FT  10 AUG 94 / Management: Hitting the open road - A restructured Pirelli
is pinning its hopes of a return to profit on a culture of transparency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
During the next year or so, Pirelli's managers will be seeing a lot more of
Marco Tronchetti Provera, the Italian tyre and cable manufacturer's managing
director.
Pirelli, a company which has invested heavily in the latest fibre-optic
technology, is installing video conference facilities throughout the group.
The network is in place for the group's research units in Germany and Italy.
The UK, Brazil and France will follow. A separate network for management
should be in place by the end of the year.
Tronchetti Provera is a manager who wants to see and be seen. In Italian and
English, he talks repeatedly about clarity, transparency, visibility and
information flow. The video conference, he says, apart from its obvious
advantages for researchers who need to see each other's models and plans,
makes management easier.
'I do a global tour twice a year to make contact with people, and every
month the main people in charge also come to Italy,' he says. 'But with the
video conference, you don't just talk face to face; it allows more flexible
management.'
Video conferences are also a symbol of how Tronchetti Provera has changed
Pirelli since Leopoldo Pirelli, the chairman, gave up executive control in
February 1992, the nadir in the company's 122-year history. That was just
after Pirelli had been forced to abandon its takeover of Continental, the
slightly bigger German tyre-maker. About half Pirelli's L673bn (Pounds 276m)
consolidated loss for 1991 was blamed on the cost of mounting the bid. The
takeover was prepared by a complex network of alliances, built on secret
guarantees that Pirelli would cover any losses on Continental shares
incurred by its allies. The strategy looks like the exact opposite of the
culture of transparency Tronchetti Provera has now instilled in Pirelli.
The managing director is too tactful to put it that way. 'I think that all
crises can help accelerate the process of change. Crisis in the market,
internal crisis, if led in the right direction, can achieve good results
rapidly.'
The Continental debacle was the spur which allowed Tronchetti Provera to cut
costs, reduce the company's break-even point, and slice debt from L4,000bn
in January 1992 to L2,000bn in June this year. Excluding the sale of
non-core businesses, Pirelli factories have been reduced from 102 to 80, and
the workforce from 50,000 to 40,000. Another stage of this restructuring
began last month, when Pirelli announced it would sell its farm tyres
business in the US.
The group's results for this year should demonstrate the benefits of this
post-crisis restructuring to concentrate on the core tyre and cables
businesses. In 1993, Pirelli's net losses narrowed to L96bn. The company
expects to return to net profit in 1994.
Tronchetti Provera has tried to encourage what he sees as strong potential
inside the group. More than 60 per cent of the company's managers have
changed position within Pirelli in the last two years, for example, and new
ideas have been promoted in the cables and tyres operations.
'It was clear to me (in early 1992) that Pirelli had the internal capacity
for product innovation in tyres, which was under-used. We had a strong brand
name in the world, the result of product quality, but also of the
imagination of our new products,' he says. 'So we started to provide
incentives for this capacity.' Cables, he says, followed suit.
That is where Tronchetti Provera's emphasis on communication comes in. He
has tried to encourage flows of information: 'If development (of ideas) is
left up to each country, it's difficult to collaborate and innovate. If, on
the other hand, you try to transfer information quickly between quality
people . . . that's when ideas are born and opportunities to do new things.'
Pirelli has also kept more in touch with clients. A higher proportion of
turnover in the tyres division - 65 per cent - now comes from the
replacement market rather than the own-equipment market. That means margins
are higher, but also that the demands of customers are clearer.
In cables, US subsidiaries have relayed information to the centre about the
leading edge of the multimedia revolution, encouraging Pirelli to develop
its high-technology fibre optics more aggressively.
Nevertheless, many Italian observers still seem to expect Pirelli to behave
like other Italian companies with the same heritage, cutting deals behind
the closed doors of the salotto buono (good drawing room) of Italian
corporate tradition. Tronchetti Provera's career fits the traditional
template: he married Leopoldo Pirelli's daughter (they are now separated)
and his family investment company owns 5.75 per cent of Pirelli's holding
company.
But he dismisses this old-fashioned interpretation of Pirelli's ambitions.
For example, he says stories about how Pirelli wants to exert an influence
over Stet, the state-owned telecommunications company, after it is
privatised, 'make us angry'. Rumour has it that Pirelli will link up with
Mediobanca - the influential Milan merchant bank which advised the group on
the ill-fated Continental takeover - to take control of Stet by the back
door. Tronchetti Provera describes this as 'rubbish' and points out that
Pirelli wants liberalisation of the telecoms sector, not perpetuation of a
private monopoly.
He does, however, foresee continued strong technological co-operation
between the two companies. 'It's a serious industrial project by Pirelli and
by Pirelli only - not a power-play as some have tried to depict it,' he
adds.
Clearly the moment for the geographical expansion of Pirelli has arrived. As
for acquisitions, it seems the ghost of the Continental bid may have been
finally exorcised. 'Before thinking of acquisitions, a company must be under
management control, be cost-effective, and have a capacity for innovation.
Then it can look at opportunities,' says Tronchetti Provera. Has Pirelli
reached that point? 'We're close.'

FT  10 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Window of opportunity for government policy -
Information Technology is transforming the search for vacancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The middle-aged unemployed manual worker anxiously scanned the visual
display unit as the Guildford Jobcentre employee keyed in 'warehouse work'
and 'Pounds 175 a week' as the man's optimum salary and preferred
occupation.
The job search, which scanned all such jobs available in the Guildford area,
came up with no vacancies. A second attempt was made, this time with Pounds
150 as the desired salary. Again no luck. 'Try driving', he said. This time
there were no vacancies that the man found acceptable.
'Keep looking at the vacancies on the boards in the office and we will
access vacancies on the computer next time you sign on,' advised the
Jobcentre employee.
Jobcentres, run by the Employment Service, a government agency, handle about
30 per cent of vacancies in the UK, as well as administering unemployment
benefits.
The Guildford Jobcentre employee keying into the visual display unit was
operating an experimental Information Technology project called called VOP
(Vacancies, Opportunities and Providers.)
In addition to providing screen access to vacancies, it will also provide
single screen access to training programmes and claimants' records, many on
paper at present.
The system has only been running for a couple of months and so has not yet
been formally evaluated. But staff hope that Mr Michael Portillo, the new
employment secretary, is persuaded of the cost efficiencies of the new
system and that he, in turn, can persuade his Treasury colleagues of those
benefits. The cost of rolling out the programme to the 1,200 Jobcentres in
England and Wales has not been worked out.
Better IT processes may be vital, say Jobcentre staff, if they are to manage
their operations more efficiently. This need will be even more pressing next
year when the ES, along with the benefits agency, part of the department for
social security, will be administering the new Jobseekers allowance.
This new allowance, which replaces income supplement and unemployment
benefit, will place even greater obligations upon the unemployed to seek
work and for Jobcentres to monitor that process more closely.
But most Jobcentres while physically integrating the administration of
benefits and job search, operate systems that are designed for stand-alone
operations. This is at a time when the government's reforms will demand even
closer integration of benefits and job seeking plans.
Not only are the IT systems that exist not integrated, but other processes
are outdated and time consuming. Mr Richard Foster, regional director of the
Employment Service for the south-east, grimaced as he demonstrated how staff
have to drill a hole with a pen into a claimant's 'back to work plan' in
order to attach it to the man's claims form for unemployment benefit.
'Staff up and down the country have to do this thousands of times a week and
and nobody thought of punching a hole in the form when it was printed,' said
Mr Foster, who recently spent a week running a Jobcentre with his senior
colleagues so as to better understand the needs of frontline workers. A
Jobcentre colleague said: 'I estimate that I spend 10 per cent of my time
keeping clients in touch with their pieces of paper.'
Nevertheless, Jobcentres have been working more efficiently over the past
few years, according to government criteria. Mr Foster said: 'We have
achieved big performance gains through better management and setting clear
targets. But, there is a limit. So, we started focusing on the processes.'
This involved a joint project between the office staff in the region, Price
Waterhouse Management Consultants and the ES itself, led by an ES board
director, in which they examined ways the centres could improve their
business processes.
'We are the ones who know what our business needs,' said Mrs Shirley
Whittle, the Guildford Jobcentre manager. 'We want to get people back to
work, but we have to have the tools to do that. In the past systems were
handed down to us. This time we have been involved in the process.'
The design process started last November, with a series of workshops. Users,
from a range of frontline and advisory jobs, first mapped out current
processes and then suggested ways to make them work more efficiently.
The aim was to design an IT system that would best support both claimants
and those employers offering jobs; improve advice to clients; encourage
active job seeking; and boost the marketing areas of the centres' work.
A first finding of the project was that the system for taking vacancies was
poor. Traditionally the least experienced member of staff was put to that
job and he or she was often unable to obtain the best job descriptions.
Using a Windows-based computer package, the vacancy-taker can now access a
number of prompts which make staff instant experts in different trades.
'Carpenters are not just carpenters,' said Mrs Whittle. 'There are first fix
and second fix, for example and those vacancies demand different skills.'
Such vacancies are instantly placed on the computer system, which sends the
details to all four Jobcentres participating in the project. Press another
button and there is an instant print-out for the notice boards. Before this,
jobs were written out for the boards.
Mrs Whittle said that in the past staff were often tempted to keep the best
vacancies for their Jobcentre, only passing on less desirable ones to other
offices in local travel to work areas. The new system, she said, giving
automatic distribution of vacancies would be to the benefit of both clients
and employers.
Despite a few teething problems Guildford Jobcentre staff described VOP as
'brilliant.' Staff pointed to what they called a glaring example of systems
not keeping up with new demands on the service. This involved what is called
'active signing', a new procedure in which claimants attending the Jobcentre
to 'sign on' every few weeks are now actively asked what they are doing to
find a job. Such information is recorded.
But, the Jobcentre staff signing them on in most offices have no sheafs of
vacancies on their desks. Normally they physically have to get up and walk
to the boards displaying vacancies if they want to guide claimants to jobs
on offer. Most do not have the time to do so.
VOP offers such a service at the press of a button, as well as automatically
recording what jobs people may have declined or tried to get - information
which will be even more vital with the Jobseekers allowance. Such
information is manually recorded at present, a process that is not only time
consuming but also not foolproof.
'VOP will help staff test availability by giving them instant access to a
much larger number of vacancies of the kind that the job seeker says he is
looking for,' said Mr Foster.
'The system is great' said one young employee at Guildford. 'I had one man
who wanted retail work. He could not believe it when 200 vacancies flashed
up on the screen. I get more job satisfaction because clients can actually
become involved in the process as well as seeing that you are trying to help
them.'
While the middle aged manual worker seeking warehouse or driving work did
not like the information that was being flashed in front of him, there was a
sense that he felt a participant in the process.
The system may in turn place new demands on employers. Mrs Whittle said:
'Sometimes employers ring Jobcentres with vacancies that we know nobody will
accept. These vacancies are not always actively promoted. Now all jobs taken
are instantly put on record. But, because one of our assessment criteria is
the number of vacancies that we fill, we will have to communicate more
effectively with employers about what jobs are acceptable.'

FT  10 AUG 94 / Lords challenge claims against driftnet fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claims by the European Commission that driftnet fishing is harmful to the
environment have been challenged by a House of Lords committee.
The Lords committee on the European communities said a commission report on
driftnetting - which is at the centre of the dispute between Spanish and
British fishermen - failed to provide adequate evidence to justify its
proposal to ban the practice in four years.
The commission's report also proposed allowing French vessels that have
fished for albacore tuna in the north-east Atlantic for the past six years
to continue using drift nets of up to 5km in length - twice the legal EU
maximum - during this summer. Fisheries ministers have failed to reach an
agreement on the proposals.
Describing the commission report as 'deeply flawed', the committee said it
was disturbed 'by the lack of objectivity apparent in the commission's
report and indeed by accusations of a lack of intellectual integrity in the
document'.
French and British vessels in the Bay of Biscay have been confronted by
Spanish fishermen angry at their use of driftnets. The Spaniards use poles
and lines and suspect their rivals of using driftnets longer than 2.5km.
Vessels using driftnets can land about 105 tonnes of tuna in the Bay of
Biscay compared with an average 35 tonnes landed by Spanish vessels using
lines.
The Lords backed some proposals by the commission, but said the commission's
report and the evidence received during its own inquiry 'give rise to
doubt'. An assessment of the impact on the environment was urgently needed
from the commission, it added.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Wilson's nemesis haunts trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increase in the trade deficit in May was largely due to erratic items,
the ragbag of goods which the Central Statistical Office separates from the
main trade account.
It is easy for such items to distort one month's trade figures. Lord Wilson
 -then prime minister Mr Harold Wilson - blamed his 1970 general election
defeat on bad trade figures, published just before the polls and distorted
by the import of two Boeing 747s.
There are five categories of trade which come under the heading of erratic
items: ships, North Sea installations, aircraft, precious stones and silver.
In May, dealings in precious stones were largely responsible for the blip.
From a surplus of Pounds 101m in April, trade in precious stones slumped to
a Pounds 17m deficit in May. Overall the 'erratic' surplus declined from
Pounds 258m in April to Pounds 67m in May. That Pounds 191m swing made up
the bulk of the Pounds 262m increase in the overall monthly deficit.
Of the five erratic categories, two - precious stones and aircraft - are by
far the most important. Last year the UK imported an average of Pounds
212.4m worth of precious stones a month and exported an average of Pounds
231.5m.
Mr Roger van Eeghem of CSO Valuations, the leading diamond clearing house,
said: 'The main thing to remember is all that is imported is re-exported'.
The CSO has 10 'sights' a year at which dealers can bid for stones. That
leaves two months a year without a 'sight', a fact which contributes to the
erratic nature of the figures.
According to Mr van Eeghem, the same two months are not missed out each
time, and sometimes the 'sights' straddle the end of one month and the start
of another. Diamond rings would not affect the statistics; as finished
jewellery, they would be classed as manufactured items.
Trade in silver can also be volatile. Mr John Fairlie of Johnson Matthey,
the precious-metals group, said: 'Sometimes the flow of silver exports has
been very high to the Middle East and Singapore in the form of metal bars.
At other times, but not for some years, a great amount of metal comes out of
the Middle East and Singapore as imports to be refined.'
Silver is counted as an erratic item but not gold, since most trade in gold
is a financial transaction and is dealt with under the financial rather than
the current account. Commodity trade in gold is in the current account, but
trade is not erratics.
Aircraft - Lord Wilson's nemesis - are potentially even more erratic items
than precious stones. British Airways, for example, bought 12 aircraft in
its last financial year. Given that the market rate for a Boeing 747 is
Dollars 125m (Pounds 80.6m), a cluster of aeroplane deliveries can make a
big difference to monthly trade patterns.

FT  10 AUG 94 / 70 groups propose to promote their own schools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventy groups have put forward proposals to promote their own
grant-maintained schools, the Department for Education said yesterday.
Mr Robin Squire, schools minister, said the 70 included 'parents,
religious-interest groups, those promoting specialisms such as technology,
music or dance, and those with business and industry links'.
The 70 prospective promoters, which would be required by law to provide 15
per cent of the capital building costs of any new school, are now discussing
detailed proposals with the Funding Agency for Schools, the quango that
controls funding for grant-maintained schools.
Any new school would need the approval of the education secretary, Mrs
Gillian Shephard, before work on it could begin.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Pupils' leaving rates show regional divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An educational 'north-south divide' is revealed by regional statistics
published yesterday for school staying-on rates and academic qualifications.
However, the figures, provided separately by the Department for Education
and the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys, showed that all regions
of Britain have registered improvements.
National participation in full-time education in the academic year 1992-93
ran at 70 per cent for 16-year-olds - up 3 percentage points on the previous
year - and 53 per cent for 17-year-olds, up 5 percentage points.
Staying-on rates have improved by 18 percentage points for both age groups
since 1988-89.
However, while some local education authorities, mostly in the south, have
registered improvements in staying on of more than 25 percentage points -
the greatest increases coming from Barking, Hounslow and Avon  - other
predominantly northern authorities have managed an increase of less than 10
percentage points.
Knowsley in Merseyside is the only English authority where less than half of
16-year-olds are in full-time education, while Salford, Rochdale, Sandwell,
South Tyneside, Tameside and Barnsley all have participation rates of 54 per
cent or less.
All the 10 authorities with staying-on rates of 80 per cent or better are in
outer London or the Home Counties - Kingston, Berkshire, Surrey, Hounslow,
Redbridge, Sutton, Croydon, Harrow, Hertfordshire and Barnet.
Data from the 1991 census shows that there has been an improvement in the
proportion of the British workforce which has 'higher' qualifications -
equivalent to an A-level or better - but there are again broad regional
variations.
The census showed that 17 per cent of men between the ages of 18 and 64 in
Britain had such qualifications - up from 13 per cent 10 years earlier, and
9 per cent in 1991. Meanwhile, 14 per cent of women had similar
qualifications, up from 9.5 per cent in 1981, and 6.7 per cent in 1971.
The south-east had the highest proportion of qualified men (19.1 per cent),
while the north of England had the lowest (12.2 per cent).

FT  10 AUG 94 / Aston Martin output spurred by owner Ford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aston Martin Lagonda, the luxury sports-car manufacturer, intends to raise
production to about 1,500 cars a year by the late 1990s from only 144 last
year.
Ford, the US vehicle-maker which bought a 75 per cent stake in the company
in 1987, has taken 100 per cent control with the purchase of the small
outstanding minority stake held by the Livanos shipping family.
The fortunes of Aston Martin have been transformed through the takeover.
Ford injected Pounds 50m in new equity last year.
Aston Martin output should increase fivefold next year to about 800 cars
with the launch of the DB7 sports car.
Developed at a cost of about Pounds 50m, the DB7 will go on sale next month
priced in the UK at Pounds 78,500. It will be launched in North America at
the end of next year.
Production of the DB7 is expected to total about 150 in the final months of
this year, rising to 700 next year.
Mr John Oldfield, executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, said that the
introduction of the DB7 marked the 'start of the new Aston Martin. It will
build the volume base on which Aston Martin will secure its future.'
He said the company was planning to develop a second range for launch in
1998-99. This is expected to be a four-door, four-seater sports saloon based
on the Lagonda Vignale concept car shown at last year's Geneva motor show.
The DB7 is a two-door coupe powered by a 3.2-litre, six-cylinder
supercharged engine. It has a top speed of 165 mph and produces 335
horsepower.
Mr Oldfield said that the sports saloon could be powered by a Ford V12
engine now undergoing prototype development in the US.
Aston Martin Lagonda, which had a turnover last year of Pounds 13.96m, is
forecasting a rise to a turnover of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m next
year.
The workforce is rising from about 270 to 420 by spring next year.
The company has created a new production facility for the production of the
DB7 at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, with the takeover of the facility used to build
the Jaguar XJ220 supercar. Production of the XJ220 ceased this year.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Watchdog raps opt-out schools over cash controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious failures in financial management by grant-maintained schools in
England have been identified by the National Audit Office,
thepublic-spending watchdog.
The office examined 70 schools which have opted out of local education
authority control and taken over their own budgets. It found that 10 had no
overall development plan, 23 had not prepared plans looking ahead more than
a year and 38 had not placed their plans within a financial framework.
Sir John Bourn, who heads the National Audit Office, also found that many
governing bodies had failed to appoint properly independent responsible
officers - intended by legislation to take on functions broadly similar to
non-executive directors - while the quality of external auditing was
variable.
Sir John said 16 schools had responsible officers who were 'insufficiently
independent owing to their involvement in day-to-day financial matters'.
Responsible officers at 28 of the schools were failing to fulfil at least an
element of their intended function.
Schools failed to guard against conflicts of interest, with 22 of those
surveyed not keeping an updated register of pecuniary interests. At one
secondary school, the wife of the information technology manager owned the
company employed to install a computer and software. The school was unable
to show that governors had been made aware of the potential conflict of
interest.
When contracts were put out to tender, schools were not always able to prove
that value for money had been obtained, with 21 of those examined failing to
retain details of the tenders they had obtained.
The quality of external auditors' work, which played a 'key role' in
regulating grant-maintained schools, was variable, with auditors of two
schools failing to report 'significant deficiencies' subsequently discovered
by the National Audit Office. Time spent auditing at schools varied from
four hours to 14 staff-days, while audit fees charged to secondary schools
varied from less than Pounds 1,000 to more than Pounds 6,000.
Applying information technology to school management also proved difficult,
with one school reverting to manual accounts after trying two separate
computer packages. Of the schools that did use computers, 26 did not make
full use of their software packages, while 16 needed to provide more
training for their finance staff.
From now on, the office will review opt-out schools' performance annually.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Driving-licence plan sparks fears on ID cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport yesterday proposed that driving licences should
include the holder's photograph, heightening speculation by civil liberties
groups that the government will introduce national identity cards in the
next session of parliament.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said the new driving licence was
'long overdue', and would carry security features to prevent fraud.
The department suggested that in the longer term microchips could be added
to driving licences to convert them into 'smart cards' - holding details of
endorsements, medical information and possibly national insurance details.
Liberty, the civil-liberties campaign group which opposes identity cards,
said: 'The more information a card carries, the more likely it is to be used
as an identity card.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, recently backed the principle of identity
cards as a way to combat crime and fraud, but ministers are still debating
what form they should take.
There are also concerns about the costs of introducing a national card
network. When parliament debated identity cards in June, the launch cost was
put at Pounds 450m, with subsequent annual costs of Pounds 100m. The
transport department said the costs of the new licence should be much lower.
The prime minister's efficiency unit looks likely to recommend the
introduction of 'swipe' cards to combat social-security fraud.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has backed such a scheme amid
signs that benefit fraud has reached about Pounds 150m a year. He described
the system of paying by order book as 'probably one of the most archaic and
insecure means of transmitting money known to man', adding that computer
companies would soon be invited to introduce systems into post offices.
It is less clear whether the government will push ahead with a system based
on the more sophisticated 'smart card' suggested by the transport department
as a future replacement for driving licences.
Home Office officials believe such a national card would redress the
difficulties faced by police and customs officers following the opening of
European Union borders and an upsurge in terrorism.
The Association of Chief Police Officers believes identity cards should be
voluntary. Police officers have expressed doubts in the past over whether ID
cards could help to combat crime, although the association said yesterday:
'We also have to recognise that one of the weapons of the terrorist is
anonymity and the ease with which they can merge into normal life.'
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'We have no objection in
principle to the idea of photos on driving licences but we have doubts about
the costs and benefits. We also don't believe they should be used as a
back-door way of introducing national identity cards.'
He said that cheque and credit-card fraud could be countered more
effectively by requiring banks and building societies to have photos on
credit cards. Then the private sector, and not the government, would bear
the costs.
The transport department's proposals, which are still only provisional,
would be introduced in July 1996, initially for provisional licences.
Consultation continues until the end of November.

FT  10 AUG 94 / EU ruling bans 'soya milk' from food labels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The term 'soya milk' should be dropped in the UK because its dairy
connotations are 'confusing', a European Union committee has decreed.
The ruling that anything sold as milk should be a dairy product comes in
spite of the EU's 1989 acceptance that products can be sold as cream
crackers, butter beans and lemon cheese even if they do not contain cream,
butter or cheese.
The Ministry of Agriculture announced ruefully yesterday that Britain had
been outvoted by 10 to one, with one abstention - the Republic of Ireland -
on the EU's milk management committee.
Soya milk manufacturers, whose sales amount to only Pounds 10m a year
compared with Pounds 3.3bn for the dairy milk market, will have to find a
new name for their product, said Mr Michael Jack, junior agriculture
minister.
Britain argued that 'soya milk' should be allowed under the EU's 1989 dairy
designation regulations because it was a well-known name in the UK. But
other member states, apparently led by France, the Netherlands and Germany,
thought otherwise.
Soya milk is a substitute for those who cannot tolerate dairy milk or prefer
not to drink it. The Health Food Manufacturers' Association responded to the
decision with fury, dismissing the alternative 'soya drink', widely used on
the continent, as 'nondescript'.
'It is outrageous that we should be forced to apply what seems to us to be a
misleading description to a product of great value to a minority,' said Mr
Maurice Hanssen, president. 'Here is surely a case where subsidiarity can be
applied and the manufacturers allowed to continue to name their product in
as effective a way as do coconut milk producers, which is of course a
permitted designation.'
The National Dairy Council questioned whether consumers were really confused
by soya milk. 'We think the consumer is a bit brighter than that,' it said.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Walker 'denied Pounds 7.5m transfer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, former chief executive of Brent Walker, denied to police
that he had ever stolen money from the property and leisure group, an Old
Bailey jury heard yes-terday.
He also denied authorising the transfer of Pounds 7.5m from the company, in
spite of his signature's appearance on documentation for the transaction,
the court was told.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the company's former finance director,
are accused of fraudulently boosting the profits of Brent Walker by some
Pounds 19m. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiracy to
falsify accounts.
The prosecution alleges the profits were boosted by bogus transactions
carried out within the group's film division. It claims the Brent Walker
group in effect funded its own profits, and that the bogus transactions were
disguised through a circular money trail.
The jury was read the transcripts of interviews Mr Walker had with police
attached to the Serious Fraud Office in April 1992 before his arrest in
January 1993.
Mr Walker was questioned about the transfer of Pounds 7.5m from Brent Walker
to the Arab Bank Corporation in New York in May 1989. The prosecution
alleges this payment was part of the circular money trail used to boost the
profits.
Mr Walker agreed that a document concerning the transfer bore what appeared
to be his signature, but denied having authorised the payment.
Although he did not accuse anyone of forgery, Mr Walker told police he would
never have sent such a letter, which was written on paper that had not come
from his office.
Police officers put it to him that the Pounds 7.5m had been stolen from
Brent Walker.
Mr Walker replied: 'I have never had a penny out of Brent Walker. I never
touched this money ever. That is a fact.'
If money had been stolen from the company, he added, then nobody would help
the police more than himself.
Mr Walker said it was often his practice to sign papers without reading
them. He trusted fellow directors to have done their job properly. Had he
questioned everything they did, he would never have had the time to to build
up the company, he said.
The trial continues today.

Flights from Manchester and Birmingham could be grounded next month if more

Most voters would prefer Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, as prime
minister, an ICM poll in The Guardian suggests today. The poll of 1,400
adults in 103 constituencies last week says 43 per cent believe Mr Blair
would do the best job; 17 per cent back Mr John Major and 16 per cent go for
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats.
A System Three poll for The Herald in Glasgow suggests that support for the
Scottish National party has fallen. The poll of more than 1,000 people at
the end of July suggests the nationalists dropped from 30 per cent to 27 per
cent over the previous month while Labour rose from 46 per cent to 51 per
cent. The Tories are unchanged at 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats down
from 11 per cent to 9 per cent.

Train services which have run between London King's Cross and Peterborough
during the recent rail strikes will not run during the signal workers'
planned action at the end of this week and early next, it was announced
yesterday.
Otherwise, services will be similar to those during previous strikes with
more trains in some areas, train operating companies announced.
Hourly trains are expected between London Euston and Birmingham and between
London Paddington and Bristol, Devon and south Wales. Some trains are
expected to run between London Euston and Glasgow.
Acas, the conciliation service, said last night that it was continuing
separate talks with both sides in the nine-week rail signalling dispute but
it was not yet in a position to decide whether joint negotiations could
restart.
Further talks will be held today through Acas, but there is still no sign of
any breakthrough in the industrial conflict between the RMT transport union
and Railtrack, the state-owned company running the network.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is to shed 700 jobs over the next
three years at its centre in Swansea, south Wales, Roland Adburgham writes.
The DVLA is an executive agency of the Department of Transport and employs
4,300 people including 2,700 at Swansea. It has been told to make a 20 per
cent efficiency improvement over two years from April. To meet the target
Pounds 12m is being invested in projects to change the way information is
captured, accessed and managed.
Mr Donald Anderson, Labour MP for Swansea East, described the announcement
as 'a devastating blow to the very heart of our economy in Swansea. Here we
see the economics of an inhuman government that invests Pounds 12m to
destroy 700 jobs.'
Swansea has more than 10,500 unemployed people in its travel-to-work area, a
rate of 9.2 per cent.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Glasgow sets out trams proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glasgow yesterday unveiled detailed routes for a light railway system that
will cross the city. Strathclyde Regional Council hopes the first phase of
the new network will be operating by 2002 at a cost of Pounds 150m.
The 20km tram system will run along a mixture of dedicated track and city
streets from Maryhill, north-west of the city centre, through the centre to
Easterhouse on the eastern fringe.
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive says the tram system will provide
links to areas poorly served by public transport and dissuade people from
driving into the city centre. The trams will be long, single-deck vehicles
similar to those in continental cities and will carry at least 150 people.
Glasgow hopes to join Manchester and Sheffield, which have systems, and
Croydon and Birmingham, which have plans for reintroducing trams.
The reintroduction of trams is held up by the difficulty of securing
public-sector finance. Mr Gordon, who admitted that financing the project
could be 'problematical', said he hoped the council would allocate part of
its capital spending programme to the project, obtain European Union
financing and get a government grant under Section 56 of the 1968 Transport
Act.
Mr Stephen Lockley, chief executive of Strathclyde PTE, said the executive
could award a contract to a private-sector group to design, build, operate
and maintain the network. But he acknowledged that the 'vast bulk' of the
financing would still come from the public sector.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Modest recovery seen in land deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'modest recovery' in conveyancing and secured credit activity in England
and Wales in the year to the end of March was highlighted in the annual
report of the Land Registry published yesterday.
Mr John Manthorpe, chief land registrar and chief executive, said it offered
the prospect of some stability in the property and secured lending markets.
By meeting all the financial targets set in the Registry's first year as a
trading fund it had been possible to recommend reductions in the statutory
scale fees to come into effect later this year.
Mr Manthorpe said computerisation of the land register could lead to the
further simplification of conveyancing.
Income was Pounds 232m, against Pounds 205m the previous year, and a
dividend of Pounds 3.3m was payable to the Treasury.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Telephone sales of life insurance set for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new regime to regulate the sale of life insurance and pension policies
over the telephone came a step closer yesterday, as financial watchdogs
began sifting through responses to a consultation exercise launched last
month.
While some aspects of the discussion paper will attract wide support, there
is likely to be concern among some life companies at the proposed ban on
offering for sale over the telephone anything less than the range provided
by agents.
A number of large life insurance companies are looking at telephone selling
of financial services, which they see as a low-cost distribution channel.
The consultation was ordered by Lautro, the life industry regulator, but the
analysis of responses will be passed to the Personal Investment Authority,
the new watchdog to protect the private investor.
The PIA board will address telephone marketing later this year, as part of a
broader study of how to regulate retail financial services as technological
advances are made.
Lautro's consultation paper admits that selling over the telephone is not
conducive to providing advice across a large product range, especially where
some policies are complicated and can involve several different options.
But it says there is no question of life companies being allowed to offer
fewer products in telesales than they do through sales agents who operate on
the basis of face-to-face interviews with clients.
This could add significantly to the length of telephone calls with clients,
and could mean that a sales agent might have to conclude a long call by
suggesting a face-to-face meeting to talk about a more complex product which
could not easily be explained on the phone.
GA Life is among the companies already selling simple, single-premium
investment products, but not its full range of policies, by phone. The
company said yesterday that the way this issue was handled would determine
how successful telephone marketing proved to be.
Life companies are more likely to support other proposals in the paper,
including the suggestions that all telephone operators should be trained as
sales agents, and that all telephone conversations between sales staff and
customers should be recorded.
A tape recording of the conversation would mean that it should be clear if
the sale had been conducted properly.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Long hot summer hinders crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long hot summer has produced an earlier harvest than usual in many parts
of the country, but the lack of rain is pushing yields down in some areas,
the National Farmers' Union said yesterday, Alison Maitland writes. The
sunshine has ripened the cereal crop up to two weeks early, said Mr John
Malcolm, the union's chief economist, but the shortage of rain, especially
in the south and south-west of England, means that the ears of corn have not
swelled out fully. Combined with poorer soil quality, this has left areas
such as the Cotswolds and Chilterns reporting yields as low as 4 tonnes a
hectare compared with a national average of 5.5 tonnes in a normal year. But
fortunate farmers in parts of East Anglia, England's bread basket, are
reporting yields as high as 10 tonnes a hectare. Mr Malcolm said this was
thanks either to well-timed cloudbursts during the past month or to farmers'
decisions to irrigate.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Complaints to City regulator at record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of complaints against members of the Securities and Futures
Authority, the self-regulating body for the securities industry, fell in
1993-94 to its lowest annual level.
The authority's complaints commissioner, who is independent of the watchdog,
said 393 complaints were received last year, down from 421 in 1992-93 and
678 in 1991.
The most frequent type of complaint involved the administration of a member,
with 36 per cent of complaints falling into this category. Complaints about
dealing accounted for 18 per cent while poor investment advice accounted for
another 15 per cent.
The number of cases referred to independent arbitration fell to 20 from 34
in the 1993-94 year. Members of the body successfully defended themselves in
10 of these cases, with only five decided in favour of the complainant.
Meanwhile, the watchdog announced disciplinary actions against six
individual members, including terminating the registration of Mr James
Cesareo who was found to have borrowed a friend's British Rail season ticket
and to have forged and used a copy of it.
Mr Simon Ian Farquharson, an equities dealer at Credit Lyonnais Securities
who was dismissed last year, was reprimanded by the watchdog and fined
Pounds 15,000 for accepting two cash payments from a client totalling Pounds
30,000.
Mr Jolyon William Money had his registration terminated and was fined Pounds
3,000 after falsely claiming a US qualification and inaccurately portraying
his previous employment history.
Mr William Muir Grant, formerly employed on the Euroyen desk at UBS, was
reprimanded for 'seriously mismarking' positions to conceal losses and
reporting valuations to UBS Tokyo which were different from those reported
in London. He had been ordered to pay Pounds 5,000 costs.

FT  10 AUG 94 / US court dismisses Maxwell actions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation have lost a Dollars
140m legal action in the US against three European banks.
Price Waterhouse, the administrators, had sought to recover the money from
Barclays, National Westminster and Societe Generale. PW had claimed that
payments made by MCC to the banks before its insolvency could be recovered
under US preference law.
The Bankruptcy Court in the southern district of New York last Friday
dismissed the actions brought by PW.
Under both US and English law, some payments made by a company in a relevant
period before it enters formal insolvency proceedings may be set aside as
'preferences' if the effect of such payments is to prefer one creditor at
the expense of another.
However, the Bankruptcy Court upheld the argument of the banks that US law
should not be applied to the payments in question.
Under English law, a preference has to be proved by establishing a desire to
prefer the creditor concerned. This is not necessary under US law.
In 1992, the English Court of Appeal ruled that the issue of whether US
preference law should apply was a matter for the US court. The
administrators are still deciding whether to appeal in the US.
MCC was placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US and in administration in
the UK in December 1991.

Acas, the conciliation service, said last night that it was continuing
separate talks with both sides in the nine-week rail signalling dispute but
it was not yet in a position to decide whether joint negotiations could
restart.
Further talks will be held today through Acas, but there is still no sign of
any breakthrough in the industrial conflict between the RMT transport union
and Railtrack, the state-owned company running the network.
The next disruption on the network is due to start at midnight tomorrow for

Five people were arrested by police in Dublin yesterday after investigations
into IRA racketeering.
Swoops were made on 12 addresses in the city by police units from the
special branch, fraud and drug squads. The detainees are being held under
Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, the republic's
anti-terrorist legislation. They can be held for up to 48 hours without
being charged.
The last such operation was four months ago and resulted in 22 arrests on
both sides of the Irish Sea but the 11 arrested in the republic were
released without charge.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Probe of 'gifts' to Espy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Janet Reno, the US attorney-general, last night sought, as expected, the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate charges that Mr Mike
Espy, secretary of agriculture, had accepted gifts from agri-business
interests, Jurek Martin reports from Washington.
She did so under the terms of the independent counsel act by which, last
Friday, Mr Kenneth Starr replaced Mr Robert Fiske as head of the Whitewater
investigations into business ventures of President Bill Clinton and his
wife.
It is now up to a special judicial panel to pick someone to head the Espy
probe.
Ms Reno said the justice department had unearthed no evidence that Mr Espy
'accepted the gifts as a reward for, or in expectation of, his performance
of official acts.' But she added that lack of that evidence was not enough
for her to advise against naming a special counsel.
The department has ascertained that the secretary had twice accepted free
air travel, entertainment and sports tickets from Tyson Foods, an
Arkansas-based poultry producer with close former ties to Mr Clinton.
Inquiries into other possible favours had not been concluded.
Accepting any gift is a technical violation of the meat inspection act of
1907. Ms Reno noted that 'non-trivial gifts' such as those apparently
provided by Tyson were within its purview.
Investigation of the ethics of a cabinet member does not help an
administration already under the Whitewater gun. However, the White House
has re-stated its confidence in Mr Espy and he has denied all wrongdoing.

FT  10 AUG 94 / PRI agrees to share air time: The efforts by the Mexican
opposition to gain equal media exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mexico's governing party persuaded the main opposition to sign an
electoral pact earlier this year, it promised to promote a balanced coverage
by the media of the presidential campaign. With less than two weeks to go
before the election, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI)
contends the pledge has been kept.
For the first time in a Mexican presidential campaign, opposition figures
appear regularly on the TV news, are interviewed almost daily on radio, and
have their meetings reported at length by almost all national newspapers.
While acknowledging the media opening, critics contend the changes have not
gone far enough, and have been made too late. Television, radio and
newspapers, many complain, still dedicate considerably more time or space to
the PRI's Mr Ernesto Zedillo than to his rivals, and treat him in a
generally more favourable way.
'Quantitatively and qualitatively the changes have been enormous,' says Mr
Raymundo Riva Palacio, a columnist with Reforma newspaper and a frequent
critic of the government, 'but there is still far from being a desirable
level of objectivity.'
With the election race more competitive than any other in Mexican history,
the debate over the role of the media has become a central issue.
The governing party has been caught between wanting to push for balanced
coverage as a way of winning credibility for the result and needing as much
exposure as possible to bolster the uninspiring candidacy of Mr Zedillo.
Most criticisms have been levelled at television, the principle source of
news for Mexicans. The controlling shareholders of Mexico's two private
television networks, Mr Emilio Azcarraga of Televisa and Mr Ricardo Salinas
of Azteca, are declared supporters of the PRI. Their networks have devoted
more than twice as much news time to the governing party candidate as they
have to any opposition figure, according to independent monitoring.
Responding to criticisms, Televisa, by far the largest of the two private
networks, has recently made concessions. After a highly public meeting with
the minister of the interior, Mr Azcarraga agreed to give all political
parties three hours of free 15-minute slots.
Since the federal electoral institute began to monitor its news programmes,
Televisa's coverage of the candidates in the main news programmes has become
more balanced.
Critics point out that the 15-minute slots are generally not at prime time
and have low ratings. Moreover, the greater news time opposition candidates
have recently received does not, say many observers, balance the more subtle
ways the networks have of influencing opinion in favour of Mr Zedillo.
'With Zedillo they are always showing him kissing babies, smiling, with
happy people, in any kind of situation that shows him in a good light,' says
Mr Miguel Acosta, who studies Televisa's campaign coverage. The other
candidates are often shown criticising each other or their speeches are
paraphrased, reducing their impact.
Although the government maintains that it cannot force private television
networks to be more objective in their coverage, state-granted television
concessions awarded to Mr Azcarraga are partly why he is reported to be
Mexico's second richest man, worth Dollars 5.1bn.
Newspapers have much less political impact than television and are generally
more diverse in their views. And in this election even the most
pro-government newspapers regularly put stories about opposition candidates
on their front page, a break from past tradition.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Clinton perseveres with 'fast track'
request
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton and 17 top US business leaders yesterday agreed it
was vital to win a new 'fast track' trade negotitating authority, so as to
allow the administration to negotiate free trade agreements which cannot be
amended by Congress.
The request for 'fast track' authority, which the White House has attached
to the Uruguay Round implementing legislation heading for a House-Senate
conference committee, is widely regarded as a test of Mr Clinton's
credibility on trade.
The president could use the authority to negotiate free trade arrangements
with Chile, perhaps Argentina and others.
Administration officials do not want him showing up at the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation meeting in Jakarta without the capacity to conclude
trade and investment treaties.
Mr Clinton was due to meet the heads of companies including Texas
Instruments, Caterpillar, Boeing, Monsanto, Eastman Kodak, Chemical Bank and
Salomon Brothers. Congressional staffers now say the fast-track request was
a risky one and perhaps a sign of over-confidence by the US Trade
Representative's office. Having produced a number of successes - including
passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and completion of the
Uruguay Round - it requested a seven-year fast-track authority.
Authority is usually granted from two to four years, and in this case, the
administration wanted a longer period without even having agreed a strategy
for the post-Nafta era.
The fast-track request is in trouble because the administration wants to
include labour and environmental provisions in future trade agreements. The
business leaders and many Republicans oppose that but several Democrats will
vote against the Uruguay Round, if a fast-track request does not declare the
administration's intention to negotiate on labour and environment.
If the president concedes to the Republicans, he is likely to lose 20-30
Democratic votes in the House. It should still pass the House but, without
liberal Democratic support in the Senate, the entire implementing
legislation could face a Democratic filibuster.
A House-Senate conference to write a final Uruguay Round package is being
delayed while the House Ways and Means Committee works on a compromise over
funding the Uruguay Round pact. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen met late
Monday with Bill Archer, the ranking minority member of the House Ways &amp;
Means Committee, to discuss Republican concerns over an inventory taxation
proposal.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Health reform reaches US Senate for debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debate at last got under way yesterday afternoon in the US Senate on a bill
that would accomplish some of the goals set 10 months when President Bill
Clinton presented his massive plan to overhaul the US healthcare system.
Discussion started after a delay caused by last-minute parliamentary
wrangling. The debate, based on a compromise bill drafted by Senator George
Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, could eat into the Senate's
planned August recess and last several weeks. Some senators are threatening
a filibuster, seeking to block the passage of a bill by extending debate.
Senator Mitchell told the Senate that the debate should not be 'political'
but, instead, 'about the best way to deal with the real-life problems of
real-life Americans when they fall ill'. Early votes on amendments to the
bill are expected to provide an indication of the tide for or against
healthcare reform. One vote, on a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse
Helms, the extreme right-wing Republican from North Carolina, would propose
putting off debate altogether until next year.
That vote, expected this morning, will offer a measure of how senators
assess the political damage they could suffer in elections in November, when
a third of the Senate will face the voters, if they have simply done nothing
about healthcare.
Before debate began, Senator Mitchell warned the Republican opposition that
it would be 'a huge political risk for them to be seen as sheer
obstructionists.'
He acknowledged that several Democratic senators remained 'undecided' about
his bill, but said he was ready to make changes so as to win over not only
the Democratic waverers but also some opposition senators.
Much of the hostility to the Mitchell bill has focused on measures that
could, in the year 2002, compel employers to pay for half of their workers'
health insurance - a delayed and diluted version of the 'employer mandate'
proposed in Mr Clinton's original plan and retained in the bill to be
debated next week by the House of Representatives.
Mr Mitchell sought yesterday to minimise the significance of this component,
which would only come into effect if the voluntary incentives which form the
bulk of his plan were to fail on their own to bring 95 per cent of the
population under some form of health coverage.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government last night announced a financial assistance
package of more than Dollars 740m (Pounds 477.4m) designed to stabilise two
big commercial banks, Banco de Venezuela and Banco Progreso.
The package is part of a government plan to assist several commercial banks
that have suffered serious problems as part of Venezuela's bank crisis,
which began last January with the failure of Banco Latino, then the
country's second largest financial institution.
Most of the financing will go to Banco de Venezuela, now the second largest
bank, while the remainder will go to Banco Progreso. Ms Norys Aguirre,
president of the government's Deposit Guaranty Fund (Fogade), said the
intention was to put these and other troubled banks back on sound financial
footing and to keep them operating. The government, which took control of
Banco de Venezuela on Monday, plans to sell the institution 'as soon as
possible', she added.
In total the government is taking steps to salvage an estimated eight
troubled banks, including another large bank, Banco Consolidado. The banks
have been hurt in recent weeks by runs on their deposits, high levels of
non-performing loans and other problems.
The government took control on Monday of Banco de Venezuela which has
deposits equivalent to Dollars 886m and a loan portfolio equivalent to
Dollars 556m.
Banco de Venezuela, founded 104 years ago, was one of the country's most
solid banks. It remained open after the government takeover and depositors
generally remained calm.
It emerged this week that, under the outline stabilisation plan, banks that
consistently fail to meet clearing house and reserve requirements will
effectively be taken over by government appointees.
The owners or major stockholders of affected institutions will be asked to
increase capital, and to pledge their personal assets to help cover
financial assistance obtained from the government and potential losses. In
some cases, the owners of affected banks will be directed to carry out
mergers, sell assets, reduce expenses, and take other steps to cut financial
losses.
As in the Banco de Venezuela case, officials want banks under government
control to stay open in an attempt to avoid the panic that occurred when a
group of financial institutions closed their doors earlier this year, in the
first wave of the banking crisis.
Banco Latino collapsed because of mismanagement and bad credit decisions.
Its closure shocked the financial system, with runs on deposits.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Deal near in Senate on phones reform
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate commerce committee is expected to agree tomorrow on a
far-reaching bill to overhaul the rules governing the telecommunications
industry, after resolving a deadlock with competing telephone companies.
While the House of Representatives has already passed its telecommunications
reform bill, the Senate has been tied up in a battle between the Bell local
telephone companies, heirs of the old AT&amp;T monopoly, and the long-distance
telephone companies, including the new AT&amp;T.
At the heart of the battle has been an argument over when and how to let the
Bells into the long-distance market without letting them use their
monopolies in the local telephone market to gain an unfair advantage. The
Bells are barred from offering long-distance service under the 1984 court
order that broke up AT&amp;T.
One proposal sponsored by Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the commerce
committee, would have required the Bells to demonstrate that they faced real
competition in their local markets before allowing them into long distance.
A competing measure backed by Senator John Breaux, of Louisiana, would
simply have imposed a one-year delay on the Bells.
The compromise is understood to keep most of Senator Hollings's approach. It
would, however, allow them to keep the lucrative market for calls that are
too long to be local, but are still within a Bell company's area, until they
are able to move into long distance. These 'short haul' calls carry high
margins, and a customer who wants them to be carried by another company must
usually dial a long access code, rather than simply the telephone number.
However, passage of the bill is by no means assured because of the
difficulty of finding time for debate.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US trade sleuth in search of fairness -
Washington's new chief investigator of commerce complains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the tennis courts, where Peter Watson relaxes when he is not cycling or
running, the chairman of the International Trade Commission is known as 'a
fair sport'.
At his other hangout, the ITC, his reputation is much the same. He is a New
Zealand-born Republican, a free trader, a former senior official on
President George Bush's National Security Council, and a commission
moderate. He is also known as 'a consummate politician' who is well liked by
Democrats and Republicans, both being receptive when he campaigned hard for
his current position.
The six ITC commissioners are part judges and part sleuths. While the US
commerce department determines the payment of subsidies or the existence of
dumping - selling in the US at 'less than fair market value' - it is the ITC
that must investigate and determine whether the dumped and subsidised goods
are hurting US companies. Without a finding of injury, an unfair trade
complaint goes nowhere.
Although most of the executive branch is in Democratic hands for now, Mr
Watson was appointed to the chairmanship in June because the office rotates
between the two parties every two years and it is the Republicans' turn. The
commission is designated 'nonpartisan' - no more than three members can be
from one party.
Mr Watson tends to be a hands-on sleuth. He can, if he chooses, lead an
investigation himself, as he did when he and two other commissioners went to
Canada to see for themselves the state of the wheat market. The three found
that Canadian wheat exports had inflicted minimal injury on US wheat
farmers, but injury nevertheless. Partly as a result of the finding,
President Bill Clinton imposed only minimally intrusive quotas for one year.
In an earlier study on large civil aircraft, requested by the Senate finance
committee, Mr Watson and ITC vice-chairman Janet Nuzum journeyed to France
to study Airbus subsidies. After meeting with officials and touring
manufacturing facilities, the two concluded that government assistance gave
Airbus a significant competitive advantage.
As a conservative 'jurist' who believes strongly in the separation of powers
in the US Constitution, Mr Watson does not see the job of commissioner as
writing - or re-interpreting - law.
'What the law says is the law,' he said in a recent interview. 'You
interpret it strictly and literally.'
Congress is now writing 'implementing legislation' which is supposed to
bring the trade laws in harmony with the agreements reached in the Uruguay
Round of liberalisation talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
But lobbyists and administration officials have been persuading
congressional allies to slip in protectionist language with which
conservative jurists will have to abide, whether or not the provisions are
consistent with the multilateral rules.
ITC commissioners deal with a detailed area of law which gives them little
latitude for interpretation. 'There are nuances, some grey areas, but by and
large we have a very regulated area of law which leaves us only a limited
degree of discretion,' he said.
This does not mean that Mr Watson opposes the dumping laws. Between March
1991 and March 1994, he was the only Republican to find injury more often
existed than not in anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases. He voted
affirmative on injury in 69 cases and against in 62.
During the same period, the past chairman, Mr Don Newquist, widely perceived
to be a protectionist, voted affirmative 96 times and negative 40. Anne
Brunsdale, another past chairman, found injury 37 times and voted against
relief on 95 cases. There is no single model for determining injury so the
commissioners can use their own to determine if a business has been injured.
'People rightly come here expecting to have a fair hearing from independent
commissioners,' Mr Watson said. 'If you don't believe in fairly and
objectively applying these dumping and countervailing laws, you don't
deserve to be here.'
Other governments have followed the US example in developing their own
'unfair trade' regimes. As a result, laws designed to defend US companies
have, at least for America's growing number of exporters, begun to seem a
threat to international trade liberalisation. However, Mr Watson insists
they have legitimate uses in circumstances where foreign companies are
underpricing their products.
'But we all know these laws can be improved,' he said. 'I can identify areas
where there are abuses . . . petitioners which use the trade laws purely as
aggressive tools, rather than as a legitimate response to unfair trade
practices.' Abuse of the laws can create trade distortion because many of
the foreign companies involved cannot afford to pay lawyers to defend
themselves, he said.
Many trade lawyers have suggested doing away with the dumping and
countervailing duty laws and replacing them with enhanced competition laws,
such as anti-trust laws. This would require truly integrated economies with
few market distortions, said Mr Watson.
A number of steps would have to be taken before competition policy could
approach the areas that trade policy cover, he said. First there would have
to be a multinational dialogue and exchanges of information for anti-trust
cases. Then the laws could be harmonised and enforcement mechanisms agreed.
The process would take years. Mr Watson's term as a commissioner ends in
December 2000. It is unlikely that he will work himself out of a job before
that.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: UK airline to launch daily flights to Orly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Midland, the UK's second largest scheduled airline, is to follow
British Airways by starting daily flights into Orly airport in Paris.
British Midland said yesterday it intended to take advantage of access
rights into the French airport with the launch next month of a
four-times-a-day service. The airline said that the new service would not
lead to any reduction in the eight daily flights operated into Charles de
Gaulle, Paris.
A British Midland spokesman said that the decision had been taken in
response to demand from passengers for more frequent flights to the French
capital and, in particular, for a service providing access to southern
Paris.
British Midland passengers will be able to fly out or back into either
Charles de Gaulle or Orly on the same ticket. Fares will range from Pounds
245 return for an executive ticket to an Pounds 81 summer saver.
Sir Michael Bishop, British Midland chairman, said deregulation of European
air routes meant British Midland intended to establish a comprehensive
network of services in Europe. The company had already launched four new
European routes this year.
British Airways has been operating a similar frequency service in Orly since
June, following France's decision to bow to pressure from the European
Commission and open up the airport to UK competition.
But BA, which intends to step up the number of flights into Orly this
winter, says it intends to challenge, through the Commission and the French
courts, proposals by France to restrict flight frequencies and the size of
aircraft flying into Orly.
France has resisted the liberalisation of its domestic air routes and when
Orly airport was opened to international carriers the French government
sought to restrict the impact of liberalisation by limiting services to
aircraft with 200 seats or more at peak traffic times.
France is also appealing a Commission ruling to allow competition on its
Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseille routes, two of the most profitable domestic
routes.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: China may get time to meet Gatt
obligations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China may be granted a breathing period on entry into the General Agreement
on Trade and Tariffs, to give it extra time to meet all criteria for
membership, Mr Winston Lord, the US assistant secretary of state for East
Asia and Pacific affairs, said yesterday.
China, which was previously a member of Gatt but quit after the communists
came to power in 1949, wants to be a founder member of the World Trade
Organisation, the post-Uruguay Round Gatt, which comes into being on January
1 next year.
China's Gatt negotiators say their entry would be set back five to 10 years
if the period of grace was refused.
Mr Lord, speaking in Hong Kong, said: 'We would recognise that in the Gatt,
they (China) would have the right in certain areas to a transition period
before they're fulfilling their obligations.'
He said the issue which had to be addressed was the extent to which China
was a developing country, rather than an advanced developing country. 'The
honest answer is, I think, somewhere in between,' he said.
'But we also believe that China is already an economic powerhouse in many
ways . . . and therefore it's somewhat misleading to suggest that China is
like any other poor developing country and therefore should get all the
exemptions of these developing countries,' Mr Lord said. 'So we have to
strike a balance.'
Mr Lord also said the Clinton administration was conducting a review of its
policy on Taiwan, the first comprehensive re-appraisal since the late 1970s.
But he stressed that, while the United States needed to strike a balance, it
would adhere to its One China policy, based on the three joint communiques
with China and the Taiwan Relations Act.
Any adjustments in policy resulting from the review, which would be
concluded soon, will be in line with the existing framework, he added.

Taiwan says it has further relaxed curbs on foreign banks' operations on the

Tariffs and Trade, Laura Tyson reports from Taipei. The finance ministry
said the changes would enhance foreign banks' efficiency and service in
Taiwan, as well as further the government's oft-stated goal of developing
Taipei into a regional financial centre. A ceiling on
Taiwan-dollar-denominated deposits held by foreign bank branches, set at 15
times the branch's capitalisation, has been lifted.

<TEXT>
Singapore's economy grew at an annualised rate of 10.5 per cent in the first
half of the year, said Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in a speech marking the
island republic's national day yesterday, Kieran Cooke reports from Kuala
Lumpur. Singapore's planners had forecast economic growth of between 6 and 8
per cent in 1994 but full-year forecasts are now likely to be revised upward
to between 9 and 10 per cent. Last year Singapore's economy expanded 9.2 per
cent.
'All sectors of the economy are expanding,' said Mr Goh. Manufacturing
output had increased well above expectations, driven in part by continuing
demand for electronics products. The financial sector also turned in a
better than expected performance in the first half of the year, despite a
slowdown in foreign exchange activity and in the stockmarket. Mr Goh said
per capita income in Singapore was now higher than in Britain but, he said,
one of the main problems Singapore would face in future would be
'overindulgence in materialism, subsidies and welfare'.

<TEXT>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday announced moves toward market
deregulation, including a detailed timetable for removing barriers which
have prevented banks and foreign companies owning local brokers. The JSE,
the 11th largest in the world by market capitalisation, is to be
restructured to 'meet the needs of the new South Africa,' its president, Mr
Roy Anderson, said.
Banks and foreign companies will be able to take a 30 per cent stake in
local brokers as soon as required legislative amendments have been passed by
parliament, with full ownership to be permitted 12 months later. 'The 12
months is designed to enable stockbrokers to prepare for the entry of new
competitors to the market and for the JSE to amend its rules and systems to
meet the needs of the new environment,' Mr Anderson added.
Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive officer of South Africa's financial
markets watchdog, the Financial Services Board, said yesterday draft
legislation was 'ready to go' and could be ready for discussion in
parliament in 'two to three months'. The JSE has been under heavy pressure
to permit banks to own brokerages, with the Congress of South African Banks
threatening recently to establish a second exchange if deregulation of the
JSE is not implemented within 12 to 18 months.
The JSE said yesterday it remained opposed to any move to switch from the
current system of single trading capacity, where brokers act on behalf of
buyers and sellers, to dual capacity where brokers act not only as agents
but principals. It would 'reluctantly' adopt dual trading capacity only if a
second, dual-capacity exchange were opened in competition, or if foreign
exchange controls were lifted, a move which would improve liquidity in the
market and reduce the risk of price manipulation.

Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) and its workers' union yesterday decided to
seal a pit at Moura, central Queensland, entombing 11 coalminers killed in a
big underground explosion on Sunday night.
The decision was taken after a second big explosion yesterday, followed by
several smaller blasts causing fires inside the mine. It was hoped that
sealing the mine would put out the fires. The open-cut section, producing
most of the coal, will keep operating.
A mixture of methane gas and coal dust caused Sunday's explosion, trapping
the workers in a tunnel 265m underground, and 3km from the mine entrance.
The explosion is the third in 20 years to hit the BHP Australia Coal
operations in Moura. In 1986, 12 men died in the Number Four mine, and in
1975 13 died in the nearby Kianga mine.
The Moura mine is 80 per cent owned by BHP Australia Coal and 20 per cent by
a Japanese company. It has an annual production capacity of 2.1m tonnes of
coking coal and 2m tonnes of thermal coal.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Israeli trade rights for Jordan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE at The Dead Sea
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel is preparing to make a unilateral trade concession worth millions of
dollars to Jordan to keep up the momentum of the peace process between the
two neighbours, the Israelis said yesterday.
The move came as Israel and Jordan resumed bilateral talks about borders,
water, trade, finance and banking, saying they had agreed to use the 1922
British Mandate lines as a basis for demarcating the frontier, an apparent
concession to Jordan.
The resumption of talks on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea, aimed at
finalising a formal peace treaty, came a day after the two states opened a
new border crossing 3kms north of the Red Sea. Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, chief
Israeli negotiator, said the two would open a second border crossing in the
north once its exact location was agreed.
An Israeli negotiator said Israel would allow Jordanian imports preferential
access to the market in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in recognition of
Jordan's peace gestures. A list of Jordanian products allowed access to the
West Bank would be drawn up soon.
Such an agreement would give Jordanian goods access to the much larger
Israeli market as there are no formal trade barriers between the West Bank
and Israel proper. The pact will last until Israel transfers the West Bank
to Palestinian self-rule after Palestinian elections due in mid-December.
Trade experts say the impact of Jordanian imports on Israel's Dollars 70bn
(Pounds 46.6bn) economy, insignificant initially, will have profound effects
on Jordan which last year had a trade deficit of Dollars 2.4bn.
Border demarcation and water remain tougher obstacles. Jordan is seeking 380
sq kms of the Arava Desert it claims Israel has occupied. It wants its
'rightful allocation' (a geographical term under international law) of the
waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers it claims Israel has diverted since
1967.
In joint working groups yesterday, both sides made progress on accords for
an air corridor for Jordanian flights over Israel, connection of the two
countries' electricity grids, crossing points, and prevention of drug
trafficking.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Cash-stuffed envelopes and Korean business: The changing
relationship between government and chaebol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRESH allegations that two big conglomerates paid bribes to win construction
orders for state-run nuclear power plants in the early 1990s is only the
latest reminder of the widespread corruption that has affected relations
between government and business in South Korea.
The tight state control over Korea's industrialisation programme since the
1960s gave bureaucrats and politicians unlimited opportunities to demand
bribes and kickbacks from companies.
The claim that two of the country's largest groups paid Won400m (Pounds
323,000) to a former president of Korea Electric Power, the state-owned
electricity monopoly, is seen as a typical example of the corruption that
afflicted government.
The passing of cash-stuffed 'white envelopes' to officials became an
accepted fact of life for companies dependent on government approval for
almost all aspects of their business operations.
If any company failed to adhere to the system of institutional bribery, it
faced the threat of official retribution and the loss of business. Kukje,
one of the country's biggest industrial groups, was dismantled on government
orders in 1985 after its chairman apparently refused to make political
donations to the ruling party.
The inauguration last year of President Kim Young-sam, the country's first
civilian leader after three decades of military-backed rule, promised an end
to the corruption.
Mr Kim quickly introduced measures to fight graft. Politicians and senior
bureaucrats were forced to disclose their personal assets. The use of
anonymous bank accounts was banned to deprive them of the ability to hide
bribes. Government auditors conducted extensive investigations of state
agencies for evidence of past corruption, notably defence procurement
contracts since the late 1980s.
Korean industrial groups, or chaebol, initially welcomed the anti-corruption
campaign, which they saw as a first step toward economic deregulation by
weakening bureaucratic control over their activity. The chaebol also viewed
the move as financially beneficial since an estimated 6 per cent of their
net profits on average was spent bribing officials.
But executives have since come to believe the anti-corruption campaign may
prove to be a double-edged sword that could be used to intimidate the
chaebol. There are suspicions in boardrooms that the government has
selectively used the corruption investigations to punish companies,
including Hyundai and Pohang Iron and Steel, whose leaders opposed Mr Kim's
presidential campaign in 1992.
Mr Kim's government has displayed an ambiguous attitude toward the chaebol.
On the one hand, the president recognises their importance as the main
engines of the Korean economy and their role as pioneers in penetrating
global markets.
But Mr Kim also shares the distrust of most Koreans about their economic
dominance in the domestic market and the influential position they gained by
co-operating closely with the former military government.
The dilemma confronting the government is that economic deregulation is
likely to provide opportunities for the chaebol to expand their economic
strength at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses.
The government has adopted a policy of gradually reforming and dismantling
the chaebol by weakening cross-holding arrangements among subsidiaries in
each industrial group. It also plans to dilute the shareholdings of their
family owners through inheritance taxes.
But it will take at least one or two decades to achieve these results. In
the meantime, the government must find ways to prevent the chaebol from
growing more powerful once state controls on industry are lifted.
This has not proved easy, and the problem has contributed to delays in
proposed economic reforms, including widening the ownership of banks and
privatising state companies. The government fears the reforms could allow
the chaebol to expand into these sectors unless adequate safeguards are
introduced.
The threat of launching corruption investigations into the past activities
of the chaebol could prove to be at least a short-term solution to keeping
the industrial giants in line while further barriers to their expansion are
erected.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Indian investigators parade Bombay terror blast suspect on
TV
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian investigators examining last year's Bombay terrorist bomb attacks
last night paraded one of their prime suspects on national television.
The move gave India an opportunity to highlight its claims that Pakistan
helped to organise the blasts in which over 250 people were killed and 1,200
injured.
It seems certain further to damage relations between the two countries,
which see each other as their worst enemies.
Mr Yakub Memon talked at length on last night's programme about his alleged
role in the blasts and the support he allegedly received from Pakistan's
secret service, Inter Services Intelligence.
Born and having grown up in Bombay, Mr Memon, 33, fled the city after the
explosions together with his brother, Mr Tiger Memon, and their families,
and secretly sought refuge in Pakistan.
He was arrested a few days ago in mysterious circumstances. The Indian
police say he was captured at Delhi railway station last Friday.
But Mr Memon has said he was detained on July 24 in Kathmandu and taken
across the border into India.
Since his arrest, Mr Memon has allegedly provided his interrogators with 'a
rich harvest', according to officials of the Central Bureau of
Investigation.
As well as giving details of the bombings, he has named a Karachi gangland
boss as an ISI agent and the main organiser of the bombing conspiracy.
Indian investigators have also claimed, through stories leaked to
newspapers, that Mr Memon carried with him incriminating evidence, including
a fake Pakistani
passport and forged Pakistani school and university certificates, all of
which were in the name of an alias.
The investigators believe the documents were meant to give him a new
identity after the bombings.
Moreover, Mr Memon allegedly carried a video of a wedding attended by the
ISI agent and a prominent Bombay underworld chief, who is also wanted by the
Indian authorities in connection with the bombings.
There was some incredulity in Delhi yesterday that a fugitive terrorist
suspect would be travelling with so many incriminating items in his
possession.
Some observers believed the authorities may be exaggerating the quality of
Mr Memon's evidence to create the impression that India's worst terrorist
attack has finally been solved.
Indian officials have from the beginning accused Pakistan of complicity in
the blasts but have lacked hard evidence.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese key private-sector machinery orders rose in June for the second
month in a row, fuelling hopes that the long decline in companies' capital
spending may be ending, Gerard Baker reports from Tokyo.
Figures released yesterday by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) showed a
12.5 per cent increase to Y950.6bn (Pounds 6.2bn) from May in receipts of
machinery orders, excluding the volatile ships and power-equipment sector.
The total figure, including ships, power and public-sector orders, rose 9.4
per cent in the month to Y1,907bn.
The longer term trend suggests capital formation is still faltering. In the
second quarter of the year, the key private-sector orders figure fell 4.2
per cent.
The EPA forecast that the core private-sector machinery orders total will
increase 1.1 per cent in the current quarter against the same period a year
ago. That would mark the first year-on-year quarterly gain for more than
three years.
An EPA official said uncertainties remained, especially in the steel sector:
'We have to wait a while to conclude that it is really the beginning of the
recovery.'

FT  10 AUG 94 / US cautious over progress in talks with N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officials expressed caution yesterday that the latest talks between
Washington and Pyongyang would find an acceptable solution to North Korea's
suspect nuclear programme. The open-ended negotiations resumed last Friday
after a month's suspension following the death of North Korea's President
Kim Il-sung.
Mr Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, said on Monday
his government was prepared to freeze its nuclear activities in return for
being given light water nuclear reactors. These are more proliferation
resistant than North Korea's graphite moderated reactors which produce
plutonium that can be used to build atomic bombs.
However, a senior US official involved in the talks said yesterday that,
while the West had an interest in helping North Korea switch to a less
proliferation-prone nuclear technology, any help was conditional on
Pyongyang's full compliance with international nuclear inspections under the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would include checks on two storage
sites which the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects may hold enough
undeclared weapons-grade plutonium to make a bomb.
The official said North Korea continued to oppose inspection of these sites,
at the Yongbyon nuclear complex north of Pyongyang, claiming it has
'suspended the effectuation' of its NPT membership. 'The North Koreans have
an obligation to fulfil their safeguards agreement' with the IAEA, the
official said. 'The world shouldn't have to pay for that.'
North Korea, which first indicated interest in LWRs during talks with the US
in July 1993, says it needs 1,000MW of nuclear generating capacity, about
half its power needs, at an estimated cost of Dollars 2bn. LWR technology is
widely available in the west and in Russia, and the US has already sounded
out Japan and South Korea for help with funding the programme.
To obtain the LWRs, North Korea would have to agree not to reprocess the
fuel rods already withdrawn from its small experimental nuclear reactor,
which the US fears could provide enough plutonium for four atomic weapons.
It would also have to agree not to reload the reactor with fuel and to halt
construction of two bigger graphite moderated reactors with capacities of
50MW and 200MW.
Mr Kang indicated on Monday that Pyongyang would seek compensation for the
power supplies lost as a result.
He also said North Korea had put forward proposals for treating the 8,000
spent fuel rods now corroding in a holding pond at Yongbyon 'in such a way
that can make the international community feel easy about it'.
The official said he thought Pyongyang was negotiating more seriously than
before as a result of the US push in June for United Nations economic
sanctions against North Korea. But 'they are difficult people to talk to,
these are complex issues to deal with, and I can't say I see the light at
the end of the tunnel'.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Falling prices could drive Japan into the rough: Lower golf
course fees and other consumer costs may not be all good news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 130 round of golf has at last arrived in Japan. Last month, some
clubs just outside Tokyo began charging Y13,000 for so-called 'self days' -
18 holes without a caddy.
A few years ago the same courses were charging between Y30,000 and Y40,000
for an afternoon's entertainment.
What is happening on the golf courses is typical of the most striking
by-product of the country's long recession - falling prices.
Prices of many goods and services are in steep decline. Though the
government's official statistics say that consumer price inflation is still
positive, at 0.9 per cent last month, hardly anyone believes them any
longer. The official index - revised every five years - measures patterns of
spending that are no longer prevalent in Japan.
In particular, it underweights both services, such as a round of golf, and
the vast discount sector that has sprung up in the last few years. Japanese
consumers have sharply increased the proportion of their household spending
in these discount emporia - yet these sales are barely picked up in the
official figures.
Unofficial evidence suggests prices have been falling for more than a year.
A recent survey by the large Seiyu supermarket chain estimated that prices
in its shops had dropped by 6 per cent in the last year. Even the official
figures show that wholesale prices are falling.
For many economists, the decline carries with it alarming echoes of the
prolonged global deflation of the 1930s when a collapse in prices forced
companies to cut wages and lay off workers, leading in turn to a fall in
demand as unemployment rose and disposable incomes fell.
In the Japan of the 1990s price-cutting has already burnt deep into
corporate profits. As Mr Alexander Kinmont, equity analyst at Morgan
Stanley, says, 'sectors that are heavily dependent on domestic labour are
being squeezed sharply, as the prices of their goods fall while demand for
their products remains flat.'
Service sector companies are typical. Price cutting in the airline sector
has sent companies such as Japan Airlines into pretax losses for the last
three years. Even manufacturers, though they are less labour-intensive, have
reported stagnant profits directly attributable to price-cutting.
However, Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo,
believes the worst is already past. He argues that this 'demand deflation',
or weak demand forcing down prices, was what Japan experienced in the first
phase of recession in 1991-93.
The current phase, he argues, is marked by a much more beneficial
'cost-driven deflation'. The rapid appreciation of the yen in the last year
and falling input costs are now enabling companies to cut prices without
severely denting their profitability. The lower prices are then feeding
through directly to the consumer whose purchasing power has risen as a
result.
'The acceleration of growth will continue, while prices continue to fall -
precisely the combination that implies a supply-driven deflation.'
Economic theory suggests this ought to be the quickest route out of
recession. Falling prices raise real disposable income, making customers
more likely to spend. Higher spending raises corporate profits and lifts the
economy out of slump.
But the beneficial impact on companies is limited by the price elasticity of
demand for their goods - the amount by which sales rise as prices fall. New
research by economists at the Industrial Bank of Japan suggests that for
manufactured goods, each 1 per cent fall in price raises sales by just 0.17
per cent. For services the figure is 0.63 per cent. In other words, higher
spending is not offsetting losses in revenue caused by lower prices.
In any case, there is continuing doubt about the willingness of Japanese
consumers to spend. As Mr Kinmont says: 'If a customer thinks prices of
consumer durables, for example, will be 5 per cent lower in a year's time,
he will defer his spending. The danger is that consumers will go on doing
that, leading to a downward spiral.'
And there is certainly scant evidence of a recovery in consumer spending.
Despite the fall in prices, retail sales fell by 4 per cent in the year to
May. Even allowing for the higher spending at the discount stores (not
reflected in these figures either), it is likely that sales are still
falling.
But the biggest danger of all in deflation lies in the huge corporate debt
burden. Corporate indebtedness rose sharply in the boom years of the late
1980s. A prolonged period of falling prices raises the real level of that
debt, and makes it harder for companies to service it.
It is a sobering thought on the putting greens around Tokyo. Many of the
courses were built in the boom years of the late 1980s, on the back of huge
borrowings. Falling green fees may be good news for golfers, but the courses
need more revenue, not less, to meet their debt-servicing costs. They might
not survive the Dollars 50 round, if it comes.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Italian media upset Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chief of staff of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister,
yesterday accused the media of applying double standards when judging the
Italian government and its predecessors.
Mr Gianni Letta, former deputy chairman of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group,
complained to journalists that the three-month-old government was getting a
rough deal compared with the previous technocratic administration of Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
Mr Berlusconi's government has made a series of political mistakes recently,
and come under attack from the opposition and from members of the coalition
itself, most notably the populist Northern League.
The onset of the summer holidays does not seem to have reduced the pressure
on Mr Berlusconi, or on Italian markets. The Italian lira weakened yesterday
in slow trading to close at L1,001 against the D-Mark, amid worries about
the coherence of the coalition.
Mr Letta's press conference was called to clear the air following suspension
of a pro-government TV advertising campaign. Certain commercials outlining
the achievements of the Berlusconi government were pulled by state
television on Monday, after Italy's media ombudsman reacted to claims that
the government was abusing its right to screen commercials for public
information only.
The part of the campaign explaining changes in tax policy is still running,
and Mr Letta said yesterday Mr Berlusconi - whose Fininvest group owns three
Italian commercial TV stations - would not be deterred from launching such
campaigns in future.
He pointed out that the outgoing Ciampi government had issued extensive
press releases outlining its achievements. '(The Ciampi government) ..
received only praise, whereas the Berlusconi government has had only abuse,'
he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League's leader, has indicated the
League will put forward its own set of economic measures after the holiday
on August 26.
Meanwhile, Italian newspapers yesterday carried reports of the interrogation
of Mr Berlusconi's younger brother Paolo by Milan magistrates, based on a
transcript of the interview. According to this, Paolo admitted authorising
payments of L330bn to Italian anti-fraud police to avoid tax investigations
into Fininvest companies.

Poland's privately-owned PolSat TV plans to continue transmission despite a
Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) ruling suspending its licence for
nationwide broadcasting, a PolSat official said yesterday. The court made
the decision on Friday at a closed session, citing numerous legal challenges
the station faced. The National Radio and TV Council, Poland's broadcasting
authority, suggested the ruling infringed its responsibility and said it
licence to PolSat in January, rejecting bids from from several
foreign-Polish media groups. It said it preferred PolSat because it was
fully Polish-owned. However, the challengers said they had been offering
better programming and had sounder financial foundations. Among PolSat's
critics was President Lech Walesa, who reportedly tried to remove the
chairman of the broadcasting council for giving the licence to the station.

Mr Vassilis Vasilakakis, deputy agriculture minister. 'The EU banned exports
of live animals and fresh meat until August 22 when a committee will review
the decision, taken last night. There is no threat to public health, we are

Russia now has nearly 1m small businesses employing 9m people. A majority of

<TEXT>
The Belarussian government has confirmed its sudden conversion to market
reforms with a decision to lift subsidies on bread and milk. The move, which
could lead to a tenfold price increase, suggests that President Alexander
Lukashenko, once expected to adopt reactionary economic policies, was
sincere in his post-election pledge to pursue reforms. Maintaining food
subsidies has been a particularly costly choice because it has led to an
exodus of goods from Belarus into neighbouring countries. Prime Minister
Mikhail Chigir, the reformer whom Mr Lukashenko appointed shortly after his
election last month, admitted that the leap in prices would cause hardship
for Belarussians, but said that without price liberalisation other market
reforms would be impossible. Russian conservatives had expected the new
presidents of both Belarus and Ukraine to favour closer relations with
Russia and a return to a centrally planned economy.

effectively closed and if the Bosnian Serbs seem to be deprived of important
aid and war-making material, clearly there then would be a case for easing
of the sanctions,' he said. Mr Christopher's cautious statement suggests
that the US regards steps to isolate the recalcitrant Bosnian Serbs as a
potential turning point. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic last week cut
ties after the Bosnian Serbs rejected the latest western-backed peace plan.
A US Senate amendment to lift the arms embargo on Moslem-led Bosnia may be
introduced as early as today. However, the White House fears any unilateral
move would endanger allied peacekeeping efforts. Bosnian government troops,
meanwhile, are overrunning Moslem separatist positions in the Bihac region,
sending thousands of civilians and rebel soldiers fleeing across the border
into neighbouring Croatia, according to United Nations officials. Government
forces have made big advances against rebels who backed local business
tycoon Mr Fikret Abdic, a former member of the Bosnian leadership, who split
with Sarajevo almost a year ago over whether to accept an international
peace plan for Bosnia.

FT  10 AUG 94 / France bans Islamist papers

<TEXT>
France yesterday banned five Islamist publications and detained 36 people as
part of its clampdown on suspected Algerian Moslem fundamentalists. The
action is intended to prevent terrorist attacks in the wake of threatened
reprisals against France for its internment of 17 suspected Moslem
militants. The internments followed the deaths of five French citizens in
last week's attack on an embassy building in Algiers. The French interior
ministry justified yesterday's ban by claiming that distribution of the
publications 'could endanger public order because of their violently
anti-western and anti-French tone and the calls for terrorism they contain'.
Paris police said 36 more people had been detained during a third successive
night of spot checks on vehicles and pedestrians. Monday night's detentions
took to more than 100 the number of people so far held for questioning.
Domestic criticism of the clampdown was muted, although the opposition
Socialist party demanded that the government expand contacts with moderate
Moslems in Algeria. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, argues, however,
that there is no choice but to back Algeria's military-led government or see
extreme fundamentalists take power.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Current account deficit declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Final current account figures produced by Germany's federal statistics
office show a revised deficit of DM33.2bn (Pounds 13.6bn) for 1993, compared
with a provisional DM35.2bn, the Bundesbank said. The capital account
surplus was unchanged at DM20.8bn. For 1992, the current account deficit was
DM39.2bn; the capital account was DM134.8bn in surplus. Changes in the way
trade data are gathered because of the European single market have led to
long delays in reporting since early 1993. The statistics office said
recently it also expected an extensive revision in first-half 1994 figures,
due for release late on August 26.
Spain's consumer price index is expected to have risen nearly 0.4 points in
July, to put the year-on-year inflation rate at 4.7 per cent, the same as
June's, according to a Reuter survey of analysts' forecasts. Expectations
for the figures, due on Friday, range from 0.2 to 0.7 per cent for the
monthly increase and 4.5 to 5 per cent for the yearly rate.
The Dutch trade surplus narrowed to a provisional Fl 1.3bn in April from an
upwards revised Fl 2.3bn in March, the central bureau of statistics said.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Ukraine Stirs: Hope rises amid the nostalgia for Soviet past
 -Entrepreneurs beavering away in the Donbass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In many respects, Mariupol is the typical, botched result of Soviet central
planning. Statues of Lenin in heroic poses still grace its main squares, the
local telephone network is so dreadful that calling from Kiev is a day-long
task, and the grimy yellow substance that comes out of the city's water taps
is unfit to drink.
But, nearly three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
centrally planned economy of which Mariupol was an integral part, a few
elements have emerged in this dismal industrial city-scape which point the
way to a new future.
Mariupol is in the Donbass, Ukraine's depressed industrial heartland which
sent communist MPs to parliament in expression of its nostalgia for the
Soviet past, but in recent mayoral elections the city voted for a wealthy
young entrepreneur who prefers laissez-faire economics to Marxism-Leninism.
The Spartak, Mariupol's main hotel, is as grimy as they come in this part of
the world, but its rickety balconies are spiky with the satellite dishes of
western businessmen who need reliable contact with their headquarters in
London, Frankfurt, Milan and New York.
Even Azovstal, one of the biggest steel mills in the former Soviet Union and
one of Mariupol's main employers, is jousting for its share in the world
market rather than settling for the decline which appears to be the fate of
most of the Soviet-era factories in the region.
In its efforts to adapt to the market, Azovstal, like most enterprises in
Ukraine, has thus far found the central government to be more of a help than
a hindrance. Mr Oleksandr Bulianda, the plant's director, is not afraid to
let the Kiev bureaucracy know exactly what he thinks about its management of
the country.
When a deputy minister calls on the special, Soviet-era government telephone
which looks out of place next to the high-tech gadgets on Mr Bulianda's
desk, he launches into a tirade: 'This country is run more badly than a
whore-house. At least in a whore-house there is order, here we have total
chaos.
'I have metals traders from all over the world begging me to sign contracts
with them, but you idiots refuse to give me export quotas.'
Last year, Azovstal, which western metals companies rate as one of the best
steel mills in the former Soviet Union, exported 1.5m tonnes of steel to
customers outside the former Soviet Union. Mr Bulianda expects to export
1.8m tonnes this year, slightly more than half Azovstal's total production.
Mr Bulianda's main foreign partners are Germany's Klockner, Italy's Duferrco
and two companies that operate mainly in the former Soviet Union, Metals
Asia and AIOC.
But Mr Bulianda's room for manoeuvre is restricted by the central
government's administrative control over exports and prices.
'Fixed prices are a real stupidity,' Mr Bulianda complains. 'The producer
will never work at a loss. This system must have been dreamt up by some
idiot, we don't even know who.'
The restrictions have hit particularly hard at trade with Russia,
traditionally Ukraine's main economic partner: in 1991, Azovstal shipped
700,000 tonnes of steel to Russia, this year 70,000, a drop Mr Bulianda
attributes mainly to the difficulty in securing export quotas for Russia.
Notwithstanding Mr Bulianda's progressive attitude - he is described by the
western metals traders queueing at his door as 'one hundred per cent
capitalist' and had the foresight to begin purchasing up-to-date western
equipment during the dying days of the Soviet Union - Azovstal is not
finding the transition to the market entirely painless.
Azovstal is operating at only half capacity, which Mr Bulianda attributes to
the difficulty in purchasing fuel from Russia rather than to a lack of
customers. Moreover, he says, the factory could comfortably lay off 7,000 of
its 21,600 workers. But Mr Bulianda ('I guess I'm still half socialist')
refuses to sack any.
Within the next few months the factory, currently leased by its employees
from the state, is to be privatised. Between 30 and 40 per cent of the
shares will be sold through a public offering and Mr Bulianda hopes a
western investor, preferably one of the companies he already does business
with, will buy a large bloc of these shares.
Although Mr Bulianda predicts a struggle with the central government over
privatisation, he may find his path clearer now that Ukraine has elected a
new president and heads of regional government. President Leonid Kuchma has
promised swift privatisation and Mariupol's new mayor, Mr Mykhailo
Pozhyvanov, is a member of the Reform bloc in parliament, the most
progressive political faction in the country.
Once an Azovstal employee, Mr Pozhyvanov left the state mammoth to make his
own way as a metals trader, founding a company whose turn-over last year was
Dollars 150m.
Mr Pozhyvanov cheerfully admits that the election of a radical market
reformer 'is political nonsense in the communist Donbass', but he sees his
victory as a sign that even in this, one of the most conservative regions of
Ukraine, the nascent bourgeoisie is maturing into a political elite.
If Mr Kuchma manages to implement the reforms Mr Pozhyvanov supports, things
will get worse in Mariupol before they get better. But Mr Pozhyvanov is
betting that even in the industrial Donbass there are enough factories like
Azovstal, and enough new private businesses, to cushion the shock of the
painful economic remedies he is lobbying the new government to administer.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Athens tax gamble pays dividends: Improving signs in
Greece's state finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's economy minister, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, sent his economic advisers
on holiday this week, reassured by figures from the finance ministry showing
a substantial rise in tax revenues.
For the first time in four years, inflows have started to match the budget
projection. Revenues for May-July were up by 22 per cent, exactly on target,
after increasing by only 11 per cent over the previous three months.
The Greek propensity for making wildly optimistic revenue forecasts is one
reason why confidence remains low in the government's ability to reduce its
borrowing requirement, projected to reach 10.4 per cent of gross domestic
product this year.
Another is the reluctance of successive governments to tackle tax evasion,
although the black economy is estimated at more than 30 per cent of gross
domestic product.
Burdened by a public debt amounting to 110 per cent of GDP, an inflation
rate of 11.2 per cent and flat growth, Greece appears to have only a faint
chance of achieving the Maastricht targets for European economic union.
Yet Mr Papantoniou has brushed aside warnings from the European Commission,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and, most
recently, the International Monetary Fund, that a fiscal package was vital
to prevent a revenue shortfall this year, projected at Dr400bn-Dr500bn
(Pounds 1.09bn-Pounds 1.36bn). 'I knew it was a risk to insist there was no
need for new measures, but that the existing system should be properly
implemented,' he says. 'But it's starting to pay off.'
The catalyst, he says, was a new tax law aimed at reducing VAT evasion by
seizing goods and imposing stiff fines on traders whose paperwork is
incomplete. At the same time, the finance ministry offered generous
settlement terms for 7.5m pending tax disputes involving a total of
Dr1,300bn in arrears, hoping to recover a total of Dr200bn this year.
'There's been a positive response because the settlement is automatic and
doesn't mean going to court or negotiating with the tax authorities,' Mr
Papantoniou adds.
The sceptical view is that much of the revenue increase derives from
taxpayers' willingness to make settlements, rather than from more efficient
revenue collection. On the other hand, the rise in VAT receipts, up by 13
per cent since May, against 6 per cent in the first quarter, suggests that
the finance ministry's surprise check-ups on businesses are having an
effect.
Mr Papantoniou maintains the budget shortfall can be contained at around
Dr300bn this year. It would be covered by floating 25 per cent of OTE, the
state telecoms monopoly, on the Athens stock exchange in November.
Opportunities for raising extra revenue are more plentiful now that the
governing Socialists have reversed their opposition to privatisation,
backing partial flotations of state enterprises.
DEP, a profitable holding group for state-controlled oil refining and
petrochemicals companies due to be floated in 1995, will hand over Dr50bn to
the finance ministry this year as a cash advance.
With the government hoping to raise Dr700bn from privatisations over the
next three years, sales and long leases of state-owned assets, like resort
hotels and marinas, are also back on the agenda.
However, the Socialists' insistence that the state should retain management
control of public sector companies chosen for flotation could deter
investors. The IMF points out in its latest report on the Greek economy that
partial privatisation 'would neither have significant benefits in terms of
efficiency nor generate substantial revenues'.
Analysts also complain that the government's preoccupation with raising cash
obscures the problem of stimulating GDP growth, projected at an average 1.3
per cent over the next three years, against 2.2 per cent for the rest of the
European Union.
While EU transfers from the Delors II package for modernising infrastructure
will start flowing this autumn, boosting the state investment budget by more
than 6 per cent in 1994, the outlook for private investment is constrained
by interest rates approaching 30 per cent.
Private investment growth this year is forecast at 2.5-3 per cent, after a
fall in 1993. A private sector research group, IOBE, predicts that
investment in manufacturing will improve by 7 per cent this year, but notes
that 'while business prospects have not deteriorated, investment activity in
industry remains hesitant'.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Key court ruling for German N-industry
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's nuclear industry won a vital court victory yesterday in its bitter
campaign to keep open the long-term prospects for nuclear power generation
in the country.
The Supreme Administrative Court in Berlin gave the green light for building
work to continue on the plant being built by Siemens, the power and
engineering group, to manufacture mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel elements from
plutonium for atomic power stations.
The court dismissed the challenge by environmental campaigners to three key
licences in the building authorisation for the plant, overruling the
decision of the state administrative court in Kassel.
However, six further legal challenges remain to be cleared before the MOX
plant at Hanau, near Frankfurt, can go into production.
The plant is the most important missing link in the nuclear fuel chain in
Germany, needed to enable atomic power stations to re-use plutonium
reprocessed under contract in Britain and France. It is already 95 per cent
complete, at a cost of DM1.1bn (Pounds 450m), but building work has slowed
to a snail's pace because of the environmental battle.
The court decision was hailed by the Siemens management at Hanau, where a
spokesman said that 'building work can now proceed on a secure legal basis'.
It was flatly condemned by Mr Joschka Fischer, Green party environment
minister in the state of Hesse and the leading opponent of the plant. He
said it was irresponsible, and promised to continue his campaign against any
processing of plutonium in the state.
In contrast, Mr Klaus Topfer, the federal environment minister in Bonn,
welcomed the decision, saying that Mr Fischer's campaign against Hanau had
caused 'irreparable damage' to Germany's economic competitiveness.
Two more building licences for the Hanau plant face similar challenges to
the three approved yesterday, as do four licences required before uranium
can be processed there. Siemens said yesterday that it had no indication
when the cases would come to court.
The company said that if all the licences were swiftly approved, given that
the environmental objections - on the grounds of health threats to local
residents - were similar to those rejected yesterday, the plant could be in
production within two years.
According to its original contracts with Cogema in France, and BNFL in
Britain, the Siemens plant is supposed to receive 40 tonnes of plutonium
reprocessed abroad up to 2002 which would be turned into 900 tonnes of MOX
fuel elements.
It is understood that the German electricity utilities who signed the
original contracts are now negotiating to have up to 300 tonnes of the MOX
elements manufactured abroad, because of the delay in bringing Hanau on
stream. The Siemens plant would still be responsible for 600 tonnes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's newly-elected President Leonid Kuchma has taken a first bold step
toward fulfilling his campaign promise of economic reform by unilaterally
extending his own authority and tightening credits to the state sector,
Reuter reports from Kiev.
In an effort to break through bureaucratic gridlock and parliamentary
obstacles, Mr Kuchma this week issued decrees to take effective control over
the government and regional administrations. The measures are a challenge to
the country's Communist-driven parliament, currently in summer recess. In
the past leading MPs, many of them hostile to reform, have announced their
aim of establishing a parliamentary republic and curbing presidential
powers.
In the decrees, Mr Kuchma has asserted his right to appoint officials,
including deputy ministers and heads of committees, who are on the front
line of implementing policy. He may also try to chair chair cabinet meetings
on economic policy and reforms, thus curbing the role of the prime minister,
Mr Vitaly Masol, elected by parliament in June.
Local council and executive heads are now also required to obey presidential
directives. However, the decrees are likely to run up against a growing
movement toward greater regional autonomy, an idea which Mr Kuchma himself
approved in his presidential campaign earlier this summer.
In the credit tightening decree, cash-strapped state enterprises are being
required to submit business plans which explain why the state loans are
needed and how they will be paid back. The intention is for fiscal
discipline to replace the previous, often haphazard process of issuing
credits to enterprises' directors with good ministerial connections.

FT  10 AUG 94 / SPD will not join any coalition led by Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democrats warned Chancellor Helmut
Kohl yesterday that if he loses his coalition majority at the general
election in October, he cannot expect to remain in the government.
They flatly rejected hints by Mr Kohl that a 'grand coalition' between his
Christian Democrats and the opposition SPD might be possible. However, even
if the electoral outcome forces such a solution, yesterday's statements
suggest that the SPD will not accept the chancellor as its leader.
'He cannot seriously think we would allow him to stay in government if his
coalition loses its majority,' said Mr Gunther Verheugen, general secretary
of the SPD and its chief electoral strategist.
His declaration, to an election campaign launch conference of party
candidates and officials, marks a clear shift in SPD tactics to focus their
assault on Mr Kohl himself. It amounts to a calculated risk, for the
chancellor is also seen as the best selling point for the governing
coalition.
Mr Verheugen also challenged Mr Kohl to face Mr Rudolf Scharping, the party
leader, in a public debate on television, if he insists on fighting the
campaign on the basis of personalities.
Mr Scharping himself gave another fighting speech to his supporters,
determined to allay criticism that he is too dull and worthy to win popular
support. He accused Mr Kohl of being responsible for the mood of uncertainty
and lack of direction in the country.
Although the SPD has obviously decided that frontal attack on Mr Kohl is the
best form of defence, the party is also hammering away at the government's
record on unemployment, social justice, and the unequal pain of German
unification. Those were the issues, Mr Verheugen said, about which the
German electors cared.
He warned the party against paying too much attention to the opinion polls,
which show the SPD trailing between three and eight percentage points behind
the CDU. The same polls showed that the coalition no longer had any majority
itself, he said, thanks to the weakness of the Free Democratic party, the
junior partner.
At the same time, both SPD and CDU are acutely aware that the entire
election outcome could hang on the performance in eastern Germany of the
Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the former Communist party. If the PDS
can win its way into the next parliament, it could prevent either side
winning a clear majority - and force them into a grand coalition.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Barclays profits soar to Pounds 1.04bn as bad debts fall:
Results provoke protests from consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays, the UK's largest bank, yesterday surprised the stock market, and
provoked protests from consumer groups and unions, by reporting pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.04bn for the first half of the year after a Pounds 680m
fall in bad debt provisions.
The bank's interim profits trebled from Pounds 335m in the first half of
last year, helped by a sharp fall in bad debts in its UK retail bank and an
Pounds 85m profit in US operations, which lost Pounds 221m in the same
period of 1993.
It signalled a return to health for Barclays, which cut its dividend in 1992
when it lost Pounds 242m because of poor lending - particularly to large
property and construction companies - and appointed a new chief executive.
However, unions criticised the bank for having reduced its UK staff by 2,500
this year, and the Consumers' Association said that the profits 'added
insult to injury for thousands of customers who have suffered poor service'.
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, who joined the bank full-time
this year from Courtaulds Textiles, insisted that it had to make a higher
return on capital than in the past to reward its shareholders.
Mr Taylor said Barclays had made 'lousy returns' in the past few years. 'The
problem is not that these figures are very high, although that is true. It
is that people have got used to very poor returns in this business,' he
said.
Barclays is the latest bank to show a return to strong profits following
problems in the early 1990s. National Westminster last week reported first
half pre-tax profits of Pounds 767m, while Lloyds raised profits to Pounds
605m.
However, banks are finding it hard to generate new income because of low
demand for loans and competitive pressures. Barclays' operating profits
before bad debt provisions fell to Pounds 1.23bn from Pounds 1.34bn in the
first half of last year.
The bank said it had made an undisclosed provision against having to
compensate customers of its life insurance subsidiary Barclays Life to whom
it may have sold products such as personal pensions inappropriately.
Barclays Life was publicly rebuked by the Securities and Investments Board
last month over lax training of its 1,100 sales force and management
standards. Mr Taylor said that it regarded the rebuke as 'an extremely
serious matter'.
Profits at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Barclays' investment bank, fell from
Pounds 254m to Pounds 194m because of turbulence in global bond and equity
markets. Securities trading income fell to Pounds 50m from Pounds 126m,
although foreign exchange income rose to Pounds 75m from Pounds 71m.
The bank's loans and advances to customers fell by Pounds 10bn to Pounds
86.4bn, because of a reduction in low-yielding assets and slack demand. Mr
Taylor said it would be unwise for Barclays to lend at a faster rate than
growth in the economy.
The bank's earnings per share rose to 40.6p, compared with 11.7p, and it
raised its interim dividend by 23 per cent from 6.5p to 8p. Net asset value
per share rose to 362p from 330p, and the shares closed 4p up at 568p.

FT  10 AUG 94 / EU court overturns antitrust accord with US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice yesterday ruled that an antitrust agreement
signed between the European Commission and the US government was void. The
decision raised again the sensitive issue of who has the authority to sign
bilateral agreements for the European Union.
The Luxembourg-based court ruled that the agreement - signed three years ago
and designed to promote co-operation between the competition authorities of
the EU and the US - should have been concluded by the Council of Ministers,
rather than by the Commission.
Lawyers in Brussels said the court ruling was a setback for the Commission,
which was trying to create a framework with the US competition authorities
to vet global corporate agreements. However, the Commission said the case
was 'exceptional' and that the council would give its approval to the deal
very soon.
The Commission insisted yesterday that the court's decision would have no
bearing on other bilateral accords already agreed, but would cause it to
tread more carefully in fashioning agreements that might require more than
administrative approval, which is the Commission's responsibility.
The decision comes amid other wrangles between the Commission and EU member
states over who should take responsibility for concluding international
agreements, notably over who should ratify the Uruguay Round pact under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Commission has already asked the European Court for an opinion on where
legal authority lies in matters covered by Gatt. In this case, the court is
expected to find in favour of the Commission, a prospect causing some
consternation among member states such as the UK and France, which are wary
of pressure towards further integration.
Confusion over Gatt ratification together with yesterday's ruling will
highlight the need for member states and the Commission to settle questions
of where responsibility lies within the EU. These matters are expected to be
tackled at the 1996 intergovernmental conference which will review the
Maastricht treaty and look at ways of streamlining decision-making in an
enlarged EU.
Sir Leon Brittan, who signed the deal as commissioner responsible for
external economic affairs, believed the matter was administrative and did
not need to go before the council.
However, France, backed by Spain and the Netherlands, launched the court
action, arguing that for an international agreement signed with another
government it was not the Commission's place to represent the EU, but rather
a matter for the member states, as represented by the council. The court
largely agreed with its reasoning.
The Commission stressed that in most cases, bilateral agreements went before
the council but that this agreement was a special case. It added that the
substance of the agreement was not in question and that it was likely to be
approved without alteration by the council.
'Since the member states have in essence not questioned its substance, the
Commission expects the agreement will be approved without difficulty by the
council in order to maintain close co-operation and co-ordination between
the competition authorities of the European Union and the US,' said a
Commission spokesman.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Charter may abandon Swedish group bid: Esab shareholders
resist Pounds 260m takeover move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, yesterday suffered a severe setback in its
plans to take over Sweden's Esab, the world's biggest welding equipment
supplier, when a group of leading Swedish institutional shareholders
rejected its bid.
During a dramatic day, reminiscent of the Swedish shareholder revolt that
halted Volvo's attempt last year to merge with Renault, five institutions
which hold almost 20 per cent of the voting capital in Esab announced, one
by one, their decisions to spurn the British offer.
Their rejections mean Charter cannot achieve the 90 per cent acceptance it
had set as a condition for its recommended Pounds 260m bid by Friday's
deadline.
Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter's chief executive, said the company might
abandon the entire deal despite having already secured 53 per cent of the
voting capital in Esab. He said the bid price of SKr345 (Pounds 29) a share
remained a fair offer, despite a surge in Esab's share price to SKr355 since
the offer was made in June.
'Nothing has changed the terms of our offer,' said Mr Herbert, who was in
Stockholm yesterday in an unsuccessful attempt to talk round the
institutions. 'If we do not reach the required level of acceptances by
Friday, our options include walking away or remaining satisfied with the
acceptances we have.'
Charter's bid was recommended by the Esab board and accepted by Incentive,
the Wallenberg family's industrial group that was previously Esab's
controlling shareholder with 49 per cent of the voting capital.
Under the terms of the agreement with Incentive, Charter can withdraw if it
does not receive at least 90 per cent acceptances. The takeover of Esab,
which had turnover of SKr7bn last year, was billed as a successful
conclusion to Charter's search for an international industrial 'fourth leg'
to add to its three existing operations in building materials, coal and rail
track equipment.
The British group wanted complete control of Esab, which would more than
double Charter in size. But opposition to the deal began to surface in
Sweden shortly after the bid was announced, despite Incentive's acceptance.
Blue and white-collar trade unions at Esab - based, like Volvo, in
Gothenburg - began a campaign against the takeover, arguing that Charter had
no experience in welding equipment and was likely to scrap the company's
matrix management structure and shift production away from Sweden.
The unions have representation on the boards of some of the institutional
shareholders. But the biggest factor in the rejection was a growing view
that the Charter bid was significantly underpriced - despite the 20 per cent
premium the offer represented at the time it was made.
In July, the Esab share price jumped in line with the Stockholm market. On
Monday, Esab announced sharply increased profits for the first half and
predicted full year pre-tax profits of SKr390m, well ahead of the previous
forecast of SKr320m. The price/earnings multiple represented by the Charter
bid fell from 20 to below 17.
The half-year results persuaded five of the biggest institutional Esab
shareholders to hold out for more money. They included a state pension fund,
the Fourth Fund and Skandia, the insurance group, both of which played key
roles in the demise of the Volvo-Renault merger.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Package holiday industry set to escape monopolies probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is expected to announce this week that it will
not refer the package holiday industry to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The announcement will follow a 13-month OFT inquiry into complaints by small
travel companies that they were finding it difficult to get on to travel
retailers' shelves. Independent companies said they were being hampered by
the strong links between the biggest tour operators and travel agents.
The OFT also investigated the large tour operators' practice of giving
travel agent staff financial incentives to sell their holidays. The OFT is
thought to have concluded, however, that there is no need for further
inquiries by the MMC.
The expected announcement will be welcomed by Thomson and Airtours, the two
largest travel groups, which have argued that the industry is highly
competitive, selling foreign holidays to an increasing number of consumers
at low prices.
Independent operators are hoping that, in the absence of a referral to the
commission, the OFT asks large groups for undertakings to treat smaller
companies fairly.
Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain. Airtours owns Going
Places, the second largest. The two retail chains are currently engaged in a
price-cutting skirmish, selling summer 1995 holidays at discounts of up to
15 per cent.
Lunn Poly has argued that far from using its market dominance to drive up
prices and deprive consumers of choice, the cost of foreign holidays had
actually fallen over the past year. It said the average price of a summer
holiday booked by Lunn Poly by the end of June this year was Pounds 353,
compared with Pounds 356 last year.
Lunn Poly said last week that it currently sells the holidays of 147 travel
suppliers. The three largest operators - Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad
 -are given only 33 per cent of the racking space in the Lunn Poly shops. It
said the remaining space was occupied by brochures from travel suppliers who
account for only 30 per cent of sales.
It added: 'Far from being undersupported, small tour operators are allocated
far more shelf space than their proportion of sales would justify.'
Small tour operators have argued, however, that large travel retailers
demand higher commissions from them than from leading operators.

FT  09 AUG 94 / US-North Korea talks resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chief US delegate Robert Gallucci and Mr Kan Sok-ju, his North Korean
counterpart, resumed talks at the North Korean mission in Geneva yesterday
on Pyongyang's controversial nuclear programme, Reuter reports.
After a weekend break during which both sides were to consult with their
capitals, Mr Gallucci said it was too early to say whether there was any
policy shift from the new leadership following the death four weeks ago of
President Kim Il-sung.
The US and its allies in east Asia are trying to persuade North Korea, which
they accuse of having a secret nuclear weapons programme, to open up its
nuclear power facilities to full international inspection.
The most immediate issue in this round of talks is the fate of about 8,000
spent fuel rods taken from a reactor at Yongbyon in June.
The US which originally threatened United Nations sanctions over the fuel
rods, has warned that they could soon corrode and pose a radiation risk.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Minefield offers route to Jordan

<DATELINE>
   ISRAEL-JORDAN BORDER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Jordan changed the road map of the Middle East yesterday, opening
a border crossing on a former minefield and inaugurating what Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan described as 'a commonwealth of shared human interests' that
would do away with regional poverty and injustice, Julian Ozanne reports
from the Israel-Jordan border.
The crown prince, with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and US
secretary of state Warren Christopher all emphasised the border opening
would pave the way to a tourism boom, business and commercial contacts and
economic co-operation and development. Mr Rabin later crossed into Jordan
for an unprecedented summit with King Hussein at his winter palace in Aqaba,
the first time an Israeli prime minister has publicly set foot on Jordanian
soil since the creation of the Jewish state in 1948.
The king then took Mr Rabin for an afternoon cruise on the royal yacht
across the Red Sea dividing their countries.
'Three weeks ago the dream of peace was far away,' Mr Rabin said shortly
before he and Prince Hassan cut the white ribbon opening the new border 3km
north of the Red Sea ports of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel. 'Today it
is materialising: telephone lines, tourism. Soon it will seem as though this
is the way it has always been.' The prince said the border was the beginning
of regional transport networks and a token of Israel's and Jordan's desire
for material economic links. 'Let the opening of this border gate in this
particular location mark the foundation stone on which we intend to build
our common future,' he said. Mr Christopher said the two nations were
'weaving together the fabric of human contact and mutual interest that are
the foundations of genuine peace.'
'Through open borders and open phones, road links and air links, economic
co-operation and security co-ordination Jordan and Israel will, step by
step, transform their relations as well as their region.' Mr Christopher
said later the Rabin-Hussein summit had discussed trilateral
Israel-Jordan-US plans for regional development and October's Middle East
economic conference in Casablanca, sponsored by King Hassan of Morocco, US
president Bill Clinton and Russian president Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Christopher said the conference, expected to bring together more than
1,000 companies with governments to finance Middle East development, would
be 'a great opportunity to unlock resources' for the regional projects.
Mr Christopher also promised continued US political and economic support to
both Israel and Jordan and said the US had written to the Paris Club of
creditors to seek debt relief for Jordan and was speeding through Congress
legislation to write off US loans to Jordan, worth about Dollars 1bn.
Israel and Jordan have drawn up a far-reaching joint economic agenda but
only a few of these plans can be implemented until a formal peace treaty is
signed. Israeli and Jordanian negotiators resume bilateral talks today on
the Israeli side of the Dead Sea to resolve border demarcation and water
disputes - the obstacles that stand in the way of a peace treaty.
The new border, on a minefield Mr Rabin said had formerly sown 'death and
destruction', comes only two weeks after Israel and Jordan signed an interim
peace accord in Washington.
Construction workers from both Israel and Jordan yesterday were still
putting the finishing touches to the roads, signposts, border terminals and
barriers minutes before the ceremony began.
Although only foreign nationals will be able to cross initially, the border
opening is a psychological breakthrough for Israelis who have felt isolated
and surrounded by hostile Arab neighbours for decades.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Disney joins 'Baby Bells' in
interactive video pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday said it plans to form a
joint venture with three regional telephone companies to provide consumers
with traditional and interactive video programming in their homes.
News of the alliance between Disney and the three 'Baby Bells' - Ameritech,
BellSouth and Southwestern Bell - follows last month's decision by the
Federal Communications Commission to allow Bell Atlantic, a local telephone
operator, to provide cable TV and interactive video services to customers in
its region.
That decision was hailed as a breakthrough because it was the first time a
telecommunications company had been allowed to offer cable and interactive
programming services over its lines in competition with local cable
television monopolies. At the time of the Bell Atlantic ruling, the FCC made
clear that it would allow other telephone companies to compete with cable
television groups.
Telephone companies, however, are still forbidden in general from owning the
content of television programming, which is why the three Baby Bells have
joined forces with Disney. The entertainment group will provide the product
 -including motion films, television shows and educational programmes -
while the telephone companies will provide the means to deliver that product
to consumers at home.
According to the four partners, the services their venture will provide
could ultimately include traditional broadcast and satellite television
networks, movies-on-demand, interactive home shopping, educational
programming, games and travel information and assistance. The venture will
also develop a navigating system that will allow customers to access these
services easily and quickly.
Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, said of the project: 'Our goal is to
use technological breakthroughs and new entertainment delivery systems to
provide customers with a compelling and creative array of programming.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Surprising claim about market testing
in efficiency study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have read few government reports that are more damning than the study
carried out to determine whether the civil service is getting value for
money from its use of consultants ('Whitehall could save Pounds 130m on
consultants', August 5).
The main findings, that a staggering Pounds 500m is being paid out in fees
to the private sector for a miserable return of just Pounds 12.5m each year,
is little short of scandalous and should be fully investigated by the Public
Accounts Committee.
I was surprised that the report also claims, on a more positive note, that
consultants have been instrumental in the 'success' of the central
government market testing programme. Is this not the same policy that was
deemed to be so 'successful' that the recent white paper on the civil
service quietly announced that departments and agencies would no longer be
obliged to continue with the initiative.
Only under this government could we have had a senior civil servant, Sir
Peter Levene, rather than an accountable minister, being fielded to deal
with the media and explain away the shocking waste of taxpayers' money. The
report shows once again that the government is obsessed with the private
sector and cares little that the public servants can often do the same work
a lot more cheaply.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Murdoch warms to Blair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, said
last night he 'could imagine' supporting Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader.
Mr Murdoch said in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel that
although he was a conservative, his newspapers had supported Lord Wilson,
the former Labour prime minister, and many Labor politicians in Australia.
'I could even imagine supporting the British Labour leader Tony Blair,' he
said.
Mr Murdoch's company owns five UK national newspapers and a majority stake
in BSkyB, the satellite TV network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times has a stake.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour party chairman, said last night: 'I think there
has been a very clear change in the attitude of the Murdoch press anyway
over the last two years, with their virulent attacks on John Major.'
But Mr John Maples, deputy Tory party chairman, said: 'He only said he could
imagine doing it. He did not say he was going to do it, and it would be very
odd if he did.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / R-R may order Mercedes engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers engineering group subsidiary, is
discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from
Mercedes-Benz of Germany for use in future model programmes.
Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive and Vickers managing
director, operations, refused to confirm the specific talks with the German
carmaker, but said: 'We are in a number of discussions.'
Mercedes-Benz said that Rolls-Royce had approached it a year ago for talks
about engine supply for a new generation of products and said that
discussions were continuing.
Mr Ward said Rolls-Royce was 'looking at a number of possibilities and
partners, but we are not yet close to reaching a conclusion'.
An eventual move by Rolls-Royce to purchase engines from Mercedes-Benz would
represent a significant departure for the company, which assembles its own
6.75 litre V8 engines at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire.
The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from an
original 6.25 litre V8 engine launched by the company in 1958, although the
engines have since been substantially updated.
The Mercedes-Benz 6 litre V12 was launched in 1991 in its S-Class model. It
produces about 8,500 V12 engines a year.
Rolls-Royce and Bentley production was 1,263 last year.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Senators warn on runaway spending: Federal budget will be
'swamped' by 2010
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Some of Washington's wisest heads yesterday issued a solemn warning that
runaway government spending was heading in a direction that will eventually
swamp the federal budget.
Sounding the alarm over the expansion of government entitlements, such as
Social Security and Medicare benefits for the elderly, a bipartisan
commission chaired by Senator Robert Kerrey, of Nebraska, called for action
to address the problem before it became overwhelming.
If trends continue unchecked, the commission said in a preliminary report,
by the year 2010 the entire federal budget will be consumed by entitlements
and by interest on the government debt.
'What we are saying is that if we continue the trend lines that we are going
right now, we are going to find the federal government essentially converted
into an ATM machine,' Mr Kerrey said.
The commission is due to present a more detailed final report in December -
after the congressional elections - with its recommendations. Yesterday's
interim report was intended to raise public awareness of the extent of the
problem.
Although many voters favour cuts in government spending, they tend to
believe that the budget deficit can be brought into line by eliminating
waste, fraud and welfare payments to the unemployed.
Apart from interest on the national debt, which is expected to eat up 14 per
cent of government spending next year, the largest programmes in the federal
budget are Social Security and Medicare, hugely popular middle class
benefits which together account for one third of all government spending.
While Social Security generates an annual surplus, most of its beneficiaries
take out much more than they put in, and the ageing of the US population
mean changes will be needed at some point.
Medicare, like other health spending, continues to climb much faster than
the general rate of inflation, and hopes are now dwindling that a reform of
the healthcare system would be able to bring it under control.
The commission was originally set up by President Bill Clinton to fulfil a
promise made to Mr Kerrey in return for his vote for last year's budget.
Since Mr Kerrey now says he will not vote for the healthcare reform bill at
present under consideration, Mr Clinton may have to promise to do something
about the commission's proposals in order to win Mr Kerrey over once again.

FT  09 AUG 94 / US-N Korean nuclear talks make progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between North Korea and the US on Pyongyang's nuclear programme
appeared to move forward yesterday when Pyongyang said it was willing to
transform its nuclear power industry, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Mr Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, said Pyongyang had
offered to switch from its plutonium-producing graphite reactors to safer
light-water reactors. was
But North Korea was only willing to make the switch if it received 'proper
and appropriate compensation', suggesting there would be a high price for
ending the stand-off caused by North Korea's refusal to allow full
inspections of its nuclear facilities.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state and chief American
delegate at the talks, said North Korea's offers had come in response to US
proposals considered by Pyongyang over the weekend. The suggestions were
'certainly worthy of study and consideration' before tomorrow's meeting.
Resumption of the Geneva talks follows the death four weeks ago of Kim
Il-sung, the North Korean leader. The new session has been seen in the west
as an important pointer to the stance taken by his son and successor, Mr Kim
Jong-il.
Mr Kang also said North Korea had proposed ways to tackle the problem of
8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods removed from a reactor in May which would
'certainly ease the concerns of the international community'. The US and
South Korea have expressed fears the North could reprocess the fuel rods and
gain a potential supply of plutonium for making nuclear weapons.
The US has been trying to persuade Pyongyang to open its nuclear power
programme to full international inspection, accusing it of having diverted
plutonium for nuclear weapons manufacture. Under a plan thought to be
favoured by the US, any light-water reactors given to North Korea would
probably be Russian, since the North Koreans already know Russian
technology.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: India to publish guidelines for telecoms
licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government will publish guidelines this month for the licensing
of private telecommunications operators, including overseas companies, but
licences are not expected to be issued until next year.
Mr Nagarajan Vittal, the senior official responsible for Indian telecoms
policy, said the new guidelines would specify the terms on which the state's
existing telecoms monopoly will be abolished and private operators allowed
to provide services.
'I would expect to see the first new operators licensed within three to six
months after that,' he said at the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity conference in
Bangkok.
However, Mr Vittal indicated that an intense debate was continuing between
the Telecom Commission, which he chairs, and the government, which is under
strong pressure from India's state telecoms operators and trade unions to
limit the degree and speed of liberalisation.
'They are afraid that the new competitors will be very quick in establishing
themselves, and they are arguing this strongly at the centres of power,' he
said.
India has barely eight telephone lines per 1,000 people, and is looking to
private companies, including foreign groups, to invest up to Dollars 5bn
over the next three years to help meet the country's target of increasing
its number of lines from 8m to at least 16m.
Warning those opposed to reform, Mr Vittal said there was a danger of 'too
much navel-gazing' while demand remained unmet. 'Several other countries in
the region are making much faster progress than us,' he said, noting that
India was competing with 'at least 60 other countries' to attract foreign
investment in telecoms.
More than 50 proposals have been put forward by private operators for
providing basic telephony services, either in competition or co-operation
with existing state operators. Overseas operators expressing interest
include US West, Motorola and AT&amp;T of the US, Siemens of Germany, and
Fujitsu of Japan.
The guidelines will cover the terms on which private operators will be
licensed and the proportion of foreign equity allowed in new undertakings.
They will also include details of a new regulatory authority to be
established to underpin the new competitive regime.
Mr Vittal said legislation would probably be required to establish the
regulatory authority, but the government would be free to license new
operators without recourse to special legislation.

FT  09 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways tumbled 12 to 417p in heavy trading of 9.2m as investors
took profits following first-quarter figures below market expectations.
Earnings of Pounds 88m fell short of the range of market forecasts of Pounds
90m to Pounds 95m. And although analysts were pleased with underlying
profitability, they focused on the poor performance of the airline's
associates such as TAT, the regional French carrier in which BA has a
significant stake.
Charterhouse Tilney downgraded its full-year profits prediction by Pounds
15m to Pounds 425m and said: 'Underlying profitability is well ahead of our
expectations and growing strongly, but this is offset by the disappointing
performance of the associates.'
However, the fall came after a period of sustained strength. Since the
market began to turn the corner at the end of June, BA shares have
outperformed the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index by almost 7 per cent.
Regional electricity stocks generally maintained the strong progress made
last week, anticipating a better than expected outcome to the distribution
review which should be known on Thursday.
Dealers reported heavy switching out of Scottish Power, which closed at 389
1/2 p ex-dividend, and into Scottish Hydro-Electric, 16 1/2 stronger at 389
1/2 p.
Dealers in the financial areas of the market braced themselves for the next
set of interim figures from the big banks, those of Barclays, scheduled for
this morning. Estimates of Barclays' interims range from Pounds 670m to
Pounds 770m, with the dividend expected to be increased to 8p from last
year's 6.5p.
Barclays moved up 5 to 564p, closely followed by TSB, 4 1/2 firmer at 212
1/2 p.
Merchant banks, meanwhile, came in for some aggressive buying, with
Kleinwort Benson climbing 8 to 530p in the wake of sizeable switching out of
SG Warburg, down 6 at 777p, following the recent strong profits from the
former.
The oil majors remained under pressure in spite of firmer crude oil prices
yesterday, with dealers citing further switching out of the UK majors and
into the US leaders.
BP slipped a penny to 405 1/2 p in heavy volume of 13m shares, the largest
individual turnover in the stock market yesterday. Shell Transport held at
739p on 2m traded ahead of interim figures due on Thursday.
Some analysts said the market had become too complacent about the impact of
the strike by workers in the Nigerian oilfields, which they felt could drive
prices higher in the short term.
Enterprise Oil dipped 3 to 425p, the shares affected by talk of a broker
sell note. There were also vague suggestions that the company had received a
bid for the 10 per cent stake in Lasmo that it acquired in its unsuccessful
takeover bid earlier this year. The latter edged forward a penny to 156p.
Smith &amp; Nephew was resilient at 159p in spite of announcing a spectacular
loss on the sale of Ioptex, its US-based lens business, for Pounds 11m. It
bought Ioptex in 1988 for Dollars 236m (Pounds 152.2m). Analysts said the
loss was offset by the relief that S&amp;N had finally got out of the business.
Amid continuing demand for the food retailers, there was a flurry of
activity in William Low, the Scottish supermarket group which last week
succumbed to a Pounds 248m bid from Tesco, with the shares advancing 3 to
363p. Tesco gained 1 1/2 at 244p and Argyll 5 at 281p.
Profit-takers trimmed the recent gain in Associated British Foods, off 5 at
595p. Takeover talk died down in Hazlewood Foods, 2 1/2 easier at 142 1/2 p.
Unigate, a rumoured predator, gained 4 at 384p. Speculative buying again
supported United Biscuits, ahead 2 at 338p.
Leading stores stocks were in demand as interest rate talk subsided. Great
Universal Stores advanced 7 to 580p, WH Smith 15 to 484p, Kingfisher 5 to
515p and Marks and Spencer 7 to 431p.
Sears was unruffled by a weekend press report suggesting weak sales at one
of its subsidiaries. The shares were steady at 121p.
The hot summer weather and hints of an easing of the wholesale price war
were again inspiring demand for regional brewing groups. Among these, Regent
Inns firmed 5 to 242p and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 3 to 531p. Among the
majors, Scottish &amp; Newcastle rose 5 to 524p and Bass 3 to 576p.
However, Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed was warning analysts at its agm that
the good weather was being offset by hesitant consumer spending, and that
profits upgrades would be premature. The shares edged forward 2 to 282p.
An agency cross and share buying by directors buoyed Grand Metropolitan, up
6 at 420p on turnover of 7.9m.
Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was one of the star performers in
London after the company posted first-half profits of Pounds 15.3m, against
only Pounds 9.1m a year ago. The shares jumped 15 to 176p. WPP, which
reports interim profits today, put on 3 at 111p and Aegis rose 2 1/2 to 30
1/2 p, both on consideration of the Saatchi profits numbers.
The move by The Today newspaper to cut its price to 10p for a day hit Daily
Mail &amp; General Trust 'A' shares, which fell 20 to 1003p, The Telegraph, down
10 at 357p, and United Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express, off 24 at
505p.
Emap gained 7 at 430p after Trans World decided to recommend the group's
bid.

Household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman slid on speculation that it was
poised to buy Eastman Kodak's household products division for between
Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 2bn.
Reckitt ended the day down 7 at 614p as analysts wondered how the company
would get hold of the necessary cash and decided that a tap on shareholders
was the only way.
However, Lehman Brothers argued that Reckitt was an unlikely candidate and
that global rivals Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble were
more plausible buyers.
Ms Jo Walton, Lehman's pharmaceuticals analyst, said the company would be
able to service additional debt of only Dollars 1.55bn. She said it was more
likely that the company could buy some lines of Kodak's Stirling Winthrop
arm that might provide a good fit.
Meanwhile, Unilever, which reports second-quarter figures on Friday,
strengthened 14 to 1081p. The Anglo-Dutch group is expected to announce
profits of between Pounds 550m and Pounds 590m.

FT  09 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data help shares to a firm
close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices held firm in London yesterday with the help of favourable news
on domestic price inflation and consumer credit. Trading volume was
unexciting, however, and the market had to struggle against the effects of
ex-dividend quotations in a number of leading stocks.
London was overshadowed in the first half of the session by concern that the
US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in the wake of the strong US
jobless figures announced on Friday afternoon. UK stocks edged forward
towards the close as the US markets regained confidence.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a gain of 4.4 at 3,171.9. The
broader-based FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued its advance, closing a further
13.8 to the good at 3,728.7.
Traders responded positively to the disclosure that producer prices in the
UK had risen by only 1.9 per cent in July, indicating that domestic
inflation was still subdued and thus reducing pressures on the Bank of
England to lift base rates. However, nervousness towards rate prospects
continued, with market traders anxiously scanning comments in the European
press by the Bank of England Governor.
Share prices made slow progress until the New York market opened, however.
The rise in consumer credit in June was substantially greater than predicted
in the stock market and retail and consumer issues responded well to this
latest indication that retail spending might provide the back-ing for
economic recovery.
The Dow Industrial Average was 10 points up at the London close, although UK
markets remained wary of a move by the Federal Reserve during a trading week
studded with important US economic data.
Seaq trading volume, at 547.3m shares was about 6 per cent down on the
previous session and left traders with a good deal of time on their hands.
Friday's retail, or genuine customer investment business in equities was
worth Pounds 1.28bn. This figure is just about satisfactory, from the point
of view of the London-based investment houses.
Strategists pointed to a generally unexciting performance across European
bourses, which they said reflected the prospect of a difficult,
lightly-traded, summer holiday week. In addition to the latest data on US
retail sales and producer prices, this week brings another appearance before
Congress of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve and a
sizeable US funding programme. This morning, the London market faces the
domestic trade figures for May.
The UK markets are expected to remain quiet this month, barring any sudden
move on US interest rates. In the wake of the Bank of England's Quarterly
Bulletin published last week, equity market analysts hopes that the
widely-anticipated rise in UK base rates can be postponed, at least until
next month.
The blue chip dollar stocks made little headway, in spite of the rally in
New York. Hopes for news of a sizeable takeover move in the pharmaceuticals
industry continued to circulate but trading volume died away. The big oil
stocks could make little fresh response to activity in crude oil markets.
There was a good deal of switching among banking stocks as institutions
sought out the best growth opportunities.
The best gains came in the stores sector, where the domestic consumer credit
figures brought in a few hopeful buyers. Most of the high street names
managed to put on a few pence, but traders admitted that individual share
volumes had not been particularly impressive.
There was some demand, once again, for UK construction stocks with German
links following further evidence of recovery in the economy and the building
industry in that country.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond yields offer modest
boost to Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices edged higher yesterday in quiet trading as an early decline
in bond yields provided a modest boost to stock market sentiment, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.79 up at 3,753.81 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 0.80 to 457.89, while the Nasdaq composite
gained 1.80 at 720.47. New York SE trading volume was low at 217.7m shares.
After last week's late sell-off that was prompted by a surge in bond yields,
trading was expected to be subdued yesterday. Bond yields had risen on
Friday because a stronger than expected July jobs report had raised fears
that the Federal Reserve would tighten interest rates again to slow down the
economy.
When bond yields opened lower in the morning, it provided a lift to
equities. A slight firming in the dollar also supported stocks initially but
trading activity remained light, with many investors and dealers choosing to
stay on the sidelines until later in the week, when July inflation figures
are due to be released. Prices, however, held their ground in the face of an
upturn in bond yields later in the day.
Leading issues were mostly firmer, although gains were kept to a minimum.
General Motors was ahead Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 50 3/8 , IBM Dollars 7/8 at
Dollars 63 3/8 and Merck Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 30 1/2.
North American Mortgage forged ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 30 5/8 in heavy
trading after the mortgage banking company revealed that it had asked Morgan
Stanley to advise on strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value.
Molecular Biosystems jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 12 3/8 after the US
Food and Drug Administration gave final approval for Albunex, the company's
flagship product used as a contrast-imaging agent.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended mixed in moderate trading after a strong showing by the
Canadian dollar and bonds failed to carry over to the equity markets.
The TSE 300 index gained 6.8 at 4,175.4, but declines outscored rises by 365
to 309. Volume was 53.3m shares.
Canadian bonds and currency surged after the release of a survey in Quebec
that showed weakening support for the separatist Parti Quebecois in the
upcoming provincial election.
Venezuela
Equities in Caracas showed little reaction to reports that a further crisis
in the financial sector could be developing following the suspension from
trading of four of the country's banks. The Merinvest composite index closed
1.24, or 1 per cent, down at 124.58.
The stock exchange authorities later lifted the suspension from two of the
banks. Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the country's finance minister, denied that
there was a problem in the banking sector, but added that there could be
changes to the boards of directors in some of the banks.
Among major stocks, Electricidad de Caracas was down 5 bolivars at 300
bolivars.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrials extended Friday's good gains, while gold shares climbed off
earlier lows as hopes remained that the bullion price would maintain its
current firmness.
The overall index advanced 30 to 5,758, the industrials index added 46 at
6,757 and golds lost 8 on balance at 2,103 after touching 2,095.
Traders said that selected stocks had led the market higher, with Sasol
building on Friday's R1.90 gain with a rise of 75 cents to R32, a high for
the year.
Among the mining sector, De Beers appreciated 25 cents to R117.75, Anglos
moved ahead R2 to R252 and Vaal Reefs relinquished R8 to R399.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as
Chinese issues move higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by overseas and corporate investors supported share prices in the
afternoon, and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground in low volume, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was up 114.13 at 20,635.83 after a day's low of 20,502.20 and high
of 20,638.93. Low-priced steels and chemicals moved ahead on buying by
foreigners, while telecommunication-linked stocks and issues related to the
'Aids theme' strengthened on demand from individuals and corporate
investors.
Volume totalled 227.3m shares, against 266m. Many domestic investors
remained inactive ahead of the Obon holidays next week, while others were
cautious of stock and bond fluctuations in the US.
Analysts expect domestic institutions to remain on the sidelines at current
levels of the Nikkei 225. James Capel said that while Japanese institutions
believe that the economy may have bottomed out, they still regard the
chances of a 'triple dip' as significant.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 7.04 at 1,656.78 and the
Nikkei 300 edged up 1.50 to 300.94. Rises led falls by 523 to 439, with 203
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 4.70 firmer at
1,347.15.
Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y6 to Y369 and NKK gained Y5
at Y284. Chemicals, beneficiaries of a rise in industrial output, were also
higher, Showa Denko adding Y5 at Y361 and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Y11 at
Y538.
Canon, the precision products group, moved up Y30 to Y1,760 on reports that
the company will see an 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the current
business year.
With the International Aids Conference being held in Yokohama until
Thursday, Ajinomoto, the food maker, advanced Y60 to Y1,360 on the 'Aids
theme'. Drug shares were also higher, Green Cross firming Y30 to Y1,170 and
Dainippon Pharmaceutical Y20 to Y1,170.
Telecommunication stocks were popular, led by a rise in DDI, the
long-distance telecoms operator listed on the second section. The issue rose
Y39,000 to a year's high of Y1.03m. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, put
on Y110 at Y7,430. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, however, dipped Y3,000 to
Y851,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 66.07 at 22,988.74 in volume of 40m shares.
Winners here included export-related stocks, and beneficiaries of rising
domestic consumption.
Roundup
Taipei was closed due to a typhoon, losing an opportunity to respond to
events in other Chinese or China-influenced equity markets.
SHANGHAI continued to assert itself as Hong Kong's H share index opened, the
Shanghai B share index climbing by 6.1 per cent. The index rose 4.55 to
78.95, aided by overseas interest following the spectacular gains last week
 -adding up to 108 per cent in five days - in the A share market for local
investors. Yesterday, the A share index gained a further 4.1 per cent.
Brokers also credited recent economic data for the surge in foreign investor
interest in China, citing a drop in companies' accounts receivable and new
credits for state enterprises.
HONG KONG had a mixed day. The Hang Seng index of blue chip domestic stocks
lost 64.34 at 9,537.87 on profit-taking by overseas investors and fears of
higher US interest rates; but Chinese companies firmed on interest sparked
by the debut of the new H shares index, which ended at 1,323.71, up 26.44 or
2 per cent.
Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 3.21bn, against an adjusted HKDollars
3.93bn on Friday. Overseas institutions were said to be cautious on the
interest rate outlook, and most investors to be waiting for Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking's interim results due next Monday.
The novelty value of the new index helped to lift H shares. Speculation that
it paved the way for fresh trading opportunities, such as derivatives, also
prompted buying interest.
SEOUL ended sharply lower after a price plunge in the market's pacesetters
Posco and Korea Mobile Telecom triggered a round of selling in late trading.
Posco shed Won600 to Won77,900 and KMT Won1,000 to Won378,000.
The composite index lost 12.41, or 1.33 per cent, at 919.76. Volume hit a
new 1994 low of 16.56m shares. However, Mr W. Lee of Jardine Fleming said:
'The market seems to be approaching a bottom. From the middle of this week,
the index will show a gradual recovery.'
SYDNEY closed lower, with interest stilled by sharply weaker bonds and the
fall on Wall Street on Friday. The All Ordinaries index shed 10.8 to
2,081.1.
BHP fell 12 cents to ADollars 19.48, News Corp 4 cents to ADollars 8.91 and
CRA 6 cents to ADollars 19. Delta Gold slipped 8 cents to ADollars 2.95 and
Highlands Gold declined 5 cents to ADollars 1.46.
WELLINGTON finished softer, although above the day's worst levels, which
were triggered by Wall Street's decline on Friday. The NZSE-40 capital index
dipped 4.64 to 2,106.62 in moderate volume. A reasonable performance by the
Australian market helped local sentiment after an earlier fall of almost 20
points.
Cart Holt Harvey led the recovery, closing 4 cents up at NZDollars 3.96.
SINGAPORE was slightly easier after profit-taking ahead of the National Day
holiday today. Analysts expected the market to be influenced by Wall Street,
rather than domestic factors, as the Straits Times Industrial index closed
5.47 points off at 2,267.65 in volume of 217.8m shares. Creative Technology
dropped SDollars 2.90 to SDollars 28.50 on disappointing fourth-quarter
results.
KUALA LUMPUR closed 12.81, or 1.2 per cent, down at 1,076.34 in volume of
355m shares, ending a two-week climb in the benchmark index. Analysts
suggested that investors booked profits as foreign funds took a breather.
MANILA edged forward as second-line issues took the limelight and blue chips
consolidated. The composite index added 0.64 at 2,884.03.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy exception to positive tone in
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European bourses showed particular strength last week, with Italy being the
only exception to the positive tone as further political and personal
problems confronted the administration of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Asia's markets were also ebullient, with Malaysia recording the best
performance last week in local currency terms, although looking at the year
as a whole it still remains one of the worst performers in dollar terms: off
11 per cent since last December 31.
Ireland led Europe's gainers last week, with the rise explained mainly by
the 16 per cent advance in the share price of Jefferson Smurfit, the
packaging group, on mid-week news that it was acquiring the paper and
packaging unit of Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials
company. The market received further encouragement from AIB, up nearly 3 per
cent after reporting interim results slightly ahead of expectations.
According to Davy's, the Dublin-based broker, the overall market valuation
now stands at 12.1 times 1994 earnings estimates, and 10.3 times those for
1995. Given the growth in the domestic economy, Davy's expects the market to
rally further in the coming months.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Overseas buying, New York
gains lift bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A healthier start in New York gave late-closing bourses a lift, and overseas
buying also seemed to improve matters, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's winners and losers mostly reflected foreign investment interest
as the broad market ended mixed in thin trading. The Dax index closed 0.09
down at 2,184.07, easing to 2,182.32 at the end of the afternoon.
Turnover reverted to hiatus mode, DM4.7bn compared with the levels of around
DM8bn seen at the peak of the bourse's excitement in the middle of last
week. Daimler topped the active list, way ahead of the pack as it turned
over DM1bn on its own and the shares rose another DM5 to DM840.
Yesterday's other main theme was mobile telephone prospects, said Mr Eckhard
Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The companies involved, Veba, Thyssen
and Mannesmann, all made the top 10 turnover list as they rose DM5.60 to
DM533.80, DM5 to DM315 and DM0.70 to DM450.20 respectively.
Dealers associated the interest in Veba with the company's plans to link its
Swiss cable operations with those of the Swiss cable television company
Cablecom; forecasts for its first-half profits, due for release on Thursday,
were also supporting the stock. Bayernverein reckoned that group net profits
could rise by a third to DM420m.
Thyssen, meanwhile, was supported by foreign buying. In an unrelated move,
Degussa, the chemicals to gold refining group, advanced DM6.50 to DM507
after the company said it would announce its nine months' results today.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by anticipation of good results expected this week
from major international companies such as Polygram, Philips, Royal Dutch,
KLM and Reed Elsevier. The AEX index rose 1.69 to 421.36.
Philips, which climbed 60 cents to Fl 56.40, compared with a Fl 1.40 loss to
Fl 81.20 for its Polygram subsidiary, was rated a strong buy by Hoare
Govett. The broker noted that the group had been a beneficiary of the higher
dollar, an improvement in the US economy, and growth in sales. By contrast,
it rated Polygram as a 'hold', believing that good results had already been
discounted.
The day's strongest performances came from Reed Elsevier, which advanced Fl
3.30 to Fl 173.10, and Unilever, up Fl 4.10 to Fl 200.10, the lat-ter due to
report its second-quarter results at the end of the week.
PARIS could find little incentive to act as turnover shrank to under FFr2bn
and the CAC-40 index drifted down a marginal 0.73 to 2,106.34.
Corporate news was also very limited, although Carrefour, the supermarket
chain, managed a further rise of FFr14 to FFr2,096 on Friday's news of a
gain in July sales.
There was little reaction to Elf Aquitaine's gain of just under 3 per cent
in first-half sales, the shares adding 40 centimes at FFr423.40.
MILAN was subdued by the onset of the holiday season as the Comit index fell
8.21 to 695.75.
Actinvest, the independent research group, noted yesterday that the major
factor on the market's short term direction remained the uncertainty which
continued to surround the government, together with real possibility that an
early election could be called.
However, it took the view that the political situation was unlikely to
deteriorate in the next few weeks - partly as a consequence of this being
the holiday season, but also due to the fact that there was currently 'the
lack of a political alternative to Berlusconi'. This present calm would
change in September, it added, with the presentation of the 1995 budget,
which was likely to draw attention away from the half-year reporting season.
Among share movements, Generali, the insurance group, shed L150 to L41,450
and Fiat added L20 at L6,810.
ZURICH picked up after a sluggish start, and extended some of Friday's
individual share price trends. Foreign buying was reported, leaving the SMI
index 16.7 higher at 2,617.5.
Foreign interest, too, was said to be behind the SFr100 rise to SFr5,700 in
the certificates of Roche, the pharmaceuticals company, following gains on
Friday on similar considerations. Nestle went along for the ride, closing
SFr14 ahead at SFr1,192.
UBS, weakened by aspects of last Friday's results, lost a further SFr10 at
SFr1,140, recovering from an intraday low of SFr1,131.
MADRID overcame late profit-taking to close with the general index 1.48
lower at 323.48. Turnover, inflated by technical factors, was Pta38.6bn.
There was sector and individual stock selection. Construction shares
continued their recent run of strength with a rise of 2.1 per cent,
Bankinter outperformed the banking sector with a Pta100 gain to Pta12,440
and Acerinox, in stainless steel and a recent cyclical play, rose another
Pta500 to Pta14,990.
STOCKHOLM made a solid gain, although turnover was reported as being below
average. The Affarsvarlden general index added 8.1 at 1,493.5.
Esab B shares moved up SKr5 to SKr355, a year's high, as the welding
equipment manufacturer reported a bigger than expected rise in six-month
profits.
TEL AVIV reinstated Sunday's sharp technical decline, boosted by historic
moves toward peace with Jordan. The Mishtanim index rallied 4.88, or 2.6 per
cent, to 190.26 after a fall of 4.50, or 2.4 per cent, a day earlier.
Yesterday's gains followed Mr Yitzhak Rabin's visit to Jordan, the first
public visit by an Israeli prime minister, and his meeting with Jordan's
King Hussein.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firms against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday reached a six-week high against the yen, helped by
sales of the Japanese currency against the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
Market conditions, however, were fairly quiet, and in the absence of any
compelling fundamental factors to explain the dollar's relative strength,
analysts were disinclined to attribute any significance to the move.
The dollar finished in London at Y101.345, from Y100.48 on Friday, and at
DM1.5811 from DM1.5822. In New York it ended at Y101.50 and DM1.5825.
Traders reported that much of the yen selling was seen against the D-Mark,
which closed at Y64.11 against the Japanese currency, from Y63.49 on Friday.
Helped by this strength against the yen, the D-Mark was generally higher in
Europe. It finished at FFr3.424 against the French franc from FFr3.422.
The lira was fairly stable at L997.9/DM from L997.5, with the parliamentary
recess having taken the spotlight off the fragile state of Italian politics.
One currency to hold up fairly well against the D-Mark was sterling, which
finished at DM2.4380, from DM2.4389 on Friday. It was also little changed
against the dollar, at Dollars 1.542 from Dollars 1.5415.
Analysts were slightly mystified by the firmer dollar, which seems as much
to reflect a desire to sell the yen as to buy the US currency. Indeed, trade
in D-Mark/yen was reported to have been at similar levels to that in
dollar/yen. This suggests that the market was happy to sell yen, but
preferred buying the D-Mark rather than dollars.
The dollar has recovered from a post-war low of Y96.55 against the yen, and
a 20-month low against the D-Mark of DM1.5165, on July 12.
Mr Steve Barrow, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, said
Y64 against the D-Mark was a significant technical level, and breach of it
had probably prompted some short-covering by those who held long yen
positions.
Other factors supporting the dollar were the respite in US/Japan trade
tensions, albeit temporary, and less foreign interest in the Nikkei share
index.
Figures from IDEA, the financial markets consultancy, show that foreigners
were, during July, net sellers of the Nikkei index for the first time in 13
months. Previously, foreign purchases of the Nikkei had been a key reason
for yen strength, but in July foreigners sold Dollars 2.17bn of Nikkei
holdings.
The dollar has recently tracked the performance of US bonds closely. For
this reason, some analysts who are pessimistic about the short-term outlook
for bonds hold a similar view about the dollar.
This view holds that it will be difficult for bonds to stage much of a
recovery this week given the release of consumer price and producer price
figures and a Dollars 40bn quarterly Treasury refunding exercise.
Following last week's strong employment report, sentiment has also shifted
in favour of the Federal Reserve tightening policy, possibly at the August
16 FOMC meeting. Higher interest rates are normally associated with weaker
bond markets.
While US interest rate markets have been under pressure, the same, if not
more so, can be said of Japan. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at
ABN - Amro in London, noted that over the past week the December Euroyen
contract had fallen about 25 basis points to 97.35 from near to 97.6.
This weakness in Japanese interest rate markets may account for some of the
recent trend of Japanese funds to shift out of yen assets. One symptom of
this trend will be the extent to which the Japanese participate in the
quarterly refunding.
Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, commented: 'If Japanese
institutions are on the threshold of recycling Japan's current account
surplus, then dollar/yen could take off.'
UK money markets seemed to have shaken off their recent concerns about
higher UK rates. Three-month sterling LIBOR remained unchanged at 5 5/8 per
cent, while sentiment in the futures market was more positive.
Volumes were light, but the December short sterling contract finished six
basis points higher at 93.40.
The market was helped by subdued producer inflation data, with output prices
unchanged in July, and input prices increasing at an annual 2.6 per cent.
Net consumer lending, however, hit a record level in June. Analysts said
this seemingly benign combination of firm economic growth without inflation
problems was making UK assets more attractive and could explain why sterling
had been stronger recently.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 1.024bn
assistance to the UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 1bn shortage.
Overnight money traded between 2 per cent and 4 7/8 per cent.
In Germany, call money rates started the week firmer at 5/5.10 per cent from
4.85/4.95 per cent on Friday. Rates are not expected to drop much before the
weekly repo allocation tomorrow. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85
per cent.

There was an improved and more general demand, reports the Tea Brokers'
Association. Brightest east African teas were fully firm and medium
descriptions sold readily at firm to dearer rates. Plainer sorts remained
about steady. Ceylons were well supported with brighter teas often gaining
several pence. The small selection on offer met good demand at firm rates.
Quotations: best available 174p/kg, good 158p/kg, good medium 140p/kg,
medium 122p/kg, low medium 84p/kg. The highest price realised this week was
186p/kg for a Kenya pf. 1.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee sees big plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funds and speculators baled out of coffee in New York and London yesterday,
sending prices plummeting.
The late sell-off in New York was largely technical, the market falling
through previous resistance points with the same ease with which it soared
after the two Brazilian frosts in June and July.
The absence of roaster buying did not help and both markets were
anticipating Friday's publication of USDA figures on frost damage to the
1995/96 Brazilian crop, which traders expect to be less than Brazilian
government estimates.
'It's a cascading technical sell-off,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, coffee analyst
at Merrill Lynch. 'From a purely technical perspective, the close indicates
this market has topped out.'
The December position in New York closed at 184 cents a pound, down 22.50
cents, or nearly 11 per cent. Earlier in London, the November contract ended
Dollars 160 lower at Dollars 3,390 a tonne, but above the recent low of
Dollars 3,310 on July 29.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vegetable farms take root in
Guatemala - Edward Orlebar writes on a co-operative approach that has
spurred an export market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marcelino Chiroy, a 51-year-old farmer from Santiago Sacatepequez, has never
looked back from the day a Swiss aid worker persuaded him to switch from
growing maize and vegetables for the local market to growing cauliflower for
export.
He used to own 8 cuerdas, or just over an acre. There were 3 cuerdas of
maize to feed his family, and five to grow coriander, beetroot, lettuce and
maize which he would sell at the bus terminal in Guatemala City, about an
hour away.
That was more than 10 years ago. Since joining the co-operative Cuatro Pinos
in Santiago Sacatepequez, he has acquired 6 manzanas - about 5 acres -
through prudent saving, and put all five of his children through school.
Mr Chiroy, who is a Mayan Indian, still tills his 3 cuerdas of corn, the
basic diet of his culture for thousands of years. On the rest of his land he
grows broccoli, mange-tout - a type of sugar-pea - and has recently
introduced radiccio.
'I did my sums and I realised I could earn about five times as much,' he
says.
The co-operative was the brain-child of Swiss aid workers who came to
Santiago Sacatepequez, a village in the highlands west of Guatemala City,
after a devastating earthquake in 1976 killed 25,000 people, mostly in and
around the capital.
It provides technical assistance, health care, literacy teachers and cheap
credit to its members, from whom it buys export quality vegetables. The
co-operative has grown from a membership of 20 to nearly 2,000, says Mr
Esteban Saz, the deputy general manager, who was among the original members.
In its first year of exports in 1982 the co-operative sent about 100,000lbs
of mange-tous to the US. By last year exports had grown to more than 9.5m
lbs of produce: principally mange-tout, but also peas, french beans, a range
of baby vegetables, radiccio and raspberries.
About 85 per cent of exports goes to the US, air-freighted to Miami, and
about 10 per cent to Europe, mostly to the UK.
It was not difficult to persuade the apparently conservative farmers to
switch to producing vegetables for export, which they remain ambivalent
about consuming, from their traditional crops of maize and beans.
'The incentive has been watching your neighbour buy a television, or even a
pick-up,' says Mr Luis Caniz, of the chamber of non-traditional exports.
Mr Caniz believes the co-operative model has been crucial in developing the
burgeoning non-traditional agricultural sector, because it hired agronomists
to teach the farmers new techniques, provided credit and encouraged
reinvestment of profits by its members.
Many of the non-traditional export crops such as mange-tout and broccoli are
labour intensive and lend themselves to being produced by small farmers,
which has allowed Guatemala's highland Indians to be competitive, says Mr
Caniz.
He estimates that about 80,000 indigenous people in the extremely poor and
formerly war-ravaged western highlands derive their principal source of
income from export vegetables, having switched from the traditional staples.
Export revenue from vegetables has boomed in recent years from Dollars 10.3m
in 1986 to Dollars 53m in 1993.
Mange-tout cultivation is expanding at around 3,000 manzanas a year,
according to the Chamber of Exporters, and it believes vegetable exports
could double during the next 10 years.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forecast of good Indian jute
harvest offers relief to mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India, the world's biggest producer of jute, is expected to harvest a bumper
jute crop of 9m bales of 180kg each in the 1994-95 season (July to June).
This should provide some relief to the local jute mills which paid a
substantial premium over the minimum support price (MSP) for jute last year
after a sharp setback in fibre production.
A spokesman for the Indian Jute Mills Association said the realisation of a
price almost double the MSP during January to March had motivated the
farmers in all centres to commit additional land under the crop. The jute
commissioner's office says the land under jute in this season is up at least
30 per cent over 1993-94.
While the pre-monsoon showers allowed timely sowing, the good progress of
the monsoon, except in parts of Bihar and north Bengal, has led to a quick
and healthy growth of the crop.
'In most centres there is enough water in the tanks and canals for doing
proper retting of jute,' said a spokesman for the Jute Balers' Association.
The quality of Indian jute has often suffered due to improper retting
resulting from inadequate water. The crop's quality this season will be
particularly good in Assam and south Bengal.
The new season jute has started coming to the market in small quantities.
Since the market arrival of the crop will start picking up from the middle
of next month, the raw jute prices have remained firm.
TD-5, the benchmark grade, is quoting Rs700 (Dollars 22) a quintal, ready
delivery, against the MSP of Rs470 a quintal. In anticipation of a big crop,
however, the forward delivery prices are quoting around Rs600 a quintal.
In spite of the big crop, the growers hope to realise 'remunerative prices
for the fibre' throughout the season, because the year has opened with
stocks of only 800,000 bales.
The total availability of fibre is estimated at 10.1m bales, including the
likely import of 300,000 bales of high-quality fibre. The total fibre supply
last year was 9.5m bales.
Industry officials say that while the jute mills will process about 8.2m
bales, the requirement of the other sectors, including the paper mills, is
around 600,000 bales. The next season will, therefore, open with stocks of
1.3m bales, or just over two months' requirement of fibre by the jute mills.
Bangladesh, the world's largest exporter of raw jute and jute goods, is also
heading for a large crop of at least 5m bales, compared with 4.5m last year.
Bangladesh exports regularly at least 1.5m bales of jute a year.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply deficit in nickel likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nickel market is this year heading for its first supply deficit since
1990, according to the research team at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
However, the deficit - forecast to be 8,000 tonnes - will be 'only a drop in
the ocean given the sizeable surpluses (totalling 110,000 tonnes)
accumulated in the last three years'.
So nickel prices are likely to be slightly lower in the second half of 1994
despite continuing strong demand from the stainless steel industry, the
principal user of nickel.
Mr Angus MacMillan, Billiton's research manager, says nickel might ease back
to Dollars 2.63 a lb (Dollars 5,800 a tonne) compared with last night's
closing price of Dollars 2.76 a lb (Dollars 6,092.50 a tonne).
The CRU International consultancy group recently reported that 30,000 tonnes
of nickel was waiting to be shipped from the port of Dudinka in Russia and
another 10,000 tonnes was at Murmansk. Mr MacMillan says that, when this
metal arrives in the west, London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks will rise,
putting downward pressure on prices.

The large Porgera gold mine in the Enga province of Papua New Guinea, began
operating again at the weekend after an explosion last week which left 11
people missing, presumed dead. The blast occurred at the explosives
facility, a short distance from the mine.
The project is one of the largest gold mines outside South Africa and an
important revenue source for the PNG government which has a 25 per cent
interest in it. Similar stakes are held by Placer Pacific, Renison
Goldfields and Highlands Gold.
BHP Coal Australia yesterday shut down coalmining operations at Moura in
Queensland, as rescue teams tried to reach 11 people trapped underground in
an accident on Sunday night. The mine has taken a heavy toll in the past: 12
people were killed there in 1986 and 13 in 1975.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kennecott under attack over
diamond sampling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian geologists and mining analysts have strongly criticised Kennecott,
the US subsidiary of UK mining group RTZ, in the wake of disastrous sampling
results from one of the most prominent properties in the Northwest
Territories diamond rush.
The results have burst the bubble of euphoria which has enveloped the search
for diamonds across a wide swathe of northern Canada during the past two
years.
Share prices of companies involved in the stampede have crashed since
Kennecott announced last Friday that results from the highly-touted Tli Kwi
Cho kimberlite pipe were far below expectations.
Some of Kennecott's junior partners have lost more than 80 per cent of their
market value. For example, Kettle River Resources plunged to CDollars 1.99
early yesterday from CDollars 11.75 just before Friday's announcement.
Mr John Idt, analyst at Dominick and Dominick Securities in Toronto, said
yesterday the Tli Kwi Cho project was dead.
'Somebody might go back and look, but it will take a few years,' Mr Idt
said.
Kennecott owns 40 per cent of the DHK joint venture, which was rushing to
prove that Tli Kwi Cho could rival the nearby Lac de Gras area, where a
consortium comprising Australia's BHP Minerals and Dia-Met Minerals of
Canada is expected to give the go-ahead later this year for North America's
first diamond mine.
'In hindsight, Kennecott advanced the project too fast,' said Mr Chris
Jennings, president of SouthernEra Re-sources, which has a 10 per cent
interest in Tli Kwi Cho.
'The mentality of catching up to BHP and Dia-Met cost them a lot of money,
and at least a year,' said Mr Jennings. Tli Kwi Cho is about 40km south-east
of the BHP project.
Criticism centres on Kennecott's decision to go ahead with costly
underground tests on the basis of samples which weighed less than 2 tonnes
and were retrieved from about 50 narrow-diameter drill holes.
Kennecott has spent an estimated CDollars 15m (USDollars 10.9m) on the
underground programme which involved bulk samples of 5,000 tonnes.
Mr Jennings said that Kennecott had 'assumed an air of secrecy' towards
other joint-venture participants.
He alleged that the US company refused to allow its junior partners to visit
its sampling plant at Yellowknife. He also said that Kennecott failed to
carry out a promise to advise them well in advance if results failed to live
up to expectations.
Two principal kimberlite bodies were analysed from the Tli Kwi Cho pipe. The
higher-grade body was especially disappointing, with fewer than 30 per cent
of those diamonds more than 2mm in diameter classified as gem quality.
Kennecott concluded that the results were not sufficiently encouraging to
justify further bulk sampling from Tli Kwi Cho.
Mr Jennings, who has wide experience in diamond exploration, said there was
an 'outside chance' that the samples were not representative of the whole
pipe.
The joint venture is, however, now pinning its hopes for diamond exploration
on other nearby pipes.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries little changed ahead of Dollars
40bn refunding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and ANTONIA SHARPE

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON

<TEXT>
US Treasury prices were little changed across the maturity range yesterday
as dealers and investors prepared for this week's Dollars 40bn quarterly
refunding auctions.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 84
29/32 , yielding 7.532 per cent.
The two-year note was also slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield
6.192 per cent.
Trading activity was very light from the opening, with participants
reluctant to commit funds to the market ahead of the refunding round.
The auctions begin today with the sale of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes.
That will be followed by auctions of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes tomorrow
and Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds on Thursday.
Last week's strong July employment report raised fears in the bond market
that the Federal Reserve will once again raise interest rates to slow the
economy, and the talk of another monetary policy tightening has only made
dealers and investors even more cautious than usual in the planning of their
strategies for the Treasury auctions.
European government bond markets were quiet as investors focused on this
week's US refunding. In the absence of meaningful investor activity, the
market continued its debate on whether Germany would continue to cut
interest rates in the wake of buoyant economic data.
Salomon Brothers took the view that the strong German recovery could mean
that the Bundesbank would not cut rates further in this cycle, turning its
attention instead to inflation worries.
However, Kidder Peabody Securities said the Bundesbank was likely to cut
interest rates after Germany's federal elections in October.
On Liffe, the September contract of the bund future traded in a narrow range
before easing 0.34 to 93.07 in the late afternoon in meagre volume of 58,000
lots.
Dealers noted that a widening in the yield spread between UK gilts and
bunds, which reached 175 basis points on Friday, prompted some switching
from bunds to gilts. This caused the spread to tighten again to 158 basis
points.
Gilts rose on the release of weaker than forecast producer prices data for
July but, surprisingly, shrugged off a big rise in consumer credit for June.
Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg said the Bank of England was likely to
interpret the lending data as a clear indication that the economy was still
growing fast and that it would be that bit keener to raise rates soon.
In the meantime, news that the Bank was raising Pounds 700m through four
taps of existing bonds strengthened the view that it would not be holding an
auction this month.
On Liffe, the September long gilt future stood  5/16 higher at 102 5/8 in
the late afternoon in small volume of 31,200 lots.

National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), the emirate's largest commercial bank,
reported net profit after provisions of KD26.25m (Dollars 88m) for the first
six months of 1994, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
There was no comparison with the corresponding 1993 period because this is
the first year Kuwaiti banks have been required to report half-year earnings
under new central bank regulations. However, the result is in line with 1993
full-year profits of KD52m.
The group's total assets rose to KD3.535bn as of June 30 1994 from KD3.267bn
at the end of calendar 1993. The loan portfolio grew to KD1.153bn from
KD1.086bn.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Syndicated loan for Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatile conditions in the bond markets, its traditional funding source,
have prompted the Kingdom of Spain to return to the syndicated loans market
to secure standby liquidity.
Its new Ecu6bn five-year revolving credit facility, which is being arranged
by Chemical Bank, comes one year after NatWest Capital Markets put in place
a Ecu5bn three-year facility. About one-third of the latter has been drawn
down.
Banks are keen to lend to Spain, which has a double-A credit rating and a
zero-risk weighting, but some in the syndicated loans market have decided
not to participate in the multi-currency deal because ofthe terms.
Their criticism is levelled mainly at the large underwriting commitments:
Ecu750m for senior lead managers and Ecu500m for lead managers. These levels
pose problems for banks at or close to their country limit as a result of
underwriting last year's loan.
Their feathers have also been ruffled by Chemical's decision to invite
around 25 banks and to publish the terms before the deal is underwritten.
This more open strategy runs counter to the practice of not disclosing terms
until a small underwriting group has been formed.
They add that Chemical is breaking the market practice of reducing
underwriters' commitments on a pro-rata basis if a deal is oversubscribed.
Chemical's Ecu1.65bn commitment will be reduced to Ecu800m before
commitments taken on by other senior lead managers are reduced.
Chemical confirmed there had been some declines but said three banks had
already committed at the higher level. 'The strategy has been put in place
to get the best results and to bring the banks as close as possible to their
desired targets,' said an official. In the case of senior lead managers,
this was Ecu375m, and Ecu250m for lead managers.
Spain will pay an annual interest rate of Libor plus 4.5 basis points and a
facility fee of 4.25 basis points. Underwriting fees for senior lead
managers are 2.5 basis points and lead managers 2 basis points.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goldstar merger meets opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Goldstar, South Korea's second largest electronics company,
are opposing plans for its merger with loss-making Goldstar
Telecommunications, a sister subsidiary of the Lucky-Goldstar group.
'It's one of the first times that institutional shareholders have complained
about a corporate merger in Korea,' said Mr Andrew Holland, head of research
at BZW Securities in Seoul.
Corporate mergers are usually non-controversial affairs in Korea because of
the close cross-holdings arrangements among subsidiaries of the country's
main conglomerates and the normally passive role of shareholders.
Goldstar said the merger, which will occur at the beginning of 1995, will
strengthen efforts to enter the multimedia business.
Shareholder objections focus on two areas. One is that the merger terms,
under which 10 common shares of Goldstar Telecommunications will be traded
for four Goldstar common shares, are too generous considering the
telecommunications company's large debt/equity ratio of 1,768 per cent.
The other complaint is that the merger threatens to slow down what has been
a rapid rise in profit growth for Goldstar during the past 18 months.
Goldstar reported net profits of Won65.6bn (Dollars 81.7m) last year and
Won79.2bn for the first half of 1994.
In contrast, Goldstar Telecommunications had a loss of Won23.7bn last year
and an estimated loss of Won10bn for the first half of 1994.
The losses result from interest payments on its debt of Won418bn and
price-cutting in the heavily-competitive area of telephone equipment, which
is the main business of Goldstar Telecommunications.
Analysts believe Goldstar shareholders will not be able to stop the merger
but may demand that the company repurchase their shares, which could
increase pressure on Goldstar profits. The merger must be approved at a
shareholders' meeting on September 29. The largest shareholder in Goldstar
is Lucky, the group's petrochemical unit, with a 6 per cent share.

Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank, has had its application
for a UK banking licence approved. As a result, the bank said that it was
formally converting its London office to UK branch status from yesterday.
The bank, which is owned by more than 40 institutions, with the UK's Hill
Samuel holding the largest single stake, has been putting increased emphasis
on international expansion recently.
London is its largest centre outside Australia, and Mr Allan Moss, managing
director, said yesterday that the current aim was to develop a 'more diverse
European client base in centres including Spain, Italy, Denmark, Finland and
Norway' - countries where Macquarie has had a limited presence.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Landesbank taps dragon sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market saw a sprinkling of new deals yesterday, but amid the
ongoing summer lull, issuance is expected to remain slow this week.
Germany's Landesbank Rheinland Pfalz tapped the dragon bond market for
Dollars 300m of three-year bonds via joint leads Goldman Sachs and Lehman
Brothers.
The bonds were deemed adequately priced, yielding 24 basis points over the
when-issued US Treasury note at their 99.592 re-offer price.
One of the lead managers said he placed some 95 per cent of his Dollars 110m
allotment among eastern Asian investors. 'We saw good demand from that
region, following the borrower's extensive roadshow in July,' he said.
The lira sector saw L150bn of 10.6 per cent four-year bonds for WestLB
Europe which attracted some buying by investors in the Benelux region,
Germany and Switzerland, according to an official at one of the joint leads.
The deal was lead-managed by SBC and WestLB.
Despite the recent political upheavals in Italy which caused turmoil in
currency and bond markets, investors are more positive on the prospect of
convergence by high-yielding bonds, he said. Moreover, they are attracted by
the high coupons these markets now offer.
Amid the cautious comeback by emerging market borrowers, the Argentine
electricity distributor Empresa Distribuidora Sur - or Endesa - issued
Dollars 50m of three-year floating-rate notes via Bear Stearns. The bonds
pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 400 basis points, which was seen to
be a level which would generate investor interest.
The deal, which is targeted at European and US investors, had been widely
pre-marketed and met with good interest, helped by the SEC's Rule 144a,
which allows placement among US institutional investors, said the lead
manager.
Although emerging markets remain clouded by expectations of a further
interest rate rise in the US, sentiment has been buoyed in recent weeks by
growing optimism over the outcome of the Mexican elections and the region's
promising economic fundamentals.

May Department Stores, the biggest US department store group, said
First-half sales and earnings reached record highs and outlined plans for
significant increases in the number of stores operated.
Second-quarter net income rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 130m from Dollars
117m on turnover 6.5 per cent up at Dollars 2.62bn.
Fully-diluted earnings per share were 49 cents, an increase of 11 per cent
from the 44 cents a year earlier.
For the six months to July, turnover was up 9 per cent at Dollars 5.15bn
while net income was 13 per cent higher at Dollars 242m. Fully-diluted
earnings per share were ahead by 14 per cent, at 90 cents.
May Department Stores operates 302 department stores and 3,869 Payless
ShoeSource stores.
At its annual meeting earlier this year, it announced plans to open 110
department stores, 1,200 Payless ShoeSource stores and 1,000 Payless Kids
stores over the next five years, at a cost of Dollars 4bn.
At the end of last month it significantly expanded its shoe retailing
operation by buying all 679 shoe stores owned by Kobacker and The Shoe
Works, two related companies based in Columbus, Ohio.
Yesterday May said it had opened a Famous-Barr department store in Jamestown
Mall, St Louis, during the quarter, and that another 14 department stores
would open by the year end: five Lord &amp; Taylor, four Filene's, two Foley's,
one Hecht's, one Robinsons-May, and one Famous-Barr.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charge of Dollars 485m puts Sara
Lee into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sara Lee, the international food and personal products company, suffered a
net fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 309m, or 65 cents a share. This was after
a previously-announced Dollars 495m restructuring charge to trim costs in
its hosiery division.
In last year's fourth quarter the company earned Dollars 109m, or 38 cents a
share.
Sales for the quarter rose 5.6 per cent, to Dollars 4.1bn, from Dollars
3.9bn in same period last year.
In spite of the higher sales, the company said that even without the
restructuring charges, its fourth-quarter results would have been flat
compared with last year.
For the year, excluding all extraordinary items, the group reported income
of Dollars 729m, or Dollars 1.47 a share, on sales of Dollars 15.5bn. This
compared with Dollars 704m, or Dollars 1.37, on sales of Dollars 14.6bn in
fiscal 1993.
Commenting on the results, Mr John Bryan, Sara Lee's chairman, said profit
growth suffered from weak results in the company's personal products
division, particularly in hosiery and knit operations in Europe.
However, the company's other three lines of business, notably packaged meats
and bakery items, and household and personal care products enjoyed profit
growth.
Mr Bryan said growth in those businesses, combined with the extensive
cost-cutting announced for the troubled hosiery operations, should boost
earnings in 1995.
Although Sara Lee historically is viewed as a rapid-growth company, Wall
Street took the flat results in its stride, with the shares closing Dollars
 3/8 higher at Dollars 20 7/8 in New York yesterday.

Hawker Siddeley Canada, now independent from BTR, the UK industrial
conglomerate, posted a second-quarter loss of CDollars 9.2m (USDollars
6.66m), or CDollars 1.15 a share, because of continuing problems and special
charges at its restructured saw mill equipment unit.
The loss compared with a profit of CDollars 5.5m, or 65 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales were CDollars 81m, against CDollars 88m.
The latest figures brought the first-half deficit amounted to CDollars
12.1m, or CDollars 1.53, compared with profits of CDollars 8.6m, or CDollars
1, last year, on sales of CDollars 159m against CDollars 173m.
BTR sold its 59 per cent stake in the company earlier this year.
Hawker Canada is now concentrating on its profitable railcar leasing
business, jet engine overhaul and mining and sawmill machinery.
Mr Keith Moore, president, said costs at the saw mill equipment unit were
coming under control and sales prospects were improving.
However, some other markets declined in the first half, including mining
equipment in the UK and military engine overhaul in Canada.
The foundry unit improved volume but was still unprofitable.
Hawker would show a loss for 1994, said Mr Moore, but 'we're well on the way
to repositioning the company for the long term'.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Australia Air loses fight for
China route rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rights to fly between Australia and China were finally lost yesterday by
Australia Air, the would-be international airline, when Australia's
International Air Services Commission revoked last year's route authority
decision.
The move follows a year-long struggle by Australia Air to find the necessary
financial backing which would allow it to take to the skies.
Although yesterday's decision did not come as a surprise, it is a blow for
the Australian government's efforts to deregulate the international aviation
scene and do away with Qantas' long-standing monopoly in this area.
Australia Air was the only potential new carrier to emerge as a result of
the new liberalised policy.
The only other beneficiary has been Ansett, which shares the national market
with Qantas and which has been awarded some international authorities.
Ansett, however, has been extremely cautious about using these.
The IASC said it was 'in the public interest' to revoke the decision to give
the China rights to Australia Air. Other airlines will now be able to apply
for the route authority in due course.
Australia Air won the rights in March 1993, and initially hoped to get a
weekly service linking Beijing and Sydney up and running by late-1993.
Superficially, this looked a feasible scheme, since only one rival carrier -
Air China - flew directly between the two countries and business/tourism
links are growing.
However, Australia Air ran into a lengthy spat with Qantas - which had flown
the route in the 1980s - over which was the 'designated' carrier under the
Sino-Australian air services agreement.
Australia Air's efforts to raise the ADollars 55m (USDollars 40.4m) demanded
by the IASC before it could start operating also proved unsuccessful. It
asked for a number of extensions from the IASC, which were granted, but
yesterday the authorities finally called a halt.

<TEXT>
A year after withdrawing from the market for notebook personal computers,
Dell Computer has introduced new products with which it aims to make a
comeback in the fastest growing segment of the PC market.
The products are critical to the future of Dell, which has been struggling
to keep pace with larger competitors in the PC business.
Last year, the company was forced to pull out of the notebook sector when
quality problems emerged in its products.
In a significant change of strategy, Dell put together an in-house design
team, headed by a former Apple Computer executive.
The first results of these efforts, unveiled yesterday, are two lines of
notebook computers that look remarkably like Apple's popular Powerbook
models.
The new Dell notebooks offer longer battery life than most competing
products and are aggressively priced. By using new lithium-ion battery
technology, Dell's top-of-the-line Latitude XP, which is designed for
corporate users with a starting price of Dollars 3,199, can work for six to
eight hours before recharging, rather than three to five hours with
conventional batteries.
A lower-priced product line, available only in the US at present, will start
at Dollars 1,399.
The basic Latitude uses conventional notebook-computer batteries but allows
users to pull out the floppy disk drive and substitute a second battery,

Dell has an opportunity to make a comeback in the notebook market because
leading suppliers, such as Compaq and IBM, are unable to keep up with
demand, analysts said.
However, Dell's re-entry may be hampered by the company's recent withdrawal
from retail sales channels. It now sells only via mail and telephone orders.

Two of Singapore's biggest banks have reported profits reflecting the island
republic's buoyant economy and the territory's growth as a financial
services centre.
Pre-tax profits at United Overseas Bank (UOB) for the six months ended June
30 rose 34 per to SDollars 411m (USDollars 273m).
Net profit jumped 32 per cent to SDollars 292m while per-share earnings rose
31 per cent to 40.2 Singapore cents from 30.7 cents in the equivalent
previous period.
UOB said net interest income increased by 26 per cent to SDollars 430m.
Income on fees and commissions jumped 36 per cent to SDollars 136m.
In the six-month period, pre-tax profits at Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp
(OCBC) rose 26 per cent to SDollars 330m while net profit increased by 28
per cent to SDollars 231m.
Net interest income grew 24 per cent to SDollars 528m over the six month
period while fees and commissions income rose 42 per cent to SDollars 109m.
Earnings per share increased by 43 per cent to 30 Singapore cents from 21
cents in the previous equivalent period.
OCBC said it had made an extraordinary profit from the sale of a portion of
its shares in Singapore Press Holdings, the island republic's biggest
publisher.

Myer

Coles Myer, the large Australian retailer which is currently trying to
arrange the buy-back of a 21.45 per cent stake in itself from Kmart of the
US, saw annual sales rise by 5 cent last year, to ADollars 15.92bn
(USDollars 11.7bn).
The unexciting overall result, however, contained a 10.4 per cent gain in
the final quarter - although this figure partly reflected the benefit of an
extra trading week (14 weeks in 1994 compared with 13 in the previous year).
The group result was also held back by flat sales at the Myer Grace Brothers
department store division.

<TEXT>
Biomaterial, a bio-technology company based in western Japan, plans to list
on Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter stock market.
It will be the first Japanese company to bypass the domestic stock market
for a listing on an overseas stock exchange. The move will increase anxiety
among Japanese financial authorities over the 'hollowing out' of the
country's capital markets.
The company, backed by the government's venture capital programme,
maintained that Japan's listing requirements were too stringent for start-up
companies and it was seeking a wider investor base in the US.
Biomaterial, which develops and produces stabiliser equipment for
anti-pollution bacteria, said listing on the domestic over-the-counter
exchange was impossible for high-growth companies, since corporations are
required to post Y10 or more in earnings per share and to have net assets of
Y200m or more.
The company, which was established in 1992 and expects pre-tax losses of
Y220m (Dollars 1.99m) this business year, plans to start providing
information to US investors next month, for a listing on Nasdaq in 1996.
Industry analysts say other small companies are likely to follow suit, since
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is encouraging the
diversification of funding options among start-up companies.
The move comes as criticism of Japan's over-regulated financial markets is
heightening.
Due to high capital gains tax, domestic investors are trading Japanese
stocks on overseas stock exchanges.
The rise in demand for Japanese stocks among leading US, European and Asian
investors has provided further incentive for Japanese companies to seek
funds abroad.
Government officials are also concerned at the possible deterioration of
Japan's status as a financial centre.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which has been facing a sharp decline in listings
of overseas companies, is looking at ways to stop the outflow and increase
new company listings, while Japan's Ministry of Finance said it was about to
launch a study of the outflow of activity from the Tokyo market.

<TEXT>
Singapore's Sembawang Corporation, one of the island republic's biggest
companies whose activities are mainly centred on the shipbuilding and repair
business, has reported flat earnings for the first six months, reflecting
continued lacklustre performance in the worldwide shipping industry.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 improved by 0.4 per cent to
SDollars 63.6m (USDollars 42m) though turnover was up by 42 per cent to
SDollars 502m from SDollars 359m previously. Earnings per share declined 9
per cent to 18.9 Singapore cents.
Sembawang has been making efforts to diversify operations out of Singapore
in recent years, though profits from these ventures are not likely to flow
through for some time.
Late last year a unit of the group signed a joint venture contract with the
authorities in Zhejiang province in China to develop a SDollars 1.9bn power
plant. Sembawang said the plant would be the first of a series it would help
develop in China.
Projects that Sembawang is currently involved in include a SDollars 350m
contract for an offshore drilling and production facility in Indonesia and a
SDollars 200m contract to convert a Netherlands-owned bulk carrier into the
world's largest pipe-laying vessel.
Sembawang said that its latest results included a SDollars 23.6m gain from
the disposal of some long-term investments. It said the group expected to
maintain its present performance in the second half of the year.

Holvis, the troubled Swiss nonwoven fabric and distribution group, suffered
a SFr4.5m (Dollars 3.4m) net loss in the first half, compared with a
SFr19.6m profit in the same period of last year. It has reduced its
operating profit forecast for 1994 from SFr32m to SFr20m.
Turnover was down 11.6 per cent, mainly as a result of the sale last year of
the speciality papermaking business.
The group has been hurt by price pressure in the traditional markets for
non-wovens and diapers, and is having problems with volume production of
higher value fabrics for the medical market.
Operating profit in the non-woven division fell 35 per cent in the first
half to SFr7.7m, dragging down group operating profit 41 per cent to
SFr12.3m.

profit

<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation, the Australian mining group, yesterday forecast
that its after-tax profit on an equity basis and after abnormal items would
be about ADollars 125m (USDollars 92.7m) for the year to the end of June. On
a consolidated basis, the figure would be ADollars 132m.
In 1993-94, WMC - one of the country's largest mining companies - saw group
equity profit before abnormal items reach ADollars 165.9m.
However, it incurred a ADollars 113.3m abnormal charge, reflecting a mixture
of additional amortisation for assets, a writedown in the value of some
assets and some heavy legal costs.
WMC made the forecast in a prospectus, lodged with the Australian Securities
Commission yesterday, for its ADollars 720m rights issue. The company
announced the cash-call last month in the context of a plan to buy into the
international bauxite and alumina-related interests of Alcoa, the US group.
The deal is complex, but essentially WMC would reduce its stake in Alcoa of
Australia to 39.25 per cent from 48.25 per cent, by passing a 9 per cent
interest to Alcoa of the US. (Alcoa, the US parent, currently owns 51 per
cent.)
WMC then proposes to pay an additional cash sum to Alcoa of the US, for a
similar 40 per cent in the remaining assets (with the US company holding the
remaining 60 per cent). Originally, the cash amount was put at USDollars
360m; yesterday, WMC said that it was more likely to be USDollars 348.5m and
could be as low as USDollars 296m, depending upon which - if any - of
Alcoa's Brazilian assets were included in the package.
WMC added that the Alcoa deal should have 'minimal impact on WMC's equity
profit after tax in 1994-5', although it reconfirmed that earnings per share
for that year would be diluted. In years ahead, the transaction should
'enhance growth prospects'.

Charoen Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the listed agro-industrial arm of the
multinational CP group of Thailand, yesterday announced a 39 per cent rise
in first-half net profit to Bt684.5m (Dollars 27.3m) from Bt493.1m in the
same period of 1993.
Net profit in the second quarter, however, rose only 11 per cent to Bt375.8m
from Bt337.5m. Further financial details have yet to be released.
Prawn feed accounts for two-thirds of CPF's revenues, and the improved
profits are partly attributable the continued strength of the Thai prawn
farming industry.
Thailand is the world's largest prawn exporter, and prices have been boosted
by a fall in Chinese production caused by outbreaks of disease.
Yesterday Trang Seafood Products, one of Thailand's listed seafood
exporters, reported a 96 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Bt52.8m
from Bt26.9m a year earlier.
CPF's first-half profit increase is also a reflection of the company's
relatively poor performance in early 1993, when chicken prices fell sharply.
Poultry raising and feed account for a substantial share of business.
Chicken prices have improved since then, although Thai poultry exports are
still facing stiff competition from low-cost producers in China, Brazil and
elsewhere.
CPF has majority stakes in Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products and Charoen
Pokphand Northeastern, as well as 5 per cent of TelecomAsia, which has a
concession to install 2m telephone lines in Bangkok.

<TEXT>
The hotels division of Ciga of Italy continued to improve its operating
result in the first seven months of this year.
But the luxury hotels group, which is now in effect controlled by ITT
Sheraton, the US conglomerate, will still be forced to announce a loss for
the first half because of heavy financial charges.
Ciga yesterday published figures which show that occupancy rates at its 34
hotels increased by 9.2 percentage points in the first seven months of this
year, to 59.4 per cent.
The hotels' turnover increased by 11.7 per cent to L295bn (Dollars 187m),
compared with L264bn in the first equivalent period last year.
Under the control of Fimpar, the holding company of the Aga Khan, Ciga's
debts and losses mounted, and earlier this year first Forte, the UK hotels
group, and then ITT Sheraton launched bids for control.
ITT's initial strategy failed when a deliberately overpriced rights issue -
supposed to deliver Ciga to the US group - was fully subscribed, raising
more than L1bn to help reduce the Italian company's borrowings.
But ITT has still managed to build a stake in Ciga of more than 20 per cent,
and three of the seven-strong board are ITT appointees.
Italy's stock market watchdog decided at the end of last month that ITT
should mount a formal bid for further Ciga shares as it had gained control
of the company, but the authority has yet to specify the terms or scope of
such an offer.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank privatised earlier this year,
is to launch its L2,362bn discounted issue of shares and warrants on August
18, and the offer will close on September 16.
The new shares will be priced at L3,000 and offered on the basis of one new
share for every two held, the bank said.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charter stands by bid for Esab
after shares rise
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, said yesterday it stood by its bid for
Esab, in spite of a further rise in the Swedish welding group's shares above
the offer price following a sharp upgrade in the company's profits forecast.
Esab shares rose to SKr355, SKr10 ahead of Charter's Pounds 260m (Dollars
400m) recommended June bid, after it announced a surge in half-year profits
after financial items to SKr195m (Dollars 25.19m), compared with SKr23m in
the same period last year.
The Gothenburg-based group, the world's largest supplier of welding
equipment, added that it expected full-year profits of about SKr390m, well
ahead of its previous forecast of SKr320m. It said income targets set for
the coming few years would be reached earlier than expected.
The results fuelled speculation in Stockholm that Charter, which already
holds 53 per cent of Esab, might fail in its target of capturing 90 per cent
by the deadline of this Friday. Several Swedish institutions that hold the
bulk of the outstanding shares have yet to make up their minds and have made
clear they are closely examining claims that the Charter bid undervalues
Esab.
But Mr Charles Parker, Charter commercial director, said yesterday that the
UK company regarded the latest rise in Esab's share price as a blatant
attempt to force it into increasing the bid price. He said the fundamental
assessments which led to the offer at SKr345 - at the time a 20 per cent
premium - had not changed. 'The offer stands as it is,' he said.
Esab attributed the dramatic turnround to a cost-cutting programme which
during the past two years has seen the workforce fall by some 1,700 to just
over 7,000 at the end of June.
Group sales in the first six months rose to SKr3.74bn from SKr3.38bn as
demand in Esab's main markets in Europe remained slack. Operating profits
after depreciation grew to SKr222m from SKr93m. Return on capital in the
year to June was 13.7 per cent, compared with 9.1 per cent in 1993.
Mr Lars Westerberg, chief executive, said he expected that sales growth
would continue, sustaining profits growth.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Unwrapping an east European
strategy - German deals have given Mercer a foothold in the paper industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Treuhand privatisation agency recently sold an eastern German
printing plant to Mercer International, a Vancouver-based public company, it
completed the privatisation of the region's pulp and paper mills.
But for Mercer, the acquisition of Zellstoff und Papierfabrik Rosenthal, in
the eastern state of Thuringia, could mark the beginning of the
transformation of a company which until a year ago had neither a foothold in
Europe nor an interest in the paper industry.
'In some ways, the transformation of our company is linked to the
transformation of the east German economy,' said Mr Jimmy Lee, Mercer
chairman.
Mercer, founded in 1985, had specialised in US real estate and financial
services and had an interest in Nalcap, whose principal asset was its
royalty interest in the Wabush Lake iron ore mine in Newfoundland. By 1993
Mercer had revenues of USDollars 112m.
But Mr Lee was impatient. 'Our whole philosophy is to look for undervalued
situations. We look for messy problems. I saw what was happening in eastern
Germany.'
Mercer's first acquisition from the Treuhand was Specialreinigung Meissen, a
small industrial cleaning company in the eastern state of Saxony. It paid
Dollars 500,000 for the plant. 'This was a kind of test case for us. We knew
there would be plenty of contracts in this line of business in east
Germany,' said Mr Lee.
Mercer was committed to guaranteeing 40 jobs and investing DM300,000
(Dollars 191,000). 'All the capital investments have now been carried out,'
said Mr Lee, a 37-year-old who has maintained close contacts with his
business connections in South Korea, where he was born.
According to Mr Stephen Weinress, of Friend, Weinress and Frankson, a
California-based investment banker, Specialreinigung is expected to generate
annual revenues of between Dollars 15m and Dollars 20m.
Soon after the acquisition - and advised by, among others, Shin-Ho, one of
South Korea's largest paper groups which last year had a turnover of nearly
Dollars 1bn - Mercer started looking at the paper industry in east Germany.
But by 1992, there was overcapacity both in Europe and North America and
prices started to fall sharply.
This make life difficult for the Treuhand; it had been negotiating with a
French company to sell off Dresden Papier, eastern Germany's largest paper
mills which before unification had a workforce of 30,800 and 126 plants. By
early 1993, the deal with the French had collapsed. The Treuhand was
desperate to find a buyer. Dresden Papier approached Mercer.
'We were sure the paper industry would turn eventually. And in any case,
because of Germany's strict environmental laws which require companies to
recycle at least 50 per cent of their waste products, we believed we would
have a wide market. We also had the advantage that the Treuhand was seeking
a quick deal.'
When the Treuhand took over Dresden Papier, based in Saxony, centre of the
German printing and publishing world before the second world war, the
company was in poor shape. The Russian market, which accounted for most of
Dresden Papier's greaseproof paper sales, had collapsed and losses exceeded
DM60m. To prepare it for privatisation, the Treuhand invested DM100m -
primarily in new equipment, including de-inking facilities.
The Treuhand drew up a generous contract with Mercer. The agency agreed to
pick up DM45m estimated losses for 1993, provide an additional DM30m for
losses during 1994 and 1995 and cover redundancy costs. It also agreed to
contribute to 90 per cent of the DM10m environmental liabilities while
Mercer received investment grants worth 32 per cent of the total DM75m which
Mercer had committed to invest.
'We paid DM1m for Dresden Papier, and injected DM20m as a sign of good
faith. We also agreed to guarantee 490 jobs,' said Mr Lee. A year after the
deal was completed, Mercer acquired the Rosenthal plant in Thuringia, with
similar favourable terms.
The question is what kind of strategy does Mercer want to pursue in Germany.
Ms Frances Campion, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Asset Management in London,
believes Mercer's move to Europe represents 'an interesting investment. It
will give them exposure not only in east Germany, but in the European paper
industry.'
Mr Weinress, who has followed Mercer closely, says the company 'wants to be
a leader in the European recycled speciality paper market, but it still
lacks credibility in the US. . . it should move out of Vancouver if it wants
to be taken seriously by investors and the US market.'
With Shin-Ho as a partner, Mercer believes it can use the Rosenthal plant,
one of the most modern pulp enterprises in eastern Germany, to recycle 80
per cent of its raw material consisting of waste, something of which
Germany's environmental lobby would approve.
It will be able also to integrate its three acquisitions and capture not
only the local market but expand into western Germany.
'We are now one of the principal users of waste in Dresden. Dresden Papier
is running at full capacity - 235,000 tonnes. We expect a turnover of
Dollars 95m this year, there's no reason why we cannot keep costs down.'
Already, 90 per cent of Dresden Papier's products, which include high-grade,
recycled writing and printing papers, are sold to the west German market.
Its wallpaper sales account for 18 per cent of the total German market. In
addition, now that Russian capital, which flowed out of Russia during the
early 1990s, is slowly returning to the country, Dresden Papier is again
selling greaseproof paper to the Russians.
But consistent with his philosophy, Mr Lee is not prepared to sit back.
Eastern Europe beckons. 'Our staff at Dresden Papier have an excellent
knowledge of printing operations as well as contacts in eastern Europe. The
east Europeans used to be trained in Saxony. We have big advantages. We are
interested in looking at Hungary and the Czech Republic. And Saxony is so
close to these countries,' said Mr Lee.
Mr Weinress believes that Mercer's presence in Germany will give it a better
focus as well as give it foothold in the middle of Europe.
'But if Mercer wants to get that respectability it lacks, it should think
about getting listed on the New York Stock Exchange,' he adds.

FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Wallenberg increases its stake
in SE-Banken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Wallenberg group has sharply tightened its grip on Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the country's largest commercial bank, after buying nearly
20m A shares worth almost SKr1bn (Dollars 129m) in the first half of the
year.
The buying, carried out by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, has
lifted Wallenberg ownership of the bank to more than 11 per cent from 8 per
cent.
It bolsters the influence of Sweden's leading industrial dynasty over what
is already considered to be the 'family' bank.
The foundation has overtaken the investment group Custos to become the
largest single shareholder in SE-Banken. It holds 47.3m A shares and 1.36m C
shares for a 9.2 per cent stake, according to statistics compiled by DN
Agareservice, a share monitoring service.
At the end of last year the foundation held 27.8m A shares and 1.28m C
shares, equivalent to 5.5 per cent of the capital. Other Wallenberg
interests, including Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company, hold 2
per cent of the shares.
SE-Banken's recent decision to scrap a rule preventing shareholders from
voting for more than 2 per cent of its shares has enhanced the Wallenberg
influence.
Today the group accounts for 11.4 per cent of the bank's votes, based on a
system which accords each A share one vote and each C share one-tenth of a
vote.
Mr Jan Nilsson, managing director of the foundation, said it had decided to
increase its stake in the bank because it believed it would get a good
return for its investment.
He also noted that the foundation had been fairly liquid since it sold its
shareholding in Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group, to Investor in
1991.
Strong links have existed between SE-Banken and the Wallenbergs ever since
the bank was formed from the merger of Stockholms Enskilda Bank, the
Wallenberg family bank, with Skandinaviska Banken in 1972.
Mr Bjo Svedberg, SE-Banken chief executive, is a central figure in the
Wallenberg family empire and Mr Peter Wallenberg, dynasty patriarch, is
first vice-chairman of the board.

black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millicom International Cellular, the Luxembourg-based international cellular
communications company listed on Nasdaq, reported pre-tax profit of Dollars
28.2m for the six months to June 30.
The profit was due to the sale of the company's Chilean cellular operation
for Dollars 37m.
Excluding extraordinary gains, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars
5.7m, a 70 per cent reduction on a net loss before extraordinary gains of
Dollars 19.3m for the same period in 1993.
Revenue was Dollars 34.3m, 56 per cent up on the Dollars 22m in the same
period in 1993.
Most of the company's 22 operations, in 16 countries, are recent start-ups,
and it is expecting to bid for new cellular licences in emerging market
countries, particularly in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The number of subscribers rose by 40 per cent in the six months to 85,214.
The company's most profitable operations were in Moscow, Sri Lanka, the
Philippines and Guatemala.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Woolwich edges ahead in competitive market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The competitive pressures in the UK mortgage market were yesterday
illustrated when Woolwich, the third largest UK building society, reported a
1.5 per cent improvement in first half operating profits from Pounds 161m to
Pounds 163m.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 133m (Pounds 87.9m) as provisions for bad and
doubtful debts fell to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 72.7m). The society's general
reserve rose to Pounds 1.33bn (Pounds 1.16bn), and gross capital rose to
Pounds 1.71bn (Pounds 1.46bn).
Net interest income rose only slightly to Pounds 249m (Pounds 241m) while
income from other sources rose to Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 75.3m). Operating
profits were reduced by a rise in administrative expenses to Pounds 166m
(Pounds 156m).
Mr Donald Kirkham, the society's chief executive, said it had built on the
good results of last year 'nothwithstanding difficult market conditions'. He
said that the mortgage market had been characterised by 'intense
competition'.
Mr Kirkham said the trading outlook was good, with a steady recovery in the
housing market. He predicted that house prices would rise by 3 per cent
during the year, while housing transactions would grow by some 6 to 7 per
cent.
The society's total mortgage lending dropped to Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn),
and net retail receipts fell to just Pounds 22m (Pounds 389m). The society
said that both mortgage and savings markets had been 'far more
price-competitive than expected'.
The gross ratio of capital to assets grew by 0.4 percentage points to 7.4
per cent, while the solvency ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose
to 13.1 per cent (13.7 per cent).

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Weir's selective strategy pays off -
Tackling Asia's tigers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Britain's engineering companies emerge from recession, the short-term
domestic outlook looks reasonably bright. But for many, prospects for
sustained long-term growth lie beyond the mature markets of the UK,
continental Europe and North America. Returns will be higher in the
fast-growing developing and industrialising economies of Asia - China, the
Asian 'tigers' and countries still only on the edge of the commercial map
such as Vietnam and Burma. In the first of a summer series, Andrew Baxter
looks at how UK engineering companies are gearing up for this growth and
talks to some of their top executives working in the region.
Along with all UK engineering company executives in Asia, Mr Gerry Malley
believes there are tremendous opportunities across the region. 'Asia is
bubbling over,' he says. But, as one would expect from the general manager
(Asia) of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering products
company, Mr Malley is not letting euphoria go to his head.
'We made a decision early on to do the hard things,' he says. 'We are very
selective in what we bid for and will not be all things to all men; there
are some areas where we can't compete.'
Rather than try and sell what Mr Malley calls 'bread-and-butter stuff', Weir
is going for the high-tech-nology markets, where the products are not made
in Asia.
Mr Malley, who has been based in Asia for 11 years, says he is 'still amazed
at the ignorance of people' trying to exploit opportunities in the region.
'There are huge differences between countries and within countries. With
China, for example, you have to look at every province differently. But some
companies don't focus on an initial target - they just spill around Asia
without identifying opportunities.'
The selective strategy is already paying dividends for Weir. A strong export
performance in the Pacific Rim was one of the bright spots for the group
last year, when pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 37.5m
overall; Weir Pumps won orders for pumps and related equipment from power
stations at Zouxian in China, Budge Budge in Calcutta, and the Ulchin
nuclear power plants in South Korea, while Hopkinsons, Weir Group's valve
company, benefited from Weir Pumps' success and also won contracts in its
own right for power stations including Shajiao in China and Taean in South
Korea.
This year there have been further contracts worth at least Pounds 10m from
the power generation industry in the region for Hopkinsons, Weir Pumps and
recently-acquired Darchem Engineering, which is supplying insulation systems
to a Hong Kong power station. Weir says India and east Asia should continue
to offer the most promising long-term opportunities in the power market
because of the shortage of generating capacity and the rapid growth in
economies.
Outside power, Weir's biggest coup this year was through Strachan &amp; Henshaw,
which won a Pounds 5m contract in China to supply two rail car dumper
systems for the Qinhuangdao coal export terminal.
Weir is well used to competition, and Mr Malley says it is giving a good
account of itself in Asia even if margins are hard-pressed.
'European competitors tend to be patchy, as we all are here,' he says. 'The
US are strong in Taiwan and the Philippines but are not making an impact
relative to their size, and the Japanese are being strangled by the yen.
We've seen a lot less of them in the region over the last four to five
years.'
There is room for Weir to expand, he says. The Asia/Pacific region,
excluding India, accounted for 15 per cent of Weir's sales last year, and Mr
Malley sees no reason why it should not be 25 per cent in three to five
years.
To achieve this, a number of changes have been made. Mr Malley, formerly
with Weir Pumps, has been given group responsibility for the region
stretching from Sri Lanka to New Zealand. He hopes to use Weir Pumps'
experience to help other parts of the group generate more sales, but without
reducing their independence. Weir Pumps comprise 70 per cent of sales in the
region, but a better balance between pumps and other products is achievable,
he says.
Mr Malley's role should also help the group win more contract 'packages'
involving more than one business - for example, pumps and valves.
Allied to this is a stronger presence on the ground. The valves business
will soon have its own local sales manager based, like Mr Malley, in Hong
Kong and focusing on China and Korea. Strachan &amp; Henshaw appointed its own
sales manager in May, also based in Hong Kong. A Singapore office was
reopened last year after a gap of a decade. The regional base will remain in
Hong Kong, but Mr Malley says he is 'looking back' at the opportunities in
south-east Asia. 'People like to have you on the doorstep,' he says.
Weir is bidding to supply pumps, valves and bulk-handling equipment for the
planned Tuas power station in Singapore, and Mr Malley sees further
opportunities in the water and sewage sector as the island state upgrades
its housing.
Indonesia represents a very large market opportunity, he says, and he
remains hopeful about Malaysia - although supplying equipment for any public
power station contracts will have to wait for the end of the Malaysian trade
ban.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trans World accepts Emap offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trans World Communications, the Preston-based local radio group, yesterday
advised shareholders to accept the Pounds 71m bid from Emap, the media
concern.
Directors, who had led a fierce battle to maintain USM-quoted Trans World's
independence, grudgingly admitted defeat in the wake of the High Court
ruling last week that the decision by the Radio Authority, the industry
regulator, to sanction the deal should be upheld.
The ruling, which could spark a widespread rationalisation of the commercial
radio industry, appeared to expose a loophole in the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
By acquiring Trans World, Emap will hoist its radio licenses from three to
eight - two more than present regulations permit. It plans to set up a joint
venture with Schroders, its merchant bankers, to allow two of the licences
to be 'warehoused'.
Trans World yesterday warned shareholders that they may be left with a
limited market for their shares if they did not accept Emap's final offer of
181p per share.
Directors reiterated, however, that in their view, the offer 'represents an
inadequate premium for control' and failed to show a 'full reflection of
improving performance and prospects'.
To illustrate the latter point, Trans World's results for the six months to
June 30 were also released yesterday, showing pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.29m, against Pounds 254,000 last time.
Turnover jumped 30 per cent to Pounds 7.43m (Pounds 5.71m), including a
near-50 per cent leap in national airtime advertising sales. Earnings per
share improved from 0.5p to 2.3p but 'in view of the offer' the interim
dividend is omitted (0.3p).
Emap shares rose 7p to 430p; Trans World's dipped 1p to 179p.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity sees business failures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company, yesterday demonstrated
the impact of an improving economy, as gross claims against policies from
its continuing operations fell by 43 per cent in the first half of 1994.
The group does not disclose interim profits, but it emphasised its
confidence in the latest recovery by declaring an interim dividend of 0.4p,
the first interim payment since 1990.
Trade Indemnity has mirrored the strength of the UK economy, because of its
broad exposure to business failures.
The company said that business failures had dropped by 42 per cent in the
first half of this year, and gross claims paid from continuing operations
fell by a similar proportion from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 29.5m.
In addition, Trade Indemnity achieved an increase in gross premium income to
Pounds 74.4m (Pounds 71.3m), up 4.3 per cent from 1993.
Mr Victor Jacob, managing director, said that failures and claims were
falling, and while demand for the company's products might be expected to be
muted following a recession, it was, in fact, increasing.
However, the recent Court of Appeal decision on the Investors' Compensation
Scheme, which was underwritten by Trade Indemnity, has resulted in an
additional Pounds 7.5m provision against further claims.
The Court decision could result in additional claims resulting from bad
pensions advice given by failed independent advisers covered by the ICS. The
company is planning to appeal.
Further negative news came from the company's investment portfolio, which
experienced a Pounds 10.6m decline in value during the first half of the
year, reflecting the weakness in bond and equity markets.
Investment income on its Pounds 100m portfolio fell from Pounds 2.21m to
Pounds 1.99m, but as a long-term investor, Trade Indemnity will not be
required to make provisions against the portfolio at the year end.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Great Southern falls to SCI - Raised offer
wins approval but depends on Takeover Panel decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International yesterday won its hostile bid for Great
Southern Group, the UK funeral company, after gaining the approval of the
previously antagonistic Field family with its third cash offer for the
company.
Last Tuesday's offer of 680p a share was raised to 775p after Great Southern
entered negotiations with Loewen Group, SCI's main US competitor. However,
Loewen was only prepared to make a 690p cash offer.
SCI's latest offer depends on the failure of an appeal by Vancouver-based
Loewen, which has objected to the fact that SCI's previous final offer
listed no conditions under which its bid could be raised.
The bid from SCI demonstrates its determination to break into the fragmented
UK funeral market. It plans a rapid expansion, spearheaded by Great
Southern.
The 775p offer values the company at Pounds 112.9m, and represents a 63 per
cent premium over the 475p share price before SCI made its first offer.
It is offering 309p per convertible share.
The Field family, which has a three-hundred-year history in the funeral
business, will raise Pounds 51m from the sale of its interests in Great
Southern. Mr Barry Field, MP for the Isle of Wight, will get close to Pounds
8m for his personal shareholding in JD Field, the private company which owns
a 56 per cent stake in Great Southern.
The offer still depends on Wednesday's decision from the Takeover Panel on
whether SCI can increase last Tuesday's final offer.
It is a suitably controversial ending to what has been an extraordinary
takeover battle. Hostile bids have been virtually unheard of in the funeral
business, and the Field family were clearly shocked by the arrival of Mr
Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI's larger-than-life presi-dent.
Mr Heiligbrodt made every effort to force a dialogue with the Field family,
but the clash of styles made this difficult. At one stage, Great Southern
refused to discuss the offer unless the price did not begin with a 6, while
their offer document was described by Mr Heiligbrodt as 'garbage'.
There were numerous ironies. SCI had been invited to look at Great Southern
by people closely connected with the Field family and the company, even
though the company claimed a united front against the US aggressor.
But as the prices rose, the Field family decided they would sell out; it was
just a question of price.
SCI always said it would pay a significant premium for a recommended offer,
and Mr Heiligbrodt said yesterday that he was delighted that the Field
family had backed his third cash price.
By contrast, the Field family's original negotiating position had been an
800p offer, and the final bid is closer than had ever seemed likely.
The only distressed party appears to be Loewen Group. But even assuming its
appeal is unsuccessful, it will have the comfort that its main rival in the
increasingly competitive market for US funeral acquisitions will be Pounds
13.8m the poorer for Loewen's involvement.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Acatos shares jump 19p on link-up with
supplier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Acatos &amp; Hutcheson rose by 19p to 335p after the edible oils and
fats manufacturing group said it had reached agreement with an international
supplier to take a 22.5 per cent stake in the company.
Acatos declined to identify the supplier, and said the agreement to
subscribe for new shares was subject to contract. The company put out a
statement late on Friday evening, after market rumours had pushed its share
price up 33p during last week.
Acatos said the two companies intended to co-operate on various areas of
business of mutual interest and advantage. The proposed share subscription
would be based on a price of 288p, the level at which Acatos' shares closed
on Thursday.
Analysts said one possible candidate was Archer Daniels Midland, the US
agribusiness group which supplies Acatos's biggest refinery in London's
Docklands and which likes to take stakes in trading partners.
The edible oils market is dominated by international, privately-owned
companies such as Cargill of the US and Bunge y Born of Argentina. Other
players include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group that dominates the UK
branded edible oils market, and Aarhus of Denmark.
Analysts said Acatos - which is the biggest supplier of own-label food oils
and margarine in the UK, with about a 30 per market share - has long wanted
to move beyond the UK.
In 1990 it pulled out of an unsuccessful joint venture in Spain, writing off
Pounds 6.9m.
In the same year, Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, abandoned an attempt to take
the group private after he could not reach agreement with potential
institutional investors.
The group's weekend statement also said it was proceeding with a planned
reconstruction of the 37.1 per cent shareholding currently controlled by
Acatos Limited, a private company which owns the shares previously owned by
Mr Hutcheson, his family and other parties.
Advisers are working on a scheme to improve the shares' liquidity by making
it easier for stakeholders in the private company to sell their shares.
The group said it hoped agreement on this would be reached before its
year-end on September 30.

'Although the K factors determined fall short of those considered desirable

decided to accept the determination,' the directors said.
'It is inevitable, with the curtailment necessary in expenditure, that not

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook dismisses rights issue speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group, will report its annual
results on Thursday - the figures had been expected yesterday in some
quarters. The company blamed a mix-up with the Stock Exchange for the
confusion, writes Andrew Bolger.
Speculation that Tiphook might announce a rights issue was dismissed by a
source close to the group, who said its five principal banks had pledged
their support for four years and a rights issue at this stage was 'out of
the question'. The speculation caused the shares to drop from 38p to 30p
last week, but they were unchanged yesterday at 34p.
Tiphook is expected to show a substantial loss for the year to April. The
group escaped liquidation in March by selling its biggest asset, the
container business, to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for an
initial Pounds 673m. Tiphook still has debts of about Pounds 500m.

Towles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London City Equities has made a revised 275p per share offer for Towles, the
lossmaking clothing manufacturer.
The Australian investment group made its original offer of 265p per ordinary
share at the end of May.
With a 51 per cent stake in the company but only 14 per cent of the voting
rights, London City said at that time it was making the offer because it was
'outraged' at Towles' continuing losses.
The offers for the other classes of share remain at 115p cash for each A
ordinary share; 52p for each A preference share and 78p per B preference
share.
The directors of Towles have indicated that they will accept the revised
offer in respect of their entire beneficial holdings - representing 33.8 per
cent - and have unanimously recommended that shareholders also should
accept.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Where there are necks there is money - Tim
Burt reports on Tie Rack's airports-based international growth plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss rail commuters are about to get a taste of British retailing. Tie
Rack, the specialist neckwear and fashion business, is opening a store at
the Hauptbahnhof in Zurich - marking another stage of its international
expansion plan.
The retailer, which calls itself the 'smallest multinational in town',
predicts steady demand at the city railway station for products ranging from
fancy silk boxer shorts to all manner of neckwear.
Its confidence is based on a tried and tested format. Tie Rack opened its
first station store at Bank, on the London Underground, 12 years ago. Since
then it has exported the concept to 14 countries.
Regarding travellers as a captive market, the group has opened shops at rail
hubs, 15 international airports and - most recently - on four ferries
operated by DFDS, the Scandinavian shipping line. It has also opened a third
outlet at Dallas-Fort Worth airport and plans shops at stations serving the
Channel tunnel.
Complementing its 243 high street outlets, the 64 transport-linked shops
have become an integral part of the group's growth, which was underlined
earlier this year when it announced a 31 per cent increase in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 6.67m on turnover ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 78.2m.
For Mr Roy Bishko, the chairman who founded Tie Rack in 1981 and floated it
six years later, the results represent a triumph of concept shopping over
niche retailing.
Indeed, niche is almost a banned word at the company's west London
headquarters, where the buying and merchandise departments overflow with
non-core products such as jewellery, scarves, silk clothing, underwear and
accessories.
'If Tie Rack was a single product company, we would have long since passed
away,' says Mr Bishko. 'I have spent my time all these years building up the
range of products that Tie Rack sells so that we would not be dependent on
one single item.'
He blames such dependence for the collapse of copy-cat retailers such as
Sock Shop, Blouse House, Tooth Booth and Shave Shop.
Arguing forcefully that his business is a broadly-based international
concern, he adds: 'Niche is a swear word in my opinion and, at best, it has
a derogatory connotation.'
Tie Rack's product range may have protected it from the worst effects of
recession and volatile consumer spending, but even the irrepressible Mr
Bishko sounded a note of caution in his recent results statement.
He hinted that sales could decline marginally this year amid worsening
trading conditions in some of Tie Rack's key European markets.
Although new shops are said to be performing strongly, the shares have
fallen almost 10 per cent since the results were announced and closed
yesterday at 141p.
Mr Bishko shrugs off the muted City reaction, and ponders whether the
company's trading statement was 'perhaps too honest for the market'.
Claiming also that cash generation was more important than the share price,
he predicted that increased sales - enhanced by some 30 new stores due to
open this year, half of them overseas - could lift net cash balances from
Pounds 11.2m to more than Pounds 13m.
His unbridled optimism is tempered only by the admission that one market has
not been kind to the company - North America.
The group was almost undone by a poorly controlled US expansion plan which
left it with losses, expensive stores in the wrong places, and hefty
rationalisation charges.
Losses in the US last year climbed from Pounds 58,000 to Pounds 482,000 as
the group closed unprofitable shops and made significant write-downs. But Mr
Bishko, who wears a watch permanently set to Eastern Standard Time, refuses
to regard the market as an Achilles' heel and points instead to lucrative
new outlets at airports in Pittsburg, Denver and Dallas.
New shops may offset problems in cities such as New York and Atlanta. But
Tie Rack's success probably owes more to improved quality and innovation,
which last year helped it bring out 1,000 new tie and 500 new scarf designs.
It also depends on low overheads at overseas outlets, which are supplied
directly from the group's London headquarters.
Mr Bishko may be the 'ideas man' acclaimed for that progress, but it is
doubtful he would have succeeded had it not been for the conservative
influence of Mr Nigel McGinley, the chief executive recruited from Argyll in
1989.
He oversaw the group's 1991 rights issue, raising Pounds 3.2m to strengthen
the balance sheet, and imposed the stock and cost controls necessary to
withstand the recession.
He is the antithesis of Mr Bishko's effervescence. While the chairman talks
of expansion and landlords who are 'thrilled' to have Tie Rack on their
property, Mr McGinley forecasts more US closures and an uncertain recovery.
'Several of our overseas markets are in recession, and in the UK tax
increases may well hit people's spending power,' he adds.
Some City analysts regard him as the company's saviour. 'He screwed down the
costs and improved the cashflow,' according to one analyst. 'I don't know
where the company would be without him.'
Mr McGinley's caution has proved an ideal foil to Mr Bishko, and their
double act has ensured Tie Rack's growth. Despite their different styles,
both are committed to further expansion in airports, where turnover is
estimated at more than Pounds 1,000 per sq ft, and to exploiting new markets
in east Asia.
The group has identified 50 airports where it would like to establish a
presence, and has also begun considering a move into China from Hong Kong,
where it has a franchise operation with Watson's, a retail division of
Hutchison Whampoa.
Hailing the group's prospects, Mr Bishko says: 'As long as people have
necks, there will be a pretty big market out there.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sales expansion and cost control behind
Inspec rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inspec Group, the speciality chemicals company which came to the market
earlier this year, yesterday announced a sharp increase in first-half
profits following strong volume growth and tight cost controls.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 2.85m to Pounds 6.91m in the
six months to June 30, on sales ahead 46 per cent at Pounds 35m (Pounds
23.9m)
Mr John Hollowood, chairman, said the outcome demonstrated the group's
progress since its March flotation, which raised Pounds 49.5m.
The figures were flattered, however, by Pounds 1.05m of exceptional gains
following early repayment of a vendor loan to BP Chemicals - the group's
former owners - and by first-time contributions from Allco, the US
speciality acids business acquired last December for Dollars 20m (Pounds
12.9m).
Although the group declined to reveal the exact size of Allco's profits,
analysts estimated it contributed about Pounds 500,000 to increased
operating profits of Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 3.54m).
On a pro forma basis - assuming Allco had been acquired at the beginning of
1993 - operating profits rose 30 per cent from Pounds 4.92m.
Mr Hollowood said the improvement had been underpinned by increased demand
in its three core areas: coating intermediaries, synthetic lubricants, and
Allco's speciality acids.
'Allco has turned out to be a real gem,' he added. 'But there's been strong
organic growth; we've increased capacity and kept a tight control on fixed
costs.'
The group also plans to exploit sustained growth in Britain and the US by
investing Pounds 5m on new facilities at its Hythe plant near Southampton
and Dollars 5m on increased capacity at Allco in Kansas.
Earnings per share came out at 6.9p - 5.5p excluding exceptional items  -
and an interim dividend of 1.33p is declared.
The shares, floated at 160p, closed up 3p at 231p.

FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Signet criticised by US holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, was yesterday
criticised by disaffected shareholders for failing to address their demands
for a capital reconstruction.
The San Francisco-based Delta Dividend Group said it would press ahead with
plans to requisition an extraordinary meeting after receiving an 'inadequate
response' to proposals for a restructuring and repayment of dividend
arrears.
Preference dividends have not been paid since early 1992, and arrears in the
year to January 29 stood at Pounds 58m (Pounds 30.3m).
Mr David Gale, president, said the US investors - holding variable term
preference shares worth about Dollars 29m (Pounds 19m) - were disappointed
by a letter from Signet which rejected their calls. 'We haven't been paid
dividends for two and a half years, and I'm not sure the company has the
means to compensate us,' he said.
The US group had urged the company to relist the preference shares on
Nasdaq; appoint a majority of non-executive directors; cap discretionary
bonuses and restructure the capital.
Delta, which claims to have backing from UK-based preference holders, said
it would decide shortly on a set of resolutions.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Royal Oak Mines lifts offer to CDollars 2.4bn in fight for
Lac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Oak Mines, the pugnacious Vancouver-based gold producer, yesterday
lifted its takeover bid for Lac Minerals, the much larger Canadian mining
group, by about 14 per cent to CDollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.12bn).
The latest offer substantially raises the amount of cash available to Lac
shareholders. Mrs Peggy Witte, Royal Oak's chief executive, said she was
encouraged by the support her company had received since its first offer a
month ago. Nevertheless, the chances of Royal Oak winning the battle for Lac
remain slim.
Analysts predicted yesterday that American Barrick, which has submitted a
rival CDollars 2.2bn bid, would sweeten its package, or that other offers
would surface. Barrick shares, which comprise a sizeable part of its bid,
are widely regarded as being of higher quality and more liquid than Royal
Oak paper.
Royal Oak also has the disadvantage of drawing heavily on Lac's resources to
finance the takeover.
Lac said last night that it would consider the revised Royal Oak offer. The
Toronto-based company has so far said that its favoured option is to retain
its independence. It has responded to criticism of its management by
replacing its chief executive, unveiling USDollars 600m (Pounds 387m) in new
projects, and substantially raising estimates of reserves at its mines in
Canada, the US and Chile.
Mr Rick Cohen, analyst at Goepel Shields in Vancouver, said that with a
bidding war now in full swing, Lac was unlikely to survive in its present
form. Its directors 'have to recognise that the company is history', Mr
Cohen said. 'The best thing is to put it up for auction.'
Lac is widely owned, with most of its shares held by North American
institutional investors. Royal Oak's latest offer comprises CDollars 5 cash
and two Royal Oak shares, with a total value of CDollars 16.50, for each Lac
share. Alternatively, Lac shareholders can take 2.87 Royal Oak shares for
each Lac share. The offer expires on August 19.
Royal Oak said that it plans a CDollars 120m equity issue to help finance
its bid. A group of banks earlier agreed to provide a long-term credit
facility of USDollars 700m.
Lac shares rose 38 cents to close at CDollars 14.63 in Toronto yesterday.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Saatchi claims PC status as profits leap 68%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Saatchi declared the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group a '100
per cent politically correct organisation' yesterday, as the group announced
higher than expected interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m, up 68 per cent
on the previous Pounds 9.1m.
The 'politically correct' status claimed by Mr Saatchi, chairman, comes from
the fact that the group now has no one on a contract longer than three
years. At the annual meeting in June, Mr Saatchi renounced his five-year
rolling contract, worth Pounds 625,000 a year, and moved to a three-year
fixed-term contract at a base salary of Pounds 200,000. Bonuses will be
linked to revenue growth.
The semi-public row between Mr Saatchi and Mr Charlie Scott, chief
executive, over the management of the organisation, appears to have
subsided, with Mr Saatchi yesterday describing relationships as
'magnificent'. Mr Scott agreed: 'I have worse arguments with my wife than I
do with Maurice, and I've only been married four weeks.'
Mr Scott described the volume and quality of new business wins this year as
the best since he joined the group at the beginning of 1990. The impact of
the new accounts, which include the National Lottery, Compaq Computer and
Qantas, are not expected to feed through until 1995.
The share price leapt 15p to close at 176p.
Turnover slipped 6.1 per cent to Pounds 379.4m (Pounds 404.1) in the six
months to June 30. The decline had been expected because of the loss of two
important US accounts, Chrysler and Helene Curtis, together worth Pounds
16.8m in revenue. Other factors were the negative impact of exchange rate
movements, and the fact that businesses were sold.
Operating profits from continuing operations were up 15 per cent to Pounds
21.7m (Pounds 18.9m), following an attack on costs last year. Operating
margins increased from 5.3 to 5.7 per cent and Mr Scott said his target
remained 10 per cent by 1996.
Earnings per share rose 53 per cent to 2.9p (1.9p). No dividend will be paid
 -Mr Saatchi and Mr Scott said the position on dividends would be kept under
review.
Ms Lorna Tilbian, media analyst with SG Warburg Securities, said yesterday
that Saatchi had 'certainly turned the corner'. She is forecasting full-year
pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m and earnings per share of 5.7p.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Smith &amp; Nephew loses Pounds 148m on sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare products maker, has closed an unfortunate
chapter in its history by selling its worst performing business, Ioptex, for
Pounds 11m - about Pounds 150m less than the Dollars 236m it paid for it in
1988.
S&amp;N will take an exceptional charge against 1994 profits of Pounds 148m, not
far short of last year's pre-tax total of Pounds 171m. Ioptex, which makes
eye implants, is being sold to Allergan, of California.
As a Pounds 141m goodwill write-off was made against reserves at the time of
the Ioptex purchase, shareholders' funds will fall by only Pounds 7m. The
share price was barely changed at 159p yesterday.
S&amp;N said the sale would 'modestly enhance earnings (before exceptional
items) by replacing a small current loss with interest earnings'.
The proceeds from the sale will reduce gearing from about 4 per cent to
almost zero. The company is due to announce first-half results on Thursday.
Forecasts are for about Pounds 90m pre-tax on sales of more than Pounds
500m.
Ioptex makes lens implants used in eye surgery. Its profits collapsed in
1990 when the US government changed the rules on paying for intra-ocular
lenses, its main product.
In 1993, it had sales of Pounds 27m, profits of Pounds 200,000 and net
assets of Pounds 18m. In the first half of 1994, it lost Pounds 1m.
Mr John Robinson, S&amp;N's chief executive, said yesterday that Ioptex was the
only one of the company's businesses to be losing money. It was ripe for
disposal because 'it clearly didn't fit'. It was the only acquisition to
which S&amp;N had failed to add value.
Among other things, Ioptex needed specialist sales staff that did not fit
with the company's other product lines.
Mr Duncan Moore, analyst with stockbroker Morgan Stanley, said that the
Ioptex purchase had been 'a poor investment' which the company had been
expected to sell.
'What's happened today is primarily an accounting issue,' he said. 'We knew
about the magnitude of the goodwill write-off.'
For Allergan, best known for its contact lens fluids, the deal strengthens
its position in the intra-ocular lens market. Allergan was the first company
that S&amp;N approached, said Mr Robinson.
Talks took 'four to five months' with other companies also expressing an
interest.
S&amp;N has not made an acquisition as big as that of Ioptex since 1988. Instead
it has signed collaboration agreements such as that with California's
Advanced Tissue Sciences to improve cartilage surgery.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Consumers slow to put their hands in pockets: Louise Kehoe
and Alan Cane report on the personal communicators market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vision of a multi-billion dollar market for pocket-sized 'personal
communicators' that fired excitement throughout the computer industry a year
ago has turned out to be a mirage. Among the companies that hoped to profit
from the anticipated emergence of this new category of electronic product -
handheld devices that combine some of the functions of a personal computer
with those of a mobile telephone, pager or fax machine - there is now a
consensus that it will be several years before sales take off.
Disenchantment began to set in when Apple Computer's much heralded 'Newton',
launched 12 months ago, failed to achieve its sales targets. Mr John
Sculley, former Apple chairman, has been widely blamed for setting
unrealistic expectations for the performance of what he called 'personal
digital assistants'.
Although Apple has not released sales figures since last December, fewer
than 100,000 Newtons have been sold, according to analysts' estimates - a
far cry from the millions that Apple had hoped for.
Apple, however, is not alone in disappointing its customers and investors.
Eo, a Silicon Valley venture that introduced its personal communicator last
year, recently closed its doors after AT&amp;T, its biggest investor, refused
additional funding.
Last week Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company and the leading
supplier of microprocessor chips for personal computers, ended a joint
effort with VLSI Technology, another Silicon Valley semiconductor company,
to develop chips for personal communicators.
'The market for handheld devices has developed more slowly and with
dramatically lower volumes than the industry originally anticipated,' said
Mr Donald Maulsby, VSLI vice-president. The company will cut its research
and development spending on chips for personal communicators and Intel plans
to sell its 15 per cent equity stake in VLSI (plus warrants to acquire an
additional 7.5 per cent).
Amid growing scepticism about the near-term prospects for personal
communicators, the introduction of an IBM product called 'Simon' - a
handheld cellular telephone-cum-computer - is behind schedule. IBM's plans
to launch similar 'smart telephones' bearing its name are also believed to
be on hold. Similarly, Compaq Computer has delayed indefinitely the
introduction of its personal communicator and Motorola, the leading
manufacturer of cellular telephones, has postponed shipment of its 'Envoy'
personal wireless communicator until the end of the year for 'additional
testing'.
Despite the setbacks, most industry executives believe that eventually
personal communicators will become a mass market product, but not in the
near term.
Mr David Potter, founder and chairman of the UK company Psion which makes a
pocket communicator, is angered that the relative failure of Newton reflects
badly on other handheld gadget manufacturers. He pointed out that Psion had
been successful with a handheld computer which communicates via a Motorola
radio system.
Amstrad, the UK consumer electronics company, claimed to be the first to
launch a personal digital assistant with its pen-based handheld computer in
early 1993. Amstrad's PDA600 has consistently outsold the more expensive
Newton in the UK, although numbers for both are small. In December, sales of
Amstrad's PDA600s were about 1,800, against about 600 Newtons.
Makers of the first generation of personal communicators were too ambitious,
it now appears, in promising 'anytime, anywhere' voice and data
communications services via today's cellular telephone networks.
Yet advances in 'wireless' mobile communications are on the horizon. Nextel,
for example, plans to build a North American mobile communications system
that combines voice, paging and data messaging systems. And a week ago
several companies and investment groups paid the US government a total of
Dollars 833m (Pounds 537m) for radio spectrum rights assigned to advanced
two-way paging systems. These are expected to enable users to send and
receive short messages. Such services may be available within five years,
according to analysts.
In December, the US Federal Communications Commission is set to hold another
airwaves auction for licences to operate 'pocket communication service'
networks. PCS is expected to expand on today's cellular telephone services
by adding data communications and perhaps even limited video capabilities to
conventional voice transmission. However, the new networks may cost billions
of dollars and take several years to build.
That should give the computer industry plenty of time to overcome the
shortcomings of the first generation of personal communicators. But it also
suggests that manufacturers have a long time to wait before their dreams of
a huge new market come true.

FT  09 AUG 94 / BA fails to impress City with 40% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profit
as passenger and cargo traffic continued to recover. But the strong
performance failed to impress the stock market with BA shares falling 12p to
close at 417p.
BA's first-quarter profit of Pounds 88m for the three months to June 30 was
up from Pounds 63m a year ago. Turnover for the period rose to Pounds 1.69bn
from Pounds 1.52bn.
Although profits were in line with expectations, they did not match the more
bullish forecasts, which had exceeded Pounds 90m pre-tax. The market's
reaction also reflected continuing worries about BA's Dollars 400m (Pounds
259m) investment in a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir. The sixth largest US
carrier is struggling to win labour concessions to help it return to
profitability.
BA said yesterday it was not close to deciding whether to write off its
USAir stake. But it acknowledged that the current negotiations between USAir
and its unions were not encouraging and would probably drag on into the
autumn.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said he was encouraged by the overall
first-quarter performance. It reflected 'buoyant demand' for passenger and
cargo services, with first and business-class premium traffic reaching an
all-time high.
First-quarter operating profits rose 32.4 per cent to Pounds 143m. Fully
diluted earnings per share were 6.4p, slightly up from last year's 6.3p,
largely due to a higher estimated tax rate and the rights issue of June
1993.
A total of 8.3m people flew on the airline's scheduled and charter flights
in the first quarter. Passenger traffic increased by 6.9 per cent on
scheduled services.
The biggest improvement was in the high-yield first and business class
traffic which rose by 12 per cent, double the rate of economy class traffic.
This helped passenger yields on scheduled services to rise by 3.4 per cent.
Cargo traffic rose by nearly 20 per cent with a total of 171,000 tonnes
carried.
BA also said net borrowings fell by Pounds 201m in the first quarter, taking
its gearing to 56.9 per cent - a 2.7 percentage point improvement since the
end of March.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Price of car parts may rise under Brussels proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European car owners may be forced to pay higher prices for spare parts and
be banned from shopping around for better deals under European Commission
proposals to harmonise rules governing the legal protection of industrial
design.
The Commission's plans will insist that certain car body parts be legally
protected for the first three years after a car is launched, giving the
manufacturers the exclusive right to supply spares during that period.
Consumers and independent suppliers fear the proposals will stifle
competition and allow car manufacturers to charge what they wish for
windscreens, panels, headlamps and other parts.
The UK has a free market in the supply of spare parts for repairs. This
contrasts with countries such as France, which uses copyright law to protect
carmakers from the competition of independent suppliers.
The Commission, under pressure from powerful carmakers on one side, and
consumer groups and independent suppliers on the other, has come up with the
three-year compromise plan as part of a wider initiative to harmonise rules
covering the legal protection of industrial design.
These rules differ greatly across the 12 EU member states.
In the proposals, the Commission argues that many car parts, such as
windscreens, are unlikely to qualify for legal protection according to
strict rules defining design and that consumer groups are overestimating the
costs of such protection.
No final decision has been taken on the Commission's proposals. They are
being scrutinised by the working group of the Council of Ministers and have
yet to be debated by the European Parliament.
However, independent suppliers believe manufacturers could use the
three-year ruling to create a monopoly in the supply of spare parts.
'Without a repair right, the availability of spare parts would decrease, the
price of spare parts would increase, and the very existence of the European
independent spare parts industry would be put at risk,' says the European
Campaign for an Automotive Repair Right, a grouping of independent suppliers
and consumer organisations.
They also argue that the ruling could cause great inconvenience to consumers
in the UK who are able to ring up glass suppliers, for example, 24 hours a
day for repairs on broken windscreens.
'It is not just a matter of cost, it is a matter of flexibility,' said Mr
David Roycroft, of Pilkington, the UK glass manufacturer.
The carmakers say they should be allowed some sort of protection for parts
in order to recoup the costs of investment in design, although the consumer
groups say those costs are covered in the sale of the vehicle.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Welfare costs threaten to swamp US federal budget, Clinton
told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Runaway US government spending on pensions and healthcare is in danger of
swamping the entire federal budget, a bipartisan commission warned
yesterday.
A preliminary report said if current trends continue unchecked, by the year
2012 the entire federal budget will be consumed by entitlements such as
social security, which provides government pensions, and Medicare, which
gives health insurance to the elderly. These increase automatically each
year with the growth of the population and with inflation, and by interest
on the government debt.
The commission, chaired by Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, called for
action to address the problem before it becomes overwhelming.
'What we are saying is that if we continue the trend lines that we are going
right now, we are going to find the federal government essentially converted
into an ATM machine,' Senator Kerrey said.
The commission is due to present a more detailed final report in December -
after the congressional elections - with its recommendations for action. The
interim report was intended to raise public awareness of the extent of the
problem. Although many voters favour cuts in government spending, they
believe that the budget deficit can be brought into line by eliminating
waste, fraud and welfare payments to the unemployed.
But besides interest on the national debt, which is expected to eat up 14
per cent of government spending next year, the largest programmes in the
federal budget are social security and Medicare, highly popular middle class
benefits which together account for one third of all government spending.
While social security currently generates an annual surplus, most of its
beneficiaries take out much more than they put in, and the ageing of the US
population means changes will be needed at some point. When the social
security trust fund faced imminent insolvency in 1983, Congress raised
payroll taxes in a reform it hoped would last until the year 2049. Already,
however, the date of the next projected insolvency has been brought forward
to 2029.
Medicare, like other health spending, continues to climb much faster than
the general rate of inflation and hopes are now dwindling that a reform of
the healthcare system would bring it under control.
The imbalance between benefits and taxation raises questions of fairness
between generations. Where the average baby boomer born in 1950 is projected
to pay 33 per cent of a lifetime income in taxes, after deducting the
benefits received from social security, the same figure for someone born in
1993 would, if current benefit rates were maintained, climb to 82 per cent.
The commission was set up by President Bill Clinton to fulfil a promise made
to Senator Kerrey in return for his vote for last year's budget. Since
Senator Kerrey now says he will not vote for the healthcare reform bill
being debated, Mr Clinton may have to promise to do something about the
commission's proposals to win him over once again.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All parties involved in the wrangle over the bidding for Great Southern are
agreed on one thing - the proposed solution hammered out by the Takeover
Panel and SCI does not disadvantage any group of shareholders. Nor is there
any suggestion that SCI's advisers prevented investors getting the best
possible deal because of the wording of its 'final' offer. Most assumed that
the offer was final only on condition that there was no competing, higher
bid even though this was not spelled out. Shareholders who asked were told
of this. Those who then sold in the market are to be compensated. They can
hardly complain.
The main principles of the Takeover Code are not compromised. The proposed
solution conforms to the letter of the Code which gives the Panel discretion
to allow a final offer to be amended in exceptional circumstances. The
question is whether the loose wording was a mistake by SCI's advisers or a
tactic. It is hard to believe that an adviser of Schroders' stature would
set out blatantly to mislead. Even so, the Panel should guard against
setting a precedent.

The 3 per cent fall in British Airways' share price yesterday suggests the
market had exaggerated expectations about the effect of economic recovery on
its operations. Still, the actual outturn is not bad. BA has managed
impressive growth in lucrative premium traffic business. Its more efficient
use of aircraft promises enhanced gains as the recovery proceeds.
There are more grounds for worry on strategic alliances. Yesterday's figures
suggest disappointing progress in reducing losses at European associates. BA
calculates USAir will contribute around Pounds 70m to profits this year
whatever happens to its investment in balance sheet terms. The airline could
easily afford to write down its stake. Whether it could afford the resulting
loss of strategic direction is another matter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The long queue of investors for Pillar's flotation says more about the
company than the state of the wider property market. Despite the brightening
economic prospects, there is still little sign of rising rents. The latest
survey evidence points to falling capital values in retail, office and
industrial sectors. Anecdotal evidence suggests institutional investors
pulled back from direct investment in property during the second quarter.
This may have been caused by falling equity and bond markets, which tended
to push property weightings higher even without action. Pension funds may
also be mulling the government's proposed solvency test and asking where
property might fit into their portfolios in future.
There seems little chance of another slide in values, especially now that
the gilts market has recovered some poise. With property values becalmed,
though, stock market investors are looking for companies which can add value
to their assets through development or trading. Pillar seems to fit the bill
 -as did Argent, which saw its flotation oversubscribed in June. At a 5 per
cent discount to net assets neither flotation was especially cheap. Indeed,
if Pillar and Argent represent fair value at this level it is difficult to
see why the less dynamic or well-placed property companies are trading at a
similar discount.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's economic data leave the debate about UK inflation as confused as
ever. Input prices are growing faster than output prices, although an annual
rate of 2.9 per cent hardly amounts to hyper-inflation. Consumer borrowing
is up sharply on a net basis, though a large part of the jump seems to
reflect a slowdown in repayments. Gross lending in June scarcely rose at all
and gross lending on credit cards actually fell. Taken together the figures
can thus be construed as offering comfort both to those who argue that
inflationary pressures are building up in the economy and to those who claim
that price pressures are likely to remain muted.
Yet it would be naive to assume that the economy can continue growing as
fast as it is without inflation eventually accelerating again. For the time
being higher volumes will continue to offset the impact of raw material
price increases on unit costs. The slowdown in credit repayment could be a
sign that April's tax rises are hurting consumers. While wage rises remain
restrained, they are likely to remain price conscious. But if the
authorities wait till wage pressure returns, it will be too late for a
pre-emptive strike.

FT  09 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Smith's short sight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by the standards of 1988, when countless companies struck deals their
shareholders lived to regret, Smith &amp; Nephew's acquisition of Ioptex was an
expensive blunder. At the exchange rates then prevailing it paid Pounds 140m
for a company that is now being sold for just Pounds 11m. After writing-down
the company's assets, there is a total loss of Pounds 148m which represents
almost three years' dividends and a third of shareholders' funds.
In retrospect the acquisition was breathtakingly risky. Smith &amp; Nephew paid
over five times annual sales for the number four player in a market that was
fast going ex-growth. The deal was so structured that despite the high price
the acquisition would not dilute earnings in the first year. Maybe the
ingenuity of the financial engineering blinded management to the dangers.
They should certainly have questioned whether margins approaching 45 per
cent were sustainable in a mature US market, or whether Smith could add
anything to Ioptex's attempts to expand internationally. It was dismissing
the regulatory threat that was to prove most damaging, since the price
controls placed on some lenses by the US authorities 18 months later were a
blow from which Ioptex never really recovered.
Smith stresses that all its other US acquisitions have been successful and
that it has learned hard lessons from Ioptex. If this reassures
shareholders, who have seen dividends rise by just 15 per cent over the past
five years, they may still wonder why over the same period the pay of Smith
&amp; Nephew's successive chief executives has doubled.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The disgraced former president of Brazil is doing his best to resuscitate
his old party - but it's nothing if not a challenge. With the National
Renewal party trailing at under 1 per cent in the opinion polls, Fernando
Collor de Mello, who has been banned from office until the year 2000, made
an appearance on TV to aid the flagging campaign of the party's next choice
for president, Walter Queiroz. No doubt mindful of a Brazilian law that
forbids anyone but the candidate himself appearing in a party political
broadcast, Collor made do with just a photo and a voice-over as he railed
against the 'state mandarins' who had contributed to his downfall.
That was still too much for the courts, who warned him that any repeat
sallies on to the box would cost him a year in jail.
But he must nearly have stumbled over Queiroz on the court room steps. The
latter has been expelled from the party following allegations that he
'forgot' to declare Dollars 1.7m in income tax returns, but is fighting to
be reinstated.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Observer: Daley round
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty six years of penance is obviously deemed to be sufficient. Chicago is
being allowed to host a Democratic National Convention once again which
should give the current Mayor Daley a chance to do something towards setting
the family record straight.
For it was when his father, 'Boss' Daley, was in the mayoral office that
city police charged unarmed anti-Vietnam war protestors at the infamous 1968
gathering.
Daley junior has enjoyed nothing like the immense political power wielded by
his father, but on this occasion he did have a man in the right place. With
his former campaign manager David Wilhelm now chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, Daley's city was more than well-placed to secure the
prize in 1996. But was he a bit optimistic when he forecast, echoing the
words of the late 1960s protestors, that the 'whole world will be watching'?

The UK economy must be on the mend - judging by the number of new
(ad)ventures being started by Peter de Savary, the buccaneering
yachtsman-cum-businessman who found the last recession more heavy going than
most.
Last week Observer reported that de Savary, who was pipped at the buoy in
the 1983 America's Cup by Australia's Alan Bond, was planning to invest
upwards of Dollars 1.5m on a boat to take part in a new international race
being planned by the super snooty Royal Yacht Squadron and the New York
Yacht Club. Now comes news that he is planning to reopen the 100-room Skibo
Castle, Andrew Carnegie's old home in the Scottish highlands, as an upmarket
leisure resort.
The local enterprise council has chipped in Pounds 0.5m towards the Pounds
15m that de Savary is planning to spend on upgrading the property to the
style the US steel magnate is accustomed to when entertaining the likes of
Edward VII and the Rockefellers. It will, of course, have a few extra
facilities such as a fully equipped gymnasium, golf course and beauty
therapy centre. No word yet on the cost of membership, but de Savary is
planning to milk the great steel man's name for all it is worth by
christening his latest baby the Carnegie Club.

Who will be the next bigwig to be piped aboard the Alexander, Greek

Former US President George Bush, plus more than a dozen relations and

Latsis's legendary hospitality consists of lending his guests his yacht,

For Prince Charles, that could mean a stop at Mount Athos, the peninsula off

Athens, attracts an increasing number of western visitors with a mystical

FT  09 AUG 94 / What to do when Chaps can't cope: Reform of UK bank
settlements procedures aims to reduce risk to the financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is lunchtime on Friday October 13 1995, and a large UK bank is failing.
Its capital has been wiped out by the collapse of several big companies and
catastrophic falls in markets. As rumours spread through London money
markets, its credit dries up, and it starts to lose deposits.
At an emergency meeting attended by the governor of the Bank of England, the
bank's board agrees to close the bank at the end of the day so that it can
be recapitalised in an orderly way.
But Mr Eddie George, the governor, knows that an even larger problem is
looming. He phones Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve
Board, to warn him that London's payment systems are about to grind to a
halt.
The difficulty stems from the bank's status as a clearer, one of a
privileged breed which has existed in the UK since the 1770s. It is one of
16 which pass Pounds 100bn - in large electronic payments and cheques -
through the clearing system each day. As well as big UK banks, Citibank,
Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais also have such status.
By lunch the bank owes billions of pounds to other banks in the Clearing
House Automated Payment System (Chaps). It has sent them thousands of
computer messages authorising immediate payments on behalf of large
customers such as quoted companies and financial institutions.
But although the other banks have credited cash to customers' accounts
immediately, they have not received the money. That should happen late in
the afternoon, when promises are totted up. At that moment, if Bank A owes
Bank B Pounds 8.1bn and is in turn owed Pounds 7.8bn by Bank B, it should
pay Bank B Pounds 300m.
Mr George has been warned that Bank A is about to refuse to settle. It
intends to retain the Pounds 8bn it is likely to promise today, until it has
received an injection of public money and is certain it can pay.
This could not only cripple another clearer - the nine largest UK banks have
only Pounds 24bn in equity and reserves - but force suspension of the Chaps
system. Currency markets would halt, because 45 per cent of the money passed
through Chaps is the sterling half of foreign exchange contracts.
Mr George curses his luck at having come close to avoiding catastrophe, but
failing at the last . . .
This nightmare has two years left to come true. After that, the Bank of
England hopes to have banished it to the realm of fantasy. 'There is a real
but avoidable risk to the financial system, and we could not just sit back
and tolerate it,' says Ms Merlyn Lowther, the Bank's deputy chief cashier.
The solution which clearing banks have agreed with the Bank involves
abolishing net settlement at the end of the day. Banks will instead settle
their big payments to each other in full as accounts are credited, so
eliminating the hours during which they pile up obligations.
Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) should allow regulatory authorities to
take a troubled bank out of the system without disrupting others. If it was
settling its accounts instantly, it would not owe anything when it was shut
down. 'It means that when you stop the clock, you can make a clean break.
The whole payments system does not have to seize up while you sort out the
mess,' says Ms Lowther.
Real-time cash settlement could also allow instant settlement of securities
contracts. In addition, if all countries achieved real-time settlement, the
systems could be linked to eliminate delays in settlement of foreign
exchange contracts across time zones.
The latter is a long-held ambition of central bankers since the 1974
collapse of Herstatt, a German bank. Because of different time zones,
customers who bought the D-Mark halves of thousands of foreign exchange
contracts were left unpaid when the bank collapsed before they were paid the
corresponding amounts in dollars through US banks.
For central bankers concerned with payment systems, RTGS sounds like a
perfect world. But it is not a one-way bet for the UK clearing banks. They
not only face paying more for a service which has been cheap until now, but
could have to alter balance sheets in a way that squeezes profit margins.
Further, some central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, operate
real-time settlement commercially, charging banks for providing cash to oil
the system. Others, such as the Bank of France, have created resentment by
trying to impose their blueprint of real-time settlement on commercial
banks.
When faced in 1992 with the possibility of being strong-armed into an
expensive and difficult new world, some UK bankers argued that settlement
was only one of many risks. Thus it was illogical to single it out for
attack. A bank takes risks every time it lends cash, or enters a securities
contract.
But settlement risk is unlike other forms of banking risk for two reasons.
The first is that it is virtually impossible to control who participates in
the system. When they lend money, banks can probe the strength of those they
are dealing with, either by checking the credit record of a person, or
looking up the rating of a company.
But when they clear payments from other banks, it is impossible in practice
to carry out such vetting. They must honour instructions from all companies
which are customers of a fellow bank. They can impose overall limits on
their indebtedness to other banks - a method introduced in Chaps in 1992 -
but this is a crude method of limiting risk.
The second unique characteristic of settlement risk is that it is hard to
charge appropriately for it. A bank covers the higher risk of lending to a
bad borrower by charging more. But when it clears payments from other banks,
it is impractical to levy anything other than a flat transaction charge.
These two factors were instrumental in persuading banks to adopt a real-time
system in stages from the end of 1995. 'Once you establish that real-time
settlement is cost-effective, the argument against it is very weak,' says Mr
Eric Sepkes, a Citibank vice-president who headed negotiations with the Bank
of England on behalf of the commercial banks.
Having agreed the principle of RTGS, the UK banks and the Bank of England
have only one big issue to resolve. This is how much the Bank will charge
participants to cover the running costs of a real-time system. It has
promised a charge of 'pence rather than pounds' for each of the 40,000 daily
Chaps transactions.
Instead of building another system, the banks have adapted Chaps. When it
switches to real-time, each payment message between banks will be forwarded
electronically to the Bank's computer. This will send back authorisation for
the transfer providing that the paying bank has money to cover it.
Rather than the Bank providing this liquidity and charging for it - as in
the US - banks will provide it themselves. They will deposit liquid assets
such as Treasury bills with the Bank, which will take them as collateral for
cash payments made across the system. They will have to have enough
collateral to cover settlements at any point in the day.
This has potentially far-reaching consequences for banks because the liquid
assets they will deposit with the Bank earn them less interest than do loans
to companies or individuals. If the real-time settlement system forces them
to buy more liquid assets, it could squeeze their margins.
But the system will give banks an incentive to keep their payment flows even
during the day in order to minimise holdings of liquid assets. All banks are
working on computerised financial models to ensure that they can manage
flows of liquid assets in a real-time system as cheaply as possible.
'At the margin, it may affect banks' profits, but in a sense they have
escaped lightly until now because they have not had to provide liquidity,'
says Mr Charles Bryant, a consultant to the banks' Association for Payment
Clearing Services who has co-ordinated development work on RTGS.
By 1996, the Bank of England should thus have eliminated a catastrophic risk
to the UK financial system. It would be unlucky to have an accident in the
meanwhile. But bankers may at least pause for thought on the four Friday the
13ths before then.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Freeing Latin American trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement by the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay
last week to put in place a customs union from the start of next year is a
potentially encouraging development. It is vital, however, that this
agreement prove outward-looking, not just towards the rest of Latin America,
but towards the world. It is still too early to be sure it will pass that
test.
The decision to go ahead with the Mercosur customs union is yet another
indication that the region's governments have buried historical rivalries
and are trying to turn away from protectionist and statist economic
policies. It also gives a symbolic boost to the cause of economic
integration in the western hemisphere, however remote that goal remains.
The Mercosur accord - which brings together 190m people in a market worth
more than Dollars 600bn a year - should secure a relatively open Brazilian
economy. For much of Latin America, that may be a more important objective
than free trade with the US. Although Mercosur has failed to meet the
ambitious goals of free movement of labour, capital and goods initially
envisaged by the four governments, the treaty obligations of Mercosur will
make it much more difficult for them to return to protectionism.
The fact that a customs union - with a common external tariff regime - has
been created should also prove positive. Behind a common tariff, there is no
need to formulate complicated rules of origin for imports. These are an
inevitable feature of the patchwork of free trade agreements being
negotiated in the Americas and also a potentially significant obstacle to
trade.
Building block
The agreement has also been framed to allow for future accession - initially
on an associate basis - of other countries, such as Bolivia and Chile. It
thus has the potential to become the building block, rather than a stumbling
block, towards further economic integration.
For all that, the devil of such agreements is in the details - aspects of
which are still unclear - and the way governments choose to implement them.
Unfortunately, the governments tend to see the creation of trading blocs as
an answer to an imaginary dilemma, namely that their economies are trapped
between the high technology exporters, on the one hand, and the ultra
low-wage economies of Asia, on the other.
The risk is that such a defensive view of trade opportunities will lead to
the replication of mistaken import substitution policies at an international
level. If barriers to imports are set too high, trade diversion will
outweigh trade creation, economic efficiency will deteriorate and export
performance falter. This, in turn, will vindicate initial defensiveness and
reinforce protectionist sentiment.
Obvious flaws
From this perspective, Mercosur has obvious flaws. The agreement has forced
Argentina, for example, to raise its current zero tariff on capital goods
imports to between 14 and 16 per cent. An important sector of Argentine
industry will be protected from Brazilian competition for a five-year period
 -worrying because such 'temporary' protection often has a way of becoming
permanent. Similarly, the car regime provides continued heavy protection for
domestic automobile manufacturers.
One worry then is that Mercosur might encourage its members to believe they
have an alternative to seeking global competitiveness. Another is that it
may make hemispheric integration not easier, but more difficult to achieve.
One trade specialist, Ms Nora Lustig at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, has suggested the establishment of a regional agency to ensure
such accords remain open to third parties. She suggests such an agency
should be a central topic at the forthcoming summit of the Americas which
President Bill Clinton has called in Miami in December.
The idea is right, but should be taken still further. The aim must not just
be to ensure these accords do not raise obstacles to hemispheric economic
integration. They must also be consistent with what Latin American countries
have most shied away from during the past half century: integrating
efficiently with the world economy. Here is an agenda item for the World
Trade Organisation.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A choice of large aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dogfight over which aircraft should replace the Royal Air Force's ageing
Hercules transport fleet has so far been mostly confined to snarls and
barks. The two combatants - Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the updated
Hercules, and British Aerospace, potential partner in the flatly-named
European Future Large Aircraft - have mostly settled for emotive newspaper
advertising to make their pitch. But the fighting before a
cross-departmental Whitehall committee this autumn will probably draw real
blood.
Ministers and civil servants have to judge some finely-balanced arguments.
Lockheed contends that its latest generation of Hercules, the C-130J, is an
evolution of the aircraft which has served the RAF and many other air forces
well. Now new technology will cut the crew required, and hence the operating
costs, and improve its performance. Better still, from a cash-strapped
Ministry of Defence's point of view, the aircraft will be available off the
shelf in 1996 at a fixed price.
British Aerospace argues that the Future Large Aircraft will be a more
modern design than the Hercules, which will allow it to operate at lower
cost over its service life. The FLA will be faster and larger, and so can
transport equipment which will not fit into a Hercules. There is also a
large worldwide replacement market for Hercules which the FLA could attack.
More parochially, BAe also fears that, if the UK does not back the FLA, the
other members of the consortium will proceed anyway but that British
companies will be excluded. In particular, BAe may lose its role as
wing-maker to the Airbus consortium, with DASA of Germany taking its place.
Competing claims
In sifting these competing claims, the first decision must be: can Britain
afford to wait for the FLA to arrive? The current Hercules fleet is showing
its age badly. If an accurate assessment shows that the fleet cannot be
maintained at a conscionable cost into the next century, then the FLA is
simply not an option.
A rigorous examination of the development costs of the FLA, and the lifetime
running costs of both aircraft, is also needed. Aerospace manufacturers are
notoriously starry-eyed about the final bills for their big ideas. The
aircraft which was built for less than manufacturer's initial estimate has
yet to fly.
In this Lockheed has a huge advantage, since its aircraft is all but built,
and it stands ready to sign a deal at about Pounds 25m an aircraft with the
MoD. The onus is thus on British Aerospace to prove that its costings are
accurate. That must eventually mean that it is prepared to back its pricing
of the FLA with its own resources.
Firm order
At a bare minimum that would require a fixed price bid from British
Aerospace for a firm order. BAe might also have to underwrite the cost of
maintaining the existing Hercules fleet while waiting for the FLA. In
return, the MoD might have to agree to stop fiddling with the aircraft's
specification, a perennial habit of civil servants which drives up costs of
many programmes.
Definite answers to these questions will take time to establish, and BAe is
hampered because the final feasibility study for the FLA is not due to be
completed before the end of the year. If BAe really thinks that it can
provide adequate answers to the testing questions, then it is perhaps
justified in arguing for more time to make its case.
It is also true that Airbus Industrie, which would manage the FLA project,
has a good recent record. In particular the A340 civil airliner has proved
that the consortium can develop an aircraft which has a strong market in
relatively short order.
However, in arguing for British participation in the FLA, BAe should be
mindful of the risks of fixed-price military contracts to aerospace
companies. Hundreds of millions of dollars written-off by McDonnell Douglas
on its C-17 jet transporter are a graphic reminder of what can go wrong. It
should also remember that it would only be a minority partner in the project
and so not fully able to control its own destiny. If BAe is serious about
pursuing the FLA, it had better make sure that the terms on which it might
settle with the MoD are not ones which the company might live to regret.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Personal View: Capitalism must seize the high ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT A SIRICO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few would dispute that events in the past few years have demonstrated the
practical desirability of markets over socialism. Yet there is good reason
to doubt that capitalism's victory is total. Despite the efforts of many
great economists, political philosophers, and historians, economic liberty
has not captured the moral or high ground in public debate. Thus its
security as a system of economic organisation is not guaranteed anywhere in
the world.
If economic liberty is valued today, it is rarely because it is considered
more just or more proper than any alternative. It is valued primarily on
managerial and technical grounds. We feel free to argue about how many
'jobs' this or that piece of legislation creates; but we remain squeamish
about asking whose property will be used to create these jobs.
An argument over whether there ought to be ceilings on corporate
remuneration centres on whether high salaries are economically justifiable,
but not on whether government ought to have say over such matters. We might
dispute a proposal to force another function on private business on grounds
of cost, but not on grounds of the right and wrong uses of private
enterprise.
Consider the opinions of men and women whose work affords opportunity for
philosophical reflection on morality - the two most prominent being
academics and ecclesiastics. How many among them would be willing to attempt
a moral defence of private property and free markets? How can the
institutions of liberty survive and flourish so long as the moral opinion
makers are so overwhelmingly sympathetic to only one side of the debate?
A secure liberty must be based on a firm moral foundation, and yet the moral
terminology of contemporary political debate is often secretly at war with
liberty. This represents more than linguistic confusion; it represents a
danger to the proper exercise of virtue. Advocates of capitalism and
economic liberty can and must assume the moral high ground.
So long as economic liberty - and its requisite institutions of private
property, free exchange, capital accumulation, contract enforcement - is not
backed by a generally held set of norms by which it can be defended, it
cannot be sustained long-term. Into the moral vacuum left by capitalism's
defenders rush notions hostile to economic liberty, notions drawn largely
from the values and vocabularies of interventionism and socialism.
The link between economic liberty and public morality is more than
suggestive; it is direct. A historian would be hard pressed to identify a
society with a deep and unyielding respect for the sanctity of private
property that did not also have a relatively intact culture. Similarly,
cultural decline, family collapse, and widespread secularisation have
historically corresponded with statism and socialism.
The moral defence of liberty must make a series of distinctions: between
rights and privileges, between society and government, between community and
the collective. Rights, society, and community are all part of the natural
order of liberty. Privileges, government, and the collective are not
entirely separate, but they are essentially different in that they rest on
pre-emptive coercion. In the terminology of the public philosopher Albert
Jay Nock, what is done by political means should not be confused with what
is done by social means.
A moral argument for economic liberty should not shrink from its own logical
implications, however politically unfashionable. An imperative against theft
and in favour of the security of private property must also suggest caution
about taxes above the minimum necessary for the rule of law. Freedom of
contract must include the freedom not to contract. Toleration of individual
differences must include tolerance for the inequality in wealth that will be
the unavoidable result.
It is sometimes said that no one dreams of capitalism. This too must change.
Rightly understood, capitalism is the name for the economic component of the
natural order of liberty. It means wide ownership of property, fair and
equal rules for all, economic security through prosperity, strict adherence
to the boundaries of ownership, opportunity for charity, wise use of
resources, creativity, growth, development, prosperity, abundance, and, most
of all, the economic application of the principle that every human person
has dignity and should have that dignity respected. It is a dream worthy of
our spiritual imaginations.

FT  09 AUG 94 / CBS (Can they all Be Serious?): The likely suitors for the
biggest prize among the US television networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of CBS, the US television network, could not
have been more blunt when he spoke to reporters two weeks ago. 'I'm sending
a signal to Wall Street,' he said. 'I want to make it unequivocal . . . we
have absolutely no intention today of selling CBS.'
Wall Street, however, was not listening. Since Mr Tisch's denial that CBS
was up for sale rumours have mounted about a possible bid for the television
network. Investors anticipating a takeover have bought CBS shares, helping
to push the price up almost 9 per cent from its recent low to about Dollars
315.
Among those mentioned as possible suitors for CBS are the film and
entertainment company Walt Disney, the media magnate Mr Ted Turner, whose
Turner Broadcasting System owns cable television channels such as CNN, and
Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest US cable television operator.
Of these possible candidates, TCI is regarded as the most likely buyer. The
group has said it would be interested in acquiring CBS in partnership with
Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment business executive. Mr Diller, currently
chairman of QVC Network, the cable television home-shopping channel, has
already tried to take control of CBS. But his plans to merge CBS with his
company fell through last month after QVC's largest shareholder, the cable
group, Comcast Communications, took over QVC.
Speculation about a bid for CBS was intensified by Mr Diller's failed plans
 -and Mr Tisch, for all his protesting about newspapers recycling 'tired'
old bid rumours, has inadvertently added to the uncertainty over the
television network's future. When he agreed to the merger with Mr Diller's
QVC, Mr Tisch made it clear the deal would mark the beginning of the end of
his time at CBS. 'I've been here eight years now. I've enjoyed it immensely,
but there's a time when you sort of move on,' said the 71-year-old Mr Tisch.
Now that the merger plan has collapsed, Mr Tisch is having a hard time
convincing Wall Street that he is suddenly interested in running CBS again,
and maintaining its independence.
Though the failed merger plans triggered talk of CBS's sale, the likelihood
is that buyers would anyway have begun circling the television network.
Mr Tisch has turned CBS, once the least successful of the 'big three' US
networks, into a handsomely profitable business. In 1993, it reported record
after-tax profits of Dollars 326.2m on sales of Dollars 3.5bn. CBS shares
rose 53 per cent last year.
Earnings growth has been driven by the core broadcast television group. So
successful is CBS's programming, that the network now ranks first in ratings
during the daytime, prime-time and late night-time periods, a unique treble.
Among its most successful programmes are Late Night with David Letterman,
which dominates late evening chat shows, the comedy programme Murphy Brown
and drama programmes such as Northern Exposure. The company also owns local
television stations and a radio business, both of which make money.
But outsiders also see potential for taking the business into new areas. One
of the most common criticisms of Mr Tisch's reign at CBS is that he has been
too conservative, choosing to concentrate on mainstream broadcasting. 'It's
a great brand name, it has a terrific franchise and tremendous distribution
capability,' says Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at the Wall Street broking
firm Oppenheimer. But she adds: 'There's more that can be done - for
example, CBS never expanded into cable.'
Mr Tisch is also cautious about CBS's finances. He has built up a Dollars
1.1bn cash pile which the group last month announced it plans to use to buy
back 3.5m of its own shares at Dollars 325 a share. The move is seen as
defensive strategy to push up its own share price after the failed QVC
merger but, according to one industry observer, it illustrates Mr Tisch's
'lack of ambition'.
Potential buyers can also legitimately ask whether CBS can maintain its
ratings supremacy. Some of its most popular prime-time shows are beginning
to look a little old, and its sports programming has been hit by the recent
loss of the rights to cover American football games to Mr Rupert Murdoch's
Fox television network. Another set-back was the departure in April of Mr
Jeff Sagansky, the programming executive credited with putting together
CBS's successful schedule.
Such potential weaknesses - as well as CBS's current strengths - will be fed
into the calculations of possible buyers in the next few months as they
decide whether to make an offer. To succeed, a bid would probably cost about
Dollars 6bn.
But for Mr Diller in particular, that may present a big obstacle because, by
himself, he would lack the financial muscle to raise the sums involved. This
is where TCI comes in. It could finance a Diller bid - although Mr Jack
Malone, TCI chairman, has said he would only do so if Mr Laurence Tisch
would sell to them. 'If Larry still wants Barry, and Barry still wants
Larry, the money can be found,' Mr Malone told told New Yorker magazine.
There would be logic to such a move. Mr Diller's managerial and programming
talents, TCI's cable operations, and CBS's broadcasting franchise would mesh
easily.
But although TCI may be the most likely bidder for CBS, others can also see
benefits from buying the network. A merger between Disney and CBS would
bring together two of the strongest brand names in the US entertainment
business. CBS's extraordinary reach across the US (it broadcasts into more
than 99 per cent of the country's television-owning households) would
provide a distribution network for Disney's entertainment products. But any
deal with Disney may be complicated by government rules which restrict links
between film studios and television networks - though these rules are due to
be relaxed in late 1995.
For the other potential bidder, Turner Broadcasting, there would be obvious
benefits in merging a cable programming company with a broadcast network. Mr
Turner has never hidden his ambition to run a network but he cannot move
without the assent of his company's two main shareholders - TCI and Time
Warner - which are unlikely to be so keen on a deal. Time Warner plans to
launch its own television broadcast network and TCI would be unwilling to
give the go-ahead if it had its own plans for CBS.
The competition building to take over CBS may be ominous. For decades US
television was dominated by three broadcasters: CBS, ABC and NBC. Now, with
the arrival of a fourth network in the shape of Mr Murdoch's Fox Television,
two more newcomers on the horizon (Paramount, like Time Warner, plans its
own network), and scores of cable channels providing programming to viewers,
the field has become crowded.
As Mr Richard Grand-Jean, president of the specialist investment banking
firm Global Film Equity, warns: 'You have to ask yourself, with all the
programming becoming available over time, if there are not good reasons to
be cautious about paying very robust prices for a network.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Victims of the past: France's strategy over Algeria is
perilous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a disused army barracks in the village of Folembray, north-east of Paris,
17 Moslem fundamentalists are being detained by the French government. The
targets of a French crackdown on Algerian militants following the deaths of
five French citizens in Algiers last week, the suspected militants have been
served with expulsion orders.
Mr Charles Pasqua, France's hardline interior minister, says the 17 are free
to leave as soon as they find a host country willing to take them. But so
far, there have been no offers and French government officials said
yesterday they had not sought to identify countries which would grant them
political asylum.
If the inmates of Folembray find themselves trapped, their detention also
symbolises the snare in which French policy towards Algeria is tangled.
France's unyielding stance towards Algerian fundamentalists, and its
reluctance to deal with moderate Moslems in its former colony, reveals a
policy rift with its western partners.
More worrying, the latest crackdown has raised threats of reprisals from
Algerian radicals, which some fear could drag France into the bitter and
bloody conflict between the military-led regime in Algiers and its Moslem
fundamentalist opponents. The conflict has claimed the lives of at least
4,000 Algerians and 56 foreigners over the past two years.
The possibility that France may be drawn ever closer to the crisis was
clearly demonstrated at the weekend in a message from the Islamic Salvation
Army (AIS), a militant grouping which is linked to the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS). The FIS was poised to win general elections in 1992, before
they were cancelled by the Algerian government. The Front is now outlawed.
The AIS is demanding the immediate release of the 17 detainees. 'The arrest
and detention of these brothers means that France has declared war on the
FIS and on Algerian Moslems,' the statement said. 'France should renounce
this policy of belligerence or it will assume responsibility for what will
happen.'
The warning is the first issued to France by Algerian radicals, and the
French government is taking it seriously. 'There will be no neglect of the
threat,' said the interior ministry, which responded at the weekend with a
tightening of security measures at railway stations, airports and embassies
and with high-profile police operations to check the identity papers of
motorists.
The response reflects the risks involved. France is anxious to avoid an
eruption of violence among its Algerian community, which has so far remained
aloof from the conflict in the former French colony. An estimated 1m
Algerians live legally in France, with the number pushed higher by illegal
immigrants.
One academic Algerian expert believes it is 'certainly possible' that
fundamentalist guerrilla networks exist and could mount attacks within
France.
But France's tough reaction to last week's attack in Algiers also reflects
its broader, relatively uncompromising policy over the Algerian crisis. Such
a stance has drawn criticism from opponents of France's centre-right
government. The Socialist party has urged dialogue with Moslem moderates in
Algeria, and has criticised Mr Pasqua's high-handed approach. So far,
however, the government's stance appears to have public backing, although
some newspapers, such as Le Monde, argue economic aid to Algeria should
increasingly be linked to political reforms.
France's strategy has highlighted differences with its western partners, who
are more willing to develop contacts with Moslem moderates. One senior US
state department official said last week's killings 'only reinforce the
concern we have that the Algerian government should broaden its political
dialogue' to opposition groups that reject violence. By contrast, Mr Pasqua
stated that the only choice is between the existing, if flawed, regime and a
radical Islamic government. He dismisses as 'rubbish' the idea of a moderate
Islamic government taking power in Algiers.
The rift has become clearer since the attack on the French embassy building
in Algiers. Mr Pasqua accused the UK, the US and Germany of being too
lenient towards Moslem fundamentalists on their soil, a charge rejected by
France's partners. One French foreign ministry official argued that the US
is 'still traumatised' by its experience in Iran and is keen to cultivate
ties with moderate Islamic leaders.
For France, the prospect of a radical Islamic government in Algiers is of
acute concern. In addition to fears shared by other nations of a domino
effect across the Maghreb, France is anxious to avoid an influx of thousands
of immigrants from its former colony should a radical government come to
power.
With unemployment at 12.7 per cent and with anti-immigration parties such as
the Front National winning about 10 per cent of the vote in most regional
and national elections, a big influx of refugees from Algeria could
exacerbate social tensions in France. 'It must be a great concern,' says one
western diplomat in Paris, 'particularly if one considers the localised
effects in areas such as Marseilles, where there is already a large Algerian
and North African community.'
France's gamble is that, by providing qualified political support for the
existing regime in Algeria and supplying finance to ease its economic
plight, this possibility can be avoided. Earlier this year, France agreed to
the rescheduling of Dollars 5bn of the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt
to the Paris Club creditor nations.
The stakes of the gamble, however, are rising ever higher. An upsurge in
violence in Algeria since the lull this spring supports the admission of Mr
Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, that 'the status quo is no longer
tenable'.
In terms of French policy, last week's attack has made the status quo still
harder to maintain. But by treating the Algerian crisis as a security issue,
as demonstrated by the latest clampdown, the French government risks
creating the instability at home that it is so anxious to avoid.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Programme Africa itself wants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SHADRACK NDAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Holman's article on the United Nations Industrial Development
Organisation ('UNloved, UNwanted', August 4) misses a number of points about
the Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA). It isn't strictly a
Unido programme: the African countries themselves want it, are committed to
it and are primarily responsible for carrying it out. Moreover, all
countries, developed and developing, supported its adoption.
Unquestionably, Africa's industrialisation is a difficult task. But the
alternative is one no one would wish for: a continent forever dependent on
external aid and intervention. A concentration on Africa's industrialisation
is an attempt to get beyond the short-term solutions, and instead, through
rising standards of living, to offer longer-term market possibilities for
all countries.
Unido's direct resources for IDDA programmes are small, but we give all the
support we can. Our main activities are entirely demand oriented - funded
through UNDP, bilateral donors, and, increasingly, the private sector
itself. We are given this work because we are seen to have skills and
resources that are needed for Africa's industrialisation, just as in other
parts of the world. Michael Holman may find this risible, but it is a fact,
and it keeps us busy.
I'm sorry he didn't like the 1983 document he quoted. We could provide him
with some later ones. In a multi-cultural environment, our prose does tend
to get rather heavy, and the style hardly matches A A Milne's. We were
compared with Pooh Bear, at least not with Eeyore.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pay formula to unlock rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor W P BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The frustration of the present railway dispute is all the greater
because the ingredients exist for a settlement from which all parties can
gain. There is considerable scope to increase the productivity of signalmen
both by matching staffing on all shifts to present workloads and by treating
signalmen more as controllers of the system with greater responsibility for
decision-making at times of disruption and for spreading information to
users of the system.
With such an upgrading of the role of signalmen in the larger and more
modern signal boxes, the number of supervisors could be reduced with
significant economy. Looking to the future, the latest electronic technology
will open the door to further productivity enhancement.
But the union won't talk about the future until its claim about past
productivity has been recognised. The signalmen themselves feel aggrieved
because less responsible workers, like those on station platforms, have
already benefited from pay restructuring and increased earnings.
There is a way forward which is likely to be acceptable to the union, will
unlock discussions about future productivity and will reassure government,
which is legitimately concerned that pay settlements above the level of
inflation should be self-financing.
This consists of paying to the signalmen a settlement which will amount to
something like 5.7 per cent on basic rates. This will consist of the 3.2 per
cent already on the table plus a lump sum of about Pounds 300. The lump sum
would be consolidated into basic rates for one year only. In subsequent
years the funding of the lump sum would come, as a first charge, from the
new productivity agreement.
As a condition of the offer, the union would give an undertaking to enter
into a full-time working party to consider, in detail, the productivity
deal, and to conclude those discussions by the end of August. The results
would be put to a ballot of all signalmen to be concluded by the end of
September.
If some jobs are to be lost, attention will need to be given to providing an
attractive severance package but in an industry with a high age profile this
should not be difficult.
The risks attached to all parties - government, Railtrack and the union - in
the above procedure are small and the undertaking that it would be for the
signalmen themselves to ballot on the outcome of the productivity working
party will give everyone an incentive to be imaginative in their
deliberations.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Arts: Portraiture seen in its own right - At the National
Portrait Gallery Susan Moore is drawn to the faces for clues to history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A national portrait collection is unlike any other art gallery. Here, it is
the subject of a work of art that counts; artistic merit a happy accident.
As the aspiring young British history painter Benjamin Robert Haydon put it
in 1817: 'Portraiture is always independent of art and has little or nothing
to do with it.'
A portrait may easily indicate the wealth or status of a sitter, and offer a
fair likeness. It may also reveal something of his or her character. The
Romantic notion of the genius artist as uniquely capable of divining and
representing the essence of an individual lingers on. We scan faces for
clues to history.
Where better to search for clues than in portrait drawings, the most
immediate - and often the most intimate - response of artist to sitter? Some
100 rarely exhibited drawings from the collection of the National Portrait
Gallery in London have returned home from a North American tour and a
selection is now on show in St Martin's Place. This disparate display,
ranging from Nicholas Hilliard's keep-sake iconic miniature of the Virgin
Queen to Kitaj's pastel of the art historical knight Ernst Gombrich, is
utterly compelling. Unlike other exhibitions, the captions are almost as
rewarding as the works of art.
At one extreme is the slick, formulaic chalk of Charles Dickens by one
Samuel Laurence, the quintessential anodyne portrait that tells us nothing
but shows that, in terms of portraiture, the great and the good do not
invariably get their just deserts. In contrast, the 18th century poet
William Cowper could not have hoped for a more sympathetic recording angel
than George Romney.
Romney considered this rare pastel as the nearest he had come to a perfect
representation of life and character, and had taken great pains to express
what he had often witnessed, 'the poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling'. That
said, informal attire - no wig - and the suggestion of a keen, nervous
sensibility (Cowper was a manic depressive) were conventions widely applied
to the portraits of writers and artists of the period.
No lesser witness to the 18th century physiognomist's premise that character
can be read in a face is the head of Somerset Maugham. Graham Sutherland
offers an incisive analysis of the hard, thin lines that scour and sour the
writer's face. Sutherland spoke of dovetailing the diverse and complex forms
into a single rhythm that suggested 'the maximum action in repose'. In
Lucian Freud's no less impressive study of the recumbent Arnold Goodman,
scrutiny of form appears an end in itself. This is not a portrait of a
distinguished law lord. From Freud's peculiar vantage point, Lord Goodman's
head is simply an intriguing mass of fleshy folds, crags and cavernous
nostrils complemented by wisps of untamed hair.
Freud could never be accused of flattering his sitters. Not so Henry Lamb,
who perhaps can be forgiven his outrageous if tentative idealisation of the
Hapsburg features of his formidable mistress, Lady Ottoline Morrell. (John
Singer Sargent, a seasoned hand at phiz-mongering, animated the mannish
features of the composer Dame Ethel Smyth by imploring her to sing the 'most
desperately exciting songs' she knew.) Elsewhere there is ample evidence of
the advantages of some intimacy between artist and sitter. In the presence
of Gwen Raverat, known since childhood, a young John Maynard Keynes sits
reading, relaxed and oblivious to the artist's intent gaze. William Holman
Hunt described his pencil portrait by Millais as 'totally different from all
other sketches which my friends have done being unlike either a murderer, or
a beer drinking pickpocket.' Edward Burney's watercolour of his older
musician brother, Charles, playing the fiddle, is an astonishingly tender
expression of fraternal affection.
Ultimately, it is only in the self-portrait that the artist is both
intimately familiar with his subject and under no obligation to pull his
punches. We detect an old man's apprehension in the touchingly direct chalk
on blue paper of the 70-year-old portrait painter, art theorist and
collector Jonathan Richardson the Elder. Sir George Hayter belongs more to
the Albrecht Durer school of self-portraiture. Arm in a sling after a riding
accident, he cuts a romantic figure in his vaguely exotic dress, languidly
puffing on an oriental pipe.
David Bomberg, in contrast, is quite sure that he does not like what he sees
in the mirror.
The exhibition, sponsored by Philip Mould, Historical Portraits, continues
until October 23.

Wagner who swim with grey seals in the North Sea; Derek and Pauline Harrison
who attempt at their Lake District hotel to feed red squirrels and not grey;
and businessman Mike Warburg who breeds great crested newts in Chorleywood

to their being ostracised, is Eric Laithwaite, former Professor of
Electrical Engineering at Imperial College. His heresy is a belief in
gyroscopic propulsion which appears to challenge Newton's laws. Last month

FT  09 AUG 94 / Arts: Agongo: an opera in the making - Jane Mulvagh reports
on Damien Hirst's first venture into this medium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Live rats suspended in a cage, a snake and an indefinable embryo - Damien
Hirst, the enfant terrible of contemporary British sculpture, is at it
again. This time, however, his chosen medium is opera. Firefly Productions,
a new young multi-media creative team, presents the overture and finale of
its new opera Agongo at the Edinburgh Festival next Sunday alongside Hirst's
installation for the piece.
The opera preview, at the Demarco European Arts Foundation, is part of
Firefly's drive to raise Pounds 300,000 to complete the production. Its
full-length debut is to be held at the Union Chapel, Islington, in May next
year and there are plans to take it to Berlin, New York, Venice and Sydney.
Firefly Productions is the brain-child of young art dealer Daniel Moynihan,
who has commissioned talents from across the range of the arts to create an
opera based on an environmental short story he wrote 15 years ago. The music
is by Mark Springer and Sarah Sarhandi. Piano and viola performers
respectively, Springer and Sarhandi set up the high-energy band Rip, Rig and
Panic, which has recorded with Virgin Records. The sets are by Hirst; the
costumes by Japanese fashion designer, Kohji Tatsuno; and Julian Hope, with
experience at Glyndebourne and the Welsh National Opera, will direct. Hope's
influence will, it is suggested, temper the assortment of radical talents to
meet the inter-disciplinary rigours of opera.
The Edinburgh taster suggests that Hirst's visceral observations on modern
life and Moynihan's bleak libretto will be counterbalanced by the beautiful
lyricism of Springer and Sarhandi's score. In a 35 square foot room the
viewer will walk round a 25 square foot cage suspended at head height.
The cage confines live rats bedded down in bottles and is suspended over,
but cut off from, a verdant jungle beneath which an indefinable embryo
struggles to be born.
A series of neon-lit images - a snake, a capsule, a tablet - hang on the
walls and the 15 minute experience is supported by a synchronised light show
'playing to' the overture and finale. According to Moynihan, the opera's
theme dwells on man's mindless adherence to tyrants who exploit any belief -
science, medicine, environmentalism - for self-aggrandisement. A tribal
chief, Agongo, is in the thrall of a dwarf who controls the tribe by
metamorphosing from witch doctor to Russian general and finally to western
surgeon, wreaking havoc with broken promises.
The music fuses conventional instruments with sounds of the jungle and the
industrial world. Sections of the score focus on solo players - a clarinet
plays over the dawn chorus, for example - while the libretto includes
confrontational raps, with one singer chanting a mantra of diseases in Latin
while another retorts with surgical and pharmaceutical palliatives to the
accompaniment of respirator machines. Neither side is granted victory, but
there is hope that Agongo may become a 'green' man.
This cautiously proselytising work is targeted at the kind of audience which
might attend Philip Glass operas or Michael Clark ballets and Moynihan hopes
that commercial sponsors - fashion labels or ice cream brands, perhaps -
eager to ally themselves to modish issues and target a specific age group
and lifestyle, might see marketing benefits here.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Arts: A lost 'Cry' from the past - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a double Prom on Friday, and its late second concert attracted
many new arrivals after the first: not the usual way around. That was
because the second concert consisted entirely of Giles Swayne's 1979 Cry,
eighty minutes' worth of 28 amplified voices - the BBC Singers - being put
sonorously, slowly and meditatively through quite difficult hoops.
Cry is, or was, almost a 'cult' piece. By the late 1970s, Swayne was not the
only composer to feel disillusioned with academic music (mostly
post-serialism then) and with avant-garde coteries. After flirting with
rock, he found his inspiration in the folk music of Africa, where he has
since gone to live. The outcome was Cry, a musical 'creation-myth' which
rejected the formal devices of Western music in favour of vocalisation and
native rhythms.
Originally it depended exclusively upon the voices. A 1980 version made use
of amplification, and a 1982 one subjected the voices to electronic
'treatment' as well, revised for the 1983 Prom performance. That was the
form in which Cry made its famous impact: a suggestive hubbub of voices
with a slow rate of change, rendered monumental and even magical by
state-of-the-art electronics.
It has not worn well. As aids to meditation for non-specialist audiences
(probably stoned), long minimalist pieces have the advantage of instant
familiarity; for 'visionary' appeal, Tavener and Gorecki have achieved more
with simple Western harmonies. The special sounds of Cry are
not so special now. (Nor, this
time round, did they seem so haunting: high sopranos in forte wore a hard
amplified glare, and the intricate subsidiary voices were often not enhanced
but muddied by the electronics.) Above all, Cry seems innocent of any
structure that would sustain its ambitious length.
The earlier concert, if more Western-conventional, was happier. Kent Nagano
conducted the Halle Orchestra in a programme that ran from Elgar to Berg,
and showed how well he and the Manchester band understand each other now.
If Elgar's Introduction and Allegro for strings sounded unwontedly vehement,
that was more interesting than the languid glow that some conductors think
right for it; and Berg's extremely difficult Three Pieces were handled with
great subtlety and delicacy, despite the huge thwack at the end.
In Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen the soloist was Hakan Hagegard,
whose baritone had a raw expressive edge that sounded wonderfully apt for
all that innocent pain. These are songs that too often get ultra-smooth,
cultivated treatment. As for Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia antartica, which
shows all the marks of the film-music (for Scott of the Antarctic) from
which the 80-year-old composer developed it, it makes a pleasant, kitschy,
undemanding listen. Susan Gritton's wordless soprano was a positive asset.

FT  09 AUG 94 / People: Strategic move for London Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange, once the English gentleman's bastion, has
appointed an American woman, Fields Wicker-Miurin, 36, to the newly created
post of director of strategy and finance.
The Exchange is facing increasing competition both at home - from
alternative trading systems - and abroad - from other exchanges which are
increasingly challenging London's role as the centre of cross-border
share-trading. Mike Lawrence, the chief executive, created the position as
part of a wide-ranging shake-up at the Exchange and the executive has spent
six months seeking a suitable candidate.
'The main challenge is to make sure we can maintain our leading position in
European and global securities markets,' Wicker-Miurin says, describing her
new job.
For Lawrence, described by the City's old guard as 'not one of us', the
appointment may be a bit of a gamble, although Wicker-Miurin's credentials
are impeccable.
A native of North Carolina with an MA in international economics and
European studies from Johns Hopkins University, Wicker-Miurin also studied
at the Institute d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. She has lived and worked in
Europe since February 1987, when she was sent to Luxembourg by Core States
Financial, a large regional bank then known as Philadelphia National Bank,
to establish a European operation.
At that time, like many big US commercial banks, Core States Financial had
aspirations to use its banking relationships to build a distribution base
for commercial paper and other types of securities. However, Core States,
along with many of its competitors, found the strategy wrong and the bank
withdrew.
But Wicker-Miurin stayed, and signed on as a strategy consultant with
Strategic Planning Consultants, now part of Mercer Management Consultants
where her clients were leading UK and international investment banks and
insurance companies.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Technology: Helping to ease the daily grind - Toyota is
using automation to aid its workers, rather than replace them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Henry Ford devised a system to mass produce cars, manufacturers
worldwide have struggled with the problem of how to make the grind of the
factory-line both efficient and worker-friendly.
Toyota, the world's second largest car maker, believes it has found
something close to the ideal in a system it has devised which aims to
combine the optimum level of human labour and automation.
First crystallised at Toyota's factory in Kyushu, which began operating last
year, the company's latest thinking on the production process also formed
the basis for a recent revamping of the Motomachi factory where it
manufactures its popular recreational vehicle, RAV4.
The philosophy behind the production process adopted at Kyushu and Motomachi
stems from the conviction that human labour is best suited to fulfilling the
demanding task of assembly, the last stage of the manufacturing process
where the manufacturer has its closest contact point with the customer.
'In manufacturing, there needs to be a kind of communication between the
maker of the product and those who use it,' explains Mikio Kitano, a Toyota
director in charge of production engineering. This communication is
important for car makers to ascertain whether their cars are made to meet
the needs of their customers, Kitano believes. Hence the importance of
having workers, who can represent customers, in control of the assembly
process. Only human employees can really tell if a door fits perfectly or if
the steering wheel feels right, Kitano says.
At Motomachi, although assembly is the most labour-intensive part of the
production process, there are no large, sophisticated robots visible in the
assembly area. Instead, workers appear to be doing most of the work with the
help of simple machines.
'It is sad to leave everything up to automation and not be fully involved in
the work,' notes Kitano. 'People have to be the centre of the work.'
At Motomachi, the assembly line where the car's wiring is installed employs
about 20 people, each with assigned tasks, involving very little automation.
This apparently greater reliance on human labour, however, does not mean
that machines are shunned altogether. Automation is used as liberally at
Motomachi as at Toyota's most highly automated factory in Tahara, in central
Japan.
The 30 processes that are automated at Tahara are also mostly automated at
Motomachi, Kitano points out. 'Overall, the level of automation is about the
same, but the kind of automation that is used is different.'
Instead of the vast, supposedly intelligent robots found in highly automated
factories, the machines used at Motomachi are designed to perform specific
and relatively limited functions to help the workers.
'My belief is that where people find it uncomfortable to do the work, it
should be left up to machines,' Kitano says. 'The main purpose of automation
is to relieve the burden on the workers.'
In a further attempt to make assembly work more satisfying, Toyota has
divided the work into groups, with a team in charge of each group of tasks.
At Motomachi, assembly does not take place on a long assembly line from
start to finish, with each worker doing several, unrelated tasks. Instead,
the process has been divided into five lines according to different
functions or sections of the car. The intention is to give workers a
stronger feeling that they have made an important contribution to the
manufacturing of the car.
A conveyor belt now carries the workers along the line with the car they are
working on, instead of trotting to keep up with the car as it moves down the
line.
This latest approach to the manufacturing process that Toyota has adopted is
in striking contrast to the dominant thinking of a few years ago that
propelled many car makers into sophisticated and costly automation.
Toyota was not an exception to the trend. In 1991, it, too, built a highly
automated factory in Tahara at great cost and installed robots and
sophisticated machines.
However, it soon discovered that placing too much importance on machines was
a mistake. Not only did the need for specialists to run and maintain the
high-tech machines mean that automation did not achieve its main goal of
cutting labour costs, but those workers who had always worked at the factory
felt intimidated by sophisticated machines they could not operate.
Automation also led to many mechanical problems as Toyota discovered that
'machines break down easily', Kitano says. By restricting machines to those
that make work easier for the workers, Toyota was also able to revamp
Motomachi at considerably less cost than at Tahara. Automation at Motomachi
cost the company a third of what it cost at Tahara, Kitano notes.
Another simple idea has enabled Toyota to realise the same effect as a
highly automated line at a fraction of the cost. At Tahara, the lines raise
and lower the cars at different stages of the manufacturing process, so that
the workers no longer have to bend or stretch.
Introducing that system wholesale into Motomachi would have been expensive.
But rather than give up the idea, Toyota raised the floors with planks to
elevate workers at certain points and trenches were built to lower them at
others.
'Personnel costs are not that different at the three plants, so the
difference in the costs of the machines is the difference in the overall
costs,' Kitano explains.
So far, Motomachi has been a great success, Kitano believes. A doubling of
production from an initial 2,000 a month to more than 4,000, due to the
popularity of the RAV4, has been achieved smoothly.
The number of workers overall has increased as a result of the production
increase, but the number of workers per car has not. 'Although such an
increase usually results in workers demanding more automation, my workers
are not complaining,' Kitano says cheerfully.

Kevin Leech has been appointed chairman of Flag-stone Holdings, the
USM-traded leisure company, which last week reported a big drop in 1993/94
losses. Leech has exercised his option to purchase 20 per cent of the
company from David Kirch for Pounds 2.2m, equivalent to 1.5p per share.
Flagstone shares closed  1/4 p higher at 2p yesterday.
Kirch's interests on the board are represented by Kenneth Ineson, who is
away from the UK. Kirch has undertaken to procure Ineson's resignation on
his return.
Under the board reorganisation, Stuart Sim, group finance director of ML
Laboratories who was yesterday also appointed deputy chief executive, has
been appointed a non-executive director; John Harding and Andrew Duquemin
have resigned.
Sim says Leech would be reviewing the company strategy and taking a 'hands
on' approach to the growth of the business which, he says, has just returned
to a 'modest level of profitability'.

FT  09 AUG 94 / People: Philip Wroughton: hotly tipped
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Old Etonian Philip Wroughton, a former High Sheriff of Berkshire, is having
a rather good August. Last week he was elected vice chairman of Marsh &amp;
McLennan Companies, the biggest and most respected of the world's insurance
brokers, and a day later his new racehorse, Landlord, won its first race at
London's Kempton Park.
It may be the last race that Wroughton watches for some time. As chairman of
CT Bowring and a member of the Council of Lloyd's, he will be required to
divide most of his time between New York and London in his new job as de
facto number two to Ian Smith, 60, who took over as Marsh &amp; McLennan's
chairman just over two years ago.
Wroughton, 61, who joined Bowring in 1961, has stepped down as chairman of
Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc, parent of the group's worldwide insurance broking
operations, and will be responsible for developing and pursuing new growth
opportunities in insurance and reinsurance broking businesses.
He will work closely with the heads of Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc, Guy Carpenter,
Seabury &amp; Smith and Frizell Financial Services.
Although there is a reasonably strict separation between insurance and
reinsurance operations in the US, it is not as delineated in other markets
around the world. There are 'significant opportunities for working more
closely together', says Wroughton, who will be Smith's senior adviser on
insurance matters.
Wroughton's promotion helps fill a gap which has existed since earlier this
year when Robert Clements, 61, stepped down as the group's president in
order to concentrate on running Marsh &amp; McLennan Risk Capital Corporation
which was set up in 1992 to help alleviate shortages in insurance
underwriting capacity.
Clements had been vice chairman for a brief period before becoming president
in 1992.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Technology: Explosive growth in infection stalks Asia -
International Aids Conference / Paul Abrahams highlights the most recent
findings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The terrifying epidemiological context of the 10th International Conference
on Aids, which yesterday had its first full day, was set out by Michael
Merson, executive director of the World Health Organisation's global
programme on Aids.
In spite of the efforts of governments and agencies, 3m people worldwide
were infected with HIV during the last 12 months, said Merson. By
conservative estimates that makes 17m people.
Nearly 60 per cent of all infections - more than 10m - were in sub-Saharan
Africa, he said. In the Masaka district of Uganda, Aids accounts for nearly
half of all deaths. In young adults under 35, only one death in 10 is not
HIV-related.
In Asia the rate of growth of HIV prevalence was alarming, Merson said.
Since the Aids conference in Berlin last year, more than 1m people have been
infected by HIV in south and south-east Asia alone.
In Thailand, infections had increased tenfold since 1990. About 4 per cent
of all military recruits in that country are infected and 1.5 per cent of
women attending ante-natal clinics. In Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, 20 per
cent of young men and 8 per cent of women are infected.
As for the disease rather than infection, 1m cases had been reported in 190
countries. Merson said that was an underestimate. He estimated that about 4m
had developed the disease by June this year - an increase of 60 per cent on
the same period last year. He warned that the World Health Organisation
expected the cumulative total to reach 10m people by the end of the decade.
Merson warned that governments should not use costs as an excuse for
inaction. 'Implementing basic prevention programmes in Asia would cost
between Dollars 750m (Pounds 484m) and Dollars 1.5bn and could prevent 5m
infections by 2000.
'The economic benefit that could result from prevention on such a scale is
difficult to estimate, but it is massive in comparison with the investment
needed. For Thailand alone the cost of Aids and HIV will be Dollars 11bn,'
said Merson.
Public health campaigns have had an effect. In Thailand such programmes were
achieving impressive results. A sharp rise in the use of condoms had led to
a 77 per cent fall in reports of sexually transmitted disease between 1986
and 1993. Efforts in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, had led to a 63 per cent
fall between 1990 and 1993.
With the Aids epidemic gathering pace - 10 years after the discovery of HIV
and its role in Aids - there was a rising pessimism among patients and
frustration among scientists about how to defeat the virus, said Bob Gallo
of the US National Cancer Insti-tute.
Present therapies are clearly inadequate. The difficulties of treating HIV
with anti-retrovirals, the only drugs licensed for HIV, such as Wellcome's
AZT and Bristol-Myers Squibb's ddI, were outlined by Stefano Vella of the
Instituto Superiore Di Saneta in Italy.
Vella explained the advantages of treating HIV-positive individuals before
they developed Aids symptoms. Although most infected individuals show no
symptoms, the latent disease nevertheless continues to destroy the lymph
system.
The problem, Vella explained, was that the Anglo-French Concorde study and
more recently the ACTG 019 trial showed that the long-term benefit of using
anti-retrovirals such as AZT was at best transient.
The pessimism surrounding AZT was similar to that which surrounded
streptomycin, a tuberculosis drug, in the early 1950s. One medical journal
argued that the drug was ineffective; in fact it worked but needed to be
used in combination with others.
'We are now turning to combination therapy for HIV and Aids. That is the
obvious future for treatment. It's obvious today; it wasn't a few years
ago,' Vella said.
Preliminary results from a study, called ACTG 229, showed that AZT when used
with Roche's ddC and another Roche drug Saquinavir, was more effective than
therapies using one or two drugs.
Such triple therapy should be given early, and preferably to patients who
had not had AZT before and so had not built up resistance to the drug, said
Vella. When patients had had no previous therapy, the amount of virus in the
blood fell to zero, and the patient's CD4 count - a measure of the
performance of the immune system - rose.
Most importantly, by combining the drugs there appeared to be a delay in the
ability of the virus to build up resistance to AZT and Saquinavir. Vella
stressed the data was preliminary, but encouraging.
These theories and possible treatments remain far beyond the financial means
of the vast majority of HIV-positive individuals.
An example of the plight of such people was given by Mohamed Hasan, chairman
of the Arab International Centre for Fighting Aids in Cairo.
His paper Sexual behaviour of inhabitants of cemeteries in Cairo was a model
of its kind. He interviewed 930 adolescents and young adults living in the
small cemetery courtyards of Cairo. Hasan found 42 per cent of girls were
sexually active by the age of 14. About 5 per cent were HIV-positive. For
them any progress in high-tech retrovirals announced this week will simply
be academic.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): New lease on life - The
growing popularity of asset-based financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ian Dyson wanted to start a Sheffield bus company in 1990, he was faced
with a problem. He and his three partners, all former senior depot managers
for the nationalised bus company, had little money and less collateral. To
achieve critical mass they needed at least 15 double-decker buses.
The solution was to buy 12-year-old vehicles - but who would finance such
aged assets? After exploring a number of cul-de-sacs, including bank loans,
Dyson found Close Asset Finance, a specialist leasing company.
Whereas banks were not interested in his collateral, Close Asset Finance
took a view on the residual value of the assets in the event of default,
entered a hire-purchase arrangement and Sheffield Omnibus was born. Four
years later, the company has 85 buses, employs 220 people full-time and is
still using leasing for its asset financing.
'We would not have had a business without hire purchase when we started,'
says Dyson. 'As a new company we were aware we would not get the best deal
but as they (Close) have got to know us the deals have got better.'
This form of asset-based financing has had some heavy-weight support in the
past few months. Recognising that UK companies are too dependent on
overdraft, the governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the
exchequer have suggested that they consider other sources. Factoring was one
option for financing working capital; leasing another route for financing
the assets.
During 1993, some Pounds 13.5bn was provided by members of the Finance and
Leasing Association, a significant proportion to smaller companies. While
this is an impressive figure, there would appear to be scope for
significantly more.
According to Michael Maberly, managing director of Lombard Business Finance,
part of Lombard, the UK's largest financing group, British industry has yet
to translate its short-term optimism into higher levels of investment.
Those businesses that are investing, however, are changing the way they like
deals to be financed. Driven by lower interest rates, more companies are
opting for hire purchase - which allows them to take control of the asset -
rather than the straight finance lease.
Companies such as VIP Colour Ltd, a management buy-out from East Midlands
Electricity early this year, are discovering that hire purchase is barely
more expensive than finance leasing where the asset reverts to the lessor
company at the end of the lease. As a result, hire purchase contracts grew
by 38 per cent to Pounds 6.06bn in the year to June 1994 while leasing grew
by only one per cent to Pounds 5.22bn, according to the association.
Some parts of the industry also hope to offer more operating leases. These
allow the lessor to factor in the residual value of the assets which it will
reclaim at the end of the contract so it can offer the lessee lower rental
payments.
Leasing companies are developing reputations for financing certain classes
of assets. Close Asset Finance has ties with Heidelberg, the German printing
equipment manufacturer, and is known for its familiarity with the
second-hand printing machinery market.
Lombard Business Finance, on the other hand, has chosen to enter a joint
venture with GATX, the San Francisco-based leasing company. The US group
will bring expertise in assessing asset values and, in some cases, will
provide Lombard with guarantees of residual values on assets it might
otherwise feel unable to finance.
'If you are going to run operating leases you have to understand what you do
when you get the assets back and what after-markets there are,' says
Maberly.
Certain assets are likely to remain off-limits even to specialised financing
companies. The residual value of hi-tech investments such as computers is
probably something only the manufacturer will be fully equipped to assess.
Such deals will remain the preserve of financing companies that support
equipment suppliers.
A decision by finance houses to specialise more, and therefore better
understand after-markets for second-hand assets, should open up a new source
of finance for companies, particularly start-ups. Businessmen who have used
financing companies also suggest it is a more flexible option than a bank
loan.
Take Sheffield Omnibus which is again expanding its bus fleet. 'I would not
dream of going to the bank and asking them to lend me money,' says Dyson.
In five years, he says, his finance house will allow him to trade in his old
buses and lease new vehicles on the same day so his service will barely be
disrupted. A bank, on the other hand, would demand that he repay the loan
before granting a new one to replace the buses, he says. 'That is where the
finance houses are head and shoulders above the banks. But the bank will
lend me money for the depot - it's horses for courses.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Failed directors beware -
Disqualifications are poised to increase in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulators are sharpening their teeth for an altogether more aggressive
approach towards the conduct of those in charge of insolvent companies.
The Department of Trade and Industry plans to increase considerably the
number of directors of failed companies that it seeks to have disqualified.
It is also acting to ensure that insolvency practitioners in the private
sector take a tougher line in providing the information to bring
disqualification proceedings.
The changes follow a critical report last year from the National Audit
Office, the Whitehall watchdog, suggesting that too few directors were
disqualified as a proportion of companies that collapse.
The NAO suggested that the DTI's Insolvency Service was acting against only
about half the directors identified by practitioners or its own staff as
candidates for disqualification.
For two consecutive years, the service has been given extra resources for
disqualification work. It is also clearing a backlog of outstanding cases.
In the 12 months to the end of March, while there were more than 20,000
company insolvencies, only 464 cases were brought for disqualification, as
well as 257 prosecution reports on companies and 392 on personal
bankruptcies.
In stark contrast, in a parliamentary answer in June, Neil Hamilton,
minister for corporate affairs, said there were likely to be 750 to 800
disqualification petitions this year. There will also be what the service
calls a 'significant' increase in prosecutions.
Even this level will be below the rule of thumb used by many insolvency
practitioners, who estimate that about 10 per cent of the directors of
failed companies deserve to be disqualified.
Ian Bond, an insolvency partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that
difficulties in identifying miscreant directors are compounded by how hard
it can be to make a case in court.
'One of the problems is that there hasn't been enough publicity to get
directors really frightened,' he says.
Insolvency practitioners must fill out 'D-forms' or conduct reports on all
directors connected to the companies on which they are working. They comment
and tick a box if they believe disqualification should take place.
The Insolvency Service is putting pressure on practitioners to ensure that
they provide sufficient information to make the basis of the case to
prosecute a director.
Practitioners make their recommendations for disqualification based on
guidelines from the Insolvency Service which directors would do well to
heed. Those deemed important in judging whether a director is not 'fit and
proper' to run another company include:
Misfeasance or breach of duty: whether the directors have received money for
services other than remuneration which has resulted in a loss to the
company; authorised payments to themselves; undisclosed transactions which
resulted in loss.
Failure to comply with the Companies Act requirements to keep and preserve
accounting records and information such as statutory registers and returns.
Misappropriation or retention of company monies or property.
Transactions defrauding creditors.
When the company has become insolvent, factors for practitioners to consider
include:
Causes of failure and insolvency.
Trading without regard to the interests of creditors.
Trading without reasonable prospect of payment of creditors' claims.
Use of 'phoenix' companies where assets, customers or trading style may
resemble closely those in a previous company.
Taking payments or deposits if the directors know the company is insolvent.
Undervaluing transactions, preferences and dispositions of property.
Duty of the directors to assist the insolvency practitioners in their work.
The insolvency practitioner will also consider the sums at stake and the
degree of public interest in disqualification.
If the rules are introduced and the Insolvency Service prosecutes, directors
who have not paid heed may find themselves in prison, or banned from taking
on new directorships for as many years as the courts decide.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Buy-outs take a tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management buy-out activity was considerably more robust last year in
continental Europe than it was in the UK, according to a review* published
today.
While the total number of deals - including those below Ecu10m (Pounds
7.87m) - fell marginally to 374 deals in 1993, the value increased by 5 per
cent to Pounds 3.1bn, according to the report produced by Initiative Europe
and the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at Nottingham University*.
By comparison, the volume of UK deals fell from 506 to 477 deals and the
value fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 2.85bn. France, the most mature
continental market, saw the sharpest decline, with deal volume and value
down from 1990 peaks as the largest deals dried up.
But Initiative Europe says that the country's tax laws which make it
punitive for family controlled companies to be passed from one generation to
another - the issue of transmission d'entreprises - should provide a steady
flow of opportunities for management buy-outs and buy-ins.
Overall in continental Europe, the recession has not led corporations in
financial difficulty to shed non-core assets to repay borrowings at the
speed seen by their UK counterparts.
But the recession has led to fewer small deals being financed and investment
houses concentrating on doing fewer larger deals. This helped buy-out
activity to remain roughly constant despite the deterioration in the
economies of continental Europe.
While buy-outs were flat, the volume of management buy-ins increased by 60
per cent in the first half of 1994. The review finds that the technique is
particularly appropriate where incumbent management of a family-owned
company is not capable of leading a buy-out.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Shake-up for UK underwriters after
Lords ruling - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK insurance law permitting underwriters to reject claims because of
misrepresentation or non-disclosure has been substantially altered following
a House of Lords judgment.
In Pine Top v Pan Atlantic, the Lords upheld the right of reinsurer Pine Top
to refuse claims made in 1982 because of Pan Atlantic's claims history prior
to then.
However, the Lords ruled that insured parties can defeat underwriters' right
to refuse claims on the grounds of non-disclosure or misrepresentation if
they can prove that had the underwriter known the full facts at the time,
they would still have taken on the business on the same terms.
The ruling will have serious consequences for underwriters, say insurance
lawyers. Mr Robert Viney of Davies Arnold Cooper, a London law firm, said
underwriters may have to testify as to what induced them to write a
particular risk and be cross-examined about their underwriting practices.
Insured parties are also likely to make sweeping requests for disclosure of
underwriting files in an attempt to prove their cases, he said.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Export ban illegal even if not applied
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A clause prohibiting exports by its very nature restricted competition even
if it was not actually implemented by the parties, the Court of First
Instance held recently. The Court also found fines could be imposed on
undertakings even if they were not aware they had infringed EC competition
provisions. Finally, it was held that, when imposing such a fine, the
Commission should only consider the turnover derived from products to which
the infringement related, as opposed to undertakings' total turnover.
These findings were made in two cases before the Court relating to a
distribution agreement between Parker Pen Ltd and Herlitz AG of Germany.
Herlitz had refused to supply a Dutch company with Parker products because
of a distribution agreement clause banning exports outside Germany. The
Dutch company complained to the Commission, resulting in the imposition of
fines on both Parker and Herlitz. Both challenged the Commission decision
before the CFI.
Herlitz argued it was not dealing with Parker products on a wholesale basis
but only sought to complete its own range of products of office equipment
which it merely delivered to its own retail shops. Hence Herlitz never
intended actually to trade in Parker products, which is why it had neither
the interest nor the intention of preventing parallel imports by relying on
the export ban clause. The sole purpose of this clause was to enable Herlitz
politely to refuse unwelcome demands. Also, the ban had no practical effect
as Herlitz's products suited only German-speakers.
The CFI held an export ban, by its nature, restricted competition. The mere
existence of such a clause could create a 'visual and psychological' effect
sufficient to make it unlawful, even if it had not been implemented. On the
facts, however, the Court found Herlitz had invoked the clause to refuse to
supply the Dutch complainant. Finally, the CFI concluded that, for an
infringement of EC competition law to be intentional, so allowing the
Commission to fine the undertaking, the undertaking did not have to have
been aware of an actual infringement of EC competition provisions. It was
sufficient that it was aware that the object of the offending conduct was to
restrict competition.
In its own appeal, Parker argued further grounds: first, the export ban did
not appreciably affect trade between member states; second, the Commission
had no interest in proceeding against Parker because the former had
declined, in the absence of any public interest, to pursue a related
complaint by the Dutch complainant; third, the Commission had not fined
other companies accused of similar practices and, by fining Parker, the
Commission had infringed the principle of equal treatment; and fourth, the
fine was disproportionate.
The Court held on the first point that it was necessary to look at the
position and importance of the parties in the relevant market. If sales of
at least one of the parties constituted a not inconsiderable proportion of
the relevant market, EC competition rules should apply. The CFI concluded
from the files that the respective position of the parties on the market
was, in principle, capable of affecting intra-Community trade.
On the second point, the Court held the Commission had correctly used its
discretion and not erred in law. On the third point, the Court reiterated
European Court case law, which held an undertaking, having breached EC
competition law, could not escape without penalty by arguing another trader
had not been fined for similar conduct. On the final point, the Court held
an appropriate fine could not be fixed by a simple calculation on total
turnover, as had been done by the Commission in the present case. Rather,
the Commission should only have considered the turnover of the goods to
which the infringement related. Since Parker's turnover in those products
accounted for only a relatively low proportion of this total turnover, the
fine was disproportionate and so had to be reduced.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Role of the outsider - Changes in US
corporate governance and case law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEO HERZEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the world of US corporate governance, outside directors appear to be
taking control of large public companies away from the erstwhile imperial
chief executive officer. Two of the more striking examples are General
Motors and IBM. There appear to be several reasons for this change.
First, courts are becoming much tougher on company directors. Good examples
are the Delaware Supreme Court opinions in Cede &amp; Co v Technicolor Inc1,
Paramount Communications Inc v QVC Network Inc2, and Kahn v Lynch
Communication Systems Inc3. In each case, the defendants were board members
of a company which had agreed to an acquisition by a favoured buyer. The
Delaware Supreme Court had some fairly hard words for directors whose
decisions are not entirely independent. Opinions of this kind spur directors
to assert their independence from the chief executive officer, and from a
controlling shareholder, when there is one.
Pressure on boards from institutional investors is also an important factor.
Courts and institutional shareholders have also been highly influenced by
the commentary of academic lawyers, economists and a better informed
financial press on the role directors should play in corporate governance.
On many corporate governance reforms, the US appears to be ahead of the
European Union. Compensation and audit committees consisting of outside
directors are the rule in public companies. Nominating (or corporate
governance) committees of outside directors, which control the selection of
directors, are becoming widespread.
On the other hand, in the US, the positions of CEO and chairman of the board
are usually still combined. However, the idea of a lead director, around
whom the outside directors can mobilise when the CEO is also chairman of the
board, is catching on. For example, although at present GM has an outside
chairman of the board, the concept of a lead director is the second item on
its new, widely publicised board guidelines on significant corporate
governance issues.
It remains unclear what effect these changes have had on corporate
performance. Unfriendly takeovers, the primary testing ground for corporate
governance, in the 1980s have declined, primarily for economic reasons.
However, it is possible that one reason for the decline could be improved
corporate governance, as directors reorganise companies before an overt
takeover threat. But since many of these reorganisations have come late in
the day, after the companies have suffered a great deal of damage, it is
hard to view them as clear evidence of the new effectiveness of outside
directors.
Bad laws
The US legal system remains a big problem. For a long time, it has been
suffocating under an accumulation of bad laws, and this state of affairs is
becoming worse.
It is relatively easy to pass a new law in the US, but almost impossible to
eliminate an existing bad one. Bad laws of any importance quickly develop a
devoted following of powerful pressure groups who benefit greatly from them.
The general public usually is relatively indifferent, not organised and
ineffective. This is a crucial problem, since a large proportion of laws in
any society inevitably turns out to be bad.
Courts provide some help in limiting the damage from bad laws, but not
enough. One aggravating factor in the US is the constitutional right to
trial by jury, combined with the reluctance of courts to dismiss legally
weak cases at an early stage, before a jury trial. The result is that
defendants must often settle for large sums or face the risk of even larger
damages in a jury trial, possibly trebled under some statutes or with
punitive damages added.
An extreme example of such a dangerous statute, where the courts have not
helped as much as they should, is RICO, the federal treble-damage
racketeering law. Congress has not eliminated or modified RICO, because it
is a favourite of plaintiffs' lawyers, who are a powerful political pressure
group.
However, in Reves v Ernst &amp; Young4, the US Supreme Court took an important
but cautious step to rein in this absurd statute. The court held that Ernst
&amp; Young did not conduct or participate in the management of an auditing
client through a pattern of racketeering activity when it reported a key
asset of the client at a highly inflated value. However, the court is
probably barred by its own precedents from what might to an outsider appear
an obvious commonsense idea, that auditors are not racketeers.
But in Central Bank of Denver v First Interstate Bank of Denver5, the US
Supreme Court was a little more daring. Overturning many years of lower
court precedent, the court held there is no aiding and abetting liability
under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
on the ground that the language of the statute does not cover giving aid to
a person who commits a fraudulent act. Since section 10(b) and rule 10b-5
are the heart of federal securities anti-fraud law, the case may be helpful
to accountants, lawyers and other service organisations such as banks and
investment banks, who are the natural targets of aiding and abetting
allegations in litigation.
And in Honda Motor Co v Oberg6, the US Supreme Court released a favourable
signal on punitive damages. The court held unconstitutional, as a
deprivation of the federal constitutional right to procedural due process,
an unusual Oregon constitutional provision, which prohibits judicial review
of a jury's award of punitive damages unless the reviewing court can
affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the award.
Although, because of the unusual nature of the Oregon constitutional
provision, the Supreme Court's decision is narrow, some of the language in
the court's opinion offers encouraging signs that the court may be getting
ready to cope with some of the many problems of jury awards of punitive
damages.
Contingent fees
Contingent fee litigation continues to be an important and deeply embedded
element of the US legal system.
In the ordinary small litigation of individuals, the contingent fee system
appears to work reasonably well. But in shareholder class actions, for
example, lawyers usually have the only real economic interest on the
plaintiffs' side. In fact, lawyers usually own 100 per cent of these cases,
since shareholders' interests in the claims are generally dispersed and
small.
Lawyers in the US have some intimidating governmental powers. The most
important of these powers is an almost unlimited right to discover facts,
including the interrogation of witnesses at depositions. In theory, courts
regulate and control these powers but, in fact, they do very little. Thus a
combination of right to trial by jury, lawyers' governmental powers, the
intense self-interest of plaintiffs' lawyers in the outcome of high stake
litigation and the possibility of treble or punitive damages has created a
potent anti-social mixture.
Lawyers themselves are now becoming victims of the system. They are
defendants in contingent fee litigation almost as often as accountants. But
the plaintiffs' lawyers who are beneficiaries of the system are a much more
focused and better organised group than the victims. There is therefore
little sign of change.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Textile chiefs to step up onslaught on Hualon plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of senior British industrialists is to step up its attack on the
government's backing for the Hualon textiles project in Northern Ireland,
amid growing fears that it will lead to substantial job losses elsewhere in
the UK.
In the latest indication of the concern which the project has aroused in the
British textile industry, a delegation of business leaders has said that it
will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, on Thursday.
The delegation, led by Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Tory MP and chairman of
the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, will urge Sir
Patrick to suspend backing for the Pounds 157m Hualon project until the
government has canvassed the views of other business leaders.
It will also demand that the government should consult British industry
about the economic consequences of all future inward investment decisions
before they are taken.
Mr Christopher Whitehouse, chief executive of the alliance, said: 'We want
to ensure that what has happened over Hualon will never happen again.
Ministers and civil servants should not feel they have a right to put people
out of a job just for political considerations.'
The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, of Taiwan - will
represent the largest industrial investment in Northern Ireland since the
failure of the De Lorean car venture in the 1970s.
The project is expected to create about 1,000 jobs in the next 10 years. But
leading figures in the British textile industry believe it could lead to the
closure of factories amid signs of overcapacity in the European market for
fabrics.
Earlier this year Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, said that
'as many as 1,000 jobs in Lancashire' could be lost because of the project.
Mr Whitehouse said yesterday that he was concerned about the way in which
the government took decisions on inward investment in general. His
organisation was inviting British companies to inform it of times when
government decisions had adversely affected their industry.
He said: 'What we want is a change in the Department of Trade and Industry's
policies so that the interests of manufacturers are taken into account.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Argument rages over holes in the ground: The wider
implications of Nottinghamshire's quarrying debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nottinghamshire is searching for the impossible - an agreement between
industry, politicians, residents and environmentalists on quarrying sand and
gravel.
At county level the outcome of the search will settle the location of big
holes in the ground, the conditions under which they may be dug and how the
land will be reclaimed. All of this will be written in the county council's
minerals local plan.
At national level the search has a wider implication. It reflects the
environmental price which has to be paid for economic development.
The competing parties are polishing their arguments for a public inquiry in
October. The arguments will swirl around the proposals of the county
council, embodied in a draft minerals plan. The council is the planning
authority for minerals, granting or refusing permission for quarries. It is
trying to settle what will be worked during the next 10 years, and where.
It is a testing role because Nottinghamshire has extensive mineral
resources, and the greater the desire to exploit them, the more acute the
tensions. The main deposits of sand and gravel - which are vital raw
materials for the construction industry - are in the Trent and Idle valleys.
Nearly all recent extraction, running at 2.5m to 3m tonnes a year from 10
big and several small quarries, has been confined to these valleys.
Quarrying companies are drawn to the county's deposits because they offer
high yields and hard material, meeting most specifications for concrete. As
the draft plan noted: 'This factor can give Nottinghamshire's deposits a
premium above those found elsewhere.'
The county council draws its authority to settle which deposits will be
worked from the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. But the council is
caught between its own voters, who would tend to wish all quarries were
elsewhere, and instructions from Whitehall that control the tonnage of
aggregates to be mined.
The Department of the Environment has a national co-ordinating group of
officials and industry executives which looks at aggregates supply and
demand, and forecasts future needs. This group gets its information from
regional committees, which in turn tell the counties what they expect each
should produce.
For Nottinghamshire County Council the key group is the East Midlands
Regional Aggregates Working Party.
Based on the calculations of this government-industry working party, which
itself has been influenced by national forecasts of rising demand,
Nottinghamshire council has been planning for annual production of 3.2m to
3.4m tonnes. Too little, argues the industry. Too much, say local groups
such as parish councils with quarries in their midst, and national
environmental groups such as the Council for the Protection of Rural
England.
Nottinghamshire can meet the rising demand at least until the end of the
century. But the county council hopes to be let off the hook. By the end of
the century, it said, 'it is hoped that government guidance will have
successfully promoted the fundamental changes in supply and demand need, if
an environmental crisis is to be avoided'.
The government has eased the political pressure. It decided, in a planning
guidance note to mineral planning authorities, that it would not be
necessary to make provision for 10 years of aggregates extraction. Seven
years would be enough.
This had two effects. First, it meant that Nottinghamshire could largely
meet expected production levels for seven years from existing quarries,
although some would open up adjacent workings. It avoided any need to make
provision for the opening of a new quarry at Stapleford Woods.
Wimpey Minerals, in the face of spirited opposition from the Stapleford Wood
Action Group, local MPs and the district council, has for more than a year
been looking at the environmental implications of a quarry on Forestry
Commission land near Newark, on the Lincolnshire border.
That struggle has faded away. Mr Des Whicher, secretary of the action group,
said: 'Wimpey thinks we'll go away more quickly than they'll go away. And
they're probably right in that. Local people think the campaign is won.'
Second, the government decision has served to switch local discussion away
from new quarries to issues such as reclamation after quarrying.
For example, at Hoveringham, south west of Newark, where Tarmac Quarry
Products has the biggest quarry in the county, there are fears about the use
of holes for waste tips.
There are worries at Collingham, on the Trent north of Newark, about the
spread of water areas as former quarries become lakes.
Such local argument is part of a wider national debate about the use of
mineral resources and the abuse of nature that sometimes implies.
For industry there is a demand which has to be met - economic development
needs construction materials. Mr Val Shields, publicity manager at Tarmac
Quarry Products, said: 'The needs don't go away and the customers - society
at large - who want things built would have to be satisfied elsewhere,
wherever 'elsewhere' is.'
That is too simple for environmental groups. Mr Tony Juniper, senior
campaigner of Friends of the Earth, said: 'We must look at ways of
stimulating long-term growth apart from digging holes in the ground.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Report on quango trips and expenses released
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Health Promotion Wales, a government quango which offers advice on healthier
lifestyles, yesterday made public a district auditor's report on its former
chief executive's overseas visits and expenses claims.
The quango and its administration has been under intense scrutiny since
Professor John Catford resigned as chief executive in February. South Wales
fraud squad was called in to investigate his expense claims for a number of
foreign trips but the Crown Prosecution Service later decided not to bring
criminal proceedings.
The report concludes that the reason for Prof Catford's attendance on
several trips was unclear. A visit to Brazil appeared to have been
undertaken 'for purely personal reasons'.
Mr Gordon Macdonald, head of professional development, has also been
disciplined over his foreign trips. His contract will not be renewed when it
runs out in October.
Mr John Davies, chairman of Health Promotion Wales, said yesterday: 'We are
doing a thoroughly professional and worthwhile job which the NHS values
highly. We are not a tarnished quango although two individuals have been
tarnished.'
He added that procedures on overseas travel had been changed.
Prof Catford now works for the World Health Organisation as public health
adviser to a number of eastern European countries. He has not commented on
the district auditor's report.
Mr Macdonald said: 'The District Audit Services report cites me as
undertaking 26 international visits between April 1990 and January 1994.
This is inaccurate and misleading. Eight of those journeys were to domestic
destinations within the UK.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Minister opens review of safety for drinkers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A review of the government's guidelines on the consumption of alcohol was
launched yesterday.
Mr John Bowis, junior health minister, said in May that he would be
reviewing the limits below which the consumption of alcohol was considered
unlikely to damage health - 21 units a week for men and 14 units for women.
The move followed research showing that moderate drinkers lived longer than
those who did not drink.
Announcing the inquiry's terms of reference yesterday, Mr Bowis said the
departments of health and transport, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the
Home, Scottish and Welsh offices would be represented in a working party.
This would review scientific and medical evidence on the long-term effects
of drinking alcohol before deciding whether the guidelines should be
modified or qualified.
The guidelines were set by the Royal College of General Practitioners,
Psychiatrists and Physicians in 1987. Recent studies - particularly US
research published in the New England Journal of Medicine last December  -
have suggested moderate drinking can reduce the risk of heart attacks.
The New England study found that people who consumed between one and three
drinks daily were half as likely to be at risk of heart attacks as those who
never drank.
Alcohol Concern, the charity, welcomed the review, which it said would help
end confusion about how much it was safe to drink.
It said 'It is important that the government give their own review a high
level of priority because there are currently some 8m drinking above the
existing recommended levels.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Curriculum cuts to deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuts in the compulsory national curriculum for England and Wales from
September next year are to be deeper than planned, the government's
curriculum body said yesterday.
The move follows responses by teachers' unions to the provisional new
curriculum unveiled in May by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools
Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
The unions said the curriculum would not deliver the government's aim of
ensuring that at least 20 per cent of classroom time up to the age of 14
could be spent studying non-compulsory subjects chosen at teachers'
discretion. At present most teachers believe that the compulsory elements of
the curriculum take up all available classroom time.
No further cuts will be made to mathematics and English, and so the cuts are
likely to be in the other subjects, which include science, history,
geography, modern languages, art, music, physical education and religious
education.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Most wage deals 'at least 2.5%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than four in five recent pay deals have produced rises of 2.5 per cent
or more, says the latest study of wage trends published today by Incomes
Data Services, the independent information and research organisation.
Half of about 100 most recently monitored settlements provided for wage
increases of between 2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, and a third from 3 per
cent to 3.9 per cent.
The IDS report found 'only a handful' of deals provided for increases of 4
per cent or more.
The economic recovery has started to raise the level of earnings, mainly
through increased overtime.
The average annual rise in earnings in the year to May was 4.3 per cent,
with an underlying 3.75 per cent rate of growth.
The largest growth in earnings in the year to May was in the motor vehicles
and components production industry, where there was an increase of 6.8 per
cent.
There was a 5.5 per cent rise in mechanical engineering. Banking and finance
has seen the highest earnings increase in the service sector with 4.4 per
cent. Distribution and retail have had pay rises of up to 4.2 per cent.
In a commentary on overall pay figures the report says that as the economy
has moved out of recession 'the inflation rate has become much more of a
floor for pay settlements than it was previously'.
The report adds: 'Actual wage increases for many individual employees are
much higher than between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, through incremental
movement or merit pay on top of general awards.'
It says the Bank of England is a good example of such deals. Staff there
received general pay increases of 2.5 per cent from July 1 with an
additional 4.5 per cent on the wage bill to fund performance-related rises
and promotional increases. The average salary has been increased by 7 per
cent in this way.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Free Trade Hall poised to become hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester's Free Trade Hall, originally the headquarters of the Anti-Corn
Law League and currently the home of the Halle Orchestra, is set to become a
luxury hotel.
The city council, which owns the listed building, said yesterday that it
would be turned into a 290-bedroom hotel, with a four to five-star rating,
in a Pounds 30m development.
Mr Graham Stringer, the council's leader, said: 'This will help to confirm
our status as a major European city.'
Central Manchester Development Corporation has yet to receive a planning
application for the scheme, but has indicated hotel use is acceptable.
The proposed scheme would retain the Italian-style, stone building's famous
facade, and incorporate the statues on the rear elevation. Construction is
expected to start early in 1996 when the Halle moves home to the nearby
Pounds 42m International Concert Hall.
The city council said the Free Trade Hall, built in 1856 on the site of the
Peterloo Massacre, has always been a symbol of Manchester's drive for
enterprise and social reform. It has played a leading role in the city's
cultural, social and political life.
Famous people who have spoken there include Charles Dickens, the explorer HM
Stanley, and politicians such as Disraeli, Gladstone and Winston Churchill.
The council said it had agreed heads of terms with La Sande North West, the
development company. La Sande is at an advanced stage of discussions with
Scotts Hotels Management, the UK subsidiary of Scotts Hospitality, the
leading franchise holder of the Marriott hotel brand in the UK. US-based
Marriotts would run the hotel as part of its UK expansion programme.
Mr Stringer said Manchester needed hotel accommodation of the quality
proposed for the scheme. He said it would bring valuable investment and
jobs, and support the city's bid for the Commonwealth Games to be staged in
the year 2002.

FT  09 AUG 94 / RMT digs in on pay supplement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union may soon return to the negotiating table through
Acas, the conciliation service, in a further attempt to settle the nine-week
signalling workers' dispute.
However, the union will first require a clear understanding that Railtrack,
the state-owned company that runs the network, is willing immediately to
consolidate into basic rates a large part of a 6 per cent supplement it has
already offered.
Acas officials said yesterday they were 'actively in touch with both sides'.
Mr Mike Patterson, secretary of the Central Rail Users Consultative
Committee, said that neither side had taken advantage of the 'window of
opportunity' offered by the vote to reject industrial action by RMT
signalling supervisors last Thursday.
He added: 'It is extremely frustrating that that opportunity has not been
taken.'
Confusion continued to surround the dispute yesterday, when little outward
progress was made towards a resumption of negotiations. The RMT and
Railtrack have both said that they want to re-enter talks, but these have
failed to materialise.
With the prospect of 72 hours of severe disruption starting on Friday with
further strikes on Monday and Tuesday, there is little time to reach a
settlement before the weekend.
The RMT said that the main obstacle remained Railtrack's apparent
unwillingness to state unequivocally in writing that it was prepared to
allow a consolidation of part of the proposed 6 per cent supplement.
In recent days Railtrack has not been prepared to make its position clear on
this point, which RMT negotiators say is crucial to removing the obstacles
preventing a settlement.
The RMT seems prepared to accept Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton's public
offer to try to settle the whole restructuring package for signalling
workers during five days through secret negotiations if a deal could be
reached on an interim payment.
Only a few days ago Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, rejected Mr
Horton's suggestion outright. Railtrack welcomed the lastest apparent
conciliatory move from the union.
The RMT insists that at no time has Railtrack spelt out its willingness to
consolidate up to half the 6 per cent supplement.
During the five days of fruitless bilateral negotiations through Acas from
July 21 to 25 Railtrack said it was willing to go 'half way' to meet the RMT
if the union displayed similar flexibility. But this was never turned into
an offer with specific figures.
Mr Knapp said yesterday that he was pledged to make 'every genuine effort'
to find a settlement.

in the region had attracted the largest number of nominations in the latest
offshore licensing round.
Mr Charles Wardle, a junior industry minister, said other relatively
unexplored areas in the Irish Sea and Cardigan Bay also 'attracted high
numbers of nominations'. Many of the west coast blocks are in
environmentally sensitive areas.
Mr Wardle said that a total of 329 blocks had been nominated by 29

FT  09 AUG 94 / Names to take case to Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 500 loss-making Lloyd's Names is to take its case to the House of
Lords, Richard Lapper writes.
The Court of Appeal ruled at the end of June that the Names, who are all
members of the Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in the 1982 year of account, were
too late to start legal action to recover insurance losses, overturning a
judgment made last year by the High Court.
The Names, individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the
insurance market, allege breach of duty by their agents.
They did not participate in a successful earlier action by fellow Names on
the syndicate which resulted in a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in
February 1992.
Last year Mr Justice Saville ruled that the Names, whose solicitors are
Norton Rose, could take action against RHM Outhwaite (Underwriting
Agencies), which managed syndicate 317/661, and approximately 80 members'
agents.
Solicitors Denton Hall are acting for RHM Outhwaite, while Oswald Hickson,
Collier are acting for a number of the members' agents in the case.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Navy steps up protection for trawlers: Waldegrave pledges to
stand by fishermen in face of Spanish 'harassment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Royal Navy ships will be in place in the Bay of Biscay later today to
protect a small group of Cornish fishing vessels from further attacks by
Spanish fishermen angry at their use of driftnets to catch tuna.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture and fisheries minister, said yesterday:
'We will stand by our industry.' Announcing the despatch of the second
fishery protection vessel, HMS Alderney, he said: 'It is unacceptable that
UK flagged vessels should be prevented from legitimate fishing as a result
of harassment or damage by other vessels. We will see that they are not.'
The two vessels will protect a maximum of a dozen Cornish boats that use
driftnets for tuna fishing in the Bay of Biscay - with no more than six
usually present at any one time. Last week Spanish fishermen, who use baited
lines to catch tuna and object to the high-technology driftnets, cut the
nets of two Cornish boats and forced several others to flee home.
Mr Waldegrave rejected calls for a Royal Navy frigate to be sent to the
area, saying the two fisheries vessels would provide adequate protection.
HMS Anglesey has been in the area since last week.
At the same time, he strongly defended the action taken by the navy to check
a complaint by a European Union fisheries inspector that the Charisma, a
trawler based in Padstow, Cornwall, had used illegal nets.
The Charisma was found to have a net 153 metres longer than the 2.5km
permitted by the EU. This is just over the 5 per cent allowed for natural
stretching of the nets and a ministry spokesman said charges against the
skipper had not been ruled out.
Mr Waldegrave said it was right that the case should have been investigated.
'We have shown that we enforce the rules properly.'
The Cornish vessels have turned to tuna fishing in the Bay of Biscay, about
400 miles off Land's End, because catches of traditional white fish around
Britain's coasts have fallen. One Cornish skipper said yesterday: 'We've got
so little fish left to catch through our own quotas, we've just got to do
something different.'
Mr Mike Townsend, chief executive of the Cornish Fish Producers'
Association, said his group would maintain regular contact with the navy and
its two protection vessels on the movements of the Cornish boats in the Bay
of Biscay.
A British crewman working on a Spanish boat blamed British trawlers for last
week's clashes.
He said: 'They are more aggressive than us. They have been crashing into us,
smashing our boats. We have just been retaliating for what they have done to
us.'
The government yesterday proposed simplifying the complex system for
licensing 8,900 fishing vessels as part of its deregulation drive.
The proposals, which will come into force next January subject to a
two-month consultation period, include a reduction in the number of licence
categories from 160, a simpler licence format and more straightforward rules
on the issue of licences.
Most of the 3,200 licensed vessels over 10 metres long would have to carry
only one licence instead of several.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Producer prices held down by competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Powerful competitive forces held down prices for UK manufactured products in
July in spite of upward pressure on the costs of industry's fuel and raw
materials.
The prices charged by UK manufacturers were unchanged on balance between
June and July, bringing the annual rate of output price inflation down from
2.1 per cent in June to 1.9 per cent last month, its lowest since December
1986, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday.
The so-called core measure of output price inflation, which excludes food,
beverages, tobacco and petroleum, was also subdued. It increased by 0.2 per
cent on a seasonally adjusted basis between June and July, while the
year-on-year rate slipped from 2 per cent in June to 1.9 per cent in July,
its lowest rise since November 1967.
Raw material and fuel prices dipped by 0.3 per cent on an unadjusted basis
between June and July, reflecting a seasonal fall in home-produced food
manufacturing inputs. Elsewhere, seasonally adjusted figures and revisions
to the CSO's June data pointed to a strengthening of input price inflation.
The input price index rose by an adjusted 0.5 per cent last month after a
1.3 per cent jump in June that was revised upwards from 0.8 per cent in the
CSO's initial report a month ago. Input prices rose an unadjusted 2.9 per
cent in the 12 months to July compared with a rise of 2.2 per cent in the
year to June and year-on-year declines as recently as April.
The Treasury welcomed the continued evidence of subdued inflationary
pressures at the factory gate.
Some City economists warned, however, that output prices may soon rise.
Mr Andrew Cates of UBS said: 'The evidence suggests that the current rate of
output price inflation has probably reached its trough.'
Mr Cates, forecasting that underlying retail price inflation could breach
the government's 4 per cent target ceiling in the middle of next year, said:
'Input prices are increasing faster than output prices, unit wage costs are
under pressure and firms are desirous to expand their profit margins.'
The year-on-year increase in input prices largely re-flected the higher
costs of most categories of imported materials.
While annual output price inflation fell for a wide range of goods, higher
commodity prices were reflected in higher year-on-year prices for pulp and
paper products, chemicals and petroleum products.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Receivers to Astra start action over its downfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receivers to Astra, the munitions company connected to the Iraqi
supergun affair, have started legal action against the auditors and merchant
bankers who advised the company on one of the acquisitions that led to its
downfall.
Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Chris Barlow, insolvency partners at Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, have issued writs in the last few days against Stoy Hayward, the
accountancy firm, and Paine Webber, the US-based merchant bank.
The writs pursue the organisations for breach of contract and/or negligence
in respect of advice given to Astra before its acquisition of PRB, the
Belgian munitions company, in 1989.
There are no sums specified in the writs, which are a holding action
designed to beat the six-year statute of limitations after which it is
impossible to bring a case.
The PRB acquisition cost Astra Pounds 22m, and the writs are likely to seek
damages for at least this amount as well as costs and interest.
Paine Webber was the merchant bank advising on the PRB acquisition, and Stoy
 -Astra's auditors - conducted due diligence.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the writs would be served in the next four months.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's highest
regulatory body, started an investigation in May into the role of Stoy
Hayward as Astra's auditor following publication of a Department of Trade
and Industry inspectors' report.
Stoy Hayward said last night it was surprised by the move. It added: 'If the
receivers do decide to proceed, it will be most vigorously defended.'

Growing oil company interest in the relatively unexplored area west of
Shetland was confirmed yesterday when the government announced that blocks
in the region had attracted the largest number of nominations in the latest
offshore licensing round.
Mr Charles Wardle, a junior industry minister, said other relatively

FT  09 AUG 94 / Consumers drawn to June sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net lending to UK consumers hit a monthly record in June but City analysts
and the Treasury held back from proclaiming a new spending boom on the
grounds that the official figures from the Central Statistical Office are
prone to sharp fluctuations.
The unexpected strength of June's figures reflected an increase of net
borrowing on credit cards. But there was widespread agreement that this
reflected action by cost-conscious consumers to take advantage of heavy
price discounting in the June sales.
The CSO announced yesterday that net consumer lending, after repayments,
jumped on a seasonally adjusted basis to a new high of Pounds 683m in June
from Pounds 208m in May and was sharply higher than the Pounds 227m of net
lending in June last year.
The monthly statistics, which exclude mortgages but cover lending by finance
houses, unsecured non-mortgage lending by building societies and loans
through bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems, showed only
a small increase in new lending to Pounds 5.14bn in June from Pounds 5.12bn
in May.
Although the June net lending figure was sharply higher than the City's
Pounds 375m median forecast, analysts pointed out that consumer-credit
statistics are volatile and, in the case of June, followed a very low figure
for May. The modest increase in new lending also suggested that the growth
in net lending resulted from slower credit repayments rather than heavy new
commitments.
In the three months to June, however, net lending as measured for the
monthly statistics rose to Pounds 1.3bn from Pounds 1.11bn in the first
quarter of the year. Broader quarterly figures, published yesterday, showed
that net lending to consumers was at its highest level for almost five years
in the three months to June.
The quarterly figures showed that net lending increased by Pounds 1.41bn in
the second quarter against Pounds 905m in the first three months of the
year. The quarterly figures include lending by banks on personal accounts,
insurance companies, retailers and lending on all bank credit cards and
charge cards as well as the components of the monthly statistics.
A sharp jump in net credit-card borrowing was common to both sets of
figures. Net lending on bank credit cards, as measured by the monthly
statistics, increased to Pounds 267m in June following a large Pounds 99m
repayment in May. The broader quarterly figures showed an increase in net
credit-card borrowing to Pounds 406m from Pounds 158m in the first quarter.
The monthly figures showed net lending by finance houses increased to Pounds
392m in June from Pounds 304m in May. The broader quarterly figures showed
an increase in net lending by non-banks and by banks on personal accounts to
Pounds 932m in the second quarter from Pounds 746m in the first three months
of the year.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Income tax for Cubans next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba will impose taxes on property and income at the start of next year as
part of a government effort to cut the budget deficit, ease pressure on the
peso and shore up the troubled economy.
The taxes, the first of their kind since the revolution 35 years ago, will
be levied first on the self-employed and on Cubans who earn from foreign
sources. The legislation, passed at the weekend by the National Assembly,
includes provisions for taxes on salaried workers when the economy improves.
The legislation also imposes taxes on a range of property and on some
services. The rates will be announced in the next three months. Their
imposition of the taxes is the Cuban government's response to a widening
budget deficit, which reached 4bn Cuban pesos
(Pounds 2.5bn at the official exchange rate) last year.
It also wants to mop up much of the 11.75bn pesos in circulation, which
officials say has contributed to a depreciation of the currency on the
unofficial market. The government announced a 50 per cent cut in the armed
forces' budget this year, saying the military should cost the country 'as
little as possible'.
For the past two months Cubans have been paying higher prices for a range of
consumer goods and public transportation. Cigarette prices rose by an
average of 600 per cent while alcohol prices were doubled. The cost of air
and sea travel was also increased.
Last week police clashed with demonstrators protesting over the price rises
in Havana's port area after what diplomats describe as a perceptible rise in
political tension in the capital. Cuban newspapers said 35 people, including
10 policemen, were injured.
Cuba's economy has been thrown off course by the collapse of the Soviet
Union, which was the Caribbean island's main trading partner, the failure of
last year's sugar harvest and a significant cut in foreign earnings.
Fuel, food and medicines have been in short supply, power cuts are frequent
and lines of ration card holders have been growing.
US Coast Guard ships picked up 230 Cuban refugees in the seas between Cuba
and Florida over the weekend, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Miami.
The people, on makeshift boats and rafts, left Cuba amid reports of unrest
after three ferryboats were hijacked in nine days by Cubans hoping to reach
the US.

<TEXT>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's apparently smooth progress towards
re-election has encountered an unexpected obstacle - his wife.
Ms Susana Higuchi, who prefers not to use her husband's surname, has moved
out of the presidential palace, having formally complained to the
attorney-general that legislation prohibiting the president's close
relatives from running for office is unconstitutional.
Pressed to say whether she intends to run as a presidential or congressional
candidate in next April's election, she replied: 'I am thinking about it.'
However, she will need to make up her mind by October, the deadline for
nominations.
Ms Higuchi, like Mr Fujimori a second-generation Japanese Peruvian and a
qualified engineer, argues that the 1993 constitution permits all Peruvians
except members of the armed forces to stand for public office.
Ms Higuchi's intention, she says, is to demonstrate 'very pragmatically' to
Mr Fujimori, 'that there exists no channel for a citizen to demand
enforcement of his constitutional rights'.
Ms Higuchi seems to be correct. Her legal action was rejected by the
attorney-general on the grounds there is no entity in Peru empowered to
pronounce on constitutional issues.
That is because her husband dissolved the previous constitutional guarantees
tribunal during his April 1992 'self-coup', in which he seized emergency
powers, and it has yet to be replaced.
In recent weeks Ms Higuchi has publicly criticised her husband's
'authoritarianism' and 'blindness to the suffering and poverty' of the
majority of the population. This weekend, in two television interviews, she
made her 'differences of ideas' even more explicit.
'The achievements (of this administration) are all in works of
infrastructure,' she said. 'The human factor has been neglected.'
While Peruvians wait for Mr Fujimori to confirm he will run again, and for
former UN secretary-general Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar to announce a
probable candidacy, all eyes are on Ms Higuchi.
While her husband was a university professor and, later, rector, she ran a
successful civil engineering business and brought up four children.
Most observers expected her to play a prominent role once her husband was
elected president. But she never progressed beyond the traditional role of
First Lady - for example, fundraising for needy children. She has made clear
she does not wish to continue with this role.
Although there have been rumours of matrimonial difficulties before, the
first big rupture with her husband came in March 1992, when Ms Higuchi
publicly accused her in-laws of trafficking in aid donations from abroad.
Her accusations were never closely investigated.

FT  09 AUG 94 / US halves allowable levels of asbestos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government yesterday cut by half the level of asbestos permissible in
the workplace. The ruling came in the announcement of a long-awaited set of
regulations affecting 4m workers in the construction, car repair and
shipbuilding industries.
The change, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the US
labour department, was prompted by a 1988 court ruling stemming from a 1986
union law suit which challenged the previous tolerance level as 'dangerously
lax' and one which exposed workers to unsafe amounts of the carcinogen.
'With these new rules, we now have in place a regulatory structure that will
result in very significant reductions in deaths due to cancer and in costs
to society,' said Mr Joseph Dear, assistant secretary of labour. The labour
department estimates 42 cancer deaths a year will be prevented under the new
rules.
The new level of permissible exposure will be 0.1 asbestos fibres per cubic
centimetre of air over an eight-hour exposure period.
The new regulations will cost the private sector Dollars 361m (Pounds 230m)
to implement, Mr Dear said, far less than the Dollars 15bn price-tag for the
mandatory government inspections the department opted against.
The new rules do not require building owners to remove asbestos but instead
focus on training maintenance and construction workers how to safely work
around materials containing asbestos.
Along with the 3.2m construction and maintenance workers, there are new
standards affecting 685,000 car mechanics, who work with clutch and brake
systems containing asbestos, as well as 1,000 shipbuilders.

FT  09 AUG 94 / US agriculture chief could face gifts inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Will a ride in a company jet and tickets to two sporting events bring down
Mr Michael Espy, the US secretary of agriculture? Did he, as is alleged,
take these gifts in exchange for easing up on proposed poultry regulation?
These questions frame the latest mini-scandal in the pursuit of ethical
purity in Washington.
Mr Espy has been the subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigations probe and
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, is expected to ask a federal court to
appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate the matter, yesterday's
Washington Post reported.
Mr Espy is accused of having flown to Washington on a corporate aircraft
from Arkansas.
He is also accused of accepting tickets to a football game and a basketball
game. The alleged donor is Tyson Foods, the largest poultry supplier in the
US and an early supporter of President Bill Clinton.
One farm lobbyist who admires Mr Espy's work as secretary said the charges,
despite the low value of the gifts, were 'a serious matter' because food
safety inspectors have for years been fired for having taken a turkey or ham
for Christmas dinner.
'It is no bigger deal than all the money Clinton took from Tyson,' said Mr
Niel Ritchie of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minnesota.
'But any time anyone in Washington takes travel and favours from people
they're supposed to be regulating, it diminishes confidence that they will
be doing a fair job.'
Although Mr Espy reimbursed Tyson's for some of the expenses, according to
his staff, and the gifts were minor, he is accused by some of delaying
poultry regulation reform for a time.
The charges have been causing some consternation in the Washington farm
lobby. 'I think its a witch-hunt that may have something to do with
different perceptions of what is acceptable,' said Miss Carol Brookins, a
Washington agriculture consultant. 'The real issue is, at what point do some
of these ethics rules get to being ridiculous?' She and several farm
lobbyists say an investigation now would be 'regrettable' if it detracted
from the focus needed on next year's re-authorisation of US farm programmes.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Dismissals and new currency alter outlook for Brazil poll:
Patrick McCurry on a fall in inflation and the dumping of running mates
accused of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The removal of two of Brazil's vice presidential candidates after fraud
allegations is being seen as further evidence that things might slowly be
changing in a country where holding public office has long been regarded as
a means to personal wealth creation.
Last week Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, presidential candidate of the
centrist Brazilian Social Democrats, took swift action to replace his
running mate Mr Guilherme Palmeira of the conservative Liberal Front party,
Mr Cardoso's main electoral ally. Mr Palmeira was accused of being linked
with fraud involving public works contracts.
A week earlier Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' party
dropped his deputy, Mr Jose Paulo Bisol of the Brazilian Socialist party,
after allegations that Mr Bisol had submitted over-costed amendments to the
budget for works that benefited property he owned.
Although both Mr Bisol and Mr Palmeira, who are both senators, deny any
wrongdoing the sackings were a response to the growing public demand for
clean government. Mr Cardoso and Mr da Silva, who are tying in the opinion
polls for the election in October, had little choice but to sacrifice their
running-mates in the face of incessant, if often sensationalist, press
investigations.
The coverage has been feeding, and feeding off, the public's demand for
higher standards of public morals, which stems largely from the resignation
of former President Fernando Collor in December 1992 amid corruption
allegations, and from a huge congressional investigation into federal budget
fraud that ended earlier this year with the expulsion or resignation of
several leading politicians.
The public mood has reached the point where, according to a poll last month,
Brazilians rate honesty as by far the most important personal quality for
the next president. It was rated top with 38 per cent followed by character
at 3 per cent and competence at 2 per cent.
This trend has damaged the campaign of Mr Orestes Quercia, the controversial
candidate of the Democratic Movement party, Brazil's biggest. Mr Quercia has
been stuck at 7 per cent in the polls, largely because of an indictment on
fraud charges relating to his term of office as Sao Paulo state governor.
Last Friday Brazil's appeals court quashed the case.
For Mr da Silva, known as 'Lula', the allegations levelled at his
running-mate have been a blow to the Workers' party's image of clean
government. Mr da Silva's delay of nearly a month in sacking Mr Bisol
virtually paralysed his campaign.
This coincided with the introduction by Mr Cordosa, when he was finance
minister, of Brazil's new currency, the real, which has brought monthly
inflation down from 50 per cent in June to 7 per cent last month and has
helped Mr Cardoso draw level with Mr da Silva in the polls after trailing by
15 to 20 points.
Mr da Silva's new running-mate, Mr Aloizio Mercadante, is an economist and
is expected to spearhead the Workers' party's new approach to the
anti-inflation plan. Given the widespread public approval for the plan, Mr
da Silva is in a delicate position. If he criticises it he risks being
labelled the 'candidate of inflation' by Mr Cardoso, while if he supports it
he is, in effect, endorsing his opponent.
Mr da Silva has toned down his criticism and is now committed to retaining
the new currency but also to increasing wages, which he says have been
eroded under the plan.
Mr Cardoso's new running-mate, Mr Marco Maciel, is, like Mr Palmeira, a
senator from the Liberal Front party and from the north east of Brazil, a
region in which Mr Cardoso's party is weak. Mr da Silva is expected to try
to exploit Mr Maciel's membership of military governments and the Collor
administration by portraying Mr Cardoso's team as representing a return to
the bad old days of corruption.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Oil companies tread warily in Nigerian strike: How western
majors are coping with the dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western oil companies in Nigeria find themselves caught between a political
hard place and a rock.
As the industry enters the sixth week of a strike by oil workers, the
companies are seeking a middle way between a military government determined
to see off the opposition, and the workers who are demanding a handover to
civilian rule.
If the oil companies maintain output they risk being accused of supporting
an unelected regime and alienating their workforce. There is also a possible
danger to their non-striking staff and equipment from the more extremist
opponents of the government.
But if the companies, which account for more than 99 per cent of Nigeria's
normal production of about 2m barrels a day cut output, they lose revenue
and risk being accused by the Nigerian government of backing a politically
motivated strike. Given the fact that oil accounts for over 90 per cent of
Nigeria's foreign earnings and over 80 per cent of government revenue, any
overt sign of support for the strikers would be viewed harshly by the
military.
There is no sign of an end to the oil workers' stoppage, which has spread to
other unions in protest at the arrest on treason charges of Mr Moshood
Abiola over his claims to be president.
Production has fallen by more than a quarter, with most of the loss from
onshore fields operated by the Anglo-Dutch Shell group. It normally produces
half Nigeria's oil but has cut output to about 500,000 barrels a day,
according to industry sources. 'We are trying to maintain as much as
possible of the industry and prevent an escalation of danger in a very
delicate situation,' said Mr Brian Anderson, chairman of Shell's Nigerian
affiliate, in Lagos yesterday.
'We have rejected the government's offer of military protection in order to
maintain full production. I do not believe that protection is possible in
some of our fields,' which are spread across a vast area of the Niger delta.
'There are too many small fields too exposed to attack or sabotage. We do
not believe that calling in troops is the answer and could lead to even more
serious trouble,' said Mr Anderson.
For the first month of the strike, Shell kept the oil flowing with the use
of non-union management and expatriate staff, and some contract workers, to
replace the skilled engineers of the senior staff association Pengassan on
strike. Normal maintenance has been neglected, however, and development of
new capacity is impossible.
Recently threats against strike-breakers were followed up by attacks. Two of
the staff were beaten up for continuing to work and minor sabotage, carried
out by strikers, halted some plants. Shell began to pull its staff out of
the most dangerous fields and declared force majeure, enabling them to
default on supply contracts.
Mr Anderson rejects charges that Shell is siding with the unions, with whom
the company will always have to work, regardless of the tenure of the
present regime.
'We are certainly not taking sides with anyone, we are non-political' he
said. 'We would like to maintain full production and we want a resolution of
this crisis. But I am not prepared to risk the lives of my staff or risk
more serious sabotage and I do not want to inflame the situation.'
He says Shell has to achieve 'a fine balance'. 'We want to retain our
assets, both staff and equipment, so that we can recover when this is
resolved. We have old fields, with high water content, especially in the
western region. You don't just turn on the taps and it starts to flow.'
Other companies are also beginning to report supply disruptions, but on a
lesser scale than that affecting Shell. Chevron, the third largest producer,
is said to have lost about 15 per cent of its 350,000 b/d output and Mobil,
the second largest has been even less affected.
Both operate offshore or in onshore enclaves which are easier to protect and
have fewer fields. Elf's offshore operation of about 60,000 bpd has been
shut down but Elf continues to produce offshore.
In the longer term the strike will worsen a decline in investment which
began almost a year ago. The government, which owns 58 per cent of the joint
ventures with the multinationals has fallen further behind on paying its
share of costs, with the backlog now estimated at Pounds 800m. The 1994
budget for exploration and production has been cut from Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 3bn, inadequate to maintain future capacity.
Rising costs are already cutting into the multinationals' fixed profit
margin of Dollars 1 a barrel. At Dollars 19 a barrel this is about 5 per
cent. But the government arrears have forced a halt on investment.
The big multinationals can survive a temporary drop in revenue but political
instability and state-led under-investment are dimming the one bright spot
in Nigeria's economy over the past eight years.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Minefield offers way to Jordan

   ISRAEL-JORDAN BORDER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Jordan changed the road map of the Middle East yesterday, opening
a border crossing on a former minefield and inaugurating what Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan described as 'a commonwealth of shared human interests' that
would do away with regional poverty and injustice, Julian Ozanne reports
from the Israel-Jordan border.
The Crown Prince, with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and US
secretary of state Warren Christopher all emphasised the border opening
would pave the way to a tourism boom, business and commercial contacts, and
economic co-operation and development.
Mr Rabin later crossed into Jordan for a summit with King Hussein at his
winter palace in Aqaba, the first time an Israeli prime minister has
publicly set foot on Jordanian soil since the creation of the Jewish state
in 1948.
'Three weeks ago the dream of peace was far away,' Mr Rabin said shortly
before he and Prince Hassan cut the white ribbon opening the new border 3km
north of the Red Sea ports of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel. 'Today it
is materialising: telephone lines, tourism. Soon it will seem as though this
is the way it has always been.'
The prince said the border was the beginning of regional transport networks
and a token of Israel and Jordan's desire for material economic links. 'Let
the opening of this border gate in this particular location mark the
foundation stone on which we intend to build our common future,' he said.
Mr Christopher said the two nations were 'weaving together the fabric of
human contact and mutual interest that are the foundations of genuine
peace.' Later he said the Rabin-Hussein summit had discussed trilateral
Israel-Jordan-US plans for regional development and October's Middle East
economic conference in Casablanca, sponsored by King Hassan of Morocco,
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Christopher said the conference, expected to bring together more than
1,000 companies with governments to finance Middle East development, would
be 'a great opportunity to unlock resources' for the regional projects. Mr
Christopher also promised continued US political and economic support to
both Israel and Jordan and said the US had written to the Paris Club of
creditors to seek debt relief for Jordan and was speeding through Congress
legislation to write off US loans to Jordan, worth about Dollars 1bn.
Israel and Jordan have drawn up a joint economic agenda but only a few of
these plans can be implemented until a formal peace treaty is signed.
Israeli and Jordanian negotiators resume bilateral talks today on the
Israeli side of the Dead Sea to resolve border demarcation and water
disputes - the obstacles that stand in the way of a peace treaty.

FT  09 AUG 94 / NKK sheds 1,300 jobs by transferring staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NKK, the loss-making Japanese steelmaker, announced yesterday it was
shedding a further 1,300 jobs, but its workforce had no overt reason for
despair. Japan's disavowal of compulsory redundancies means the cuts are to
be made, apart from those who wish to retire, by transferring staff to
affiliates or customers.
When they get there, they will remain NKK employees and, their company
assures them, will continue to draw their present salaries. They comprise
technical workers and white-collar staff who, an NKK official said last
night, need not worry about being forced into an inappropriate job.
'Accountants will be sent to accounting departments,' he averred.
If the main disruption to their lives will be that the beige-clad office to
which they bring their bento (lunchbox) each day is not the one they have
previously known, their experience will be better than most have
encountered.
NKK stands to benefit from the secondment only because of the existence of a
system, administered by the government but funded by the private sector,
which for 20 years has helped smooth the paths of companies which fall on
hard times.
The employment adjustment subsidy scheme is due to pay out a record Y112.7bn
(Pounds 727m) this year to employers in designated industries where sales
have dropped from a year earlier. This allows them to take from the offshoot
to which a worker is seconded whatever modest salary contribution is agreed,
while a central pool pays the larger company up to two-thirds of the wage
bill for staff members it has transferred.
Hundreds of thousands of Japanese workers have been asked by their employers
in the past two recession-hit years to bid farewell to colleagues with whom
they have shared their midday rations of cold-rice-in-cardboard, and to
learn the two-hour route to a different train station.
The reach of the programme has been extended as the domestic economic
downturn endures. It now covers more than a quarter of industrial categories
recognised by the labour ministry, and the overall payout is more than 100
times the level of three years ago.
Most employees who have undergone a transfer to a company with which their
employer has a business relationship, however close, appear to find it less
than edifying. A survey of 335 large and small companies, released last
year, suggested that seven out of 10 secondees departed with no guarantee
they would be able to return to their former workplace once conditions
improved.
At least eight in 10 such workers encountered poorer conditions, such as
longer hours and a reduction in paid holidays, and fewer than a third were
compensated for this by the parent company.
A Kawasaki Steel executive has been quoted in Tokyo as saying: 'In general,
affiliates don't have room to accept workers from their parent companies. We
cannot count on them.' Nor, once they are sent there, can the new staff.
One young computer scientist with a master's degree from the prestigious
Tokyo University, who was hired by a steelmaker because it wanted to
diversify into high technology, now finds himself unproductively pushing
paper at a distant offshoot. He wryly recites his designated task: improving
efficiency for the group.

The Industrial Bank of Japan, a leading Japanese long-term credit bank,

clients - yesterday for the first time in five months in response to a rise
in yields on the government bond market.
The bank's increase of its long-term prime rate, a benchmark for corporate
lending rates, by 30 basis points to 4.7 per cent will be effective from
tomorrow. Although corporate demand for funds have been low because of the
prolonged recession, the rise in loan rates may squeeze demand even further.
Heightened expectations of an economic recovery and a fall in the yen
against the dollar has weighed upon the government bond market, and
long-term yields rose to a 14 month high of 4.63 per cent last Friday.
The rise has affected short-term rates, and could affect profitability at
corporations and banks because of the rise in interest payments.

India's exports grew 9.5 per cent to reach Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in
the first three months of fiscal 1994-95, against Dollars 5.1bn in the
corresponding period last year, the commerce ministry reports.
Imports increased 7.5 per cent to Dollars 5.8 bn in the same period, against
Dollars 5.4bn in April-June 1993.
The country's trade balance for the three-month period registered a decline
at Dollars 197.94m. Last year's trade deficit was Dollars 301.49m, the
ministry added.
Exports showed relatively low growth this year because of the erosion of
India's competitive edge, reflecting a higher inflation rate than in the US,
EU and Japan and growth in domestic demand.
Textile and leather exports, which account for nearly 20 per cent of total
exports, have been adversely affected by sluggish international demand and
competition from other suppliers, mostly in the Far East. The export of
engineering goods, which accounts for nearly 10 per cent of the total
market, slowed because of a fall in demand for primary and semi-finished
iron and steel products.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Korean bribes probe draws in chaebol chiefs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An expanded investigation into bribery involving Korea's nuclear energy
programme threatens to implicate the heads of the Daewoo and Dong-ah
industrial groups.
Prosecutors allege that the former president of Korea Electric Power
(Kepco), the state-run electricity monopoly, received kickbacks totalling
Won400m (Pounds 324,412) from the two conglomerates for construction
contracts of several nuclear plants and thermal power stations.
Mr Ahn Byong-wha, the Kepco president between 1989 and 1993, was arrested
last week for allegedly accepting a Won200m bribe from the Korean agent for
Atomic Energy of Canada involving a nuclear reactor contract. A total of
five nuclear power plants were ordered by Kepco at a cost of Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 6.6bn) during Mr Ahn's term.
Mr Kim Woo-choong, the Daewoo chairman and one of Korea's best-known
businessmen, is expected to be interrogated today on his return from a
business trip to Vietnam following the questioning of Mr Choi Won-suk, the
Dong-ah chairman, over the weekend.
The business groups own two of the country's largest construction companies.
Both men could be indicted on bribery charges if it is believed they gave
kickbacks to Mr Ahn.
Mr Ahn is alleged to have demanded the money in order to bribe other
government officials in the former administration of President Roh Tae-woo
in an unsuccessful attempt to extend his term as Kepco president.
The Kepco investigation threatens to harm relations between the government
of President Kim Young-sam and the country's big conglomerates, or chaebol.
Mr Kim initially took a tough stance against the chaebol last year in an
effort to reduce their immense economic and political influence. Several
main groups, including Hyundai and Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), were the
target of corruption inquiries.
But the government adopted a conciliatory policy toward the chaebol earlier
this year as part of an attempt to revive economic growth.
Political analysts believe that Mr Kim might once again be willing to
challenge the chaebol in an effort to reverse his declining popularity after
his ruling Democratic Liberal party lost two of three parliamentary
by-elections last week.
The Korean public has generally mistrusted the power of the chaebol and the
president's anti-corruption campaign last year contributed to his high
approval ratings then.
It is thought Mr Kim may also try to use the Kepco investigation as a means
to assert his authority in the DLP against the conservative faction
affiliated with former President Roh.
Mr Ahn was a former trade and industry minister in the Roh administration
after serving as president of state-controlled Posco.
Critics of Mr Kim have accused him of conducting a political vendetta by
focusing corruption investigations on companies whose leaders were known to
oppose his presidential candidacy in 1992.
Mr Kim of Daewoo and Mr Park Tae-joon, the former Posco chairman, supported
a aborted effort to run a conservative candidate against the present
president.
Mr Park later fled to Japan after he was investigated for allegedly using
Posco funds to finance the failed presidential challenge.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, the former Hyundai chairman who stood against Mr Kim in
the 1992 election, recently received a suspended jail sentence for illegal
campaign finances, and his group has been subject to government-imposed
financial restrictions.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Waters smoothed in Taiwan straits: The talks between Beijing
and Taipei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's official media yesterday highlighted what was described as an
'important breakthrough' in talks between Chinese and Taiwanese officials,
but gave less weight to the story than newspapers in Taiwan.
People's Daily, the communist party newspaper, on page three of its
international edition, reported that common ground had been achieved on
'functional issues' such as the repatriation of hijackers, fishing disputes
and the return of mainland Chinese working illegally in Taiwan.
But observers in Taipei cautioned that while the outcome of the talks, the
sixth round since groundbreaking meetings in April 1993, had smoothed
cross-strait waters for the time being, underlying political tensions would
be likely to escalate in the future.
Reports in the Chinese press were consistent in tone with the need for
workmanlike discussions Beijing had emphasised in the lead-up to the talks
between Mr Tang Shubei, secretary-general of China's quasi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and his Taiwanese
counterpart, Chiao Jen-ho of the Straits Exchange Foundation.
While Beijing is treating the latest developments in a sober manner, there
is no doubt it is taking seriously the process begun in Singapore in 1993
when the two sides agreed at a highly publicised meeting to explore ways to
broaden contacts as part of a confidence building process.
Impetus has been given to the discussions by Beijing's growing concern,
shared by the Taiwanese leadership, about a strengthening nationalist
movement in Taiwan. China's leaders will not have overlooked opinion polls
showing an increasing number of Taiwanese favouring independence.
China's avowed aim is to achieve reunification of Taiwan with the mainland,
but whereas in the past it had insisted there was plenty of time to achieve
this, gains made in recent elections by opposition parties committed to
independence have changed Beijing's approach.
Mr Tang gave voice to these concerns in comments after the two sides reached
agreement on Sunday. Describing cross-straits ties as 'very complicated', he
added: 'Whomever tries to cut these ties and create hostile feelings is
serving no-one's interests.'
While it would be stretching a point to describe Mr Tang's visit to Taiwan
as part of a 'charm offensive', there is also no doubt that he was at pains
to show a human face to the Taiwanese to counter the independence tide.
Mr Tang may also have wished to make amends for China's mishandling of a
boat tragedy in March in which 24 Taiwanese tourists were murdered while
sightseeing on a lake near Hangzhou, south of Shanghai.
Mr Hu Fo, a politics professor at National Taiwan University, said the talks
'certainly helped restore a certain spirit of harmony, consensus and mutual
trust' damaged by the incident. 'But the basic problems which existed well
before (the incident) remain. This will make it extremely difficult to reach
similar agreements on a political level.'
Mr Shih Ming-teh, chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
denounced the talks, which he said Beijing had used merely to get ties back
on track.
Mainland Chinese media have expressed the hope that further high level
discussions can be held soon, including a repeat of the 'summit' in
Singapore between senior figures from both sides.
China would like to force the pace on such issues as direct shipping and air
links, but Taiwan remains nervous, fearing being drawn into a suffocating
embrace.
Beijing, for its part, wishes to encourage trade and investment further.
Taiwanese investment in the mainland exceeds USDollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn),
and would receive a significant boost if barriers to direct contacts were
removed.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Iran's MPs block cuts in food and drug subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TEHRAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iran's parliament yesterday ordered the government not to cut subsidies on
food and medicine, weakening a key element of President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani's economic liberalisation programme, Reuter reports from Tehran.
The MPs, during a debate broadcast on state radio, agreed however with the
government on the need for cuts in generous domestic energy subsidies,
despite earlier this year having vetoed an increase in petrol prices.
As it opened its debate on a new five-year plan, already watered down in
committee by members uneasy with Mr Rafsanjani's free-market reforms,
parliament also ordered a 25 per cent cut in Iran's foreign debt by the end
of the plan.
The government had proposed a 15 per cent cut in foreign borrowing during
the five-year plan, which was originally due to come into force at the end
of March, but has been delayed by parliament for one year to allow closer
study.
The debt was put at Dollars 30bn by Mr Ali Movahedi Savoji, a Tehran deputy,
during the debate.
Mr Rafsanjani said in April that Iran's foreign debt was Dollars 18bn, of
which Dollars 10bn had been refinanced in agreements with foreign creditors.
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said special Majlis (parliament) committees
had 'hammered out and modified' government proposals for the five-year
development plan, Iran's second since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
The full parliament approved the plan's broad objectives, of deregulation,
currency and subsidy reforms that have stirred popular discontent.
'The government does not feel there are great differences (to the plan)
after the approval of the (Majlis) special committee,' said Mr Masood
Rowghani Zanjani, head of the budget and planning body and representing the
government in the debate. 'We were able to minimise our differences.'
But the committee told the government not to make cuts during the plan in
subsidies on medicine and certain foodstuffs - worth Dollars 1.67bn a year
compared to a total budget for 1994-95 of just under Dollars 40bn.

KUWAIT yesterday signed a contract with a Russian state arms company to buy
armoured personnel carriers and multiple rocket launchers, the state news
agency Itar-Tass reported, writes Chrystia Freeland in Moscow. Kuwait is the
first country to buy Russia's Smerch rocket launchers, which are the
successors to the Katyusha system. A spokesman for Rosvooruzhenye, the state
company through which the weapons are being sold, would not specify the
price or quantity of armaments negotiated in the contract. Yesterday's deal
is the most recent step in Russia's effort to revive its massive but
cash-strapped defence sector by finding foreign buyers for the arms the
Kremlin no longer wants or can afford. Government officials said yesterday
that the Ministry of Defence, traditionally allowed nearly unlimited access
to the state purse, is falling behind in payments to arms factories. The
government's debt to the defence industry is one reason for Russia's
dramatic fall in industrial production this year.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Boeing in Dollars 600m Chinese venture -
XAC to supply sections for 737 airliner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Boeing yesterday signed its biggest manufacturing agreement yet with a
Chinese company when its president initialled contracts worth about Dollars
600m for the supply of aft sections for its 737 twin-engine airliners.
Mr Ron Woodard, president of Boeing, said the Xian Aircraft Company (XAC),
was 'now elevating itself from a producer of major assemblies to
manufacturer of an entire Boeing aeroplane section.'
XAC has been manufacturing parts for Boeing aircraft since the 1980s,
including vertical fins, horizontal stabilisers and forward access doors.
But this will be the first time it will have manufactured the whole section
of an aircraft.
Boeing's decision to engage a Chinese company in a big production venture
reflects the company's desire to further consolidate its position in its
fastest growing market.
'Support of China's aerospace industry has been a top priority for Boeing
for many years,' said Mr Woodard. 'Much technology has been exchanged . . .
enabling China's aerospace industry to be on a par with other world-class
manufacturers.'
Boeing supplied 46 jetliners to China last year or 14 per cent of its entire
production of 330 aircraft. China this year is scheduled to receive 36
Boeings, or 14 per cent of the company's output of 260 aircraft.
China is also in the market for Boeing's newest jetliner, the 777, which is
a medium-to-long-range wide-bodied jet with a capacity of up to 400
passengers. China Southern Airlines, based in Guangzhou, has ordered six of
the aircraft with the first due in May 1995.
Boeing also announced that it was upgrading its representation in China by
basing a senior executive in Beijing. He will report directly to the
president of the company in Seattle.
Boeing plans to spend Dollars 100m in China over the next five years on
upgrading its service and spare parts facilities and in assisting the
Chinese to improve their maintenance and air safety standards.
Mr Woodard said Boeing hoped to continue its dominance of the China market
with 65-75 per cent of new sales.
Boeing forecasts that the total market for commercial jet aircraft sales in
China will be worth Dollars 40bn until 2010. This would make China the
world's third largest aviation market after the US and Japan.
Separately, Mr Woodard told reporters he expected that a feasibility study,
involving Boeing, Chinese and Japanese organisations, into the co-production
of a 100-seater jetliner for the Asia-Pacific would be completed within 18
months.

FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: HK gives the world its phone number -
Foreign interest in a planned expansion of its mobile market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government has incensed the telecommunications industry with
proposals to expand the mobile telephone market - a move widely tipped to
have the effect of attracting competition from across the globe and expected
to give the existing cellular operators a run for their money.
The government announced last month that it would award up to 10 new mobile
licences as early as next April. The invitation to bid is bound to attract a
wide number of bidders, including from Europe and the US. Hong Kong has no
bars on foreign ownership or participation in its economy and licences are
awarded on the basis of merit rather than being auctioned off to the highest
bidder.
The new licences are being awarded on the basis of a projected total demand
of 1.1m mobile phone users, or 18 per cent of the total Hong Kong
population, by the end of 1998, which assumes current growth rates are
maintained.
In a consultative paper issued in February, the government said it intended
to award up to six Personal Communication Services (PCS) (also known as
Personal Com - munication Network (PCN)) licences - mobile services intended
for the mass market with coverage comparable to existing cellular services
and accessible through inexpensive and lightweight handsets.
Even this suggestion met with outrage - Pacific Link Communications, one of
the existing cellular operators, advocated a ban on new licences for the
time being; conversely two non-cellular operators urged discrimination
against (if not a total veto on) those operators already providing cellular
services.
But the submissions in response to the consultative paper that caused the
greatest impact were those that called on the Office of the
Telecommunications Authority (Ofta) to consider the advanced Japanese
technology known as Personal Handy Phone System (PHS).
Hong Kong last week asked Japan's telecommunications ministry for
co-operation in its plan to introduce the system.
The suggestion came in a proposal - outlined in the authority's report on
the Future Regulation of Mobile Telecommunications Services in Hong Kong
that followed the consultation process - to issue four new licences on PHS.
Mr Alex Arena, director-general of telecommunications for Ofta, says about
half the 47 submissions made after the consultative paper mentioned PHS. 'So
I took the view, if the industry wants to use PHS and I have spectrum
(frequencies) available, and if it meets the usual tests for developing a
standard, I would be prepared to accept it for Hong Kong.'
He disputes the notion of a 'magic number', or ceiling, and points to the
fast-growing pager market which, unhampered by regulatory barriers, has
swollen to accommodate 34 licencees.
'Competition has driven that market and grown that market and therefore many
more licences can exist that would not have had the government decided four
or five was the right number. We have been trying to get the message across
that government's role is to create opportunities in the market. If they
cannot make a business of it then the normal marketplace dynamics will take
effect,' he says.
But it is the nature of that competition which is disturbing the industry.
Mr Douglas Li, chief executive of SmarTone, Hong Kong's newest cellular
operator, says: 'The government takes the view competition is good. But
that's a narrow view. It seems logical and simple and appeals to the
populous, but I think it's too simplistic in the sense that overall if you
look at Hong Kong as a whole all these networks are way too many.
'Economically it is not that efficient. Especially with PCN, the nature of
which means you have to have substantial investment up front. By issuing
licences all at the same time means some time in 1996/97 we will have this
sudden emergence of a massive amount of capacity. People put hard dollars in
to create those, and the only way is to make them pay is to grab customers.
The most likely way to do that is by dropping the hell out of prices, but
that means the financial case deteriorates, maybe beyond the pale.'
Hongkong Telecom's deputy chief executive Peter Howell-Davies says: 'Six PCN
licences and four PHS licences is bold. Whether it's the best solution for
Hong Kong I think needs - and am sure will receive - further consideration.
. . . We have counselled some caution on whether that's the best solution
for Hong Kong, knowing the industry is changing fairly rapidly.'
Mr Andrew Harrington, senior analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong
doubts there will be enough demand to absorb more than two new licencees -
one PCN and one PHS.
Already three out of 10 people in Hong Kong have some form of mobile
telephony, or around one per household, giving Hong Kong one of the highest
penetrations in the world and putting it on a par with fixed wire telephone
penetration in Taiwan and South Korea. 'It takes a leap of faith there's
significant long-term growth left in the market. How high can it go?' says
Mr Harrington.
Mr Li of SmarTone is adamant the move will do little to enhance services to
customers: 'I don't think it is necessarily better for consumers. I can see
the logic behind what they are saying, but I do feel by splitting the
spectrum in so many parts it is not aiding efficiency on the part of the
operators. It requires us to invest more and ultimately that (cost) has to
be passed on to customers.
'It will lead to a massive amount of capacity and definitely bring down
prices. Initially that's a great deal for the consumer, but I believe there
will be casualties financially among the operators. If that kind of
cost-cutting competition comes in then you will find possible deterioration
in services offered.'

<TEXT>
Norway's budget deficit could fall below NKr30bn (Pounds 2.82bn) in 1995 if
prices for the country's North Sea oil remain strong, the Finance Ministry
said. For the current year it said the deficit would be less than NKr40bn,
compared to a forecast of NKr42.5bn. Norway, Europe's biggest oil producer,
produced a record 2.67m barrels per day in June. The Labour government has
forecast a 1994 oil price of NKr110 a barrel.
Car sales in Spain rose 16.6 per cent to 101,748 in July compared with
87,247 in the same month last year, the national carmakers' association
said. The increase in the first seven months was 18.9 per cent, but the
total of 555,599 was still far less than the 646,570 registered in the same
period of 1992 and 8.1 per cent below the average for the previous five
years.
A seasonally adjusted 4,917 French companies failed in January, 0.1 per cent
more than the 4,866 judged bankrupt in December, Insee, the national
statistics office, said. However the number of companies failing in the
three months from November 1993 to January 1994 was 1.5 per cent down on the
same period a year earlier.

<TEXT>
President Leonid Kuchma issued two decrees yesterday putting himself
directly in charge of government and subordinating all local councils to the
presidency, state television said, Reuter reports from Kiev. Under the first
decree the president will define the government's basic direction and
priorities and appoint and sack the heads of powerful state committees. Mr
Vitaly Mosol will remain as prime minister. The move was explained in the
decree as necessary to 'put into effect economic reforms and develop market
relations'. The second decree subordinates the heads of Ukraine's 27
regional councils directly to the president. Lesser councils must then
report to the regional councils.
Earlier, Mr Kuchma issued the first of a planned series of decrees aimed at
reforming the economy. Under it financial assistance to state enterprises,
mostly in the form of loans, will be given only after they provide a
business plan or restructuring programme.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Dutch snuff out church candle cartel: EU rules have ended a
price arrangement dating back to first world war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stiff wind of competition is blowing through the candle-lit churches of
the Netherlands, where members of the Church Candles Convention have been
forced by European Union rules to change their ways and abandon the practice
of price fixing.
This week, as part of its drive to eliminate cartels, the government
outlawed a price-fixing arrangement that has been operated by the
convention's 12 members since the first world war.
The companies, which supply candles to mainly Catholic churches, have not
decided whether to appeal. 'To be successful, we'd have to prove that the
price arrangements are in the interest of the Netherlands as a whole,' said
Mr Gody van den Hurk, secretary of the industry association. They are not
alone in feeling the heat of the government's campaign against cartels.
Until recently, the Netherlands was alone in the EU to permit cartels,
provided they were not expressly forbidden and were entered in a secret
government register.
The Netherlands forbade price-fixing agreements in 1993, and this year it
outlawed market-sharing and tender-fixing agreements. So far, it has not
granted a single exemption to the rules, not even to the 12 church
candle-makers.
'We've never heard objections from fellow manufacturers or the churches
themselves,' said a spokesman for Van Manen, a family-owned candle-maker.
'The market for church candles is not expanding, and there's no growth in
the number of churches. If anything, the trend is downwards.'
Mr Jacques Klok, chairman of the finance directors of the Catholic Church's
seven Dutch bishoprics, said: 'To us, what is important is that there are
enough candle-makers in the Netherlands.'
Each of the church's 1,800 Dutch parishes buys its own candles from its own
long-standing suppliers. According to Mr van den Hurk, because of these
traditional links between priests and the companies which have supplied
local churches for generations, there is little likelihood of cut-throat
competition emerging.
Attentive service and quick deliveries are probably more important to
churches than price alone, he believed.
The mainstay of the industry is the devotional candles which churchgoers can
light for a donation, starting at around Fl 1 (36p) for the smallest candle.
Churches pay less, and use the difference to pay for general upkeep and
religious purposes.
The industry's most specialised product is the large altar candle which is
made to detailed liturgical specifications and which stays lit for days at a
time on special occasions, such as Christmas or Lent. Prices for these are
calculated by the kilo, but can easily exceed Fl 250 (Pounds 90) for the
bigger varieties.
The average Catholic church spends several thousand guilders a year on
candles. This is especially true for those in large cities where streams of
tourists and other visitors encourage church elders to light candles during
the week. In the countryside, candle-lighting tends to be restricted to once
or twice a week.
Together, Dutch churches spend up to Fl 8m a year on candles, a fraction of
the country's total Fl 200m annual consumption of candles.
Besides church candle-makers, other business sectors that have failed to win
exemptions from the new cartel rules include the country's aviation schools,
which wanted to continue their policy of charging a basic minimum for
parachute courses.
Dutch estate agents also dropped their minimum commission under government
pressure and, instead, adopted a system of negotiable, recommended charges.
This week, however, a Dutch house-owners' lobby group claimed that some
agents were still agreeing commission levels and presenting a united front
to prospective house-buyers.

FT  09 AUG 94 / The tinkering engineer who serves as the symbol of Ukraine's
quiet revival: Chrystia Freeland visits a surgical needle-maker with a
pointer to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Viktor Skuratovsky, a former professor of mechanical engineering, is the
sort of man who, were he an American, would spend his weekends tinkering in
his garage and his weekdays parlaying his technical ingenuity into a growing
business.
But Mr Skuratovsky was born in Ukraine and for the first five decades of his
life his inventive drive earned him admonitions rather than rewards. In the
1980s he was dismissed from his job as an engineering professor because of
his Ukrainian Catholic faith and he spent the rest of the decade struggling
to produce surgical needles with his own unique process in the cramped
basement of a Kiev hospital.
For Mr Skuratovsky things are at last starting to change. Ukraine's
government is incompetent and its state sector largely moribund, but slowly
opportunities are opening for private thinkers and tinkers. Without taking
into consideration the fast-growing shadow economy, the private sector
accounted for 30 per cent of Ukraine's gross national product in the first
quarter of this year.
That figure, and the expected continued growth of the private sector, is
thanks to a new breed of businessmen like Mr Skuratovsky. Together with Mr
Andrii Smirnov, a former student, and Mr Evhen Stychynsky, a young lawyer,
Mr Skuratovsky has found an American partner and American investors for his
business. Their joint venture, Holnit, was due to begin production of
surgical needles this summer and they hope by the end of the year to be up
to capacity of 2m needles a year.
The owners of Holnit have an engineer's scorn for the new biznesmeny who
have capitalised on government connections, or muscle, or both, to earn
instant fortunes by selling commodities at bargain prices and importing
often shoddy western consumer goods.
'Our principle, from the very beginning, has been not to engage in these
easy trading operations,' Mr Smirnov says. 'No matter what is happening now,
we are convinced that eventually, any nation's economic strength is in
manufacturing.'
Ukraine has a vast manufacturing base, but, as in other former Soviet
republics, in the past the country's technical expertise was almost
exclusively devoted to the military sector. Holnit, and other small
factories like it, are engaged in conversion by stealth.
The two massive lathes in Holnit's brand new workshop amazed the company's
new American partners from Look, a Massachusetts-based producer of surgical
needles. Purchased at cut-rate prices from cash-starved Ukrainian defence
plants, the lathes, according to the Americans, are so sophisticated 'you
can make rockets with these things'.
Mr Skuratovsky has fitted out his factory at a fraction of the price he
would pay in the west thanks to the managers of military factories, once the
Soviet Union's industrial elite, but now squeezed by the nearly bankrupt
Ukrainian central government, who were delighted to earn money from
equipment for which they no longer had any use.
Another advantage Holnit has over fledgling manufacturers in the west is a
skilled populace, desperate to leave jobs in the collapsing state sector.
While Holnit is confident about the technical skills of its new workers, it
demands a change in attitude.
'When people come in for a job interview, the first thing I tell them is
that this is not a socialist workplace, it is the new Ukrainian capitalism,'
says Mr Smirnov, the partner in charge of hiring. 'There will be no trade
unions and no communist party cells here. Those who work well will be well
rewarded, those who don't will be fired.'
Though Holnit's version of capitalism, Ukraine-style, promises to be far
tougher than its western counterpart, Mr Skuratovsky is grateful for the
participation of his American partners. What Look and the Ukraine Fund, a US
based venture capital fund which invests in small Ukrainian businesses, have
contributed to Holnit is quality control techniques, packaging, marketing
expertise and capital. Holnit and its investors hope that with this
combination of Ukrainian know-how and western money, the company will be
able to corner the market in the former Soviet Union, which has no
indigenous large-scale manufacturer of surgical needles.
'Western aid has destroyed the market in Moscow and St. Petersburg,' Mr
Skuratovsky says. 'Why pay for what you can get for free?' But he believes
there is a huge, untapped market in Ukraine, provincial Russia and central
Asia where surgeons, unable to find the appropriate instruments, often
resort to inadequately sterilised, inappropriate needles and sutures.
For the privilege of filling this needed gap in the Ukrainian market, Mr
Skuratovsky and his partners have had to negotiate a Kafka-esque
bureaucratic obstacle course. Everyone from the local fire department, to
the tax inspectors to the civic administration must be, as Mr Stychynsky,
the lawyer, delicately puts it, 'taken into consideration'.
And Holnit has it better than most Ukrainian companies because the country's
favourable legislation on foreign investment allows Holnit, as a joint
venture, to take a five-year holiday from punitive taxes which, if
rigorously applied, can consume all of a company's profits.
Somehow, Mr Skuratovsky and his partners retain their confidence that they
will manage to continue to circumvent their nation's administrative
labyrinth. Even as construction workers were putting the finishing touches
to their new workshop, they avidly described the really perfect factory they
hoped to be able to build in five years' time.
And over coffee, Mr Skuratovsky is unable to resist the temptation to pull
out a pen, take a napkin and illustrate his newest invention for an even
better lathyroscopic needle.
This is the second article in a three-part series on Ukraine. The first
appeared yesterday.

Parachutists with bad timing knocked down a group of youths marching with
banners over the weekend in a fittingly clumsy conclusion to St Petersburg's
Goodwill Games. As an effort to reclaim its historic place as Russia's
'window on the west', the international sporting event has sorely backfired
for St Petersburg. The swimming was postponed for a day because of pool
water so filthy that western teams decanted it into plastic bottles to show
friends back home. Skaters fared no better: the ice was so thin and so soft
that their events were delayed as well. CNN owner Mr Ted Turner, who
organised the games, put a brave face on the sparsely attended event,
describing it as 'a huge success'.

The Czech National Bank has revised sharply upwards its estimate of foreign
capital inflows for 1994 from Kcs60bn (Pounds 1.38bn) to Kcs100bn, but
stressed that the inflationary effect would be broadly neutral. The pace of
foreign capital inflows has pushed up M2 money supply to a preliminary 7.4
per cent in June from 3.7 per cent in April, and an average 1.3 per cent in
the first quarter of 1994. Year-on-year inflation in June was 9.7 per cent,
up from 9.3 per cent in May and 9.2 per cent in April, and close to the
target of 10 per cent set by the CNB at the beginning of the year.

Greece's Socialist government yesterday refused to bow to pay demands from
air traffic controllers, who are disrupting flights with a go-slow. Foreign
tourists have faced long delays at Athens airport since May, mainly because
of the protest by 500 controllers. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, transport and
communications minister, told the controllers' union in a letter: 'I will
agree to fresh talks on condition you drop your demand for pay rises in 1994
and 1995. I will not grant one drachma beyond inflation and nothing will
make me change my stand. The claim would bring pay from Dr600,000 (Pounds
1,629) a month to Dr1m.' He said he was considering transferring air traffic
controllers to the defence ministry's jurisdiction, where security
considerations would make conditions tougher.

The commander of UN troops in Bosnia called yesterday for a demilitarised
zone around Sarajevo after Nato aircraft struck at defiant Serbs last
Friday. Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose was trying to set up a meeting with the
commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, Gen Ratko Mladic, to discuss the
issue, a UN official said. The plan calls for a withdrawal of all armed and
uniformed soldiers and would allow both Serb and Moslem forces to take their
weapons out of the zone for use elsewhere. However, there has been no
response from Gen Mladic, whose forces in Sarajevo have been blamed for an
increasing number of sniping incidents. UN sharpshooters are reported to
havekilled one or two Serb snipers in the past two days.

<TEXT>
The Italian state broadcaster, the Rai, said yesterday it was suspending a
television advertising campaign designed to boost the image of Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. The Rai decided to suspend the
government advertisements, launched only 48 hours earlier, after Italy's
media ombudsman intervened. The decision to suspend the advertisements is
another slap in the face for a government which last month suffered a series
of embarrassments, including the withdrawal of a decree limiting
magistrates' use of pre-trial custody. The first of the 45-second
advertisements, accompanied by the slogan 'Facts which citizens should know
to exercise their rights', was broadcast on Saturday, and outlined the
achievements of the government since its appointment in May. Italian law
allows the government to use the media to publish information of 'social
relevance', but opposition parties said the campaign was pure propaganda.
Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest media-to-supermarkets company kept a L3bn (Pounds
1.2m) fund to make secret payments, according to the prime minister's
younger brother Paolo, quoted yesterday by the Ansa and Agi news agencies.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi, arrested two weeks ago on suspicion of organising
Fininvest bribes to the finance police, is reported to have told
anti-corruption investigators: 'We were able to create a fund of several
billion lire, about three billion, which we were able to use to make those
payments that could certainly not be put on the balance sheet.' The fund
operated between 1983 and 1990, he was reported to have said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enel, the Italian state electricity utility, will be privatised before Stet,
the telecommunications holding company, according to Italy's industry
minister. In an interview published in the weekly magazine L'Espresso, Mr
Vito Gnutti said Stet would not be privatised until 1995, whereas 'in
September or October we should have the papers ready for a decision on
Enel'. Such a timetable, if confirmed, is likely to disappoint Stet's former
managing director, Mr Michele Tedeschi, who took over last week as chairman
of Iri, the state holding company which is Stet's parent. He said a week ago
that he hoped Stet would be privatised in the autumn, as originally planned.
Both privatisations are likely to be complicated by political and market
pressures. Enel and Stet will be among the largest state companies to be
privatised in the two-year programme of sell-offs, and are politically the
most sensitive. The government must set up regulatory authorities for the
two industries before it can even attempt privatisation.
The Italian treasury announced at the weekend that it had raised L4,512bn
(Pounds 1.87bn) in June by selling half of Ina, the state-owned insurer, in
the largest privatisation so far. Ina's shareholders, which include a range
of Italian and foreign funds, will have a chance to vote for new directors
of the company at an autumn assembly, the treasury confirmed.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Germans fear delay in VAT changes

<TEXT>
German industrialists were warned yesterday that a new collection system for
value added tax in the European Union might be seriously delayed.
It was intended to streamline and simplify the cumbersome transitional
system currently in operation. However, tax experts in Bonn fear that
opposition to the new rules from other member states could put back the plan
until the introduction of a single European currency, in 1999 or even later.
The new system, requiring that VAT payments be levied at the rate applicable
in a product's country of origin rather than its country of sale, is an
important element in finalising details of the single European market.
Talks in Brussels between German business leaders and the European
Commission have produced no reassurance for their anxieties, the German
chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT) said yesterday.
They warned that the whole principle of collecting VAT on the
country-of-origin basis, which would favour big net exporters such as
Germany, could fail because of the current disagreements.
'The DIHT sees with great concern (the possibility) that the so-called
country-of-origin system for VAT in the European Union could fail,' the
German business lobby said. 'That principle must not be overturned.'
The German industrialists have been much the most energetic in seeking to
simplify the present transitional arrangements, which require companies to
do all the paperwork for VAT returns formerly carried out by the customs
authorities.
They have expressed surprise at the relative lack of support from business
groups in other member states.
The DIHT said that much of the opposition to the new system came from EU
governments who feared they would lose tax revenues if the VAT was collected
at the point of manufacture and not of sale. But the transitional rules were
imposing a substantial extra cost on companies in all member states.
It warned that a 'costly compromise for the business community' which might
emerge would be to delay introduction of the final system until the EU had
been able to make significant progress towards creation of a single
currency. Under present circumstances, that could well mean 1999 or even
later.

FT  09 AUG 94 / MMM hunger strikers held by police

<TEXT>
Four shareholders of the troubled Russian investment fund MMM were arrested
yesterday. They had began a hunger strike in solidarity with Mr Sergei
Mavrodi, president of the fund whose operations were frozen last week. After
demonstrations in Moscow demanding Mr Mavrodi's immediate release and an end
to 'a state attack' on the MMM fund, three of them were charged with illegal
picketing and one with 'insanitary behaviour'.
Shareholders at one of the demonstrations outside the White House,
headquarters of the Russian government, described Mr Mavrodi as 'as saviour
who can return to the Russian people the savings accounts and pensions which
the government has confiscated through its economic reforms'. They demanded
the government release Mr Mavrodi, who himself began a hunger strike last
weekend, and cut or eliminate taxes on his businesses, so MMM could return
their money.
Meanwhile, the authorities have intensified their crackdown on the
investment fund, whose share's have dropped to one fiftieth of their
previous value over the past two weeks. Tax officials announced that they
were extending by 10 days the detention in solitary confinement of Mr
Mavrodi, who is accused of tax evasion. An association of Russian
businessmen also said they had begun a private investigation into Mr
Mavrodi's misdeeds.
However, the shareholders' spirited protests suggest that the government's
strong-arm tactics against Mr Mavrodi are beginning to backfire. Mr Mavrodi,
who first demonstrated his ability to tap into the Russian psyche with MMM's
phenomenally successful advertising campaign, has managed to shift the rage
of frustrated investors from himself to the state.
'Thanks to the state's intervention, MMM has succeeded in evading
responsibility for the pyramid scheme,' said Mr Igor Bunin, a sociologist
studying Russia's fledgling capitalism. 'Now there is even a chance that Mr
Mavrodi, when he is eventually released, will be able to start another
operation of the same sort.'
Mr Sergei Taranov, MMM's spokesman, accused the tax police of forging the
arrest warrant for Mr Mavrodi. He said the fund could not resume 'normal
operations' until Mr Mavrodi's release, but he assured shareholders that,
despite his hunger strike, the president was still in good health. 'Mr
Mavrodi has no intention of dying,' Mr Taranov said.

Workers at Aer Lingus, Ireland's state-owned airline, plan to step up a
dispute over lay-offs and cost-cutting with eight days of protests, a union
spokesman said yesterday. Staff at the airline's maintenance subsidiary met
earlier to discuss action after talks with the company and mediators failed.
The protests - involving a series of blockages on roads around the airport -
will start today. A union official said: 'The action is going to last until
the issue is resolved . . . It is likely that there will be serious
disruption.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Italian rail deal raises wage cost fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Publio Fiori, Italy's transport minister, has again stirred up
controversy by intervening to avoid industrial action by a maverick
transport union, at the risk of provoking increased salary demands from
other employees.
Mr Fiori struck an informal deal on bonus pay with Comu, the Italian train
drivers' union, at the end of last week, averting a strike which threatened
to disrupt rail traffic on the busiest holiday weekend.
The accord provoked a sharp reaction from Italy's larger unions, and has
raised fears that it will be difficult to rein in labour costs as the
government's economic team has demanded when the Ferrovie dello Stato, the
state-owned company which runs the railway system, begins formal
negotiations with its 140,000 employees in September.
Last month, Mr Fiori waded into the dispute between Alitalia, the state
airline, and cabin staff, by announcing an inquiry into the failure of the
company's management to foresee wildcat strike action by a small breakaway
union. An accord was eventually reached on radical restructuring plans in
spite of Mr Fiori's intervention, which management feared would undermine
their efforts.
In the wake of the Comu deal, stationmasters have called strikes for August
21 and September 10. The FS has estimated the cost of the informal deal at
L70bn (Pounds 29m) for the 20,000 train drivers, rising to nearly L400bn if
the company is forced to concede similar bonuses to other staff.
The FS yesterday refused official comment, pointing out merely that Mr
Fiori's intervention was 'anomalous' given the FS's shareholder was not the
Transport Ministry, but the Treasury - which, under Mr Lamberto Dini, had
been pushing for a strict line on wage negotiations.
Mr Fiori, a member of the far right coalition member, the National Alliance,
said last week that the agreement with Comu would 'commit' the FS to pay the
bonus to the drivers from October 1994. The FS believes the accord is not
legally binding, but is still worried about the political precedent which
has been set. Doubt has also been cast on the necessity for such
concessions. The state railway claims earlier industrial action by the union
affected less than half of rail services, with inter-city services running
normally.
Leaders of the main union federations have also criticised the deal,
pointing out that their members can hardly be expected to support the
government's tough economic objectives if ministers grant individual
increases to single categories of workers.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Schroders' slip will lead to Pounds 4m payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A technical slip by Schroders, one of the City's leading financial advisers,
is to result in an unprecedented Pounds 4m compensation payment to investors
who sold shares in a takeover target on the basis of a misleading
announcement.
The merchant bank's mistake - the failure to include a standard phrase in a
statement to the Stock Exchange - was described yesterday by one adviser
involved in the bid as 'like leaving a full stop off the end of a sentence'.
It could have spelled failure for a bid by Schroders' client, the US funeral
group Service Corporation International, but the Takeover Panel yesterday
provisionally forgave the lapse as an 'innocent mistake'.
As a result, SCI made a third offer for Great Southern, which finally got
the backing of the controlling shareholders of the UK funeral company. The
new bid, at 775p per ordinary share, values Great Southern at Pounds 112.9m.
The Panel tomorrow morning will hear an appeal against its provisional
decision to allow the new offer to proceed.
The error appeared in Schroders' statement to the Stock Exchange last
Tuesday, when it announced that SCI had made a 'final offer' of 680p, but
failed to list the standard exception that the bid could be revised if
another bidder emerged.
The full offer document issued the following day included the standard
contingency clause. In the intervening period, however, SCI bought close to
27 per cent of Great Southern's enlarged share capital in the market, and a
potential competing bidder had arrived on the scene.
One neutral merchant banker said yesterday: 'You may be able to change the
terms of a final offer but you have to specifically say so at the time.'
SCI has therefore agreed to pay the difference between the two offers to all
investors who sold shares last Tuesday and Wednesday. The refund will amount
to 95p per ordinary share, and 38p per convertible share. The bulk of sales
was made to SCI itself, and the compensation on those sales would amount to
about Pounds 3.73m.
Mr David Challen, Schroders' group director of corporate finance, said: 'The
issue of where the cost of this falls is simply not one which has at this
stage been discussed', but he admitted the possibility that some
compensation might be paid to SCI.
Schroders claimed the mistake was the joint responsibility of the entire
advisory team, which included Smith &amp; Williamson Securities and lawyers
Linklaters &amp; Paines.
Baring Brothers is appealing against SCI's increased bid on behalf of Loewen
Group, a Canadian funeral operator which emerged last week as a potential
'white knight' bidder for Great Southern. However, members of the Takeover
Panel said last night that Schroders' omission had been made in 'wholly
exceptional circumstances'.
SCI, the world's largest private burial company, made its first offer for
Great Southern at 600p a share. The original offer was rejected by the Field
family, who controlled 56 per cent of the company's ordinary shares through
JD Field. However, yesterday, the Fields accepted the enlarged deal, which
will be worth about Pounds 51m to them.

FT  09 AUG 94 / VW's Lopez adjusts his time for different desk job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Putting Volkswagen back on its feet is not most people's idea of a part-time
job, but the motor group's second-in-command, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, has found time enough for a spot of freelancing in the furniture
trade.
For the past six months he has been helping fit a new set of legs to
Flototto, a small private company manufacturing office and school furniture.
In October, VW's production director will make a personal appearance at a
Cologne trade fair where he will share the limelight with the Gutersloh
company's latest product: a desk.
No ordinary desk, it is being touted as an adjustable workstation,
developed, designed and manufactured according to the gospel of lean
production and continuous improvement so vigorously promulgated by Mr Lopez
since his stormy arrival in Germany from General Motors in March 1993.
His involvement followed extensive consultations with Japanese and other
experts in modern manufacturing techniques by company owner, Mr Reinhard
Flototto.
According to his spokesman, Mr Flototto needed someone who would support
management in pushing through changes necessary to counter the effects of
recession and structural crisis which had knocked up to 40 per cent off
earnings in the office furniture sector.
Mr Flototto, he said, had no qualms about approaching Germany's unofficial
Archbishop of the Church of Continuous Improvement Processes, and signing
him up for a 'co-operation agreement'.
Since then the controversial Basque has worked in his spare time - on
undisclosed terms - as patron of and participant in the Flototto project.
Even his daughter, Maite, a trained industrial designer, has joined in
briefly.
Mr Lopez, who disdains sitting at his work station to do his day job at VW,
preferring to stalk the factory floor, has contributed by participating in a
series of workshops and discussions.
According to Flototto, through-put times on the company's production lines
have been slashed from a week to 45 minutes for some products.
The application of just-in-time and lean production principles have allowed
the furniture company to dispense with its main stockholding warehouse,
which is earning Mr Flototto almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) a year in rent.
Mr Lopez's appearance at the October launch will earn the new desk - and Mr
Lopez - a wealth of publicity.
According to Volkswagen, his extra-curricular involvement was compatible
with the group's endorsement of continuous improvement as a cure for many of
the ills throughout German industry.
The arrangement was private. There was no question of his not having enough
to do at VW, a spokesman said. 'He has simply got an enormous amount of
energy.'

FT  09 AUG 94 / Borrowing hits Pounds 683m as recovery strengthens: Consumer
lending rises while factory prices remain subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Subdued price rises at the factory gate and buoyant consumer borrowing
figures provided fresh evidence yesterday that April's tax increases have so
far not upset steady growth with low inflation in Britain.
The Central Statistical Office reported that the prices charged by UK
manufacturers for their products rose by only 1.9 per cent in the year to
July - the lowest increase since December 1986 - while net borrowing by
consumers to cover current purchases of goods and services grew by a record
Pounds 683m in June.
The two sets of statistics reinforced the impression that the UK is enjoying
an unusually benign recovery from the recession of the early 1990s.
Among yesterday's good news, the CSO reported that the 'core rate' of output
price inflation, which excludes food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, also
increased by only 1.9 per cent in the year to July: its lowest rise for
nearly 27 years.
But at the same time, it announced that prices for industry's raw materials
and fuel rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between June and July
after a sharp 1.3 per cent increase in June.
Treasury officials hailed the drop in annual output price inflation from 2.1
per cent in June as encouraging. The Confederation of British Industry said
it highlighted the competitive nature of the UK's post-recession economy.
But some City economists warned that the Bank of England was still likely to
push for an increase in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent in the months
ahead.
'There are signs that gains in input prices and manufacturers' price
expectations are starting to feed through (into output prices),' said Mr
Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in London.
'The drop in the year-on-year rate of output price inflation will not
prevent a rate increase in the next few months, and probably in September,'
he added. Economists at James Capel, the UK stockbroker, said they thought
base rates might rise in October.
Yet, although yesterday's credit figures showed the biggest monthly gain in
net lending to consumers since figures were first collected in the 1980s,
there was little sign of concern in the Treasury that they might signal a
re-igniting of inflation.
Officials pointed out that June's Pounds 683m increase in net lending
followed weak net lending of Pounds 208m in May.
The CBI pointed out, in addition, that the record increase in net lending
coincided with heavy price discounting at the start of the summer sale.
An indication that strong consumer borrowing continued into July came
yesterday from Barclaycard, which said its turnover increased by 10 per cent
in the year to July after growing by 7 per cent in the year to June.

FT  09 AUG 94 / Graduate salaries increase by smallest amount on record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The average salary being offered to new university graduates rose by only
1.1 per cent this year, the smallest increase since records began in 1981,
according to a report published today.
The finding, by the Higher Education Careers Services Unit, which represents
university vice-chancellors and principals, indicates the mean starting
salary in February this year, was Pounds 12,647, up from Pounds 12,505 a
year earlier.
This rise, calculated from 908 vacancies advertised to university career
services, was lower than increases in both the retail prices index (2.4 per
cent) and average earnings (3.5 per cent) over the same period. Between 1981
and 1990, average starting salaries for graduates of all disciplines had
increased above the rate of inflation.
But strong candidates are still able to command inflation-beating salaries.
The Association of Graduate Recruiters, which represents the 300 largest
university recruiters, said its members had raised starting salaries by an
average of 3.8 per cent.
Mr Roly Cockman, the association's secretary, said yesterday: 'Even in
today's market, high fliers have the luxury of choice. Big companies will
pay Pounds 17,000 or Pounds 18,000 for a new graduate they really want.'
The outlook is more bleak, however, for the majority of graduates. Today's
report says: 'Since September, salary levels have been relatively stagnant
as employers have cautiously resumed recruitment following the recession and
have taken advantage of the large pool of graduates seeking jobs to keep
wage bills low.'
Mr Colin Lawton, the unit's statistical assistant, said: 'It's a
self-feeding process. A lot of companies are alerted when they find
graduates knocking on their doors or writing speculative letters.'
An increase in the influence of smaller employers in a market dominated,
before the recession, by large companies recruiting through the university
'milk round', was the main factor depressing salaries.
The total number of advertised vacancies for graduates rose 5 per cent on
last year, while the average number of vacancies offered by each company
fell, reflecting increased recruitment by smaller companies. Many were
recruiting graduates to jobs which might previously have been filled by
school leavers, Mr Lawton said.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Observer: Letts do it
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just like the medical variety, company doctors can't always agree as to the
best remedy for their patients. Ex-ICI chairman turned media star Sir John
Harvey-Jones, whose jolly advice in his TV series Troubleshooter often
seemed to be more carefully tailored to the camera than to the bottom line,
sparks more controversy than most.
So Sir John might be amused by a recent second opinion on one of his more
troublesome erstwhile patients, Charles Letts. His own view of the diary
printer had been that it had insufficient capital to support its
diversification, had no reason for a large headquarters in London, and
should reconsider its strategy of printing in-house.
Last week, Alan Mills, a graduate of the GEC school of company doctoring,
took over the chairmanship of Charles Letts, ending a family tradition which
has gone back more than 200 years. Mills says that one of the first things
he did on joining the board last year was to watch the video of Sir John's
'first-rate' programme.
Has Mills phoned Harvey-Jones for an update then? 'Certainly not. His daily
rate is astronomical.'

Dresdner rounds off the mid-year reporting season for Germany's big banks at

So far, results have come in above expectations and Dresdner's numbers are
likely to show the benefits of economic recovery and country debt
reschedulings which allowed its rivals sharply to reduce risk provisions.
They will also probably bear the scars of recent market turbulence which cut
deeply into the others' own-account trading income.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Ciba's genetically engineered wheat is first in field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first experimental crop of genetically engineered wheat has been
harvested from a field in the UK.
The success of the trial, carried out by Swiss-owned Ciba Seeds in
Cambridgeshire in the east of England, has enormous implications for
agriculture.
It shows that scientists can alter the characteristics of important cereals
in a reliable way, by giving them genes from other species.
The work is expected to lead within a few years to new wheat varieties with
increased resistance to drought and disease, less requirement for expensive
fertilisers, and other improvements.
Although Ciba was first into the field, several other industrial and
academic laboratories are close behind, including Zeneca Seeds, the John
Innes Centre and the Institute of Arable Crops Research in the UK.
The wheat grown at Great Abington, Cambridgeshire, contains 'marker genes'
of no commercial significance, chosen to prove that foreign genetic
material, DNA, can be passed on predictably from one generation of plants to
the next.
Some of the plants contained a red pigment gene taken from wild Peruvian
maize. When they were harvested last week, all their grains showed red spots
 -looking unlike any wheat grown on Earth before.
The other plants produced bacterial enzymes which the Ciba scientists
detected in simple lab tests, proving that the new genes were switched on
success-fully.
Mr David Thompson, head of research at Ciba's cereal breeding business, said
the 16 square metre trial plot yielded several kilograms of genetically
engineered wheat. The crop has been flown to the company's US research
centre in North Carolina for further analysis.
The strains were created last year in North Carolina, by shooting thousands
of microscopic gold balls coated with DNA into wheat cells.
Ciba scientists then grew two generations of plants in greenhouses before
sending the seed to Cambridgeshire for the field trial.
The UK was chosen because of the country's expertise in wheat breeding and
because Ciba sees Europe as the first market for its genetically engineered
wheat.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty-five people, including 10 policemen, were injured in street clashes
in Havana, the Cuban capital, last Friday in which a crowd throwing stones
clashed with police, the Sunday newspaper Juventud Rebelde said, Reuter
reports from Havana.
Those injured included a policeman who suffered serious neck injuries after
being hit by stones and beaten, and a member of a civilian law enforcement
brigade who lost an eye when he was hit by protesters. Police fired during
the disturbances, but apparently in the air and it was not clear if live
bullets were used.
The clashes along a stretch of Havana's Malecon seafront drive were the most
serious disturbances in Havana for decades. The newspaper said that
'important groups' of those involved in the unrest were in detention and
would be tried and punished with severity.
President Fidel Castro has blamed the unrest on the US, saying it wants to
create disorder in Cuba and dubbing those involved in the clashes
Washington's 'fifth column' against the revolution.
The disturbances were linked to the hijackings of three ferry boats from
Havana bay towards the US in the space of nine days.
Authorities called on citizens to attend a gathering in Havana's Revolution
Square yesterday evening in homage to a policeman who was killed in the last
of these hijacks.

<TEXT>
Monday: Rising commodity prices, and their effect on producers' costs, were
mentioned as one of the new inflationary risks by the Bank of England in its
quarterly report, published last week. So particular attention will be paid
to today's producer prices figures. The consensus is for the annual rate of
output price inflation to remain at 2 per cent in July, while input price
inflation slips back to 1.3 per cent, from June's 1.4 per cent.
Tuesday: The delay in compiling European Union trade data these days means
that the world trade data for the UK released today, relate only to May.
June figures for trade with non-EU countries have already been released.
Analysts are expecting May's whole world deficit to widen to Pounds 1bn,
from Pounds 803m in April.
Wednesday: The markets will see the minutes of chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
meeting with Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, on July 6.
Since it has been clearly signalled that the duo did not agree on a base
rate rise either then, or at the more recent July 28 meeting, the main
interest will be to see whether Mr Clarke is showing any concern about
inflation.

Israel-Jordan peace moves
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin will officially enter Jordanian
territory for the first time to meet Crown Prince Hassan and open a new
border crossing between the Red Sea cities of Eilat and Aqaba.
The crossing, part of the peace accord signed last month in Washington, will
initially be for third country nationals.
US secretary of state Warren Christopher will attend the ceremony and make a
telephone call between Israel and Jordan, marking the opening of
communications between the two after nearly half a century of conflict.
After the ceremony, Mr Rabin and Mr Christopher will hold trilateral talks
with King Hussein in Aqaba.
US House and Senate representatives meet this week in conference to resolve
differences in two important bills: the Uruguay Round implementing
legislation and the controversial National Competitiveness Act, which
contains provisions discriminating against foreign business. Members are to
decide this week whether to give President Bill Clinton authority to
negotiate free-trade deals with Chile and other trading partners.
British Airways is expected to report strong first-quarter pre-tax profits
with estimates of the range of Pounds 85m-Pounds 95m (Dollars 132m-Dollars
147m). The good performance reflects the airline's strong traffic growth in
the first quarter, which has continued into the start of the second.
Particularly encouraging has been the increase in first and business class
traffic, which has been growing by about twice that in the economy cabin.

Armenia's president in US
Armenia's President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is due to meet US president Bill
Clinton in Washington. Mr Ter-Petrosyan, whose country has been reduced to
abject poverty by its war with neighbouring Azerbaijan, is expected to
discuss energy-starved Armenia's plans to restart its only nuclear power
station. President Clinton will no doubt wish to discuss with Ter-Petrosyan
the prospects for resolving the conflict over the Armenian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
Israel and Jordan resume bilateral peace talks on border demarcation, water
and security issues. The talks, at an Israeli hotel on the Dead Sea, aim to
resolve the main obstacles that stand in the way of a formal peace treaty.
Jordan is seeking the return of 360sq km of land occupied by Israel and the
'rightful' allocation of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers which
it claims Israel has illegally diverted since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
US trade policy: The US House of Representatives is to vote on bills to
remove China's Most Favoured Nation tariff status or limit the low levies to
goods produced in the private sector. President Clinton would veto the
legislation if it were to pass.
SPD conference: Leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD), including Rudolf Scharping, and Gunther Verheugen, his general
secretary, hold a conference in Bad Godesberg, near Bonn, to launch their
campaign for the October elections. They will be seeking to recover the
ground they have lost to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his ruling Christian
Democratic Union in recent months.
Football tax probe: Clubs from the UK Football Association's Premier League

Turkey minister's debut
Turkey's foreign minister Mumtaz Soysal is expected to attend tripartite
talks in Damascus with his Syrian and Iranian counterparts in his first
official visit since being appointed last month.
The regular meetings are aimed at co-ordinating policy on regional issues.
All three countries have Kurdish minorities and are concerned about the de
facto Kurdish state in the north of neighbouring Iraq.
Ankara is also likely to urge its neighbours to curb the cross-border
activities of Turkey's rebel Kurdistan Workers Party PKK.
Traditionally, this question has been linked to the vexed water issue and
Ankara's control of both the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers.
Slovak privatisation: The Slovak National Property Fund, which holds shares
in companies to be privatised, begins a second round of sell-offs involving
stakes in 19 small and medium sized companies with an estimated value of
Sk735m (Dollars 23.1m).
US economy:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board is due to speak to
a congressional committee about the reliability of monetary aggregates as
forecasting tools. Although the hearing is fairly technical, it falls right
in the middle of the Treasury's quarterly sale of new bonds, so Mr
Greenspan's every word is likely to be scrutinised by the bond market.
Ariane blast-off: The 66th Ariane rocket, delayed from July 30 by technical
problems, blasts off from the European Space Agency's centre in Kourou,
French Guiana, on the north-east coast of South America.
The rocket is to launch a 1.7 tonne communications satellite for a Brazilian

Japan rejigs constituencies
A new political map of Japan will be proposed to prime minister Tomiichi
Murayama. A government panel has drafted new boundaries to create 300
single-seat constituencies for the lower house of the Diet (parliament),
along with 200 seats allocated by nationwide proportional representation.
This would replace the present multi-seat system which fostered corruption,
as members of the same party would compete for a seat by offering local

FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Stet - the mother of all Italian
privatisations - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Stet, the Italian state telecommunications holding
company, came back into focus last week following remarks by Mr Michele
Tedeschi, the new chairman of Iri, the state holding company and Stet's
parent, that the sale could go ahead this autumn.
His comments have put the corporate finance departments at several
international investment banks on red alert, since they are all keen to have
a prominent role in what it has become known as the 'mother of all Italian
privatisations'.
Although unwilling to be quoted (for fear of blowing their chances of
winning such a lucrative mandate), bankers and telecoms analysts at these
organisations firmly believe that a further tranche of the state's shares in
Stet will be snapped up by both domestic and international investors.
Their confidence comes as some surprise when one considers the poor stock
market performance of the Italian banks and financial institutions which
have been privatised in the last year, and the difficulties which beset the
government.
But unlike the privatised banks, which although asset-rich are dismissed as
dinosaurs in the international world of finance, Stet's strong earnings
potential and its cheapness relative to its international peers makes it a
firm favourite with international investors.
In view of Stet's appeal and the numerous hurdles which still need to be
cleared, bankers believe that Iri should not put itself under pressure to
meet an autumn deadline for the disposal of shares in its most valuable
asset.
'If they rush it, they will end up compromising on price and on size,' says
one banker.
The preferred route would be first to monitor the stock market performance
of Telecom Italia, the new company formed from the merger of Sip, the quoted
domestic network operator, with four other state-controlled telecoms units.
Shares in Telecom Italia, in which Stet will have a holding of around 61 per
cent, are due to begin trading on the Milan exchange on August 18.
Second, bankers are hoping that Mr Tedeschi, who returns to Iri after 14
months as managing director of Stet, will press ahead with the planned
demerger of the cellular business from Telecom Italia.
Although it could take up to three months to achieve, a separate stock
market quotation for the cellular business would allow analysts to value
Stet more accurately and enable Iri to get the best price for its shares.
Iri has not revealed how much of its stake in Stet it plans to sell, and
analysts believe that it wants to retain a significant shareholding. A
possible first step would be the reduction of its holding of ordinary shares
from 61.3 per cent to 40 per cent.
At Friday's share price of L5,320, such an offering would raise L4,300bn
(Dollars 2.8bn), an amount which one analyst describes as 'big, but
do-able'.
Some political concessions are also thought to be necessary before Iri can
launch the Stet sale.
Analysts place the greatest priority on the creation of a clear regulatory
environment for the telecoms industry and the elimination of political
influence in the setting of tariffs.
They are also keen for the government to refresh the privatisation plan
which it has inherited from the Amato and Ciampi administrations. On a more
mundane note, pro-forma accounts from Telecom Italia would also be welcomed.
Bearing in mind that anything is possible in Italy, the likelihood is that
the Stet sale will not happen until early next year.
Even though Mr Tedeschi is on the inside track, he could well be held back
by the conflicts within the government.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Cyclical shares likely to suffer most - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a summer rally on Wall Street now seems as remote as an
August snowstorm. On Friday, investors were confronted with the last big
hurdle standing in the way of a sustained upturn, and the obstacle proved
insurmountable.
The pundits were again tripped up by economic fundamentals, as the July
increase of 259,000 in non-farm payrolls was well above the consensus
forecast of 200,000.
The immediate result was an 18-point downturn in the bellwether Dow Jones
Industrial index, following a 26-point decline the previous session, when
the market sensed bad news was on the way.
The data were unsettling because they provided convincing evidence that the
economy is still rolling along at an unmanageable pace, even though the
Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates four times since February. A fifth
move to tighter money now seems likely before the August 16 policy-making
session. It might come this week.
An unnamed official at the central bank, quoted by the Market News Service,
appeared to confirm the pessimistic view. Employers 'are running out of
people to hire', the source commented, alluding to incipient wage pressures.
With investors playing the waiting game once again, stocks are likely to
retrace the gains posted early last week, before sentiment turns full circle
for the second time in a fortnight.
The latest readings on consumer and producer price inflation, scheduled for
Thursday and Friday, could exacerbate the tension, especially if the bond
market pushes long-term yields to worrisome levels.
Cyclical stocks, especially those in the motor vehicle and heavy equipment
sectors, could suffer the most, with the prospect of tighter credit
conditions looming large. 'Share prices in those groups tend to anticipate
events,' points out Mr James Solloway, an investment strategist at Argus
Research in New York. 'They tend to correlate very closely with trends in
interest rates.'
The Big Three carmakers were under pressure even before the release of the
employment data, as investors reacted to news of weak July sales of US-made
motor vehicles.
But raw material suppliers should continue to benefit from a bubbling
economy. Last week, paper and steel companies outperformed the market on
news that manufacturers were willing to pay higher prices for the products.
There are a few more rays of sunshine which suggest a mild reaction to any
rate increase. Last week saw a resurgence in takeover activity in the
pharmaceuticals, media, technology and insurance sectors. Corporate
insiders, meanwhile, continue to snap up shares in companies they manage.

STOCKHOLM
The market has been in upbeat mood in recent days in anticipation of the
first-half reporting season which begins this week.
Figures will come from Esab, the world's leading producer of welding
equipment, and SKF, the roller bearings manufacturer, which in June sharply
upgraded its 1994 profit forecast, citing stronger than expected growth in
volumes in its main European markets. Many investors believe that the
figures will beat analysts' forecasts.
UBS says that the rule of thumb tends to be that profits will need to be 10
per cent above expectations to prevent profit-taking.
It believes that the first-half figures will provide pleasant surprises,
particularly in the forest sector and the motor stocks.
On Wednesday, Volvo aims to improve the marketability of its shares with a
five-for-one share split.
In Denmark, Novo Nordisk, the health care and industrial enzymes group,
presents six-month figures on Wednesday.
Estimates for the half-year pre-tax profit range from DKr700m to DKr980m,
with the outcome affected by a DKr80m provision taken against operating
expenses to cover restructuring of US companies.
FRANKFURT
After the strong economic data released last week, the only significant news
this week will be on retail sales, which demonstrated moderate growth in May
 -a trend that is expected to have continued in June.
Dresdner Bank will close the banks' reporting season on Wednesday. Analysts
forecast a rise in interim operating profit to around DM1bn.
On Thursday, Veba releases figures for the first six months. In the first
quarter, the diversified energy and chemicals company's earnings rose 34.8
per cent.
In 1993, net profit fell to DM1.01bn from DM1.04bn.
AMSTERDAM
A heavy week of corporate results is due, starting with Polygram tomorrow
and ending with Fokker and Unilever on Friday, writes John Pitt.
Brokers expect most of the results to confirm the picture of a general
recovery in the European economy, illustrated by the results from chemical
groups Akzo Nobel and DSM last week.
Only Fokker, which came under the control of Daimler-Benz of Germany last
year, is likely to disappoint, says James Capel, which rates the stock as a
sell.
The aircraft manufacturer's share price has fallen 25 per cent since
January, with investors selling heavily in March after the group announced a
net loss for 1993 of Fl 460m, more than three times analysts' expectations.
By contrast, Philips' second-quarter results, due on Thursday, are widely
expected to confirm the group's continuing turnround following an aggressive
round of cost-cutting, lower interest rates and a general improvement in
consumer spending.
A similar story is expected from its Polygram subsidiary, which is due to
publish its first-half figures tomorrow.
Among other results, Unilever, due on Wednesday, will be watched closely to
see if the recent 'detergent war' with Procter &amp; Gamble has had any effect
on margins.
Hoare Govett believes any effect will be insignificant, and is looking for a
net profit of Fl 1,055m or Fl 3.75 a share, compared with Fl 3.81 a share in
the same 1993 period - the reduction due mainly to the launch of the new
detergent brand in Europe.
HONG KONG
The market has Friday's US employment statistics to digest today, while on
the corporate side Cathay Pacific announces interim results on Wednesday,
ahead of parent company Swire Pacific, writes Louise Lucas.
Property sales will continue to be closely monitored. Sales of apartments
were oversubscribed last week, but at far more modest levels than those
attained earlier in the year.
Brokers reckon that property prices are starting to bottom out and
confidence is beginning to trickle back into the market.
The H share index, designed to track China enterprises listed in Hong Kong,
is due to be launched today. However, constituent stocks have already
enjoyed a healthy rally in anticipation, and are not expected to make big
gains this week.
The market overall is in a state of consolidation.
TOKYO
Last week's announcement of Japan Telecom's listing next month may spur some
activity in telecommunications-related shares, writes Emiko Terazono.
However, overall trading is expected to be light ahead of the Obon holidays,
and the Nikkei index is likely to fluctuate around the 20,500 level. Brokers
also point out that the start of the annual high-school baseball tournament
always signals a downturn in volumes. 'Investors will be glued to their
television sets and will have little incentive to trade,' said a UK broker.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Differing views emerge on base rates -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as if the stock market, the Bank of England and the investment
press are working on different time-scales where base rate prospects are
concerned. The Bank's Quarterly Bulletin went down very well in a market
still dismayed by the sudden, and still largely unexplained, rise in
Treasury bill rates which preceded it. That same report, say the more unkind
of the City analysts, was greeted by 'almost hysterical press commentary',
suggesting the Bank was considering an immediate rate rise.
It is, of course, all a question of timing. Any illusions that base rates
can stay at present levels for long, let alone be trimmed just once more,
had long since melted away from equity strategists' reports. National
Westminster Bank says bluntly that base rates will be raised to 5.75 per
cent 'within the next six to eight weeks and peak at 6.75 per cent in the
middle of next year'. Strauss Turnbull also sees rates at 5.75 per cent very
shortly.
Having answered its first question - 'Where are base rates heading?' - the
market is ready with answers for the second - 'What will higher rates do to
equities?'
The widely-held view is that the UK stock market has successfully moved from
being interest-rate driven to becoming driven by the economic recovery, in
the form of higher earnings and dividends, actual and prospective.
Reported earnings for non-financial stocks are now running at 8 per cent
above last year and analysts are becoming more lavish with upgraded earnings
forecasts for UK companies. Real dividend growth of around 6.3 per cent next
year is also widely anticipated.
There is an even more optimistic view on base rate trends. Chartists claim,
and can produce graphs to prove it, that rising base rates have not in the
past spelt doom for share prices. The graphs indicate that equities have
risen sharply over the 18 months which followed the last three troughs in
interest rates - and an interest rate trough seems to be where we now are.
This may mean there is nothing like higher profits and dividends for driving
markets. Interest rates can rise quite a long way before shares react.
If this is so, then the sudden rash of speculative fever, now spreading from
food stocks to the drugs sector, indicates that a bullish mood is taking
hold. After all, what is a half-point rise in base rates compared with a
multinational takeover battle for a pharmaceutical giant?
The contest for William Low, while disappointing in market terms -
especially for the US house which bought Low shares in the hour between the
announcements of Tesco's knock-out bid and Sainsbury's withdrawal - has
whetted speculators' appetites.

After last week's disturbingly strong July employment report, traders and
investors will today be wary of more bad news that might spark another
interest rate increase. In particular, nerves will be on edge as the market
awaits the July inflation data, due on Thursday and Friday.
The unexpectedly large jump in non-farm payrolls last month prompted
economists to warn that the economy was probably growing faster than
expected.
Confirmation of that view could come this week when July producer and
consumer inflation numbers are published.
At the moment, Wall Street is expecting a 0.3 per cent rise in the Producer
Prices Index on Thursday and a similar increase in the Consumer Prices Index
the next day, but those estimates may be revised upwards in light of the
strong July jobs report.
If the inflation figures come in above expectations, another sell-off in the
Treasury market is likely to follow as investors bet that the Federal
Reserve's policy-making open market committee will sanction an interest rate
rise at its next meeting, on August 16 and 17.
This week will be especially testing as it includes three big Treasury
auctions: Dollars 17.25bn of three-year notes will be sold tomorrow,
followed by Dollars 12bn of 10-year notes the next day, and Dollars 11bn of
30-year bonds on Thursday.

FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Poland set to enter virtuous circle -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For bond investors willing to bank on Poland's economic fundamentals, the
future looks bright. Successive governments' commitment to market-oriented
reforms and stringent fiscal and monetary policy have made Poland's the
fastest-growing economy in Europe.
Real gross domestic product is expected to rise by around 22 per cent in the
next three years and inflation is forecast to decline into single-digit
territory by 1997, from around 30 per cent this year.
Last, the imminent completion of its Brady debt restructuring deal is
expected to give an added boost to international investment flows into
Poland, which have already risen sharply in recent years.
All this augurs well for Poland's planned comeback to the eurobond market,
which is expected to receive a warm welcome not only from emerging-market
investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, but also from investors
betting on Poland's economic convergence with western Europe and eventual
membership of the European Union.
Before it taps the eurobond sector, however, Poland has to complete the
commercial bank debt restructuring with its London Club creditors. In June,
it entered the final stage of the Brady process, with the cessation of
direct trading of its commercial bank loans and the start of 'when, as, and
if-issued' bond trading. Through when-issued trades, investors contract to
buy or sell bonds on their issuance date.
After Poland's bank creditors sign the final agreement in mid-September,
several types of Brady bonds will be issued: par bonds (where the loans are
exchanged at par value with no debt forgiveness, in return for sub-market
interest rates); discount bonds (where creditors forgive 45 per cent of the
principal of the debt in return for attractive floating-rate interest
rates); or interest-arrears bonds, where unpaid interest payments have been
restructured into a bond. Moreover, the Polish government wants to buy back
at least 20 per cent of its debt.
Depending on how much debt the government buys back and how many discount
bonds are issued, the total amount of Brady bonds issued could amount to
some Dollars 7bn to Dollars 8bn, substantially less that the original
Dollars 13bn of total debt, estimates Mr Alexander Mitcheson-Smith, head of
emerging markets research at UBS. 'The Poles got a very generous treatment
from their creditors,' he says. 'Following the completion of the deal,
Poland will have one of the best debt ratios of all post-Brady countries,'
he adds.
The Brady completion could well start a virtuous circle, triggering
increased international inflows, especially from its largest natural trading
and investment partner, Germany.
'Prospects for a hike in German direct investment in Poland may improve
significantly following the Brady deal, given the strong links between the
German commercial banking sector and German corporates,' predict analysts at
J. P. Morgan. Should such inflows materialise, 'Poland's medium-term
prospects can be expected to improve with accompanying infusion of
technology, managerial expertise, market access, and more rapid
restructuring of the industrial sector.'
Booming foreign investment, declining foreign debt exposure, strong economic
fundamentals and continued fiscal and monetary discipline should boost
Poland's chances for a strong credit rating, which is said to be in the
works.
'Poland's external position looks much stronger than Hungary's; its current
account and fiscal deficits are well below those of Hungary; its growth rate
is stronger than that of either of its central European neighbours, and
foreign investment already seems to be responding positively to the debt
agreement,' says Mr Jonathan Hoffman, a director of economics at CS First
Boston. 'In our view, Polish fundamentals merit a Ba1/BB+ rating,' - the
same as Hungary.
The successful signing of the London Club agreement and a credit rating are
likely to be prerequisites for the Polish Republic's much talked-about
return to the eurobond market - its first deal since 1979. International
investment banks are currently now jostling for the number-one position in
the 'beauty contest' for lead management of the deal, with some 16 proposals
due to be submitted by early September.
'A decision may be made by November, but the deal probably won't come until
early next year,' says a Warsaw banker.
Talk in the London syndicate community is for about Dollars 200m of three-
to five-year bonds. They are likely to be priced off the Brady bonds, which
are widely seen as being undervalued and are expected to rally in coming
months. That, in turn, could reduce the cost of the eurobond.
As Polish debt becomes more liquid and accessible, analysts expect investor
demand to increase exponentially.
'The Brady deal will attract investors who aren't able to buy when-issued
Bradys, and the eurobond will attract investors who can't buy Brady bonds,'
predicts Mr Hoffman. 'The universe of investors in Polish debt is widening
almost by the week.'

The most important event for gilts this week is likely to come this morning,
with the publication of producer prices figures. The Bank of England last
week cited as one of its new inflationary risks 'that commodity prices will
continue to rise rapidly, pushing up producer output prices'.
Mr Peter Fellner of NatWest Markets says: 'The market is reconciled to
seeing input prices continue to rise. What I think would come as an
unpleasant surprise is if there were a pick-up on the output side.'
Mr Sanjay Joshi of Daiwa Europe thinks a 0.2 or 0.3 per cent month-on-month
increase would be taken as a good sign, while Mr James Barty of Morgan
Grenfell says 0.4 per cent or above would be taken very bearishly.
Wednesday sees the publication of minutes of the July 6 meeting between the
Bank governor and the chancellor. Analysts expect them to confirm the duo's
neutral stance on interest rates.
For the rest of the week, the focus is likely to be on the international
market, with investors watching to see if the US Treasury market can recover
from Friday's losses.
'There has been evidence that the international economy is more robust than
thought,' says Mr Fellner, 'as shown in figures from Germany and the US, and
that is not a positive environment for bonds.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt

<TEXT>
Few Frankfurt observers doubt that the Bundesbank still has room to resume
easing the discount rate, but many are beginning to question whether action
will come before the federal elections in October.
As encouraging economic indicators accumulate - filling order books and
falling unemployment came last week - the less reason the German central
bank has to think of cuts in the near future, at least as an aid to
recovery.
Latest retail sales figures, due this week, are expected to embellish the
(for the bank) heartening recent pattern. Preliminary indications, including
a poor summer sales season, are that private consumption is still slowing.
In the coming weeks most attention inside and outside the Bundesbank will
focus on money supply data. Further welcome deceleration is expected as the
year progresses.
Whether and when the bank accepts the trend as established and as a reason
to reduce the discount rate might well depend on political judgment as much
as monetary know-how.
On balance, the view is that its president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, would prefer
not to lay himself open to accusations of offering pre-election help to his
friend Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the coalition led by his Christian
Democrat party, although recent polls suggest he is doing quite well
unaided.

FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Buyers take another look at Canada -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Canadian bond market, which has suffered the twin handicaps of an
adverse international interest rate environment and domestic political
uncertainty, showed signs of perking up last week.
The government's CDollars 1.9bn 10-year bond auction met strong buying from
domestic and US investors, causing the spread between 10-year Canadian and
US bonds to tighten from 208 basis points at the start of the week to 185
basis points on Friday.
Investors, who had been staying away from the market, were encouraged by
expectations of such a tightening ahead of this week's 10-year US Treasury
auction. But there are other reasons why investors are looking again at the
Canadian market.
With 10-year yields still above 9 per cent and flat inflation, real yields
are among the highest available - although in the longer term the Canadian
inflation rate is not expected to remain flat, but to rise to between 3 and
4 per cent.
For foreign investors, the weakness of the Canadian dollar is also
attractive. It has helped encourage substantial flows from retail investors
in Belgium, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, Germany, into the Canadian
dollar eurobond market, where new issues totalling more than CDollars 750m
were launched last week.
There is a heavy schedule of redemptions in the sector, totalling CDollars
1.8bn in August, most of which is being reinvested in the market, as
investors do not want to realise losses incurred on the currency. Dealers
also report some nibbling by institutional investors, as well as fresh
investment by retail buyers.
However, European institutions have not yet been tempted back into the
market in force, either because they are still overweight in Canadian bonds
or because they remain cautious about volatility as a result of political
uncertainty.
The greatest danger for the market is an explosion of volatility ahead of
the September 12 election in Quebec. Concern about the election has abated
somewhat since the date was set; at the long end of the market, Quebec bonds
have tightened from about 115 basis points two months ago to 95 basis points
over Canadian government bond yields.
But the election remains the overriding influence on the market, as the
Parti Quebecois, which is in the lead according to opinion polls, has a
platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada.
According to Swiss Bank Corporation, 'even the most cursory look at how the
Canadian bond market has behaved in the past shows that concern over Quebec
separatism and associated issue of Canada's political unity is one of the
most important factors in the market's behaviour'. However, the market has
priced in the election fears earlier than usual this time round and may not
react as violently as it has on past occasions, according to some analysts.
Signs that the governing Liberals are narrowing the gap have helped reassure
the markets. In addition, it is widely thought a a PQ victory would
represent a vote for a change of government, rather than for separation, and
would likely be followed by a referendum vote to remain in Canada.
'Even if the PQ wins, the standard pattern is that the market will pick up
once the uncertainty (of the election) is out of way. We don't think
separation will occur because the costs involved are so severe,' said Mr
Simon Maggs, a bond analyst at UBS.
While there could be volatility at the time of the election, analysts are
positive about the market's longer-term prospects.
'We are cautiously bullish, but only the brave ones will go in before the
election,' said Mr Kevin Logan, chief North American economist at SBC in New
York.
There is still some downside: while a PQ election victory is priced into the
market, a landslide could be viewed by the party as a mandate for separation
without a referendum, which is likely to cause a further sharp sell-off.
However, Mr David Adamo, senior vice-president of fixed-income research at
ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, points to strong fundamentals, including low
inflation and a pick-up in the economy allowing the provinces to meet their
deficit targets. 'Going into next year, once the uncertainty of Quebec is
out of the way, the spread between Canada and the US may get back to 100
basis points,' said Mr Adamo.
The yield curve between two and 30 years, which has been hovering around 100
basis points, is beginning to steepen further, as the Bank of Canada appears
to want to keep short-term rates as low as possible. With three-month bills
currently down to 5.45 per cent, while two-year bonds are yielding just
under 8 per cent, short-dated bonds are currently attractive, according to
Mr Adamo.

The weakening of the yen and increasing prospects of an imminent economic
recovery prompted profit-taking ahead of the September book closing last
week, and the yield on the No 164 10-year benchmark bond closed at a
14-month high of 4.63 per cent.
Interest rates have started to discount a widening belief that economic
recovery is under way. The long-term prime rate, the rate at which banks
lend to first-tier clients, is expected to be raised by 20 to 30 basis
points this week, while the recent rise in short-term interest rates may
also cause banks to raise the short-term prime rate.
Banks covering for the rise in funding demand from companies ahead of the
September six-month book closing has pushed up three-month certificate of
deposit rates. Some traders expect the central bank to prevent short-term
rates from rising further by supplying funds to the money markets.
Meanwhile, the emergence of brighter prospects for the economy has kept
investors on the sidelines. Last month inter-dealer trading volume plunged
36.2 per cent from a month earlier as the likelihood of a discount rate cut
diminished. Such low volumes may exacerbate price fluctuations this week,
since the US Treasury auction could prompt a shift in funds from the
Japanese bond market by overseas investors.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Assessing prospects for China's B-shares -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most attention focused last week on the astonishing surge in China's
A-share markets for local investors, international fund managers and market
analysts were quietly re-assessing prospects for B-shares for foreign
investors.
Securities' analysts expect that the B-share markets in Shanghai and Shenzen
will continue to make their own pace and to firm for the rest of the year
irrespective of what happens with A-shares. Shanghai's B-share index closed
the week up just 4.6 per cent, compared with the extraordinary 104.55 per
cent leap in A-shares following Beijing's declaration that new listings
would be frozen this year.
Mr Richard Graham of Baring Securities in Shanghai predicts that the B-share
index will climb back by the end of the year to around 100 points, where it
began 1994. It slid by some 40 points by the second quarter, before
rebounding by 15 per cent since June. It ended last week at 74.40, up from
71.13 at the beginning of the week.
'It now looks much more positive,' said Mr Graham. 'I think the market will
go back to 100 by the end of the year.'
He noted that B shares were now trading at multiples of about ten times 1994
earnings, which made them 'inexpensive by any standards in an emerging
market.'
Securities analysts said a number of Shanghai manufacturing companies
represented 'good value', but fortunes of the tiny Shanghai B-share market -
just 24 stocks are listed and turnover is small - depended to an extent on
sentiment in Hong Kong towards so-called H-shares. These are Hong
Kong-listed mainland companies.
A strengthening of H-shares in the past month had helped to revive interest
in the Shanghai and Shenzen B-share markets. Other factors in the improving
picture for B-shares included a decree issued by China's State Council, or
cabinet, clearing the way for mainland Chinese living abroad and other
categories of persons deemed appropriate to purchase B-shares.
This 'deliciously vague' decree, as one Shanghai-based analyst described it,
opened the way for mainland Chinese holding dollars to buy B-shares, either
through relatives or friends overseas, or possibly directly through local
securities houses.
With an estimated Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.67bn) on deposit in banks in
Shanghai alone and with dollar deposit rates very low there would seem to be
ample scope for local investment in the B-share market.
A proposal by the China Securities Regulatory Commission that would enable
foreign investors to buy A-shares through Sino-foreign joint venture
securities companies is regarded as a positive development and one that
would help to bring closer the prospect of unified A and B share markets.
But representatives of international securities companies say this proposal
is fraught with difficulties in the absence of an investment management law
now in the draft stage. Foreigners could not be expected to invest in
A-shares unless the conversion of funds out of the yuan could be guaranteed.
Repatriation of funds abroad would also have to be protected.
Removal, however, of the artificial distinction between the A and B share
markets will have to await full currency convertibility. Chinese officials
are vague about the possible timing of convertibility, beyond saying that it
may happen 'within five years.'
Among other positive developments for Shanghai B-shares was the recent
clearance given by the ultra-cautious Japanese share dealer's association
for investments in the Shanghai market. While this has not, as far as can be
ascertained, been transformed into anything more than a dribble of buying
orders, reports that the Japanese are on the way may have helped stabilise
the market.
Indications that Japanese securities houses may be turning their attention
to 'China plays' have been accompanied by reports that a Japanese Dollars
1bn fund is being put together that would go 80 per cent to H-shares and 20
per cent to B-shares.
But, like other skittish foreign investors, Japanese securities houses will
approach investing in China's fledgling markets warily. It is most unlikely
that last week's wild trading in A-shares will be repeated in the B-share
market. Ten best performing stocks

FT  08 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Mexico stock market surges
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's stock market has surged by 14.9 per cent over the past two weeks,
with investors increasingly confident that the ruling party will win a
comfortable and transparent victory in the August 21 presidential election,
writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The main index has climbed from 2301 on July 22 to 2643 at Friday's close.
The market has recovered all of its peso losses of the year, although is
still slightly down in dollar terms. It is now trading at about 12.8 times
1995 projected earnings, according to Baring Securities.
Investors have been reassured by a stream of national opinion polls that
show the Institutional Revolutionary Party at least 15 percentage points
ahead of the centre-right opposition.
Mr Vicente Licona, who runs the reputable polling agency Indemec/Louis
Harris reckons the PRI will obtain between 52 per cent and 45 per cent in
the vote on election day, against 37 per cent to 28 per cent for the
opposition National Action Party.
The expectation that the governing party will win the election has led to a
sharp fall in interest rates in recent weeks, which should stimulate
economic growth. Last Wednesday 28-day interest rates fell to 15.8 per cent,
against 17.66 per cent on July 20. Over the same period the peso has
strengthened against the dollar and is below the trading limit.
Second-quarter results turned out to be better than generally expected,
giving the market a further fillip. Baring Securities calculates that
operating profits of the 42 companies it tracks grew by an average of 16 per
cent in the second quarter against 12 per cent in the first. Real sales were
up by 8 per cent in the second quarter against 6 per cent in the first
quarter.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange traders will this week continue their dollar vigil,
scouring US economic data for hints of when the US Federal Reserve will next
raise interest rates.
The employment report last Friday revealed jobs growth above market
expectations and lent support to those expecting an early tightening. The
focus now switches to the retail sales figures due for release on Friday.
Opinion is fairly split as to whether or not the Fed will choose to move
rates at the next FOMC meeting on August 16. It is also split as to what the
quantum of such a move might be, and what sort of impact this would have on
the dollar.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, argues that
at least three factors need to be satisfied for a dollar turnround to occur.
First, US short rates must be 50 - 100 basis points higher, as the Dollars
/Y rate has never recovered without at least a 300 basis point spread
between US-Japanese three month LIBOR rates. The current gap is about 2.5
percentage points. US short rates must also move above German rates to
reduce the incentive for Europeans to hedge their currency exposure in US
assets.
Second, the bear market in US bonds needs to reverse. 'The dollar and bond
market decline are part of the same dynamic of establishing an acceptable
foreign currency price level for US assets', says Mr Persaud. 'When
foreigners view US assets as cheap, both bonds and the dollar will rally in
tandem.'
Finally, the Japanese current account surplus has to narrow considerably.
The Dollars /Y rate historically lags turning points in the Japanese current
account surplus by several quarters. The recent change in US administration
rhetoric towards the dollar has convinced some observers that the dollar has
turned. Many analysts, however, believe the dollar still has further to
fall.
In the UK, markets are also much occupied by the prospect of higher rates
which should help sterling. Although there is little expectation of policy
being tightened before the next monthly monetary meeting on September 7,
economic data ahead of the meeting will be closely watched, starting with
today's producer price inflation figures.
The release on Wednesday of the July 6 monthly monetary meeting minutes will
shed some light on where policy has been recently. In the short term,
however, the fortunes of the dollar are likely to be the key determining
factor in the outlook for sterling.

<TEXT>
Bangkok
Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission has agreed in principle to
allow Thai securities companies to open offices abroad, the SEC announced in
Bangkok, writes Victor Mallet.
Among the first candidates are likely to be Securities One, the independent
broker which has said it wants a regional presence, and Phatra Thanakit,
which has dominated the Thai underwriting market.
Bombay
The Securities and Exchange Board of India has announced the rules on the
preferential allotment of shares and warrants convertible into shares,
Reuter reports.
The SEBI's announcement is a response to the severe criticism it faced after
permitting some 30 leading multinationals to raise stakes in their Indian
units by allotting themselves shares at steep discounts. The prefer-ential
allotment method was also used by promoters of more than a dozen Indian
companies to acquire shares cheaply.
According to SEBI's rules, promoters have an option of pricing the allotment
on the basis of the average share price in the past six months or the past
two weeks.
Budapest
Turnover on the stock exchange rose to Ft18.01bn in July, a rise of more
than 60 per cent from June.
Share turnover rose to Ft2.8bn from Ft2.2bn in June, while bond turnover
more than doubled to Ft7.8bn from Ft3.6bn a month before.
The number of securities introduced to the bourse rose to 104 in July, from
93 in June.
Moscow
Russia is to hold an auction for Rbs600bn worth of six-month Treasury bills
on August 9, officials at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange have said,
Reuter reports.
Investors still consider T-bills an attractive instrument, but interest in
the paper started fading as T-bill yields fell in line with lower interbank
credit rates and a decline in monthly inflation.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Economics Notebook: Payments and settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Payment and settlement systems are to economic activity what roads are to
traffic: necessary but typically taken for granted unless they cause an
accident or bottlenecks develop.'
So far, the world's payments and settlements systems have not caused any
serious problems. But as the foregoing comment from the annual report of the
Bank for International Settlements indicates, they have been climbing up the
agenda of policy makers in central banks, banks and securities houses, over
the past decade.
The reason is fear that a breakdown in what has always been regarded as the
unglamorous end of finance could trigger a massive crisis that would
destabilise the world economy.
Deregulation and globalisation have led to a spectacular growth in the value
of financial transactions both inside countries and across borders. Since
every transaction gives rise to obligations that need to be settled through
a transfer of money between the parties involved, there has been a
commensurate increase in pressure on payment and settlement systems.
The figures associated with payments and settlements are mind boggling. The
accompanying chart shows how the level of transactions in a year dwarfs
economic output in the main industrial countries. In Japan, for example, the
value of transfers of funds jumped from 20 times national output in 1980 to
120 times in 1990.
On a busy day, the transactions handled by the UK's largest electronic
payments and settlement clearing system (known as CHAPS for clearing house
automated payment system) can amount to a quarter of the UK's annual gross
domestic product.
According to the BIS, it takes less than three business days for Japan's
interbank funds transfer systems to generate turnover equivalent to the
country's annual economic output. It takes just over three days in the US
and about four days in Germany.
The increase in the demand for payments and settlements services partly
reflects an expansion of domestic money market transactions in many
countries; partly the ballooning of foreign exchange market turnover, in
line with globalisation, and partly the rapid growth and
internationalisation of turnover in securities markets. The scale of
liquidity and credit risks involved in the settlement process has increased
accordingly.
The risks have become especially concentrated in the world's banks. Not only
have transactions grown in size, but the big companies that channel their
payments through banks have come to expect that the funds be made available
immediately to the recipients. Because of their payments role, banks have
been providing ever greater overdrafts to customers in the course of a day's
business.
Big UK clearing banks have at times found the equivalent of their entire
capital committed in temporary overdrafts by mid-morning. This need not
matter if business flows normally. But in event of a failure the authorities
could be confronted with a chain reaction that could jeopardise the world
financial system.
This 'systemic risk' explains why policy makers have become increasingly
preoccupied with payments and settlements. Central banks of the Group of 10
countries have a committee on payment and settlement systems that meets
regularly at the BIS in Basle. European Union central banks have a 'working
group on EC payment systems' which is focusing on large-value interbank
payments because these entail the biggest potential risks.
In its report, the BIS observed that 'large and unpredictable exposures,
together with limited information about their true size and distribution,
make up the mixture which could spread and intensify financial shocks'. It
painted a grim picture of possible financial meltdown with 'distress sales
of assets, leading to general price declines and undermining the solvency of
institutions.'
There have already been scares in the world financial system, notably during
the stock market crash of 1987.
Big problems first surfaced in 1974 with the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt, a
small German bank with a large scale foreign exchange business. Its closure
took place after settlement of the D-Mark leg of foreign exchange
transactions but before settlement of the dollar leg. Some of Herstatt's
trading partners, faced with non-payment, refused to make payments on their
own account or for customers. The result was a chain reaction, which sharply
reduced transfers between banks.
Simulations carried out on the CHIPS system, one of two US large value
interbank transfer systems, have suggested that an unexpected settlement
failure by a big participant could result in nearly half of all institutions
being unable to settle transactions, with perhaps a third of the value of
transactions left in limbo. The BIS has described 'a worst-case scenario' in
which 'a vicious circle of induced defaults on settlement obligations,
falling prices and insolvencies could ensue.'
The good news is that work is well in hand to reduce settlement risks. Plans
include the early introduction of 'real time gross settlement systems' which
would eliminate the granting of involuntary credits through lags in
payments, and 'delivery versus payments' arrangements to achieve the same
objective in securities trading.
But the fact that 'Herstatt risk' still exists 20 years after the eponymous
bank failure shows how difficult progress can be.

FT  08 AUG 94 / The Markets: US to assess coffee damage - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mists of uncertainty engulfing the world coffee market following the
Brazilian frosts in June and July may have cleared a little more by the end
of this week.
On Friday the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will release the results
of the survey of the damage caused by the frosts to coffee trees and to the
flowers that will develop into beans for the 1995-96 crop.
The market has retreated from the 8 1/2 -year highs of more than Dollars
4,000 a tonne reached after the second frost. But, following the publication
late last month of a Brazilian government assessment putting the damage at
about 11m bags (60kg each), 40 per cent of the previously-expected crop,
prices have consolidated in the mid-Dollars 3,000s - still 60 per cent up
from the level ruling immediately before the first frost. The USDA report
should give a better idea of whether that rise is justified.
The aluminium market has also been trying to consolidate after a substantial
advance in prices following the implementation of a multilateral agreement
to cut production by between 1.5m and 2m tonnes over two years.
The results of that agreement have been apparent in a recent sustained
reversal of the earlier, seemingly inexorable rise in London Metal Exchange
warehouse stocks of the metal to the highest level ever. But a broader
indication will be available on Wednesday when the International Primary
Aluminium Institute issues June stocks data covering reserves (including
those held by producers) in all of its member countries.
A sign of discord within the group that agreed to cut aluminium output
appeared last week when Mr Karl Wobbe, a director of German producer
Vereinigte Aluminium-Werke (VAW) called for Canadian and Norwegian producers
to step up efforts to implement promised cuts.
'The cuts are not going at the speed and the size as announced,' he said.
However: 'I am confident this will happen in the next few months.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / The Markets: Seeking synergies with the networks - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ted Turner, the boss of Cable News Network, never lets the world forget that
he could be a contender. Last week, attending the Goodwill Games in St
Petersburg, he stirred the bid fever surrounding CBS, the US television
network, by declaring that he might try to buy it. Or, indeed, he added, one
of its two rivals, ABC and NBC.
It is curious that, if seriously interested, he would talk up the value of
his target. But Mr Turner is given to startling pronouncements about the
future of the media business. Five years ago he shocked a conference of
European television grandees by prophesying that Britain's two satellite
operators, Sky and BSB, could not survive with rival, incompatible systems
of customer equipment. Then, he proved prescient: the two merged shortly
afterwards. But now? Put bluntly, why would anyone want a US television
network?
Easy, say many analysts. 'It's a wonderful business,' according to Mr David
Londoner, media guru at Wertheim Schroder in New York. He estimates that CBS
churns out some Dollars 350m of free cash a year; indeed, to consume its
much criticised cash pile, the network has turned to buying back its shares.
If network revenues are above expectations - and analysts predict that
advertising is now picking up with the resumption of economic growth - most
of that bonanza drops to the bottom line.
Bid speculation has also been stirred by imminent regulatory change. Under
the 1971 'financial interest-syndication' regulations, networks have been
barred from producing much of their own material, apart from news, and from
participating in the lucrative 'syndication' markets - selling re-run
programming to local stations.
The lifting of the ban next November will allow a wider range of companies
to own networks and to achieve synergies previously inaccessible, Wall
Street analysts argue. Companies which might be tempted to acquire a network
include Walt Disney, Tele-Communications Inc and CNN, they say.
However, there are reasons to be sceptical of this pitch about the networks'
attractions. In many ways, the networks are the poor cousins of US
television, particularly compared to local stations.
Although in the ferocious, battle between the three networks for ratings,
each has held the top slot at some point in its life, none can claim a
secure hold on that position, in contrast to some local stations which
sustain a dominant share of their market for years.
That is one reason why network operating profit margins, even in a good
year, tended to hover around 10 per cent, compared with the 60 per cent
which some local stations achieve.
Another is that the industry's evolution has left the networks with an
unattractive share of its risk and rewards. Although the huge cost of new
programming is spread over the networks, local stations, cable, and the
production companies themselves, the networks pay the largest slice, and
bear the lion's share of the risk that it will fail. Mr Al Gottesman,
analyst at Paine Webber, argues that 'the industry is not structured to
maximise profits at the network level'.
Mr Gottesman, who has distilled from his long experience of the industry a
refreshing scepticism, believes that it is not just the fin-syn rules which
have made those rewards unachievable. The networks, he argues, have often
been employed by their owners 'for some grander purpose' besides the pursuit
of advertising.
NBC, in its earliest days as the National Broadcasting Corporation, 'was
designed to make people buy radio sets', he says. '(Local) stations in the
main have a history of being run just for financial results, although some
never quite got it together. But there are no networks which have been run
that way.'
Undoubtedly, there would be attractive cost savings from some of the
partnerships which have recently been mooted; Ted Turner, for example, has
estimated that he could save at least Dollars 50m a year by merging the news
operations of CBS and CNN. But the danger is that potential bidders are
putting too much weight on a new grand strategy: to use the networks as
captive distributors of programming.
That vertical integration could prove misconceived: the new entity may be
worth less than the sum of the parts. It would be astonishing if the
programming partner did not try to force programmes onto the network which
the network would not freely choose, at a cost to ratings and advertising.
The new group might also fail to make the most of the value of its
programming, if it no longer peddled it as aggressively to competing buyers.
Given those risks, the chance to enter production may be a quagmire from
which regulation has, to date, protected the networks.
Many argue that these pitfalls could be avoided with tough management, which
would keep a measure of independence between the two arms. But harvesting
all the possible synergies between two huge, complex organisations, while
incurring none of the disadvantages, is notoriously difficult. It is hard to
believe that management could forever triumph over such pressures.
The media mergers of the past decade have given plenty of reason to be
suspicious that, despite the rhetoric, such synergies frequently never
appear. You do not need to be cynical to conclude that media tycoons are
often poor at maximising returns to shareholders. Many, in retrospect,
appear more interested in size or newspaper headlines than in shareholder
profit; (you might, in fact, use that as the distinction between an ordinary
chairman and a tycoon).
Ted Turner may not be wrong in his reckoning that CBS will be taken over.
The question is whether it is really worth doing so, particularly for the
reasons suggested by some analysts - and tycoons.

FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Renault pushed to front of the
grid - France is clearing the way for an important privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>

Slowly, but surely, Renault is being pushed towards the front of the
privatisation starting grid. Friday's appointment of adviser banks to
counsel the French government, and the preliminary selection of six
advertising agencies, are the latest and clearest signs that France is
clearing the way for one of the most important operations of its
privatisation programme.
'The preparations are in place,' said one official. 'But we cannot say when
the starting flag will fall, nor how long the race will be.' A spokesman at
the economics ministry was also cautious, claiming no decisions have yet
been taken about the timing or scale of the operation.
In spite of such reticence, the government appears set for at least a
partial privatisation by the end of the year. The various scenarios for the
reduction of the state's 80 per cent stake in Renault are also narrowing.
The government has indicated that it will maintain at least a blocking
minority of the shares, citing a minimum holding of 34 per cent.
The operation is likely to involve a share offering to employees and the
general public, rather than simply a sale of shares to financial and
industrial partners, as suggested earlier this year. The French government
is also weighing a capital increase to coincide with privatisation.
The timing and scale of the operation will, however, be affected by
political considerations. Renault, one of the best-known symbols of public
sector industry, has been a stronghold for trade unions for much of the
post-war period.
The Communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail, although no longer
representing a majority on the company's workers' committee, repeated at the
weekend that it would oppose privatisation. With presidential elections due
next spring, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, will not want to risk
a damaging labour dispute.
Such considerations explain the government's step-by-step approach to the
sale of Renault. The timing of the latest announcements, on a Friday
afternoon in the middle of the holiday period, is also significant. The
common theme is that the government is treading cautiously, while leaving
its options open.
Pressures for the privatisation of Renault have grown steadily, however. In
particular, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has pushed for a rapid
and relatively extensive operation. 'The state should not be in the business
of building cars,' he says. Other members of Mr Balladur's centre-right
government argue that it is important to maintain the momentum of the
privatisation campaign to ease pressure on the budget deficit, targeted at
FFr300bn (Dollars 56bn) this year.
An element of urgency is also provided by the divorce agreement between
Renault and Volvo following the collapse of their merger plans last year.
Under the agreement, Volvo will reduce its stake in Renault from 20 per cent
to 12 per cent at the time of privatisation, if this occurs before December.
After that date, new negotiations would be opened between Renault, Volvo and
the French state.
The collapse of the Renault/Volvo merger has left the French group without a
big partner in a consolidating international industry. Specific projects
have been agreed on a case-by-case basis. Renault last month concluded an
agreement for the joint development of cabs with Iveco, the trucks division
of Fiat of Italy. The industry ministry is thought to favour a broader
alliance to bolster Renault's position, although it accepts the number of
possible candidates is limited.
As the Volvo experience demonstrated, moreover, strategic alliances could be
easier after privatisation. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman has made
no secret of his desire for privatisation. His case has been buttressed by
the group's strong financial performance and the improved image of its
products.
Since the mid-1980s, Mr Schweitzer, and his predecessor Mr Raymond Levy,
have transformed Renault from the sick man of the European car industry to
one of its leading performers. Profits have been recorded through the
recession in the motor vehicle industry, the worst since the second world
war. This year, Lehman Brothers, the securities company, is forecasting a
doubling in net profits to FFr2.2bn.
The resilience of Renault is partly the result of an improved model range.
'A succession of strong chief executives has implemented a turnover strategy
based on a significant upgrading of the model range, from below-average cars
to distinctive, more luxurious, better styled and built products. These
include niche products like the Espace and Twingo,' said Lehman.
Such considerations may strengthen Renault's case compared with other
privatisation candidates such as Assurances Generales de France, the
insurer, which is also on the starting grid for privatisation.
As with other French insurance companies, AGF shares have been hit heavily
this year and, although up from their lows, are still down for the year. As
a result, the government may wait until the issue would prove more
lucrative.
As for Renault, the proceeds depend on the ultimate scale of the operation.
The company as a whole is valued at more than FFr40bn, implying receipts for
the state of between FFr10bn and FFr18bn, in the case of the government's
retention of a majority stake or a blocking minority stake respectively.
The government says it has time to make up its mind between Renault and AGF.
'It is our strategy to have two companies in a state of preparation,' says
one official. Renault's bid, however, is picking up speed. It may well cross
the starting line first.

Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian soft drinks group, announced after-tax
profits for the six months to June up 22.4 per cent to ADollars 40.1m
(USDollars 30m).
The group is 51 per cent-owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and has interests
spanning Australasia, Indonesia and eastern Europe.
Sales were 11.6 per cent higher, at ADollars 1.04bn, while operating
profits, before interest and tax, were ADollars 89.7m, compared with
ADollars 75.2m in the same period of 1993.
CCA said the Australian market had been competitive, but sales had risen by
7 per cent and profits by 9 per cent. There was a strong performance from
New Zealand, while in Fiji, sales had grown solidly but profit had been
affected by additional marketing costs. A new bottling plant in Suva is due
to be completed later this year.
In eastern Europe, CCA reported satisfactory volume, sales and profits
growth in both Austria and Hungary in local currency terms, but foreign
currency movements had depressed returns in Australian dollar terms. Sales
and profits from the Czech Republic increased strongly.

pressure
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unitrin, the Chicago-based insurance company which has become the target of
a Dollars 2.6bn hostile takeover approach from its larger rival, American
General, said yesterday that a combination of the two companies was unlikely
to be permitted under current US anti-trust laws.
The company said that, together, the two insurers would account for 25 per
cent of the national home-service market, which involves selling life and
health insurance and other financial services to mainly lower-income
families in their homes.
In some states, the market share would exceed 40 per cent, it added.
'It is very hard to believe that federal anti-trust regulators or state
insurance commissioners would approve the transaction American General
proposes,' said Mr Richard Vie, president of Unitrin.
The company added that the cost and time it takes to build a network of
home-service agents 'severely limits' new entrants to the market.
Unitrin's statement yesterday was seen as part of an attempt to deflect any
pressure it may be under from shareholders to accept the bid approach.
American General announced its interest publicly last week, in an attempt to
win the support of Unitrin's shareholders for an acquisition.

FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Insurers form group to rescue
Confederation Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of Canadian life insurance companies has banded together to rescue
financially-troubled Confederation Life, the country's fifth largest
insurer.
Details of the bail-out have yet to be finalised, but it is expected to
involve about 10 companies which would inject CDollars 600m (USDollars 433m)
into Confederation in the form of preferred shares and senior debt.
Confederation had assets under management of CDollars 33bn at the end of
1993. Its operations, which include a successful UK banking and insurance
arm, are relatively healthy, but its balance sheet has been weakened by
heavy losses in the depressed North American real estate market.
Confederations's problems are symptomatic of a shake-out taking place in the
over-crowded Canadian insurance market. Two medium-sized companies have
collapsed in the past year and several mergers and takeovers have been
completed. Fierce competition has severely eroded underwriting margins.
The Confederation rescue follows almost a year of talks between the
Toronto-based company and Great-West Life Assurance, which is controlled by
Montreal-based Power Corporation. Great-West Life had proposed a CDollars
225m injection as well as a substantial reduction in Confederation's
operations, including the sale of its group life and health business, and
the disposal of part or all of its UK operations.
Mr Paul Cantor, Confederation's president, said that 'as the deal worked its
way through, (Great-West) reached the conclusion that that wasn't going to
be adequate.'
He said that Great-West has taken a 'very conservative view' of the outlook
for North American real estate, with a full recovery not expected for
another decade. Great-West has also insisted on significant reserve
provisions. Confederation suffered losses of CDollars 232m on its loan
portfolio in 1992 and 1993. Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 800m at
the end of last year.
Confederation's UK arm is one of the leading providers of pooled pension
products for medium-sized companies. Its team of 850 direct sales agents
markets a range of unit-linked individual insurance contracts, including
standard term and savings products.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors will be able to track the composite performance of H shares, the
Hong Kong-listed China companies, from today with the launch of the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index.
The new index, like the long-standing Hang Seng Index, is compiled by HSI
Services, the financial information provider and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Hang Seng Bank, the colony's biggest domestic bank.
It comprises all the H shares, of which there are now 10, weighted according
to their market capitalisation. The number of H-share companies is expected
to double by the end of next year.
Mr Alexander Au, managing director and chief executive of Hang Seng Bank,
said the creation of a more focused indicator of the overall performance of
H shares was prompted by the growing international interest in these
companies.
The index was set at 1,000 on July 8, when the 10th H-share company, Luoyang
Glass, was listed. The biggest mover on the index is Maanshan Iron and
Steel, with a 30 per cent weighting, followed by Shanghai Petrochemical and
Yizheng Chemical Fibre.
HSI Services directors meet later this month to tackle a thornier issue: the
replacements for Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic, both of which
delist at the end of the year.
Companies including Henderson Investment, the property investment company
controlled by Mr Lee Shau-kee, Guoco Group the banking and property company,
and First Pacific, whose interests span banking, property and
telecommunications, are already jockeying for position.
Being in the index is seen as both a prestigious move and one which can
benefit the share price.

FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac Minerals names new chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lac Minerals, the Canadian gold and base-metals producer which is the target
of two unwelcome takeover bids, has named a new chief executive as part of
efforts to retain its independence.
Mr Peter Steen, formerly president of San Francisco-based Homestake Mining,
one of North America's biggest gold producers, replaces Mr Peter Allen, who
was unseated last month by a revolt among Lac shareholders. Mr James
Pitblado, retired head of Canada's biggest securities firm, remains chairman
of Lac.
Lac has received takeover offers from American Barrick of Toronto and Royal
Oak Mines, a smaller company based in Vancouver. Both bids are valued at
just over CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.44bn).
Royal Oak's bid brought into the open long-standing dissatisfaction among
Lac's shareholders. Criticism centred on Lac's inability to realise the full
value of its properties in the US, Canada and Chile.
Mr Steen, aged 63, has wide mining experience in southern Africa and North
America. He said shortly after his appointment last Friday that he hoped to
prepare a strategic plan, including cost-cutting measures, within two
months.
Analysts and shareholders are divided in their predictions on Lac's fate.
While American Barrick is widely favoured among the bidders which have
appeared so far, some think the recent shake-up could greatly increase Lac's
attractiveness as an independent company. Also, other bidders could emerge
in coming weeks with more attractive offers.

Kruger Inc, the family-owned Canadian forest products business, is to build
a tissue paper facility in Cheshire and will buy a Welsh tissue converting
company with the help of 3i, the UK's largest development capital group.
The Pounds 43m project to form Kruger Tissue Group UK involves Kruger and 3i
investing Pounds 22.3m in the share capital of the company, which will also
raise Pounds 20m of debt from Midland Bank.
The Welsh company being bought for an undisclosed sum is Caernarvon-based
Industrial Cleaning Paper, a tissue paper converter with a well established
market.
The new mill at Disley, in Cheshire, will produce recycled tissue for
private label and industrial markets. Imported tissue prices have surged
recently.
Mr Jim Kavanagh, the managing director of ICP, will become a director of
Kruger Tissue Group UK.
In 1989, Kruger bought the Disley paper mill from J Bibby and Sons for
Pounds 2.7m.

FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BAe to cut executives' contracts to two
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is set to cut the length of its executive directors'
service contracts from three to two years following talks with fund
management institutions.
The move follows mounting frustration among institutional shareholders over
large pay-outs to directors who have been forced to resign.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's former chairman, received a Pounds 3.1m pay-off when
he resigned earlier this year. BAe said the payment was 'for all
compensation due to him under his service contract.'
In June, PosTel, the Pounds 25bn investment management group, announced it
would be voting against the election and re-election of directors with
rolling employment contracts of longer than two years.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive, wants to end pay-outs of
up to three times basic salary to directors on three-year rolling contracts.
BAe mentioned Postel as 'not the only people we have been talking to,' and
added: 'it's a topic which has been coming up in meetings with large
investors.'
Two recently appointed BAe directors - Mr John Weston and Mr Mike Turner -
have two-year rolling contracts and the company's compensation committee is
expected to decide upon a one-year reduction in the length of the other
executive directors' contracts.
In particular, the committee is likely to change the contracts of Mr Dick
Evans, chief executive, and Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director.
Several other companies have also recently cut the length of their
directors' contracts. At National Westminster Bank the three-year rolling
contracts of six executive directors will end in two years' time, to be
replaced by one-year rolling contracts.
And at last month's annual meeting of Argyll Group, the UK's third largest
food retailer, the group announced that it was also cutting the length of
its directors' service contracts from three to two years.

FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Norton to resume production after backers
inject CDollars 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norton Motors (1993), the beleaguered British motorcycle manufacturer, has
been given a one-year lifeline by its Canadian backers.
The company, which almost collapsed last month following a row among its
Vancouver-based owners, has been promised a cash injection of at least
CDollars 1m (Pounds 400,000) to restart production at its Midlands plant.
Norton's shareholders - led by Franmar Development Corporation, a Canadian
investment group - agreed the financial package following talks with the
company's UK managers.
Mr Matthew Markham, a Franmar director, said the funds could be used to
build a final batch of 100 motorcycles using Norton's rotary engine
technology. 'If successful, we may invest more money on developing new
piston engine models,' he added.
Fears over the long-term future of Norton rose last month after Ms Rozanda
Skalbania, who had been managing the UK plant, left the company.
If the company survives, Mr Markham said it would consider raising fresh
finance in North America, where Norton BSA - a shell company - could seek a
Nasdaq listing.

FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Going public for a higher profile - The
planned flotation of ED&amp;F Man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Considering how close ED&amp;F Man is to two of the sweetest things in life  -
chocolate and money - its low profile with the public comes as some
surprise.
However, after more than two centuries of relative anonymity during which
time it has developed from a sugar broker to an international trader in
agricultural products and financial services, Man has decided to brave the
demanding world of outside shareholders and City analysts.
Its proposed stock market flotation, planned for September by way of a
placing and public offer sponsored by Schroders with James Capel as broker,
is expected to value the company at about Pounds 450m and raise Pounds 80m
of new capital.
Although existing shareholders will sell no more than 15 per cent of their
holdings, between 25 and 30 per cent of the enlarged company is likely to
flow into public hands.
The immediate benefits of the flotation are twofold. First, it will enable
Man to sever its remaining ties with Philip Morris through the redemption of
about Pounds 40m-worth of preference shares.
The US tobacco and food giant has been seeking to divest its shareholding in
Man since 1990 when it accidentally inherited the stake during its takeover
of Jacobs Suchard. Man will also be able to pay down debt and continue its
investment in upgrading and expanding its fixed asset base.
But Man's management is clearly more interested in the long-term advantages
of being a well-capitalised public group. 'The flotation will help us
greatly in the marketing of our fund management products,' says Mr Colin
Barrow, managing director of Man's fund management division.
Other benefits include the likely upgrading of its credit rating, currently
triple-B plus, and a more sound financial footing for the long-term
development of the group.
Although Man has leading market positions in soft commodities, including
sugar, cocoa, molasses, peanuts and pepper, its fund management division,
which specialises in futures funds using quantitative investment techniques,
has played an integral part in its transformation into a diversified
business.
The cashflow earned from the fund management and financial brokerage
businesses has been ploughed into the commodity side, paying for the
processing and distribution facilities which have helped to enhance the
quality of the group's earnings.
The profit before tax derived from financial services has far outstripped
agricultural products for four of the past five years, during which time the
group's pre-tax profit has grown by 75 per cent to Pounds 66.7m in the year
to March 1994 from Pounds 38.1m in 1990, and at a compound growth rate of 15
per cent a year.
Although the group's strong profit record and its adherence to stringent
risk management policies will clearly impress potential new shareholders,
Man's management still needs to slay several dragons in order to obtain its
desired rating, which is believed to be targeted in the low- to mid-teens.
This would be a considerable achievement since it is probable that Man will
be listed in the food manufacturing sector, where the prospective
price-earnings ratio is just under 12.
The most difficult task ahead for Man is to overcome the City's prejudice
against companies with large commodity operations. After all, memories of
the old Berisford group and Dalgety's unhappy experience with Gill &amp; Duffus
still linger, and some food manufacturing analysts are hardly relishing the
thought of having to follow a company whose earnings visibility, in their
view, will be cloudy at best.
This stance arouses some bemusement at Man. 'It is a curiously London
phenomenon that one has to be defensive about commodity operations, as it is
in effect an industrial activity,' says Mr Barrow. 'We have huge factories
in addition to being merchants, we don't take large market positions, we are
a global and recession-proof business.'
Another concern which potential investors are likely to have is that a stock
market listing will provide a route for Man's management to sell the rest of
their shareholdings. However, the company plans to have a five-year employee
incentive scheme in place before the flotation, which should allay such
worries and also safeguard the partnership culture which has always been
part of Man.
Mr Barrow is also surprised by questions about the quality of the funds
which Man has under management and the perception among some analysts that
they could flow out at any time.
Of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) which Man has under management, more than
20 per cent is contractually committed for a period of seven to eight years,
he says. In addition, about 70 per cent is invested in so-called
'guaranteed' funds where the focus is on the longer term.
In view of the interest from the general public so far - there have been
just under 8,500 requests for prospectuses and application forms - Man
should be feeling quietly confident about its flotation. But given its
200-year trading experience, it is unlikely to start celebrating until the
boat comes in.

FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SCI to raise offer for Great Southern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Southern Group, the funerals operator which faces a hostile takeover
bid, is to receive an offer worth up to 800p a share from its US aggressor
early this week.
The offer was being thrashed out yesterday between the Field family, which
has a controlling interest in Southern, and Service Corporation
International (SCI), the world's largest funeral company.
Sources close to Houston-based SCI said yesterday that it was in talks over
an offer 'somewhere between Southern's closing share price of 709p and
800p.'
Southern was also hedging its options and holding discussions with Loewen, a
Canadian rival.
SCI made its original Pounds 87.4m offer at the start of June, but was
stonewalled by JD Field and Sons, the private company controlled by the
Field family, which has been in the burial business since 1690.
The family, said to have bridled at the abrasive approach of Mr Bill
Heiligbrodt, SCI's Texan chairman, rejected the offer immediately. It also
ignored a higher offer of 680p a share made last week, valuing the company
at Pounds 99.1m.
Under Takeover Panel rules a move has to be made this week and it is
believed that the latest offer will be accepted.
SCI controls almost 30 per cent of the enlarged capital.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Partnership's success still up in the air: British Airways'
global ambitions hinge on recovery of USAir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY PAUL BETTS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways will confirm today its reputation as one of the world's most
profitable airlines when it reports first-quarter figures expected to show
pre-tax profits of about pounds 85m-pounds 95m. But the UK flag-carrier's
consistently impressive financial performance has so far failed to lift its
shares, which have recently traded at around 430p compared with a high
earlier this year of 496p.
Although BA has outperformed an improving airline market - The International
Air Transport Association (Iata) reported last week that overall traffic
growth for its 224 member airlines rose 9.7 per cent in the first half of
this year compared with 7.3 per cent for the whole of 1993 - a combination
of factors have worried the financial community.
These include the impact of the European Commission's decision to approve a
FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) three-year French government rescue package for Air
France, one of BA's main European competitors, and the ongoing litigation in
the US with Virgin Atlantic over the 'dirty tricks' affair.
But the biggest uncertainty involves BA's Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m)
investment in a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
BA's partnership with USAir is an important component of the UK carrier's
strategy of acquiring stakes and developing alliances with international
carriers to strengthen its world airline network.
The global concept hinges on a strong partnership in the US airline market,
which still accounts for around 40 per cent of world air travel.
Much will now depend on the success or failure of USAir's management to
negotiate a recovery package with the airline's employees to secure its
future. USAir has not made a profit since 1988, and in March warned that
this year's losses would be greater than last year's Dollars 349m.
All the big US carriers are under pressure to cut wage bills to respond to
cut-throat competition from smaller, low-cost airlines. But the pressure on
USAir is greatest because its costs are so out of line with the rest of the
industry.
USAir's difficulties in launching a meaningful restructuring prompted BA to
state it was no longer prepared to make any additional investment in its US
partner until it was satisfied it was on a road to recovery. BA also warned
it was considering writing off its existing investment in USAir if no
progress was achieved in coming months.
The US carrier has taken steps to improve productivity, culminating in June
with the announcement that it wanted its employees to take pay and benefit
cuts worth Dollars 500m a year.
Last week, its pilots' union went some way to meeting this demand by
offering Dollars 2.5bn worth of labour concessions over five years. But it
set a high price on co-operation. The union says employees should get 25 per
cent of USAir's common stock, Dollars 700m in preferred stock, three seats
on the 15-seat board, and an immediate Dollars 450m investment in the
company by BA. If this plan becomes a reality, USAir would become the fourth
big US airline to exchange equity stakes for labour concessions. Employees
now own 26 per cent of Northwest Airlines, 45 per cent of TWA and 55 per
cent of United Airlines.
By the end of last week, virtually everyone concerned had rejected the
pilots' plan - but not outright. In all likelihood, the proposal for a
partial employee buy-out will form the basis of USAir's cost-cutting.
However, employee ownership has not yet proved to be the salvation that some
had hoped, as it tends to go hand-in-hand with no-redundancy clauses that
prevent managements from making necessary job cuts. Last week, the troubled
TWA announced a long-overdue 12 per cent cut in its workforce, but the move
will probably be insufficient to stave off a cash crisis this winter. Most
US airline industry analysts rank TWA as the carrier least likely to survive
another year. USAir, they add, is not far behind.
Although BA has said it will write off the US stake if necessary, it has
also emphasised that this will not necessarily have drastic consequences on
the commercial benefits it is already reaping from the USAir partnership. A
recent study by SG Warburg Securities says BA's alliance benefits are
stronger than originally forecast. 'Our estimate of Pounds 40m in benefits
from the USAir link will be met by 1994, but on top of that the company now
expects to draw an additional Pounds 30m in revenue enhancements and cost
savings from the partnership.'
BA is also financially strong enough to take an eventual hit on USAir.
Overall traffic performance is continuing to move into overdrive into the
second quarter with high-yield first and business-class traffic growing at
about twice the rate of low-yield economy cabin traffic.
From the beginning, BA's investment in USAir was seen as a gamble. At the
time, Mr Bernard Attali, then chairman of Air France, said that BA would
probably live to regret its USAir investment. The next few months will
decide who was right.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Switched on to show improved
profits - Philips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the big Dutch-based electronics group, is expected to show a
further strong improvement in performance when it unveils second-quarter
figures on Thursday.
Analysts are looking for a continuation of the first-quarter trend, when net
profit more than doubled. Forecasts for the second quarter call for a net
profit per share on normal business activities (excluding extraordinary
items) of around Fl 0.80 compared with Fl 0.37 a year earlier.
This would put Philips on track for substantially higher full-year results
and could lead to a rise in the dividend when the payout decision is taken
early in 1995. Philips paid a small dividend in 1993, its first since the
payout on 1989 results.
The extent of the second-quarter rise will depend crucially on the
contribution made by economic recovery in Europe, the company's main market.
So far in 1994, the profit increase has rested mainly on cost-cutting, debt
pruning and financial charges, rather than on a change in business
conditions.
These factors should lead to another big increase compared with the 1993
second quarter, but a resurgence in Europe would strengthen the company's
upward trend. Components, lighting and consumer electronics are expected to
show good second-quarter results.

Interim figures for the oil major are due on Thursday. Analysts say the
presence of a number of exceptional items in the figures make it difficult
to assess the underlying trend in profits. But most expect modest growth,
with replacement cost profits of around Pounds 800m. The figures are likely
to show that Shell has suffered particularly badly from a downturn in
refining margins in Asia, where it has a strong presence.

analysts expect an increase in the interim to between 7.5p and 8p from last
year's 6.5p. Bad debts will be down, leading to pre-tax profits forecast to
rise to Pounds 670m-Pounds 770m from last year's Pounds 335m.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News: Insurers set for a beneficial interim - Other
Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the UK's largest composite insurers are expected to report
substantially increased profits in their interims this week.
The results will be boosted primarily by recovery in UK underwriting,
reflecting high premiums and stable claims. Analysts have warned that the
balance sheets may be weaker as a result of the turbulence in equity and
bond investments.
General Accident is set to announce its half-year results tomorrow. Pre-tax
profits of Pounds 177m-Pounds 200m are expected, against last time's Pounds
126m. The forecast dividend is in the range 10p to 10.25p, against 9.7p last
time.
Commercial Union is expected to unveil its results on Wednesday, although
the timing may be changed or separated from details of the way in which the
insurer is to pay for its purchase of Groupe Victoire, the French insurer,
earlier this year.
Analysts are predicting half-year profits of Pounds 168m-Pounds 180m, up
from Pounds 66m. The dividend range is 10.1p to 10.25p, against 15.1p last
time.
Royal Insurance is due to report on Thursday, with forecast profits of
Pounds 127m-Pounds 150m, with an average of Pounds 138m. This compares with
just Pounds 52m last time. The predicted dividend range is 3p to 3.5p,
rising after the company cut its dividends substantially two years ago.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Microsoft signs up ICL for servicing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has chosen ICL of
the UK to service its products and customers across western Europe.
The agreement is the first pan-European deal Microsoft has signed under its
recently announced policy of concentrating on software development while
seeking business partners to service and support large customers. Service
and support includes maintenance, systems integration, consultancy and
training.
ICL, based in the UK but owned by Fujitsu of Japan, becomes an 'Authorised
Support Centre' with the responsibility for servicing Microsoft software
products, including the new large-scale operating system 'Windows NT', in
western Europe and the Nordic countries. Discussions are under way on
similar agreements for eastern Europe and parts of Africa.
The deal underlines ICL's increasing commitment to computer services at the
expense of computer making. Once Europe's only mainframe manufacturer, ICL
has increasingly diversified into software and services as a defence against
shrinking profit margins in the hardware business. Last year ICL was
marginally profitable on revenues of Pounds 2.6bn, of which more than half
came from computer services.
Neither company would speculate on the value of the deal, but ICL is
expected to benefit substantially. There are some 40m personal computer
users in Europe. Mr Tony Rees, ICL's product support manager for Europe,
said the company already has 5,000 staff in its support group turning over
about Pounds 500m annually.
Microsoft has found it increasingly difficult to support its larger
multinational customers. The company's success was founded on software for
stand-alone personal computers, in particular the MS-Dos and Windows
operating systems now used on more than 90 per cent of PCs.
Increasingly, however, companies want to link their PCs into networks. The
networking market leader and Microsoft's direct competitor is Novell of the
US.
Microsoft's networking software, Windows NT, is large and complex and
companies installing it need considerable consultancy and support.
Microsoft, however, with its emphasis on software development, is ill-suited
to providing computer services. Rather than risk diluting its development
efforts, it decided last year to seek partners to support its customers.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Charter urged to raise Esab offer price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, will this week face trade union opposition
and widespread complaints about its offer price for Esab of Sweden, as it
seeks a complete takeover of the world's leading producer of welding
equipment.
Esab announces its half-year results today, and an expected surge in profits
is likely to heighten Swedish calls for Charter to raise its bid and
increase doubts over whether the UK company can secure the acceptance of 90
per cent of shareholders for the takeover by Friday's deadline.
Charter already holds 53 per cent of Esab following its Pounds 260m
recommended bid in late June. It secured 49 per cent of the voting capital
from Incentive, the industrial group run by the Wallenberg family that was
previously Esab's controlling shareholder.
Since then, Esab's share price has risen, wiping out the 20 per cent premium
originally offered by Charter. Last week, Esab shares stood at around
SKr350, above the bid price of SKr345.
The blue- and white-collar trade unions at Esab have come out strongly
against the Charter takeover, fearing the UK company will shift production
and control away from Sweden. They will this week appeal to institutional
shareholders not to accept the offer.
Mr Henrik Wikman, senior portfolio manager at Wasa Life, which holds a 3 per
cent voting stake in Esab, said he did not share the trade unions'
objections. But he described the Charter bid as 'stingy'. 'It might be
difficult to complete at the price they have set, but we have made no final
decision yet.'
Analysts in Stockholm expect Esab to report six-month pre-tax profits of
around SKr175m (Pounds 14.7m), against SKr23m last year. Many anticipate
profits growing faster than the company's forecast, issued before the
Charter bid, of full-year profits of SKr300m. 'The feeling is Charter is
buying too cheap,' said one senior analyst.
Charter, however, insisted last week that it had no intention of changing
its offer. 'People are trying to test our mettle, They would like more
money,' said Mr Charles Parker, Charter commercial director. 'I think
whatever price we had agreed this would have happened.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Advertising rally produces more
confident feeling - WPP/Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim results for the two marketing services giants, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and
WPP, are expected to reflect the growing confidence in a gradual worldwide
recovery in advertising expenditure. Zenith, Saatchi's own media-buying
division, in its latest half-yearly forecast of world spending trends, sees
expenditure growth of 5.5 per cent this year, compared with 3.4 per cent for
1993.
Saatchi is expected today to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m-Pounds
13.5m for the first six months, compared with Pounds 9.1m in 1993.
The group will continue to suffer from the loss of some large clients in the
US. However, there have also been some recent new business wins, notably for
Qantas' overseas advertising and, in the UK, for the National Lottery.
Analysts will be particularly watching for signs that the shake-up of the US
business is beginning to take effect, and that some headway is being made on
improving margins beyond 6.3 per cent.
A truce between Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman, and Mr Charlie Scott, chief
executive, following an embarrassingly public falling-out, appears to be
holding.
WPP's interim results on Wednesday are likely to show pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 36m-Pounds 37m, compared with Pounds 24.1m in 1993. The group
will be particularly keen to emphasise the good news and impress the
institutions: the banks, which bailed the group out in 1992 in a Dollars
271.6m (Pounds 175.2m) debt-for-equity swap, will be free to sell their 190m
shares - 26.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital - at the beginning of
next month.
The biggest new business win of the year has been the scoop by WPP agency
Ogilvy &amp; Mather of IBM's advertising worldwide. Margins are again expected
to improve, and should be heading towards 8 per cent.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Railtrack urges staff to increase pressure on RMT to stop
strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack is appealing directly today to all its 12,000 employees, urging
them to contact the RMT transport union to demand the suspension of a
planned 72 hours of disruption by signalling staff.
The strikes are due to start at midnight on Thursday, affecting Friday, and
continue next Monday and Tuesday. Saturday and Sunday services should run
normally.
The state-owned company that runs the network also urged the RMT leadership
to reballot its signalling staff on the latest pay productivity offer. The
move was designed to increase the pressure on the union's executive to
return to talks to end the dispute, now entering its ninth week.
Railtrack's bulletin to all its staff asks them to call the union's London
headquarters to express their views. It said: 'Let us have a negotiated
settlement to end the dispute. We have made a commitment to negotiate until
we reach a settlement. Will the union do the same? Ask them.'
The RMT transport union executive committee is being urged by the union's
full-time officials today to consider reopening negotiations with Railtrack.
The officials believe they have won enough clarification from Railtrack on
its present offer to suggest an improvement can be made immediately in the
basic pay rates of the staff through a consolidation of half the proposed 6
per cent supplement that is already on the table.
This would be in addition to a proposed earnings rise, backdated to April 4,
of 7.2 per cent composed of a productivity-linked increase of up to 4.7 per
cent on top of a 2.5 per cent basic pay rise already agreed.
The possibility of a return to talks was glimpsed on Friday when Railtrack
chairman Mr Bob Horton suggested that the company's pay restructuring
package for signalling staff could be reshaped.
He suggested consolidating into basic rates for overtime and shift premiums
some of the proposed 6 per cent supplement.
Railtrack, however, has still not put this proposal into writing. The RMT
executive might expect to have formal confirmation on the proposed
consolidation before going back to the conciliation service Acas.
But Railtrack's appeal today, and its behaviour over the past few days since
the RMT's signalling supervisors rejected joining in the dispute after a
decisive ballot vote, suggests the company is ready to be flexible.
'There are grounds to go forward,' says today's bulletin to Railtrack staff.
As well as the immediate 7.2 per cent increase, Railtrack said last night
that the offer also involves a final restructuring deal by October involving
a further rise, plus improved holidays and sick pay.
In addition, some Pounds 50m has been put aside in the railways pension fund
to meet the cost of the increased pension benefits the signalling staff can
expect to gain if the final settlement is agreed by October 1.

FT  08 AUG 94 / US group in Tokyo supercomputer deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cray Research of the US, the world's leading supercomputer manufacturer, has
for the first time won a Japanese public sector order in direct competition
with a Japanese computer company.
The sale, to the Japanese government-funded Tokyo Institute of Technology,
represents a breakthrough after more than a decade of trade disputes over US
allegations that Japan has discriminated against American manufacturers in
its public procurement of supercomputers.
It also comes as the US is preparing to impose trade sanctions on Japan
after failing to reach agreements on disputes over Japanese public
procurement policies in the telecommunications and medical equipment
sectors.
While the supercomputer purchase may be calculated to help defuse trade
tension, it could have the opposite effect by highlighting how long it has
taken Cray to break down the alleged barriers to Japanese government
purchases. Despite two US-Japanese agreements on supercomputer trade, in
1987 and 1990, and the formation of a supercomputer procurement review board
in Japan to ensure fair play, Cray has previously been unable to win sales
to Japanese government agencies and institutions except when there were no
bids from domestic competitors.
Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the sale to the Tokyo institute was
influenced by the depressed value of the dollar against the yen, which has
reduced the cost of US goods sold in Japan. Cray did not disclose the terms
of its sale agreement, but Japanese press reports said that the US-built
supercomputer was less than half the price of one offered by NEC, Cray's
largest Japanese competitor. Supercomputers typically cost Dollars
10m-Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m).
Cray will provide its C90 supercomputer to the institute for use as a host
computer at its information processing centre, the company said in Tokyo. It
is the first of 10 supercomputers to be bought by the Japanese government in
the current fiscal year.

FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Trustees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most prestigious hotels group and one of its biggest undertakers
have one thing in common: their fates are in hands of trustees of trusts set
up by the companies' founding families. The charitable trusts that have
protected the Savoy from Forte's advances for so long have finally agreed to
talk, while the Field family trusts could hold the key to the battle for
control of Great Southern. In such cases trustees can find their positions
most uncomfortable. It would be only natural for trustees to feel loyalty to
the company in which the trust holds shares but their only consideration
should be the financial interests of the trusts' beneficiaries.
Whatever else has brought the Savoy trusts to the table it can hardly be a
coincidence that the company's performance has been so poor it was forced to
cut its dividend and therefore the trusts' income. The Field family trusts
have also had a thin time having done without dividends from J D Field for
some years. It would be easy in both cases to argue that the beneficiaries
are not getting the best deal available and the trustees have clearly become
concerned. In theory, trustees should be even more single-minded in
maximising the value of their shares than other institutional shareholders.
In practice, managements often consider them a pushover. But it will be no
bad thing if the Savoy and Field managements ultimately pay the price for
not looking after the beneficiaries better.

FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having won its third consecutive Eurovision song contest Ireland may be
heading for another award this year - fastest growing European economy. The
Irish government has just increased its 1994 growth forecast to a racy 5 per
cent and judging by last week's figures from AIB the optimism looks
well-founded. These showed the bank's Irish loans growing at an annualised
rate of 10 per cent in the first half while across the Irish Sea, NatWest's
loan book was down.
Not everything in Ireland is rosy. Unemployment is still very high though
this at least adds to the confidence that the economy can combine such
growth with continued low inflation. So confident are some independent
forecasters that they predict this benign environment will last to the end
of the century.
The implications have not been lost on domestic or international investors
who pushed the Dublin stock market up by 54 per cent last year. However,
this could be seen largely as a correction for the steep fall over the
previous two years and with the market 12 per cent off this year's high it
is not highly rated by international standards. The biggest problem for
investors is the limited range of stocks to choose from. Most quoted Irish
companies are either very small or, like Jefferson Smurfit, very
international. The one large industrial group that has significant exposure
to Ireland is building materials group CRH, whose shares now discount much
of the good news. Nor have investors overlooked the two banks, AIB and Bank
of Ireland, which generate half their profits in their home market. But
their shares remain modestly rated compared with their UK banks, operating
in a much more difficult climate.

FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: European chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Half-year results from the German chemicals giants, starting next week,
should confirm that European recovery has come earlier than even bulls of
the sector dared hope. ICI and DSM have already reported volume gains
running into double digits by the end of second quarter. Although selling
prices are not much higher than this time last year, the upwards trend from
the trough reached in the final months of 1993 is clear. With capacity
utilisation rates already pushing towards 90 per cent in some areas, there
are surely further pricing gains to come.
This is good news for this year's profits. In addition to strong volume
gains through the first half of the year, the usual third quarter lull in
activity has failed to materialise. But the broader question is whether the
peak in chemicals industry profits will come sooner or last longer than
investors hitherto expected. The recent growth trend gives grounds for
optimism on the first count - barring an unforeseen event such as an oil
shock.
How long the peak lasts depends on the industry's ability to resist
investing in excess capacity during the upswing. But big capital programmes
announced this year or next would take some years to complete. If the
profits peak comes in 1996-97, there could be at least a short plateau
rather than an immediate downswing. The big European chemicals companies
have been outperforming their local stock markets for about a year on
expectations of a slow, sluggish recovery. Given the quickening pace of the
upturn it would be extraordinary if they now fell behind.

FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Shady side of the street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street is caught between a rock and a hard place. Economic indicators
which point to continued strong growth - such as last Friday's employment
data - drive shares lower on the grounds that the Federal Reserve is more
likely to raise interest rates. This week's producer and consumer price
figures could be crucial. Gathering inflation, combined with the apparent
strength of the labour market, would surely tilt the Fed towards higher
rates at its Open Market Committee meeting on August 16.
Yet pointers towards a significant slow-down in the second half of the year
 -such as lower housing starts, car sales and weaker money growth  - raise
fears that earnings expectations are too high. After the exceptionally
strong second quarter figures reported by many US companies, that might seem
an unlikely prospect. With many analysts again lifting forecasts for this
year and next, though, there is plenty of room for disappointment. The worst
of all possible worlds would be another half-point rise in rates just as it
becomes clear that the economy is already slowing.
It is always possible that the Fed will stay its hand and that growth will
fall gently back towards trend, around 2.5 per cent. Under this golden
scenario earnings estimates might turn out to be a touch optimistic, but a
stable bond market would underpin equities. While this rosy prospect helped
equities climb by 3 per cent last month, the outcome is delicately poised
and the evidence conflicting. The course of events is rarely as neat in
practice.

British fund managers tempted to head for China on a Dollars 5,000 'research
tour' should think again. The trip, advertised in the American monthly
magazine Institutional Investor, is payable 'in soft dollars through the
broker of your choice'. In other words, it is a variation of the
increasingly common practice whereby brokers barter 'research-related'
services to a client who agrees to execute a minimum amount of business.
But the regulators are on the trail. SEC chairman Arthur Levitt has been
complaining that the practice 'doesn't feel right, taste right, smell
right'. Imro, the self-regulatory body for the UK fund management industry,
has gone further and has formally censured Abbey Life for sending fund
managers on jollies to the US and Asia.

Whatever do the initials 'CHyp' after a person's name denote? If that person
is Tom Leigh, director of 3T Publications, one of the companies now in
provisional liquidation thanks to the UK government's clamp-down on
'pyramid' schemes, the logical conclusion might be 'Certificate in Hype'. It
transpires instead, in a letter circulated by 3T, that Leigh is trained as a
hypnotherapist at the 'well-known and highly-respected Proudfoot School of
Hypnosis and Psychotherapy at Scarborough'. Here at last an explanation as
to why all those 'investors' opened their wallets with such alacrity to a
notion so fundamentally flawed?

FT  08 AUG 94 / Observer: Taki two
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As if the visage of Taki Theodoracopulos beaming atop 'Atticus' were not
unsettling enough, the society gossip who has just hijacked the Sunday Times
column of that name seems disturbingly shaky on his classical antecedents.
'I guess it was inevitable I become Atticus,' the Spectator magazine's High
Life columnist crows. 'Of all the distinguished journalists who have been
Atticus, I'm the only one who was actually born under the Attic sky of
Athens.'
It all depends of which Atticus one speaks. Should Taki be referring to
Titus Pomponius (109-32 BC), the symmetry is sadly less than complete, this
Atticus having been Roman. A scholar whose main claim to fame was publishing
a collection of letters penned to him by Cicero, it was his 23-year sojourn
in Athens - rather than the sky 'neath which he was born - that earned him
the moniker Atticus.
So how about Herodes Atticus (circa 101-177 AD), celebrated orator and
writer? A member of the second Sophistic movement, 'he sought to entertain
and enlighten without referring to political matters' a glance at
Encyclopaedia Britannica reveals. Which would rather cramp the style of the
man who yesterday laid, with such gusto, into Greek prime minister Andreas
Papandreou.

Mention red socks to an east German, and his first thought is not of a
baseball team from Boston, but of the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
restyled communists to whom this nickname has attached itself. Unsettled by
the PDS taking 18 per cent of the vote in polls ahead of the October
election, Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats temporarily donned the socks and
ran with them - only to make some serious errors.
It was all the idea of Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, who last
month came up with a poster depicting a solitary red sock hanging from a
washing line. It read: 'Together towards the future, but without the Red
Socks.' No sooner had Hintze ordered 200,000 posters than the CDU's branches
in eastern Germany refused to back the campaign.
Some thought it too frivolous, while others tried to explain to their
masters in Bonn that sending up the PDS was tantamount to attacking the east
Germans themselves, and hence not the brightest way of trying to heal
political divisions that continue to split the country east and west.
A poll yesterday by Emnid found 51 per cent of Germans believing the
campaign has backfired sufficiently actually to be harming the CDU. So, with
Commie-bashing removed from its repertoire, will the government's next game
plan have to be a touch more sophisticated?

FT  08 AUG 94 / Few tricks left up his sleeve: Bill Clinton's presidency is
beginning to look compromised, confused and directionless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At his press conference last Wednesday, President Bill Clinton answered
eight questions on healthcare reform, four on Whitewater, three on trade and
the economy, two each on Haiti and his own public image, and one on North
Korea.
A visitor from Mars might need Whitewater explained, as many Americans still
do, but could otherwise conclude that the subjects accurately reflected
legitimate national concerns of the moment. A year ago the mix might have
been different, with the budget, Somalia and Bosnia more to the fore, but
it, too, would have been reasonably representative. An activist president in
a changing world would expect to find himself facing a catholic selection of
questions.
The difference is that the Clinton presidency can now, more than ever, be
fairly said to be on the edge of deep trouble. Admittedly, it was
fashionable to make a similar case in the summer of 1993, on the hypothesis
that a defeat on the budget, a failure to ratify the North American Free
Trade Agreement and an inability to reach a Uruguay Round agreement deal
were harbingers of a failed presidency. But all were successfully concluded,
giving the president, by any yardstick, an impressive first year.
It is much more serious now, for several reasons. One, passing healthcare
reform has always been the top priority of Mr Clinton and his wife: later
this month, both houses of Congress will finally come to votes on the issue,
but no sane person would currently bet on the result. The president has had
to accept substantial modifications to his original plans, to the point
where the House version is touted by its Democratic sponsors as 'not the
Clinton bill'.
But, if anything approximating universal insurance coverage is eventually
approved, he will receive a good chunk of the credit. If it goes down, he
will get much of the blame, no matter where the ultimate responsibility for
failure might fairly lie. Probable Republican gains in November's mid-term
elections, which may include loss of Democratic control of the Senate, imply
no second chance for what Mr Clinton describes as the most substantive piece
of domestic legislation since the 1960s.
Two, Whitewater was subcutaneous a year ago. But Washington, if not the
country, has been consumed by 10 days of congressional hearings focusing on
but a tiny fraction of the tangled tale of the first family's land
investments in Arkansas going back over 15 years. Nothing has been proven
and no heads have yet rolled, though Roger Altman, deputy Treasury
secretary, was seriously stretched on the rack. The spectacle of senior
White House and Treasury officials under the guns of congressional grandees,
rather than right-wing talk show hosts, can only be a public relations
disaster.
Then, late on Friday, a judicial panel replaced Mr Robert Fiske as
independent counsel with Mr Kenneth Starr, another Republican. It is too
early to say if any of Mr Fiske's interim findings exonerating
administration officials of obstructing justice will be overturned. But a
new and more protracted element of uncertainty has been inserted into the
investigations, which is not good for an administration increasingly
comfortable with Mr Fiske.
Three, Haiti brings Mr Clinton far closer to exactly the sort of foreign
military adventure that he came to office intent on avoiding. He resisted
much pressure to send US troops to Bosnia, eventually got them out of
Somalia, did not send them quixotically to Rwanda and did not overtly
threaten to use them against North Korea, all at the cost of being accused
as weak, indecisive and indifferent to human suffering.
But a combination of the sheer awfulness of Haiti's circumstances and
domestic political pressures, above all from his old friends in the
congressional black caucus, means he now stands armed with a UN Security
Council resolution empowering the use of 'all necessary means' to restore
democracy to Haiti. Curiously, as that resolution set off alarm bells around
the world, his administration, again divided between the interventionists of
the State Department and a cautious Pentagon, seemed to be drawing back from
imminent invasion, not least because intervention might complicate the
healthcare debate. But the fact remains there may be no alternative but to
send in the marines - and accept the consequences of the occupation of Haiti
and domestic political fall-out.
As last year, each of the above may turn out to be individually negotiable
shoals. It also should help Mr Clinton that there seems little wrong with
the economy, higher interest rates and twitchy exchange and currency markets
notwithstanding. But his public opinion ratings (in the low 40s) are the
worst of his presidency.
Some of that may reflect the depth of dislike, often outright hatred, he and
his wife inspire, and this, in turn, reflects the palpable decline in civil
political debate in America. The vitriol is no longer confined to the
lunatic fringes but even shows up on the floor of Congress. Last Tuesday
night, Congressman Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican, virtually accused the
Clintons of direct involvement in the death of Vincent Foster, the former
White House aide; he was speaking to an empty chamber but anybody watching
the fixed camera of C-Span, the political cable channel, would not have
known that.
But this does not account for the last and most troubling aspect of this
summer. Even the president's journalistic supporters, well aware of his
legendary powers of political recovery, have begun to wonder if he has not
irrevocably lost his way and even his spirit. E J Dionne wrote in the
Washington Post last week that, whatever Americans thought about sexual and
financial misconduct charges, 'they just don't want their chief executive to
be the subject of so many doubts, questions, rumours and jokes'. Michael
Kelley in the New York Times observed that 'Clinton's life trails him like a
peculiarly single-minded mugger, popping out from the shadows every time the
president is for a moment safe'.
The concerns of both transcended the personal. 'The central threads of this
presidency have disappeared,' Mr Dionne wrote. Mr Kelley's view was that,
having mastered the art of politics brilliantly, he was 'not perceptive
enough to see what politics was doing to him'.
Thus the early bold strokes - the budget plan, the first healthcare
presentation, the commitment to 'change' - became trimmed and hedged by the
inevitable politics of compromise. A year ago, it was still possible to
discern a clear if very busy game plan. But there now seems either to be
none or merely a series of expedient lurches that lack any coherence.
Haiti is, only perhaps, the prime example of this. The twists and turns of
Mr Clinton's policy are well documented: his campaign criticism of President
George Bush's determination to control the influx of Haitian refugees, his
adoption in office of Mr Bush's approach, the establishment of a naval
cordon to stop a new refugee flood, the aborted landing in Haiti of a US
ship carrying US and Canadian military advisers, tight and then looser
asylum application procedures, a stumbling search for safe havens,
half-hearted sanctions and finally the ratcheting up of economic and
political pressure on the Haitian junta via tougher sanctions and the UN
resolution. Throughout, the administration blew hot and cold on whether
ousted president Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide could be trusted.
At various points along this tortured road, Mr Clinton has appeared to bow
to political pressure. First it was from Florida, bearing the brunt of
looking after the boat people. Then, as conditions in Haiti worsened,
liberal activists demanded action. Randall Robinson of the TransAfrica lobby
went on a highly publicised hunger strike in Washington and the black
members of Congress demanded action.
The 38-strong black caucus, under the hard-nosed chairmanship of Congressman
Kweisi Mfume from Maryland, has leverage. Mr Clinton was grateful that
enough of them, mostly good liberals, had supported the deficit-cutting
budget bill and Nafta last year to ensure passage (but only after they had
struck some good bargains.) He knew he had let them down last summer by
dropping the nomination of Ms Lani Guinier, who is black, to run the justice
department's civil rights division and Mr Mfume told him so, bluntly and
publicly.
He still needs their support on healthcare, welfare reform and the omnibus
crime bill which envisages measures costing Dollars 30bn. Indeed Mr Mfume
fought long and hard for the inclusion of a 'racial justice' clause in the
crime bill, under which appeals against the death penalty could be launched
on grounds of a pattern of ethnic discrimination. Although the clause was
deleted from the legislation now in front of both houses, Mr Mfume is still
playing hardball, forming an unholy coalition with the gun lobby to delay
debate on the bill until he gets the assurances he wants from the
administration. He is likely to be as tough when welfare reform gets to the
drafting stage.
Last October, the black caucus called for a 'protective military force' to
facilitate Fr Aristide's return, though its arguments for intervention are
based on social justice rather than foreign policy considerations. 'If
Haitians were not black, we would not sit back and watch this murder occur,'
Mr Mfume has said, noting that there are no asylum barriers against
lighter-skinned Cuban refugees. The caucus was solidly behind Mr Robinson's
hunger strike and, when it sensed it was getting its message across, helped
end it.
Recently, Mr Clinton appointed Mr Bill Gray as Haitian special envoy. He was
a leader of the black congressional caucus for years before retiring in
1992. As it stands at present, the caucus is not displeased with the
direction of US policy. But any backtracking by the president carries clear
risks.
Republicans, long distrustful of Fr Aristide, claim that the caucus has
hijacked Haitian policy. Recently Mr Dick Cheney, the former defence
secretary and prospective presidential candidate, sarcastically painted the
imaginary scene of what would have happened if he had gone into President
Ronald Reagan and told him that Randall Robinson was on hunger strike and
that therefore Haitian policy had to be changed.
But the stronger Republican hand rests on the whole question of invasion.
Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, laid down his marker last week by
getting the Senate to pass unanimously a non-binding resolution requiring Mr
Clinton to seek the approval of Congress before despatching troops. The
president diplomatically replied that he hoped to have the support of
Congress but added, 'like my predecessors of both parties, I have not agreed
that I was constitutionally mandated to get it'. This was, indeed, President
Bush's position before the Gulf war but he still found it politic to secure
congressional assent.
As a practical matter, it probably makes sense to play down talk of
invasion, while keeping up the pressure on the Haitian junta, thus leaving
Congress free to focus on healthcare and crime. But it would only take some
egregious atrocity in Haiti itself to throw that calculation out of the
window.
The Senate vote and plenty of other polling evidence suggests that Mr
Clinton would be disappointed if he sought to restore his popularity by
'remembering the Mayaguez' - the rescue in 1975 of US sailors captured by
North Korea which sharply boosted President Ford's standing. There are some
suggestions he might invade Haiti anyway if only to assuage the pain if
healthcare fails. But that would really bring Congress down on his head.
Maybe Mr Clinton was lucky that he got only two questions on Haiti last
week. At least his answer to one of them was his most concise explanation
yet of why the US should deem it of vital interest. 'I think our security is
caught up in whether the people in this hemisphere are moving towards
democracy and open markets and observation of the rule of law . . . if you
look at the possible ramifications of (the violations of the junta in Haiti)
on other countries in the Caribbean and central and South America that is
where our security interest is.'
But this came late in the game. Indeed the broader question now, on Haiti as
on so many other issues, is whether the president can still play the game as
once he could.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Leading Article: The nuclear waste problem
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's consultation paper on the disposal of radioactive waste,
published last Friday, is central to the UK's review of nuclear policy for
two reasons. It addresses the issue of safety, which is uppermost in the
public's mind; and it has a direct bearing on cost, which must ultimately
determine whether nuclear power is commercially viable.
The most pressing issue is the disposal of intermediate and low-level
radioactive waste, such as bulky parts from first generation reactors and
nuclear submarines which are now coming to the end of their lives. By
contrast, high-level waste, such as spent fuel rods, needs 50 years to cool
before it can be stored, making it a problem for the next century.
Until last year, it appeared that the UK planned to dump at least some waste
at sea. But it has now signed an international treaty which includes a
10-year ban on sea dumping of radioactive waste. This leaves it with the
choice of burying the waste deep underground, or storing it in some form on
the surface.
The UK's provisional plans are to bury intermediate and low-level waste
permanently in sealed chambers carved out of the rocks half a mile
underground. UK Nirex, the industry's waste disposal company, has been given
the task of finding a site, and is now running geological studies underneath
Sellafield, British Nuclear Fuels' plants in Cumbria.
Deep disposal has the backing of the nuclear industry, the Department of
Trade and Industry, and a large section of the public. It is cheaper than
surface storage because it needs minimal surveillance, and is relatively
secure from risks such as terrorist attack. There is also a moral argument
for opting now for deep disposal, in that many feel it would be wrong to
leave the problem of waste disposal for future generations to answer.
Practical questions
As things stand, however, deep burial raises a number of practical and other
questions. The risk is mainly geological: radioactivity could leak into the
water table. If that happened, it would be extremely difficult to rectify.
These concerns apply particularly to the Sellafield site where Nirex has
discovered rock fissures and complex water flows which might cause
radioactivity to migrate.
Surface storage, by contrast, is more expensive and possibly riskier, but it
does keep the waste where it can be closely monitored. So long as
uncertainty exists about the science of nuclear waste disposal, it also
keeps options open. Many environmentalists argue that the permanent solution
of deep burial would deprive future generations of using whatever superior
disposal methods science eventually comes up with.
Deep burial
The trouble is that this is an argument without end: the same dilemma would
presumably prevent each succeeding generation from settling the waste
problem. Decisions about the desirability of nuclear power, in which
assumptions about the costs of waste disposal are an important part, cannot
be thus indefinitely postponed.
The government has made clear its preference for deep burial on economic,
safety and moral grounds. There will always be the suspicion, however, that
its position is shaped by short-term objectives, particularly the desire to
reduce the nuclear industry's costs and improve its chances of
privatisation. That would be patently wrong: if there was ever an issue
where safety should be paramount, it is this.
Scientific evaluation rather than political pressure must determine the
choice of disposal method. If minimising the impact on the environment and
the risk to human health is the criterion, the best technique might well be
sea disposal: environmental pessimists often understate the enormous
capacity of the deep oceans to dilute pollution. But with that option now
closed, the onus is on the government to build the safest and most palatable
alternative method of disposal into its nuclear review calculations.
There is no harm in persisting with investigations into deep disposal,
provided it is recognised that it might take years to find a safe site, if
one can be found at all. But for now, there may be no alternative to keeping
nuclear waste above ground until more of the uncertainty is removed.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Spheres of influence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a new world order, after all. It is not the one most people
imagined when President George Bush used the phrase in 1990 to elevate the
struggle against Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But it is based, in one respect, on
the precedent set by that struggle.
When the United Nations Security Council decided that force should be used
to liberate Kuwait, it did not follow the letter of the UN Charter, under
which member states should have made armed forces available to the Council
itself, so that it could 'take such action by air, sea or land forces as may
be necessary'. Instead, the Council authorised member states to use 'all
necessary means' to enforce its earlier resolutions; and an ad hoc coalition
of member states did so, under US command.
A similar formula was used in 1992, when the US went into Somalia; and last
week an identical carte blanche was given for an invasion of Haiti.
In both cases a two-stage operation was envisaged: first a swift, muscular
intervention 'authorised' by the Security Council but carried out by 'member
states', in other words the US acting with or without allies; second, a more
traditional and longer-term peacekeeping operation under UN command.
In Somalia the US initially joined in the second stage, but kept its 'Quick
Reaction Force' under separate command - a formula which caused maximum
confusion and ended in disaster last October. The UN force is still there,
but without US participation. In Haiti it appears the US does not intend to
take part in the second stage at all.
The Somali experience seems to have convinced the Clinton administration
that US ground troops should not be deployed as peacemakers or peacekeepers
outside the western hemisphere in situations where they are likely to come
under fire.
Comprehensive peace
They are deployed preventively in Macedonia; they have been offered for
Bosnia if, and only if, the parties accept a comprehensive peace agreement;
and now they have been sent to Rwanda and Zaire in a strictly humanitarian
role which, as Defence Secretary William Perry has been at pains to
emphasise, will not include peacekeeping.
Meanwhile, in June, the Security Council authorised France to intervene in
Rwanda in a role closely analogous to the US role in Somalia, and to what
will be the US role in Haiti if the invasion goes ahead: a quick 'in and
out' operation, intended to create conditions in which a UN peacekeeping
force can deploy, and to hold the line until that force arrives. Embittered
by its experience in Bosnia, France insisted on acting on its own in Rwanda
and is not willing to leave any troops as part of the UN force there.
Troubling development
And in July the Council gave a formal UN blessing to the Russian army's
presence in Georgia. This is a deeply troubling development. Although the
Georgian government now accepts the Russians as 'peacekeepers', it did so
only after suffering severe defeats at the hands of Russian-assisted
Abkhazian separatists, and when it desperately needed Russian help against
supporters of the ousted Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdjia. The price
paid for this help included agreement to join the Commonwealth of
Independent States, which Georgia had previously refused.
Thus Russia transparently exploited conflicts within Georgia to bring that
country back under its control, and the UN has now effectively ratified the
deal. It is no secret that the Russians insisted on this before agreeing to
support the Haiti resolution.
A clear pattern thus emerges. The permanent members of the Security Council,
scalded by their experience in Bosnia and Somalia, are increasingly
reluctant to deploy their forces under UN command. Instead each is willing
to act only where it conceives its national interest or prestige to be at
stake, and then looks to its colleagues on the Council for a UN rubber
stamp.
This is a travesty of the Charter and is bound to cause increasing
resentment among other UN members. If the permanent members are to live up
to their responsibilities they must be prepared to put their forces
genuinely at the UN's disposal, rather than using the UN to ratify their
division of the world into spheres of influence.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russians not taken in by image MMM
presented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALEKSANDR BALATSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Two thoughts on John Lloyd's article and his reports from Moscow on MMM
('The Possessed', July 31).
Lloyd claims, first, that the anger of MMM's shareholders is 'directed more
at the government than at MMM', and second, that Lenya Golubkov is presented
as a typical 'Russian figure in transition'.
Both claims are myth crea-ted mainly by MMM itself. According to the results
of a public-opinion poll conducted by the Independent Institute of
Parliamentary Sociology (Moscow) on July 25, 39 per cent of MMM's
shareholders blame their troubles on MMM, 24 per cent on themselves and only
9 per cent on the authorities.
The research also says that Lenya Golubkov is considered unpleasant by the
public: 58 per cent of all polled, 60 per cent of workers, and 54 per cent
of MMM's shareholders do not like his image (nearly 20 per cent in each
group were indifferent). His image meets a more or less favourable response
only from government executives - 26 per cent of those polled enjoy watching
him on the screen.
I believe that Russia (as well as other nations) stands not on Golubkovs - a
type of money-fixated idiot, whose mental abilities are restricted to
understanding where money comes from - but in defiance of them. Of course,
our economic situation presents ordinary people with a lot of problems,
which demand new approaches, but not to the extent of total trust in
advertising, as the article puts it.
I think that MMM's success was achieved mainly due to the low degree to
which people have adapted to the market and the relative rarity of such
pyramid-base schemes in today's Russia. Sooner or later this gap in the
market would be filled. In my opinion, if a similar scheme, combined with
powerful TV advertising, were introduced, say, in Britain for the first time
in a particular generation, as in our case, the effect would be at least the
same - except Lenya who would be probably replaced by John.
And, last, the article describes a TV advertisement, in which two brothers -
surely Golubkovs - are at the football match between Russia and Argentina.
As the whole story it is only partly true - in fact, in this advertisement
the brothers are at the match between Russia and Brazil.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Training cuts 'cause destitution' ' (July 22) highlighted
the closure of a Children's Society training project for young people with
special needs, funded by Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council.
Tec chief executive, T J Potts, claims (Letters, July 30/31) that the Tec
withdrew funding because it was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the
project. At the time of the closure, the Tec informed the Children's Society
it was reducing the number of providers in order to rationalise its training
provision. It closed another quality training provider this April.
The Children's Society is concerned that the project is just one of a number
of special needs training schemes which have recently been closed across the
country. As well as training, the project provided intensive pastoral and
welfare care for its users, whose needs ranged from disability to
homelessness. The value of this care was recognised by a range of local

FT  08 AUG 94 / Bounty along the border line: The likely economic benefits
of improved relations between Israel and Jordan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coils of razor wire and land mines will finally be removed today to make way
for a new Middle East border crossing between the Red Sea cities of Aqaba
and Eilat. The opening of the crossing by Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin will inaugurate a new era of economic
relations between the neighbouring states, following the formal opening of
direct telephone links between them by King Hussein and Israeli president
Ezer Weizman yesterday.
The two ground-breaking measures are the latest steps in what promises to be
a turning point in the Middle East after nearly half a century of
Arab-Israeli conflict. While the Middle East common market foreseen by Mr
Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, remains a distant dream, Israel and
Jordan will co-operate on several economic fronts.
Less than two weeks after the two sides formally ended their 46-year state
of war, they have revealed an extensive agenda. The speed with which they
unveiled their detailed proposals testifies to the economic imperatives
which are central to the peace process.
The benefits to Jordan - which has a gross national product of USDollars
5bn, a fraction of Israel's Dollars 70bn economy - are likely to be more
significant than those to Israel in the short and medium-term. Already the
US has forgiven Dollars 220m in loans to Jordan and has promised to write
off a further Dollars 500m; the UK has converted a loan worth Pounds 59.5m
(Dollars 91m) into a grant; and Japan has granted the kingdom energy loans
worth Dollars 130m, partly in appreciation of its peace efforts. Jordan has
a Dollars 6.9bn external debt.
Early economic co-operation is expected in three main areas: services,
regional integration projects and trade.
In services, the most favourable area is tourism. Today's opening of the
Eilat-Aqaba border will pave the way for travel agents to promote
multi-destination regional packages.
Israel and Jordan will also develop a near-eastern tourist association,
together with Egypt, Turkey and one day, perhaps, Syria and Lebanon, for
marketing and promotion abroad. Both Israel and Jordan expect tourism to
expand rapidly from last year's 2m visitors to Israel and about 350,000 to
Jordan. Tourism was Jordan's second-largest foreign exchange earner last
year, at Dollars 500m, and contributed about Dollars 2.1bn to the Israeli
economy.
Tourism will also be the starting ground for joint integration projects.
Plans are under way for cross-border schemes including a 'Red Sea Riviera'
between Aqaba, Eilat and Taba in Egypt, and a 'lowest point on earth'
tourism park in the Arava desert.
Transport projects will be undertaken early on, and should provide
considerable returns to both economies. Six roads - worth Dollars 1.4bn and
covering a total of 700km - are planned. The two most urgent are a road
linking Egypt to Jordan via Israel, and a road between Amman and Israel's
Mediterranean ports. Finance will be raised mainly from the private sector,
which could earn its return from tolls on the routes. Jordan will be able to
cut the costs of shipping and reduce its import bill, while Israel would
earn port fees.
Israel would also like an exit terminal at Jordan's Aqaba airport, allowing
Israel to close its small Eilat airport and pay airport fees to Jordan.
Israel also wants a joint Israeli-Jordanian port inland from the Gulf of
Aqaba, which it sees as critical to eventual exports to the Gulf states.
In the energy sector, linking the electricity grids would produce
considerable savings for both Jordan and Israel and pave the way for the
long-term development of a regional grid. The costs of linkage would be
minimal. Jordan's use of Israel's sophisticated communications
infrastructure and the resort by Jordanian companies to Israeli capital
markets to raise finance, might also save money. Potential benefits from
trade between Jordan and Israel are unclear. Both economies are highly
protected.
Any significant Israel-Jordan free trade treaty would also involve
negotiations with the Palestinians, as the Israeli-Palestinian economic
agreement is based on common import taxes and duties. Thus any pact giving
preferential treatment to Jordanian imports would have to be agreed first
with the Palestinians.
In the meantime, a trade agreement based on most favoured nation principles,
with little adjustment of present tariff structures, will promote annual
trade worth about Dollars 100m to Israel and tens of millions of dollars to
Jordan. Another option being considered is for Israel to allow Jordanian
imports to enter Israel on more favourable tariff terms and earlier than
Israeli goods enter Jordan.
Initial trade will be small, given the relative size and development of the
two economies - Israel imported Dollars 16bn of goods last year compared
with Jordan's Dollars 3.4bn. At present there are few goods Israel would
want to buy from Jordan, whose trade deficit last year was Dollars 2.4bn.
However, economists believe that once the Israeli market is open, Jordanian
industry will adapt to the new opportunities thus created.
'Trade creation will be more important than trade diversion,' said Nadav
Halevi, professor of trade at the Hebrew University. 'Trade will be much
more significant to the Jordanian economy than to the Israeli economy, and
Israel can open its markets without much fear, so the decision about trade
arrangements will be largely political.'
Politics, however, might conspire against a more broad-based process of
'beating swords into ploughshares'. While the economic links between Israel
and Jordan may develop quite quickly and smoothly, broadening economic
co-operation across the region may prove more difficult. Arab states are
suspicious about possible Israeli economic domination and reluctant to
integrate their economies with Israel.
Another obstacle to economic integration is finance. The prospect of funding
from foreign governments and international financial institutions appears
limited. Israel, however, says finance could be raised by the creation of a
Middle East development fund and the provision of government guarantees to
private sector companies. Israel is pursuing this idea with the US and other
potential donors. In October, King Hassan of Morocco will host a Middle East
economic conference in Casablanca.
Ultimately, moves towards Arab-Israeli economic co-operation based on peace
agreements between Israel and Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians will depend
in part on international economic incentives, in the form of aid, debt
relief, increased trade and foreign investment. As Mr Peres has pointed out,
in an increasingly global economy, the Middle East has little option but to
move towards closer integration. Fifteen years after a 'cold peace' with
Egypt, there are few signs of Egyptian-Israeli economic integration. But
Israeli officials believe the Jordanian agreement is a fresh start.
Further, Israel remains haunted by the threat of Islamic fundamentalism and
is determined to cement fragile Middle East peace through the economic
development of its neighbours. The Jewish state says it is ready to make
economic concessions to them. Such gestures, if genuine and expanded, could
help persuade Arab countries to see Israel as an economic partner rather
than as a power set on dominating them, and turn the initial benefits of
peace into a transformation of the region.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Awful lapse in taste: Clement Crisp laments the dire state
of British cooking - Things which never would be missed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Triangles of Camembert, coated in flaked almonds, deep-fried and served with
a cranberry sauce.' Something from the canteen in hell? 'Iced aubergine and
raspberry soup.' Ideal for clearing blocked drains? 'Mary's starter is a
ramekin of snails in a ginger and avocado sauce; then noisettes of Welsh kid
baked in filo pastry, with a port and coriander coulis, served with a
gratine of turnip and sorrel, followed by melon with brandy-snaps on a lime
and walnut sorbet.' BBC TV's Master Chef - or as near as gorge-risingly
dammit. The first two items are from life: one was part of a 'pub lunch';
the other comes courtesy of a newspaper cookery writer. Television viewers
will recognise the style and hateful probability of the third.
They are all part of the latest and by no means happiest chapter in British
cooking. Part of my plea about food in Britain today is that we must have an
end to tormented grub, to gastronomic adventures as pretentious and
improbable as those we find in cookery articles, in garrulous food
programmes on television, and especially in that apotheosis of the Cuisine
Fancy-Schmancy propounded by Master Chef, where the ingredients are as
tortured as the presenter's vowels.
Years ago, in a revue, Kenneth Williams was seen pushing food angrily round
his plate in a restaurant with the cry 'Filthy Foreign Muck]' Nowadays,
still haunted by very proper feelings of inferiority about our nation's
cooking, we are gulled by writers, by the food industry, by makers of
packaged meals (that deep-fried Camembert affront came, I'll bet, in icy
blocks from Borgia Deep Freeze Ltd) into believing that complicated is good,
and probably 'continental'. Complicated food is, on the whole, stupid,
palate-numbing, bad. It commits the greatest sin by denying ingredients
their nature, flavour, texture.
So, instead of concentrating upon freshness, upon clarity of cooking and
presentation, hotels, restaurants, cooks at home are bombarded with ideas
about elaboration and artifice by manufacturers, by writers in newspapers
and magazines, and most insidiously by the television cookery industry. A
friend, who is a good and blessedly unfussy cook, dined with a food writer.
Offered a dish, she was invited to 'guess what is in it?' She found it
impossible to say, and was rewarded by a gratified cry: 'Isn't it wonderful:
no one can tell]'
The real tragedy of all this misdirected fervour for innovation is that much
basic British food remains as disgusting as ever it was. We believe in Fast
Food, an American gospel that has spread everywhere, so that Moscow's first
taste (inapt word) of western cooking was a hamburger. Pap, tasteless but
colourful, zipped up with sauces and about as nutritious as blotting paper,
with a fizzy cola to wash it down, is what too many people now believe is
nourishment. We accept the mediocre in food shops and in hotels and
restaurants, and are gulled by the titles of dishes rather than by their
taste.
It is time for the Eater's Revolt, the Foodie's Crusade. Away with
pre-packed meat, with bruised fruit in dear little plastic baskets, with
supermarket fish that last saw the sea a year ago, with vegetables
'garden-fresh' and 'morning-gathered' and old as time, with prepared meals
whose chief merit lies in the caprices of description on the packet. To hell
with airport catering; with fake Indian, Thai, Chinese, Italian dishes in
the supermarket that taste of salt, garlic and flour; with 'instant noodles'
and 'soup' in a plastic cup that require just hot water - and dead
taste-buds. To the devil with any fish served 'in delicious breadcrumbs'
that are a carapace of cheap paste over the world's smallest piece of
plaice. And to perdition with hotels and restaurants - and some pretty grand
establishments at that - which care more for words on the menu than deeds in
the kitchen.
In one such expensive hell-hole I was recently served lukewarm fish with a
garnish of chilly vegetables. (I was a guest and couldn't make a fuss.) In a
pretentious Edinburgh hotel last month a request for 'the green salad'
brought a confection of parboiled leeks, beans and exhausted vegetation, and
the 'vegetable risotto' was most notable for chunks of raw-ish aubergine. A
protest brought the remark: 'I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it' and the bill.
Is there any real remedy for this situation - for the culinary
pretentiousness, for the inadequacy of ingredients? We make the best protest
with our purses, avoiding the offenders. (I have a satisfying private
campaign, black-mouthing certain restaurants to anyone who will listen.) We
must complain at the time, and since this will usually have no effect, we
may even lose our tempers - very un-English, save in traffic jams. Not that
this will do any good either, but it relieves the feelings.
I record that a few months ago I went with foodie friends to a new roof-top
'bistro' in London. (The difference between the service in a French bistro -
fast, efficient, knowledgeable - and the willowy and bemused youths taking
our order was cause enough for alarm.) We were not allowed to arrive until
8.15 - 'we like to stagger the seating to provide better service' - and a
40-minute wait between courses was explained by the fact that 'we think our
customers enjoy talking'. And the food was boring. We must never forget,
though, that in Britain the customer is always wrong.
Egon Ronay has done marvels with his food guides, and Gault et Millau in
France are tremendously avenging angels when the occasion demands it. What
we really need now is The Bad Food Guide to list shops, chefs, restaurants,
fast-food outlets, supermarket chains, pubs and hotels. Alas, it would run
to as many pages as the OED. But we must fight back at the purveyors of
junk. Foodies, unite] We have nothing to lose but our stomachs, and they
have already been undermined.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Misleading picture of UK investment
during recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor WYNNE GODLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The statement in the Lex column ('UK economy', August 1) that
(corporate investment) 'held up unusually well during the recession' is not
correct and the Bank of England chart apparently supporting it is
misleading. That the ratio of corporate investment to gross domestic product
has any appearance of being 'much higher than in the early 1980s' is due
entirely to the fact that the sector now comprises privatised industries
which were previously nationalised. If allowance is made for the changing
classification frontier, fixed investment fell about 20 per cent between its
peak in 1989 and its trough in 1993 - a far larger fall than in previous
recessions. There is no sign yet of any significant recovery.
Unless it is recognised how much investment has fallen, it may be forgotten
how much consumption has risen and hence why increased taxation will be
needed.

<TEXT>
Sir, Does Mr Richard Stead (Letters, July 27) feed his two horses coal? Do
they drink petroleum and breathe natural gas? The carbon dioxide that upsets
the balance of the atmosphere is from fossil carbon that has been out of the
atmosphere for millions of years. The carbon dioxide his horses exhale is
just returning to the atmosphere carbon extracted from it by growing hay and
grain only a few months earlier. Before Mr Stead disparages 'ecologists'
concerned about climate change, he had better learn some ecology.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wm Low advisers served shareholder
interests well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER STEVENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Lex column Tesco/Wm Low (August 4) surely misses the point - in
encouraging advisers to think of their reputations rather than of the best
interests of their clients.
Tesco's original offer (one Tesco share for each Wm Low share) was put
forward after two quite separate bouts of negotiation, and was judged likely
to be the best available now - in the absence of a competing offer.
The Wm Low directors could see, sadly, that one Tesco share was a better
investment, both short-term and long-term, than one Wm Low share. It would
have been irresponsible, although tempting, to deny shareholders that
opportunity - which was only available if recommended by the Wm Low board.
Wm Low and its advisers also correctly judged that, with no strategic stakes
pledged to Tesco, there was plenty of time for the other obvious candidates
to come forward. Sounding these out privately was not the right course of
action, as Wm Low's chairman has already made clear.
We were well served by advisers who had the courage and good sense to
anticipate but disregard possible adverse comment over recommending this
offer - and to concentrate on shareholders' best interests, rather than on a
macho concept of merchant banking behaviour which sometimes interferes with
such transactions.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Arts: Fringe benefits at Edinburgh - As the Festival opens
Antony Thorncroft examines the diversification of the world's biggest
cultural party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week they arrive in Edinburgh from every corner of the globe - the
wannabe army, over 10,000 strong. They are the performers of the Fringe, the
largest festival in the world, which opens next Sunday alongside the
International Arts Festival to make Edinburgh, for three weeks, the cultural
junkies' Nirvana.
The Fringe has one inestimable advantage over other arts institutions - it
is totally non-exclusive. Anyone, can come to the party. Hilary Strong, who
took over in May as director, has no plans to close the door. 'We will
continue the policy of a free and open Festival. It is unique and
significant, especially these days when small-scale arts companies are
finding it much harder to get their work seen. Here anyone can do what they
like'.
Strong speaks from experience. She was a member of Natural Theatre Company
and played the Assembly Rooms. They lost money but it gave the company
exposure and the chance to perfect a show which could then go on tour.
But she is also well aware that the problem with an open market is that the
powerful oppress the weak. She tries to bolster artists by telling them this
is really a buyer's market. She has alerted them to the landlord who hoped
to make Pounds 2,400 during the Festival by cramming 15 artists into a two
bedroom flat, and she urges them to refuse to pay the venues that want
Pounds 500 a week months in advance.
But while the Fringe Office can warn and advise the hopefuls from 40
countries - from Omid Djalili, a half Slovak, half Iranian stand-up
comedian, to a troupe of Egyptian actors performing a play written by
'Egypt's answer to Andrew Neil' - it can do little about the growing ability
of a few well-placed and well-financed venues to dominate the Fringe.
Last year half the 625,000 tickets sold on the Fringe were for shows at just
three of the 200 venues - the Assembly Rooms, the Gilded Balloon and the
Pleasance. These centrally located complexes with a myriad of stages have,
thanks to generous sponsorship by Stella Artois, pooled their marketing
efforts and established a super-Fringe. They divide up the top performers
between them and offer the punters a choice of big-name artists in agreeable
surroundings.
The main complaint about the big three is that they devise their programmes:
there is no pretence of an open house for aspiring newcomers. The three
directors get together and apportion the talent. Bill Burdett-Coutts at the
Assembly Rooms, which fills almost a fifth of all Fringe seats, goes for an
equal split between comedians and theatre groups; Karen Korn at the Gilded
Balloon favours young and aspiring comics; while Christopher Richardson at
the Pleasance blends new theatre troupes with comedians.
The over-riding characteristic of their performers is experience. The
Assembly Rooms has Mark Lamarr, Jools Holland and Lee Evans, plus theatre
companies Hull Truck and 7:84; at the Pleasance it's Frank Skinner, Harry
Hill and Tony Hawks; at the Gilded Balloon, Sean Hughes and Hatty Hayridge -
seasoned television performers all.
Often the same artists appear at the same venue year after year. Their
reputations secure good ticket sales, and the artists and the venue operator
happily share out a 60-40 box office split. Less happy are the artists who
had been hoping to get into one of the venues and who find, at the last
minute, they are excluded.
Rival Edinburgh operators see the big three establishing a premier division,
leaving the other venues missing out on audiences who think that big means
best. The reaction of the competition is - to do the same. This year
Edinburgh Venue Associates has grouped together three medium sized venues,
Church Hill, Hill Street and Greyfriars Kirkhouse, into a rival marketing
operation, but one offering flexible deals to artists. Next year more venues
could join in.
Strong is all in favour of the Fringe working in closer harmony. 'If someone
comes up to see musicals it is sensible if the venues presenting a musical
provide information directing audiences to similar shows.'
Burdett-Coutts denies that joint planning with the Gilded Balloon and the
Pleasance leads to a cosy oligarchy and keeps out aspiring artists. 'I'm
always looking for new talent. This year there's an American comedian,
Robert Schimmel, that no one here has heard of. With 300 applications for 50
places there must be some selection. People do try and buy their way into
the Assembly Rooms but what is the point if they fail to sell any tickets?
It would be a bad investment.'
Burdett-Coutts also thinks that another complaint about the Fringe - that it
has become one vast comedy festival - is also an exaggeration. He maintains
a balance between the stand ups and the dramas. Strong says there is less
comedy this year, just 167 acts describing themselves this way as against
209 in 1993. Perhaps market forces are at work: the average audience at a
Fringe performance last year was an all-time low of 44 per cent.
But if audiences are fed up with navel-gazing monologues from stand-ups,
Edinburgh is still the main showcase for comedy and a happy hunting ground
for TV producers, agents, and venue operators. About 10 years ago Channel
Four decided that comedy was the next rock and roll and that Edinburgh was
the talent pool. Since then a generation of alternative comedians has
quickly become the mainstream. 'It is the biggest comedy festival in the
world,' says John Thoday of Avalon, which manages such Fringe regulars as
Frank Skinner, Harry Hill, Richard Herring and Jenny Eclair. 'It is much
better than the Montreal Comedy Festival where television has editorial
control.'
A perfect example of the Fringe effect is Harry Hill. He gave up doctoring
about four years ago to chance his arm as a comedian. He booked himself into
a small, remote Edinburgh venue and caused a few gentle ripples. A year
later there were waves. Now he is the next big name, with a radio series
under his belt and television beckoning.
The glory of stand-up is its economy - no sets, no payroll. For less than
Pounds 500 you can tackle Edinburgh: that will cover the rent on a cheap
(shared) room (Pounds 50), a midday spot in an off-centre venue (Pounds
150), a little promotion and living costs. If you are good, word seeps out.
Frank Skinner, Sean Hughes, Lee Evans all quickly made it through the
Fringe, although it helped that they won the annual Perrier Award for best
comedy act, which virtually guarantees a television series.
Tim Hawkins of Edinburgh Venue Associates is making things even easier for
one group of debutants. He is giving the four young comedians in 'New Kids
on the Block' a free spot at Hill Street and paying their accommodation. He
thinks they will be so successful that he will make money from the box
office split.
Just now the Fringe is a happy balance: it retains its anarchic freedom at
one level while being a serious commercial operation, contributing well over
Pounds 10m to the Edinburgh economy, at the other. There is room for Alex
and Rod's 'improvisational drinking workshop' and for In one take, a show
about pornography, sado-masochism and Aids. There is a Ukranian company
putting on one of eight Shakespeare productions (a record low) at the
Infirmary Street Swimming Pool and Ian Saville, socialist conjurer. There
are no-hopers who will play to empty benches and Eartha Kitt interpreting
Molly Bloom to a packed Church Hill Theatre. There is everything you have
ever dreamed about and ever feared. And those who complain most that the
Fringe is now too big, that it has sold out to television, that it is just
wall to wall comedy, will still be back next year.

PESARO
The annual Rossini festival in this exquisite walled town on the Adriatic
opens on Thursday with a new production of L'Italiana in Algeri. Roger
Norrington makes his Pesaro debut conducting a revival of Semiramide, and
Graham Vick joins forces with Carlo Rizzi for a staging of L'inganno felice,
the only rarity this year.
EDINBURGH
After winning an international reputation overseas, the Scottish conductor
Donald Runnicles returns home to open this year's festival with a
performance of Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony. The Edinburgh Festival
Theatre has at last become a reality and the festival is celebrating with
two wildly contrasting composers of the year, Beethoven and Chabrier.
SCOTALAND: NATIONAL GALLERY
'Monet to Matisse: Landscape Painting in France, 1874-1914' opens at the
National Gallery of Scotland on Thursday. This is one of the most ambitious
exhibitions mounted by the Gallery, ranging from the famous to lesser known
artists like Devambex, who took advantage of the bi-plane to produce one of
the first aerial paintings of the countryside.
INNSBRUCK
Best known as a ski centre, this Austrian town is developing a parallel
reputation for its summer baroque and early music festival which takes place
in region's historic buildings. This year's festival, opening on Sunday,
celebrates the 350th anniversary of Heinrich Biber, the 17th century
Bohemian composer who worked in Salzburg.
LONDON THEATRE
Opening at the Greenwhich Theatre on Monday is the recent New York hit The
Sisters Rosenweig, by Wendy Wasserstein. This British production, directed
by Michael Blakemore, stars Maureen Lipman, Janet Suzman and Lynda
Bellingham.
BRECON JAZZ
The beard and beret set head for the hills at the weekend for Brecon Jazz,
the most convivial of music festivals. Benny Carter and Slide Hampton are
the main attractions, but there's plenty of atmosphere in the side streets
and smaller venues of the Welsh market town

If you have been following BBC1's repeat of the late Dennis Potter's
splendid serial/musical/thriller The Singing Detective then you will want to
catch the penultimate episode at 10.15. Earlier, on the same channel, there
are two visits to Helsinki for European Athletics (6.20 and 8.30). Otherwise
radio promises a better evening. In BBC Proms 94 the BBC Philharmonic plays
pieces by Faure and Ravel and then Sibelius's Symphony No 1 (Radio 3 7.30).
In 'The Monday Play', Angel Standing by Jonathan Myerson, Timothy West plays
an academic who finds himself with a PhD student who is researching her
thesis on sexuality by working as a prostitute (7.45 Radio 4). A new series,
The Miles Kington Interview, begins with the 16th century seer Nostradamus,
played by Robert Stephens, telling of his passion for fruit preserving . . .
(9.15 Radio 4). Then, at 10.45, in a new Book At Bedtime, Anna Massey gives
the first in a 10-part reading of The Pursuit Of Love. Nancy Mitford's
funniest book is about the mores and morals of the country house set in the
1930s (10.45 Radio 4).

FT  08 AUG 94 / Arts: Lost in the heart of America - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bush has done it again: the theatre's combination of superlative acting
and tight directing can make a new play seem much better than it is. This
time, however, it is a close-run thing. Naomi Wallace is an immensely
promising dramatist. Only when you measure the standard of the acting
against the play itself do some of the deficiencies become apparent.
The problem, and it is a laudable one, is over-ambition. Even the title is
portentous. In the Heart of America plays with so many ideas that it is hard
to know which is paramount, and there is just the suspicion that it is a
trifle trendy.
First there is homosexual love between soldiers (very topical). Then there
is ethnic stress in the US - unusual in this case because the minority group
is Palestinian Arab-American. Not least, there is the suggestion that some
Americans treat all US military interventions abroad as much the same -
Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the Gulf - and cannot even remember which
president sent them in: 'Johnson or Bush, whatever the hell his name is.'
This last theme would make a play on its own. There is a marvellously drawn
character called Boxler, played with matching dexterity by Robert Glenister,
for whom war has become a way of life: 'It's the only place that feels like
home.' Boxler doesn't want a war where the US has to fight with one hand
tied behind its back, as was said of Vietnam. He wants an operation called
'just because'.
Boxler, however, is not quite central to the play. The most arresting scenes
are between a couple of Americans who go off to the Gulf together, One is
conventionally white; the other is a Palestinian American who doesn't speak
Arabic and doesn't want to learn. They have a fascination with technology;
'Our first kiss was like seeing an aircraft take off vertically'. These male
lovers are quite beautifully played by Richard Dormer and Zubin Varla
respectively. Again here is a drama in itself.
I have doubts about some of the rest of it. Ms Wallace is better at male
characters than female. There is a ghost-like woman from Hanoi - a senior
commander of the Viet Cong, she says - who appears (perhaps unintentionally)
to look back on the American bombing with nostalgia. It is well played, but
doesn't quite fit. And the second act is little too like a repetition of the
first.
Dominic Dromgoole directs with what one might call military precision, if
the military were more precise.
Bush Theatre (081) 743 3388.

FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Chisholm stays the course - Names in the News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Out-bellowing the pugnacious former editor of The Sun newspaper takes
practice. The harsh world of Australian commercial television is obviously
not a bad place to start, writes Katharine Campbell.
For that is the background of Sam Chisholm, the straight-talking chief
executive of BSkyB, and the man to whom Kelvin MacKenzie reported for the
seven short months he passed in the world of TV before he stormed out last
week.
A diminutive New Zealander, whose energy levels belie his 54 years, Chisholm
has become one of the most trusted lieutenants of BSkyB's largest
shareholder Rupert Murdoch. He is abrasive, he is cunning - and he shuns the
press almost obsessively.
Brought up in Auckland, Chisholm left school to work on the family farm.
Via a spell peddling floor polish, he arrived, aged 25, at Australia's
largest commercial TV station, Channel Nine. Initially selling air space, he
rose to the top, and ran the network for 15 years.
For the bulk of Chisholm's time, his master was Kerry Packer, whose father
Sir Frank had founded the station in 1956. With a mix of heavily
American-influenced sport, news, and games shows, the channel flourished
under Chisholm's baton, so much so that in 1987 Packer was able to wring
more than ADollars 1bn from Alan Bond for its sale.
Just three years later, Packer was back at the helm, having paid the
hard-pressed Bond a mere ADollars 200m. But Chisholm was by now too closely
identified with high-rolling times at what had become known as the Bollinger
channel.
Shortly after the resale, a third Australian media mogul walked into
Chisholm's path, and he accepted an offer from Murdoch to run Sky.
Moving to London in the autumn of 1990, Chisholm was by November in charge
of the merged BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a significant stake - and embarking on what at the time seemed
the hopeless task of reversing the ailing fortunes of the satellite
broadcaster.
His perseverance was rewarded last December with a seat on the board of News
Corporation, and responsibility for the company's broadcasting interests
outside the US.
With MacKenzie installed as managing director shortly thereafter, Chisholm
had been expected to distance himself from the daily management issues in
London. But while he spent a proportion of his time this year in Hong Kong
with Murdoch's newly acquired Star TV, that shift had yet to take place.

FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Cyanamid's quiet Costello - Names in the News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Albert Costello sounded terse last week about someone wanting to take
over his company, it's not surprising, writes Richard Waters.
The chairman and chief executive of American Cyanamid has won plaudits from
Wall Street for giving the company a new sense of direction in the 18 months
he has been at the helm.
His move to spin off Cyanamid's chemicals operations and add to its
profitable crops business had helped lift the share price by 50 per cent in
recent months.
Last week, though, American Home Products offered half as much again to buy
the company.
Costello looks a company man through and through. Trained as a chemist, he
has worked at Cyanamid since 1957 and rose through the ranks to head the
agricultural products side of the company before being named president in
1990. On the way, he ran Cyanamid's Spanish operations and worked in Mexico.
Costello's curt initial response to last week's bid was a statement that his
board was reviewing 'a number of strategic options.' In the US takeover
market these days, where directors tread warily for fear of lawsuits from
their shareholders, that amounts to putting up a sign that you do not want
to be bought.
Unfortunately for Costello, though, few doubt that, with such a premium
being offered, his company will fall to Home Products, if not some other
bidder.

FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Leahy flies higher at Airbus Industrie - Names in
the News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Industrie has appointed an American to head its commercial activities
at a time when the European aircraft manufacturing consortium is seeking to
increase its market share at the expense of its bigger US rival Boeing,
writes Paul Betts.
The appointment of John Leahy as the European consortium's new senior
vice-president commercial also reflects the gradual transformation of Airbus
into a more commercially driven enterprise.
'It is a sign of a certain maturity in the 20 year old Airbus system,' said
a senior Airbus executive. 'It shows that senior jobs are not awarded on the
basis of an individual's passport and you don't have to be a national of one
of the four European partner countries to be appointed to a top job at
Airbus,' he added.
Although Leahy is the second American to be appointed to the top sales job
at Airbus, senior vice president positions have in the past tended to
reflect a delicate balance of the four Airbus partner countries - France,
Germany, the UK and Spain.
Leahy is replacing Charles Masefield, a British Aerospace executive who took
over the top Airbus commercial position only five months ago.
Masefield is stepping down following his nomination as the next head of the
UK Government Defence Sales Export Organisation.
Leahy is described by colleagues as a 'street fighter' who has come up the
ranks at Airbus.
He joined the European consortium from Piper Aircraft in 1985 as marketing
director of the group's North American division. The 44-year-old
Leahy became president of the North American division in 1992.

FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Prime of life at Premier Oil / Roland Shaw on
financial muscle, life - and his future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The removers will be hard at work in Belgravia this week clearing out 25
years of detritus from the office of Roland Shaw, the freshly ousted
chairman of Premier Consolidated Oilfields.
Out will go the yellowing maps of oil pipelines, the photographs of the
bulky ex-occupant shaking hands to clinch a deal, the boxes full of his
angry correspondence with newspapers, the model of his great dane.
The man himself left hastily last week, having been given a week to leave by
the board. His belongings have been allowed an extra fortnight to vacate the
building behind Victoria station they have occupied for so long.
Among the memorabilia is a folder of letters received last week from fellow
oil men lamenting the end of an era. Roland Shaw was always in a class of
his own.
Bigger, noisier, and brasher than everyone else, he stood out from the start
in an industry composed of faceless individuals from the oil majors or
bankers and accountants that used to run the oil independents.
When he arrived in what he calls 'London comma England' from Dallas in the
1960s he fitted the stereotype of what an oil magnate ought to be.
Shaw may have started life as a diplomat, but by the time he gravitated to
the oil industry he was a loud-mouthed deal maker, with a whisky glass
always to hand.
On Shaw's last full day in the office, he sat behind his big desk quite his
usual self. 'Come before lunch. I'll make more sense then,' he had promised.
He greeted me with his normal reprimand about my supposedly misleading
reporting in the Financial Times, and then waved a sheaf of yellow paper on
which he had written down all the important points he wished to get across
during the interview.
He made it clear that he had been kicked out, yet for someone who has never
minced a word in his life, was uncharacteristically short on explanation.
Equally unspecific, Charles Jamieson, the chief executive, later talked in
cliches about there 'coming a time when everyone feels it is time to move
on'. What he meant, but was too gentlemanly to say, was that there comes a
time when companies have to get rid of their domineering founders.
The first break was in 1992 when the board stripped Shaw of his executive
position. The new non-executive role suited neither him nor his colleagues:
the man who had built up the company almost from scratch to a company that
at the peak of the oil market was worth Pounds 500m, could not resist
interfering.
'The thought of Roland Shaw as a non-executive was always a joke,' says a
former colleague. 'He is one of those impossible characters in terms of
having his own way. If you don't agree with him he threatens to take his
ball home'.
Shaw admits the arrangement did not work: 'I haven't found it easy over the
last couple of years to sit back. I have kept the board advised over my
views, but different people have different concepts of how it should be run,
and the board asked me to step down.'
Age was one reason for his departure. The City is increasingly opposed to
senior citizens on the board, and was quite unmoved by Shaw's cheeky
protests that at 72 he was nearly 20 years younger than the great Armand
Hammer when he stepped aside as chief executive at Occidental.
'I don't like this ageism,' he says. 'I was 62 when I bought the stake in
Wytch Farm (Britain's biggest onshore oilfield). I was 64 when I bought the
Burmah stake. If you had knocked me out at 60 the company would still be
worth Pounds 20m'.
Even those people who found Shaw intolerable as a boss, agree that the
company was built on his irresistable charm, and iron will.
Premier has barely ever discovered any of the blackstuff itself, but had
grown through the determination and shrewd dealmaking of its boss. According
to Julian West, head of corporate development at Enterprise Oil, Shaw made
the company by 'insisting there should be one'.
It is his personality to which Premier owes its independence. When fellow
independent Carless Capel Leonard bid for the company in 1984, shareholders
decided overwhelmingly to stay with Shaw, and the company has been more or
less left alone ever since.
But in the past six years - since the fall in the oil price - there has been
less place for the original oil man. Shaw still believes that the role of an
exploration and production company is to live on its wits, getting licences
and doing deals.
But the market no longer agrees; indeed the few smaller independents that
thrived recently have been financial vehicles rather than real oil companies
of Shaw's variety.
Shaw's individuality makes him a disaster as a corporate man. He speaks with
longing of the early days when 'you didn't have to worry about gobbledegook
of large companies'. With him gone, it can only be a matter of time before
Premier hires its first 'human resources officer'  - Shaw can hardly bring
himself to say the words - or starts a house magazine.
Turning to his list of serious beefs, Shaw's first target was the City, and
its tendency to look at independent oil companies as if they were building
societies.
'People in the City are like children,' he says. 'They have a seven-year
memory. When something goes wrong they flex their muscles and take a
decision. After a while the muscles go flabby and they forget'. He handed me
a copy of a recent speech given to oil analysts entitled: 'How with a little
bit of help, I lost Pounds 350m in the Independent Oil Game'.
It was vintage Shaw - an uproarious account of Premier's worst moments.
'When the whore-house burns down the pretty ones run out with the ugly,' was
how Shaw explained that a precipitous plunge in the share price over the
past few years was not unique to Premier.
The analysts - whom Shaw dismissively describes as 'very young and have been
to business school' - took notes throughout, mindlessly writing down even a
bawdy joke about the refurbished urinals at the Garrick club.
Shaw bemoans the new homogeneity of business and City folk. The problem, he
says, is all the 'institutions, rules and regulations which are clogging the
veins'.
In particular he thinks the new corporate governance rules are a waste of
time: 'Clever crooks will still run away with the money no matter what'.
The business world has probably not heard the last of Roland Shaw, and
neither have the Premier management. 'I am free to do other things.' Shaw
remains chairman of Heritage Oil and Gas. 'I am also going to take a good
look to see if there is anything to do to help other shareholders in this
company.'
Was that a veiled threat? He says no. It was 'a sincere indication that I
have a large stake, and if I have any bright thoughts I will pass them on'.
This was Roland Shaw talking big. He tirelessly refers to his millions of
Premier shares and share options, but he does not mention that these amount
to barely 1 per cent of the company.
With his Premier days over, Shaw will have all the more time to get angry
about what he reads in the papers. He claims he is not as irascible as he
used to be. But the day when Roland Shaw stands up in public heartily
approving of some new trend, then an era really will have come to an end.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Architecture: Palladio attracts pilgrims - The influence of
an oddly neglected Venetian genius
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY

<DATELINE>
   I am always incredibly moved by the works of Andrea Palladio
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
I think it must be because you know that you are in the presence of
perfection. At this time of the year Italy beckons to anyone interested in
architecture and it is as good a time as any for a Palladian pilgrimage.
Palladio was born in Padua in 1508 and he died in Venice in 1580. His career
spans the whole period of the High Renaissance but somehow throughout his
working life he retained a rare humility and did not enjoy the kind of fame
that was received by the great Renaissance architects Michelangelo and
Bramante. You only have to visit the Veneto and read a little about his life
to realise why. He never trained as an architect but learnt first the skills
of a stonemason. It is an astonishing career - rising up from the solid
foundations of the workshop to become the leading architect of Venice. His
work was regionally based, confined to the north of Italy - mainly in Venice
and around Vicenza. He built palaces and great churches as well as villas.
It took time for the young architect to become accepted and his gradual rise
follows the acceptance of Renaissance classicism as the style of the day. In
Vicenza you can see the classical style creeping up on the gothic. It may
just be some Corinthian columns on a gothic loggia but gradually full
bloodied classicism arrives. Look at the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza which
Palladio gradually modified in the 1540's. In its inner atrium are the
familiar Palladian vaults and on the upper storey the composite pilasters,
balustrade and cornice are the first signs of a typical Palladian design.
At the beginning of the sixteenth century the Venetians faced a severe
collapse in their fortunes through war against their trading empire and
papal interdict. Rich Venetians looked for ways of multiplying their wealth
by investing outside the city. As the century progressed, agriculture and
land were the preferred investments over trade and it was this that marked
the beginning of the growth of the villas of the Veneto. It was luck that
the right architect was around to design these villas and to define them as
one of greatest contributions to Western civilisation. There was also
interest in the idea of a civilised country life and a humanist fascination
with the conjunction of arts and agriculture. The Palladian villa was born.
Palladio's influence in this area is so great that it continues to influence
the country house and a particular ideal of life in the country. At the
Villa Gazzotti Marcello Curti, at Betesina near Vicenza, Palladio stuck a
classical facade onto the front of a brick box. It was the first use of
temple pediment and in its use of brick and sandstone represents the early
essence of the Palladian style. It was also an early villa where the farm
was at the centre of things and the granary was likely to be in the roof of
the villa itself.
The Villa Saraceno at Finale near Vicenza is a near-perfect example of the
genre just restored by the British charity, the Landmark Trust. It still has
some of its farmland and is an example of a house built by someone in the
1540s who did not have a great deal of spare money to spend on the facade.
Its austerity is, to my eyes, magical. The frescoed rooms remain and to
stand in the painted portico is to experience an understanding of the nature
of arcadian life and art. As the Landmark Trust lets the villa for holidays,
this experience is now available to any one wanting a 'Landmark holiday.'
It is important not to miss the Basilica in Vicenza where Palladio underwent
a crucial architectural test. In 1546 the city fathers decided
democratically to complete the arcades of the city's palace. But Palladio
did not get the job that easily. A trial bay of the arcades was built on the
site in the form of a full-size wooden model. The city had a chance to look
and to criticise the scheme before there was any hope of it going ahead. No
modern architect ever has to undergo such a rigorous process of approval
today. The end result is one of the finest civic buildings in Europe. Proof
of the wisdom of popular taste?
Once you have seen Vicenza and all the villas of the Veneto, it is time to
leave terra firma and cross to Venice. Here the Palladian masterpieces are
churches. If you stand by the Punta della Dogana, better known as the Old
Custom House, at the entrance to the Grand Canal you see one of the finest
architectural panoramas in the world. Along with the glories of the Doge's
Palace and the Library of San Marco, there stands San Giorgio Maggiore and
to the west the church of the Redentore. Both of these are by Palladio and
both are calm masterpieces.
Inside, both of these gloriously composed buildings are austerely beautiful.
The interiors are cool, grey and white. Their limpid beauty lit by the
reflected light from the canals of Venice is something no one ever forgets.
Palladio has recently been thoroughly examined in a brilliant new book that
should be read before undertaking any tour. Palladio, The Architect in his
Time by Bruce Boucher is published by Abbeville Press and John Murray.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Format war may threaten videoconference
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears are growing that arguments over standards could plunge the
videoconferencing industry into the sort of battle that raged over VHS and
Betamax video formats.
Videoconferencing equipment once cost Pounds 40,000 or more, limiting its
use to multinationals able to afford studio suites and technical backup.
Now, for about Pounds 3,000, a miniature video camera and specialised
hardware and software can be added to a conventional personal computer to
create a desktop conferencing system.
The result is that large companies are showing interest. In the UK,
International Business Machines, ICL and Olivetti are providing the machines
for British Telecom's extensive trials.
Mr Ian Henley, business development manager for the videoconferencing
division of Softwright Systems, feels, however, that the the industry is
threatening to fragment into self-interested groups.
Softwright is a small Berkshire-based systems house which developed key
elements of the software used by BT and IBM in their videoconferencing
systems.
Mr Henley's fears have been intensified by Intel, the world's largest
semiconductor company, which this year launched a raft of videoconferencing
products complying with its proprietary 'Indeo' (Intel Video) standard.
It also announced the establishment of an industry consortium to lay down
personal videoconferencing standards. The consortium includes AT&amp;T, Northern
Telecom, Compaq and Picturetel.
Mr Henley says that an industry consortium already exists, the curiously
named MCCOI (Multimedia Communications Community of Interest) supporting
existing standards covering the key technologies used in video conferencing
systems - video and data conferencing (known technically as H320) and
multipoint data conferencing (T120).
About 72 companies support MCCOI including Apple, BT, IBM and Siemens. Mr
Henley asks: 'Intel's actions could be interpreted as an attempt to wrestle
proprietary control of the desktop video market away from H320. Could they
really be about to launch another VHS/Betamax battle just when the
acceptance of H320 seems to have removed one of the last hurdles to
progress?'
Intel replies that it will support both Indeo and the MCCOI standards,
arguing that Indeo products - which cost about half as much as H320 standard
systems - are better suited to the price sensitive personal computer market.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Media Futures: I've read the future and it spins - Reference
works are blooming on CD-Rom but not yet the novel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The secondhand bookshop Marks &amp; Co at 84 Charing Cross Road, made famous by
a play about its correspondence with the American writer Helene Hanff, is
now the Compact Disc Centre.
Inside, a sign over a staircase and a glass cabinet with paperbacks of Ms
Hanff's works are the only traces of its former occupancy. TV screens
showing Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex (Laser Disc version) and Star Trek VI: The
Undiscovered Country (CD-i version) compete for the browser's attention in
that distracting environment common to electronic emporia everywhere.
The former bookshop symbolises the fate which jeremiahs insist has overtaken
paper-based publishing: classical literary values overrun by barbaric
commercialism, battered by a tsunami of electronic products.
Changes in sales patterns, new marketplace relationships, and cost-cutting
technologies are transforming publishing as the Gatling gun transformed
warfare. Computer, telephone, TV, and video appear to be interacting so
quickly that even manufacturers are unsure what to produce next.
Against this background, the home computer - thanks to Sonic the Hedgehog,
the Brooklyn plumber Super Mario, and others - is vying for television's
crown as primary home entertainment format. Publishers seeking to broaden
their media base have to board the computer bandwagon.
CD-Rom is tipped to be tomorrow's dominant publishing medium: compact discs
that can store video images, text, and stereo sound. Reference works,
atlases, cookbooks, and family health manuals have been quickly adapted
during the past few years, becoming staple CD-Rom fare. The 'reader', by
clicking a mouse, can explore a vast network of text and moving images.
Sales figures suggest that more encyclopedias are now sold on CD-Rom than in
book form.
Yet the fact is that the wider creative possibilities are so poorly
understood that unprecedented creative alliances of artists and technicians
will have to be forged before the medium can come of age.
A few pioneering entertainment CD-Roms already exist. Peter Gabriel's
interactive music CD-Rom Xplora1 led the way, and David Bowie has followed
suit recently with Jump, a disc incorporating interview clips, music video,
point-and-click elements galore, and even the option to remix a song.
The way forward for literature and popular fiction (or hyperfiction) on
CD-Rom is much harder to see.
Andromeda Interactive's Classic Library contains the complete works of
Shakespeare, Chaucer, Jane Austen, Dickens, Poe and Melville, and W. B.
Yeats, but such a disc full of words is useful chiefly as a study tool which
allows swifter word-searches than paper versions.
Real multimedia products are much rarer than text-dumped-to-CD offerings. A
notable exception which may be a premonition of future products is
HarperCollins-Nimbus' The Bronte Sisters. This CD-Rom includes sketches,
poems, essays, diary entries and biographies of the sisters, alongside
photos of 60 Bronte museum treasures from the Howarth Parsonage. The reader
can summon an image of the desk the sisters wrote at or the bridal veil worn
by Charlotte next to diary entries or passages from the novels which relate
to those items.
A chief obstacle to the CD-Rom and multimedia revolution is that, as an
Anglo-American wit has observed, 'Before I can get on to the information
superhighway I need to get off my driveway.'
Youngsters adapt to the new media at primary school, but many adults are
technophobes. The jungle of products and lack of standardisation are
bewildering and discouraging.
Kanwal Sharma, marketing manager for new media for Apple Computer UK, admits
that while CD-Rom and multimedia have been around for two or three years
'the information flow seems to have stopped with the technology producers.'
Too few people in local markets own CD-Rom equipment at the moment to make
such publishing viable unless on a global scale.
The London market's darling, Dorling Kindersley, proves the point.
A publisher of high quality illustrated books, with an extensive
information-based backlist, Dorling Kindersley has a foreign co-editions
network already in place.
Without such a network, the market for this technology is too small at
present in the UK, or in any single country, for publishers to make a
sizeable profit, although consumer adoption of CD-Rom is strongest in North
America.
It is hard nevertheless to escape the conclusion that if Shakespeare were
alive today, he'd be looking for ways to work on CD-Rom.
Another point in CD-Rom's favour is that discs can be mass-produced very
cheaply. Paper-based production costs are astronomical by comparison.
Yet books remain the favoured currency in 1990s publishing, defying their
electronic rivals. Here too, there have been enormous changes. Paperback
sales now routinely take precedence over hardcover, while wholesalers and
retailers increasingly influence what finds its way into print.
W. H. Smith, whose stores account for one third of UK fiction sales, is so
confident in its knowledge of its consumers' tastes that it has taken the
driving seat to steer the publishing process in the direction the company
chooses with its Fresh Talent programme, now in its second year.
'The object,' says Graham Edmonds, product manager for paperback fiction,
'is to bring a good deal for new writers'.
W. H. Smith asks the main paperback publishers for recommendations, a team
of seven people reads manuscripts from suggested authors, and if they are
unanimously enthusiastic, the work appears under the Fresh Talent banner.
Penguin, Black Swan, Signet, Corgi and Hodder Headline are the participating
publishers for 1994.
Reports of the death of the book, in brief, are much exaggerated.
Paper-based reading may not be the chief hallmark of an intellectually
active person much longer, and CD-Rom will find its Shakespeare sooner or
later, but it is certainly too soon to be consigning the work of Helene
Hanff to glass cabinets.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Managers who fear the office technology gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: senior executive. Must have above average management skills and
perform competently in front of the television cameras
New technologies, such as electronic mail and video conferencing, can bring
dramatic improvements to an organisation's internal communications - at a
price.
Problems include middle managers feeling they are being undermined, as
senior managers communicate directly with all employees, and tensions
arising from a generation gap between technologically illiterate managers
and computer literate staff.
These are among the findings of a study by Smythe Dorward Lambert, a
London-based consultancy specialising in internal communications. It argues
there is a powerful need for guidelines to ensure that the power of the new
technologies is not abused. 'Areas covered' it says 'should include
frequency, targeting, matching media to audience, building in two-way
response mechanisms, the continuing importance of face-to-face
communications, the right to privacy for employees and the internal security
of information'.
The study says the technologies which will see the greatest increase in use
in the next five years will be electronic mail, personal digital assistants
and video conferencing. Telephone conferencing, seen as a poor substitute
for face-to-face meetings,may disappear with the spread of desk top video
telephones. Voice mail, however, is not proving universally popular: the oil
company Texaco reported that only a few of their staff liked it.
Staff have to be trained to use voice mail as IBM UK discovered: 'We went
too far in removing human contact too quickly' said Mr Nick Temple, the
company's chairman: 'Unless all the workforce is attuned, it becomes an
obstacle'.
The new skills that managers will need will include a good presence on
screen. . They can no longer expect to be shielded from the direct gaze of
their employees because video techniques will increasingly put them in the
spotlight.
Managers with better televisual skills could prosper over colleagues who may
be equally gifted in other aspects of management: 'At least one major
technology company is now recruiting senior managers with televisual skills
as a key competency' Smythe Dorward says.
However, the study concludes that technological push is still driving the
use of communications technology rather than clear business benefits.

<TEXT>
Warning notices are to be posted in mountain blackspots in Scotland telling
holidaymakers and casual walkers how many people have died in the area.
The shock tactic was announced by the Scottish Mountain Safety Group as
rescue teams prepared for their busiest period, when many poorly-equipped
walkers get into trouble.
The signs advise walkers on equipment and precautions they should take
before walking in the hills. On a busy summer day up to 500 people may climb
Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain. Ten people died on Scotland's
mountains and hills last summer.

India's decision to freeze importation of large aircraft by newly-licenced
private airlines will stall the entry of new carriers, aviation industry
officials are warning.
Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, India's civil aviation minister, has told parliament
the government will freeze large aircraft imports because of congested air
corridors and airports. But he says imports of smaller aircraft will be
encouraged.
Thirteen private airlines have snatched 25 per cent of Indian airlines'
passengers by offering better services.

Nearly 10 percent more passengers flew on European air carriers in June than
did in June, 1993, according to the Association of European Airlines.
The AEA says June's traffic was up 9.8 per cent from the same month a year
earlier. It adds that the first six months of this year saw 9 per cent more
passengers than the first half of 1993.
The rise in passengers was ahead of the increase in seats available, which
grew by 5.4 per cent in the first half of this year.
Planes were on average flying 71.6 per cent full.

Northwest Airlines is to end its non-stop daily service between Glasgow and
Boston from October 25. It says it has been losing money because of excess
capacity on transatlantic services from Glasgow and low yields due to
insufficent business passengers.
Northwest's withdrawal after 14 years is the second blow to transatlantic
services from Glasgow within weeks. Last month American Airlines said it
would not operate its daily Chicago service between November and mid-May.
Northwest offers alternative services for Scottish travellers from London
Gatwick and Schiphol, Amsterdam, connecting with Air UK.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Hand in hand with US immigration -
Palm-reading could cut the queues at New York airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regular travellers to New York are developing an interest in palmistry. This
is not a shift to new-age philosophy, but a way of bypassing the queues and
endless form-filling that are part of entering the US.
The US immigration service's Inspass scheme, which identifies passengers by
their palms, is being tried for a year at New York's John F. Kennedy and
Newark airports in conjunction with airlines. British Airways says 4,000
regular passengers have joined the scheme through its frequent-flyer club.
Inspass - which stands for Immigration and Naturalisation Services Passenger
Accelerated Service System - can cut the time to complete immigration
formalities to 20 seconds. The system uses a reader to measure your palm -
each person's is unique - and record the details on a database.
British Airways says the system can cope with subtle changes to your hand by
updating the database each time you place your hand in the reader.
If you travel regularly to New York, it is worthwhile joining the scheme -
particularly as it is free while the system is on trial. To register, find
the Inspass office - there is one at each terminal - where your palm will be
guided into a measuring box and read by biometric technology, which encodes
your details on to a card.
You will also have to fill in a form, with the familiar questions on
drug-dealing, Nazi or spying activities. But once you are a member of the
scheme, that will be the last US immigration form you have to fill out, and
you can use the card on your next trip.
From then on, all you have to do when you arrive in New York is put your
hand in the box and the card through the reader, and key in your flight and
airline details. The computer issues immigration forms and unlocks the gate
into the baggage hall. This does not spare you from the customs officials,
but does allow you to skip the grilling by immigration personnel.
One regular user, Mr Lynwood Bell, a Canadian merchant banker, welcomes the
speed with which the system lets him into the US. But he has some
reservations: 'It's a clumsy system. For example, it doesn't use a swipe
card - you have to put it in a reader and it clunks through. The hand-reader
is awkward too. You have to manoeuvre your fingers around four small posts.'
He is also concerned about the complexity of the system: 'Every time I've
used it, someone has had to be rescued by the agent telling him which button
to push.'
However, he believes the system is a boon for the regular traveller to the
US: 'In spite of its shortcomings, it's a useful improvement on a slow
process.'

'hyenas', private cab drivers puncture rivals' tyres, collude cosily with
the airport authorities and the police, and charge more than double the
going rate.
But as ever in Hungary, there is a kis kapu, a side door, a way around every
problem. To avoid the hyenas, take the airport minibus. Or order a cab run
by Fotaxi, a state-owned company, by going to the Fotaxi desk or phoning
222-2222. Not only will you save Ft1,000 (Dollars 10); you can feel you have
done your bit for the free market.
The rule holds in town. Do not get into unmarked cars. Look for the oval
light and red checks of Fotaxi, or order one. Anyone who can get the better
of Hungarian taxis should coast through the rest of a business trip.
Economic reform started earlier in Hungary than elsewhere in eastern Europe.
The culture and infrastructure of commerce have had longer to develop and
mature. Despite all the frustrations, Budapest works. After all, about half
the direct investment in eastern Europe has gone to Hungary. Budapest, which
is the most populous city in east-central Europe with more than 2m
inhabitants, has regained its pre-communist position as a regional hub.
When it comes to accommodation, for luxury and convenience stay in the new
post-modern Kempinski hotel, in the commercial centre of Pest. For character
and architecture try the art nouveau Gellert on the Buda bank of the Danube.
Buy forints, the local currency, at the hotel. Hard currency is no longer
preferred tender. Those in search of east European adventure and a better
exchange rate can try the grey market. Deal only with the Arab
money-changers, who won't cheat you, on Petofi Sandor utca (street) or in
the Italian restaurant on Regiposta utca.
When you set out on your business appointments, make sure you have a thick
wad of business cards. Hungarians rival the Japanese in their enthusiasm for
the ritual of card-exchanging. Running out is embarrassing and damaging to
credibility.
Be careful how you read a Hungarian's name. The Hungarian style is to put
surname first, familiar name second. Foreigners often get confused, and are
inadvertently over-familiar with senior officials and executives. No matter
how many people are in the room, shake hands with everybody on arriving and
leaving, and on first and subsequent meetings, no matter how awkward it
seems.
It is imperative to ask someone with local knowledge - a consultant,
investment banker or commercial counsellor - to suggest or arrange meetings.
Go to the top, but not necessarily the very top. In many ministries and
Hungarian companies there is a younger English- or German-speaking official
who can tell you far more than his or her boss would.
Business attire is relaxed. Air-conditioning is rare at ministries and local
companies, so it is acceptable to wear short-sleeved shirts in summer.
Hungarians loosen ties and often dispense with them altogether by late
afternoon.
Inviting a business partner to lunch is a good way to establish a more
personal relationship, as it is in the west. The Kempinski, Kacsa and
Szinbad restaurants are safe choices. To impress, opt for the Gundel, a
grand restaurant next to the city zoo, refurbished at great expense by
George Lang.
Western expatriates often grow sick of Hungary's rich cuisine. Suggest
Amadeus or Cyrano, both in the city centre, for something lighter. Alcohol
with a meal is cus-tomary.
Budapest is more than a collection of hotels, ministries and company
headquarters connected by taxi rides. The city has one of the world's most
dramatic urban geographies. The Gellert hill in Buda rises sheer above the
Danube - it looms over the grand boulevards of Pest and the great Hungarian
plain beyond it. Budapest is livelier than pretty Prague, better preserved
than bombed-out Warsaw.
Start a summer evening in the courtyard of Kis Buda Gyongye, which offers
Hungarian food as light - and service as good - as it gets. Then sample the
nightlife, which has a rather raunchy tradition. Edward VII, while Prince of
Wales, was a fan of the notorious turn-of-the-century night clubs.
Nincs Pardon, Crazy Cafe and Paris Texas are among the better bars. The
discos of the moment are Saigon and Mad Block. The Tilos az A is a
three-level club where live bands and DJs vie to play some of the best and
worst music in town. Ring the bell at the Piaf piano bar, and round off the
evening watching drunken actors stumbling against the backdrop of red velvet
decor.
Saturday is no day to sleep in. The thermal baths close at noon. The Gellert
is the most famous, but insiders prefer the Rudas, which dates back to the
Turkish occupation.
Spend the afternoon drinking endless coffee and scoffing pastry in one of
Budapest's cafes, legacies of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The Gerbeaud is
the grandest, but overridden by tourists, so a better choice is the Muvesz,
opposite the neo-Renaissance Opera.
The elegant Cafe Gusto offers an alternative to the usual heart-attack
cakes; it has the best salads in town. Then again, this is Budapest, so
perhaps excess is in order.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Channel Islands dalliance may yield unexpected
offshore rewards - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are going across to the Channel Islands this summer, you could choose
to include among the various diversions on your itinerary, a brief visit to
one of the establishments for which they are famous.
Banks and building societies are ten-a-penny in Guernsey, Jersey and the
Isle of Man. They are the ideal spot for those who enjoy their tax havens to
dally.
The dalliance need not be confined to the wealthy and famous. Anyone with
savings in a UK bank or building society can seriously consider moving their
funds 'offshore', not just for the glamour of it but in pursuit of actual
tangible benefits.
Some of the highest onshore rates are found among postal accounts, but,
depending on the size of your deposit, it is often possible to secure higher
rates offshore.
One of the advantages of investing offshore is that interest is paid gross.
While UK residents are liable to tax on the interest, they have the
flexibility of delaying tax payment by as much as two years, depending on
whether interest is paid early in the tax year. That option effectively
increases the 'advertised' rate of interest. Moreover, many banks and
building societies pay a higher rate offshore than for an equivalent onshore
account.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's instant access onshore Gold Deposit account pays
3.25 per cent gross on Pounds 10,000, while its offshore instant access
Guernsey Gold pays 4.35 per cent gross on the same amount.
The society's London postal account (onshore) pays yearly interest of 5.45
per cent gross on Pounds 100,000 while the monthly interest rate on its
offshore Guernsey Gold account is 5.79 per cent gross.
Similarly, Portman Building Society, which has one of the most competitive
offshore rates, pays 5 per cent gross on Pounds 20,000 on its onshore
instant access account and 6.2 per cent gross on the equivalent amount
offshore.
The highest offshore rates are paid to expatriates.
Leeds Overseas has two instant access offshore accounts paying annual
interest.
Its Liquid Gold Overseas account for UK customers pays 5.1 per cent gross on
Pounds 100,000, while its Overseas Gold account, open only to expatriates,
pays 6.5 per cent on the same amount. The usual argument is that rates are
set in order to be competitive with other offshore institutions.
Although offshore does not necessarily mean shady, be wary of institutions
paying significantly higher rates of interest as you could be entering risky
waters.
It is also worth remembering that of the three main offshore islands, only
the Isle of Man has its own deposit protection scheme.
The UK's building societies Deposit Protection Scheme, which guarantees to
pay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in an account, does not apply
outside mainland Britain. However, the Building Societies Act requires all
the liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the parent.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Working LIfe: 'Pyramid' sales companies face aggressive
clampdown - Caveat Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of members of schemes supposedly designed to generate money for
nothing have seen their hopes turn to sand in their hands during the last
few days.
The Department of Trade and Industry has begun an aggressive clampdown on
so-called 'pyramid' companies and has promised a review of the existing law
that allows them to operate.
In a series of High Court petitions over the last few weeks, it has applied
to appoint provisional liquidators on public interest grounds to 3T
Publications, Alchemy (UK), Alchemy Marketing and Quillpunch. It is
scrutinising at least one other company, called Powertag.
3T Publications operates as FPW - known at different times as Frequency
Programming World and Futures Product World. FPW in turn operates schemes,
including the Silver Matrix and Midas. Alchemy operated a scheme named after
itself, then renamed the Alchemy Foundation.
The companies managed several schemes which promised members the chance to
multiply many times the money they have put in.
For example, Midas members were promised that Pounds 140 paid out would
result in their receiving back Pounds 600. Alchemy offered Pounds 31,775 to
members in exchange for 24 monthly payments of Pounds 75.
They also constantly require new recruits, apparently attracted by a
combination of money and semi-mystical self-improvement. A three-page letter
distributed earlier this year explains that FPW 'is about teaching success
technologies to members' through 'mind exploration meditation' and
'self-help'. It talks about bringing money to places 'in which opportunity
is almost non-existent' such as old mining, shipbuilding and steel-making
towns, using 'breakthroughs in modern technology . . . and facts taught by
eminent doctors.'
As distinct from other more conventional pyramid selling organisations,
which use personal networks to market goods or services, these schemes
simply ask members to send in money - and to recruit additional members.
Their flaw is that they work like a Ponzi scheme: money is not invested in
any way to add to the value of the income, but simply redistributed to those
higher up in the pyramid. So for each new level of members to receive
income, there must be a continual growth in members beneath them - or
additional contributions from existing members. When these flows dry up,
members stop receiving any money.
In words approvingly cited by the DTI, Mr Justice Chadwick granted
provisional liquidation against Alchemy last month stating that the schemes
were 'bound to fail' because 'the pool of those willing to join is not
inexhaustible.'
However, the DTI's recent court petitions - and the associated publicity -
means that money from new members is likely to quickly dry up, depriving
existing members of any new income.
In spite of the logical flaws of the schemes, the regulators have apparently
left many members not only angry and out of pocket but still ardently
committed with an almost religious belief in the systems and their founders.
The views are summed up by one businessman based in the south-west of
England who wishes to remain anonymous and has been a member of FPW's Silver
Matrix and Midas, and was considering joining Alchemy. He says he joined FPW
after his 12-year-old business collapsed, and he had unsuccessfully played
the options markets and responded to chain letters which asked him to send
in money.
'I feel there is a general view - the orthodox view - of accountants, bank
managers, judges and so on about these schemes,' he says. 'I would have
argued that view before, but I have now accepted it can work. I would hope
to show that logical view has a chink. I've put a lot of thought into this.
It is a very stable way to operate. If left alone I believe they would not
only continue, I would be able to look back and say was this one of the best
things since sliced bread.'
During a discussion lasting 105 minutes he was unable to explain how the
schemes could be self-sustaining, but stressed that they worked. 'My return
is so much higher than any alternative. I have survived for 12 months on
them. I am confident I can get the money I have lost back on them.'
'I regard these as long-term savings - not as safe as a bank, but safer than
unit trusts. Unlike most investment and saving schemes this company asks
only for really very modest amounts. There are inherent dangers in building
societies, which are only saved because others step in when they get into
financial difficulty. I would hope in the future we would have a
self-protective mechanism - like Abta for travel agents.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Sport: Cricket and its gift of boredom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sporting events are, I have decided, much more rewarding when attended in
the north of England. Compared with its London counterpart, a football match
at Old Trafford is a rich occasion; rugby league, which is almost
exclusively northern, creates a more intense and genuine atmosphere than any
other sport. And, for all its grandeur, Lord's cricket ground is an
unyielding, forbidding place when contrasted to Headingley in Leeds.
Lord's is so sure of its own legendary status that it need extend no welcome
to those non-members who wish to partake of its myth; entering the ground is
a great pleasure, but there is something nerve-wracking about it, as if at
any moment one might be stopped and thrown out for harbouring seditious,
anti-cricketing thoughts. Entering Headingley is almost hilariously
informal. One waves a bit of paper at a cheery Yorkshireman - 'Go on, love,
you're alright' - and suddenly there one is, close enough to the outfielders
to see the nicotine stains on Philip Tufnell's fingers.
To be, as I was on Saturday, at a Test match that has the aspect of a game
of village cricket is wonderfully comforting. That old boy with the Deputy
Dawg moustache and the gammy walk, why, that's Graham Gooch. And that big
lumbering chap, could be the local pig farmer, that's Gus Fraser - not a bad
bowler, he can get a bit of pace up. The South Africans look a little more
rigorous, as if they have come to the village green to win the game rather
than enjoy the beers afterwards. But the general impression given by the
players is of an aimless ordinariness quite unlike the highly-defined sheen,
the air of conscious physicality, acquired by most professional sportsmen.
Of course, as with village cricket - or 'Statues', as my mother once called
it, after she and I had watched my brother make about five runs in five
hours - a Test match seen from this homely, parochial perspective is very
boring. That does not matter, but it is true, and I believe nobody who
denies it. Anyone who is perturbed that the years are slipping by too
quickly should go to lots of cricket matches. Then life will seem about
twice as long.
Theoretically, every cricket ball bowled carries with its flight a little
hope, that this time something spectacular might happen. Yet that feeling
evaporates very easily. When, on Saturday, Philip DeFreitas took two wickets
with consecutive balls, Headingley was galvanised and for some minutes every
delivery was greeted with comic-strip whoops and winces. But in effect, all
that had happened was that there had been a respite from the boredom. For a
few moments, time had passed unnoticed; soon, every second would regain its
full weight.
The beauty, and the bane, of Test cricket is that it replicates precisely
the rhythms of life: the long expanses of nothingness, the sudden flurries
of adrenalin. If one submits to this, one finds contentment. Sometimes,
though, there is a slightly precious quality to this submission, especially
at Lord's, where the cognoscenti behave as if they had found an almost
religious significance in the game. Yes, they are right, the boringness of
cricket has a point to it; within those longueurs lie infinite amounts of
patience and strategy; but they are still longueurs and there is nothing
inherently magical about that fact.
At Headingley, the boredom is accepted with much greater simplicity. The
crowd submits itself to the rhythms of the game, but it does so with ease
and humour, rather than an air of mock-holiness. When the game gets boring,
people do what they would do when their lives get boring: they nip off for a
pint, they study the crossword, they dig into their hampers and come up with
a surreptitious sandwich. They don't bother to hide their languor beneath a
panama hat or the Daily Telegraph or a self-conscious expression of mystic
communion. They just accept, and wait, and hope.
It is almost impossible, in this sensible place, to connect the desultory
spectacle before one's eyes with the effect that it has upon the world
outside that expanse of green.
That decent young fellow with the slight, apologetic stoop - can he really
be Michael Atherton? Can the contents of those untidy pockets, in which his
hands are even now being casually placed, really have engrossed the
attention of nations as remote as Australia and Pakistan?
One even begins to wonder if it really matters that much who wins or loses;
which makes one realise how very different the actuality of sport is from
the version that television, and indeed newspapers, have made familiar. How
odd it is to see a wicket taken within the natural progress of the game, to
see it taken only once, to see it taken without the benefit of analysis. One
is forced back on oneself - one's own opinions, one's own emotions. One is
forced to take a wider view, in every sense: the drama between bowler and
batsman is the focus, but it is part of something real, part of the lives of
both players and spectators, not an artificial and disembodied highlight.
The significance of the event is muted, of course. We are so used to having
our instincts magnified by commentators, so used to having life edited for
us by the fast forward, the rewind, the slow motion replay. But it is good
sometimes to accept the whole for what it is, rather than to rely on the
interpretations of an outside agent. Boredom is a small price to pay for the
pleasure of true engagement with a sporting occasion.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Software offers to end last minute search for
those up-to-date skills - Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a familiar situation to most employers. A worker with important skills
goes sick or is otherwise unavailable and no one knows who else in the
organisation has the up-to-date skills to cover the job.
A new software package, called Viva Training, offers employers a method of
auditing exactly who possesses which skills at any particular time.
Crucially, the package allows an employer to establish whether or not the
skills in question have lapsed.
Mrs Jeanne Walsh, of TSS Training and Safety Systems, who developed the
concept of what she calls 'lapsed time', says: 'There is a widely held
assumption that if training is carried out and recorded, that the person
will be able to perform that function to the required level of competence,
ad infinitum.
'In practice, this is simply not so, and work that I have carried out
demonstrates this clearly. This area of loss, multiplied up through British
industry, assumes gigantic proportions, and bleeds the economy.'
She asks employers who purchase her package to work out for themselves how
long they believe it would take for the skills for a particular task to be
lost if the individual was not practising them.
If the worker has no direct experience of that task for longer than the
'lapse time', the manager has the option of updating the skill, for example
by asking the individual to perform that task for a short period.
It sounds simple. Mrs Walsh, who also develops safety management systems, is
marketing her concept in a roadshow touring Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester
and London this autumn.
Several companies have already purchased the package, which retails at about
Pounds 2,300.
The companies include British Sugar, Dairy Crest, and C. P. Pharmaceuticals
in Wrexham. Most purchasers are medium-sized or large employers.
'I don't believe computerised control is important for companies with less
than about 130 employees', says Mrs Walsh 'but we are developing a cheaper
system for smaller businesses.'
Mr Graham Williams, training manager at C P Pharmaceuticals, says that the
package can be adapted for bespoke use.
He makes use of the system in the company's sterile production areas, where
operators are licensed for 12 months to do up to 80 tasks.
'Each task has an an expiry date and after 11 months we review the skill,'
he says.
'If the manager finds that the individual has been using a particular skill,
he or she can be re-licensed. We need this level of management control to
demonstrate to the Medicine Control Agency that we have competent people
doing tasks', says Mr Williams.
'We need the level of documentation that the system offers. At anytime the
supervisor can log into a system that informs him or her what tasks an
individual can do. It gives them confidence.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Ingredients are paramount at Granita - Eating
Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN FALDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing remotely fussy about Granita. The austerity of its large
plate-glass window, its plain wooden floor and the unadorned walls and
tables announce that nothing will distract from the enjoyment of food and,
yes, of chattering.
For this is the legendary Islington dinner party writ large. The place hums
with animated but not overbearing conversation from a smart and relaxed
crowd which can be expected to include actors, lawyers, journalists and
politicians.
The celebrated Tony Blair-Gordon Brown dinner seems not to have gone to its
head and there was friendly and efficient service from a young and
enthusiastic team.
Granita's no-nonsense approach finds further expression in the understated
but attractive presentation of the Mediterranean-inspired dishes and the
adequate size of the portions. Prices are reasonable and the main courses
come complete, so there are no extras to inflate the bill.
The restaurant, in Upper Street, Islington, concentrates on the three
essentials of successful cooking - ingredients, ingredients, and
ingredients. Only the best will do, it seems, and there is nothing flashy in
the preparation.
It is all so deceptively simple you might flatter yourself you could serve
something similar on your stripped pine table - if you could only face the
trek to Steve Hatt's for the fish, to Chapel Market for the veg, and on to
Olga's for the oils and the dried tomatoes.
But even with the culinary skills you would be missing another vital
ingredient - chef and owner Ahmed Kharshoum's confidence and ingenuity in
combining and contrasting flavours to such original effect.
Oak smoked salmon (Pounds 5.95) came with dill and sour cream - nothing too
surprising there - but the accompanying onion pancake was a neat touch.
Main courses are a mouthful - and that's just on the menu. 'Roasted chump of
new seasons lamb (pink), provencal potato gratin, lemon thyme, olives,
steamed runner beans (Pounds 9.95)'. The meat, topping a mound of the other
equally succulent items, was a treat.
My friend was delighted with her fillet of yellowfin tuna (Pounds 10.25),
peppered and chargrilled to bring out the fullest flavour. It came with lime
butter for extra zest and was accompanied by mange tout, red pepper and
garlic potatoes.
There was still room for a remarkable combination of apricot and cherry
crisp with egg nog ice cream and, for me, a smooth luxurious blackberry fool
with hazelnut biscuits (both Pounds 3.50).
Wines are reasonably priced with Chile, Australia and New Zealand well
represented. There is an intriguing range of dessert wines.
The short menu, typically four starters, four main courses and a pasta
option, changes every Tuesday.
Granita, 127 Upper Street, London N1 1QP, tel 071 226 3222. Open Tue-Sun for
dinner, Wed-Sun for lunch. Set lunch Pounds 11.50 for two courses, Pounds
13.50 for three. Nearest Tube: Highbury and Islington.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Wakey wakey - open your eyes to new products -
Innovations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spew is every parent's nightmare: the fruit-flavoured powder, available in
the US, makes a coloured foam in the mouth, and is sold complete with a
reflecting 'Spewer Viewer' so children can check the effect.
Oaw is a French canine 'sports drink' which is said to refresh and revive
dogs after they have been exercising.
Hot 'n' Cold is a Danish bread-and-ice-cream sandwich which can be served
grilled, fried or toasted.
Spew, Oaw, and Hot 'n' Cold are just three of the 12,000 new products which
have been unleashed on unsuspecting consumers around the world in the past
year, according to the market research group Mintel.
Its 450 field researchers - who shop for the new, bizarre and the handful of
products which will still be on the shelves by next year - report that
product innovation has been continuing unabated, even in those economies
affected by recession.
Six product areas account for about a quarter of all launches listed last
year by Mintel in its fortnightly new product reports: confectionery;
desserts and ice creams; sauces and seasonings; soft drinks; haircare; and
oral hygiene.
New launches in confectionery have ranged from the vitamin- enriched and
sugar-free, to the high-calorie and luridly- coloured.
In France, Neon Sucettes are lollipops which stain the tongue 'electric
blue', 'toad green', or 'Dracula red'. At the same time, France has also
seen the launch of 'natural' fruit gums which claim to help keep the
'intestinal eco-system' in good order.
The Japanese appear to be keen on what Mintel terms 'functional' foods. For
example, Wakey is a gum which wards off sleepiness, while Kiss Mints have
extended their range to include apple mint for etiquette, herb mint for
relaxation, and jasmine mint for elegance.
A new drink based on dokudami, a foul-smelling plant, 'helps quicken blood
flow, promote urination and prevents various adult diseases'.
The wonder drink is also said to be 'efficacious against piles, constipation
and menopausal disorders'.
In personal care products, the 'two-in-one' trend, which began with shampoos
and conditioners, now seems to be working its way through bath and
toothpaste new launches.
Mentadent Mouthwash, for example, is being packaged in a dual-chambered
container which dispenses baking powder and hydrogen peroxide solutions. Not
unlike Spew or Neon Sucettes, the effect is blue and effervescent.
Mr David Jago, Mintel's new products specialist, says that most new product
launches are doomed to failure.
The commonly-quoted figure is 90 per cent, although he says it depends on
how failure is defined - for example, character merchandising is often only
intended to have a short life span.
'I'd hazard a guess that around 70-80 per cent of all product introductions
don't succeed in the long term,' he says.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Confirmation of the British stereotype

<TEXT>
One day I am going to write a pot-boiler about a successful entrepreneur. My
hero will be a working class boy from a fatherless home. He will have done
badly at the local comprehensive, where he will have been persecuted for
being so small. He will risk everything and lose, only to start again, even
more determined than before.
On the way up, he will cross swords with the chief of a mighty corporation.
This chap will come from a stable, upper middle-class home. He will be
cautious by nature, competitive and will work 18 hours a day.
Readers will not be required to believe in either character - this is
fiction and bad fiction at that. Yet last week I discovered, much to my
amazement, that my imaginary account would be based on fact. Three British
occupational psychologists have just published detailed research* based on
interviews with twenty of each type which confirm the corniest stereotypes.
You cannot fault the authors on method, but I wonder about some of their
subjects: author Catherine Cookson is not my idea of a first division
entrepreneur, and neither is Teresa Gorman MP nor Lord Young. And when it
comes to the 'intrapreneurs' - people who have transformed large
organisations from within - Sir Denis Thatcher and Emma Nicholson MP would
not be first on my list.
At least I have found out how to make my book even more convincing: the
corporate man will have to be married to the prime minister and my
entrepreneur will end up one of her favourite cabinet ministers.
Since I wrote last week about the down-trodden employees who have survived
one of the biggest redundancy exercises in British corporate history, I have
been contacted by scores of consultants specialising in the 'survivor
syndrome'. One such, Alternative International, has sent me a 12-page fax
explaining how these employees need to be 'emotionally reconnected to their
employer' via three-day workshops consisting of 'force field analysis' and
an 'external environment review.'
This cure sounds almost as painful as the disease - and not everyone wants
to be emotionally connected to their employer. Still, the approach is
preferable to that of one FT reader who argues that people lucky enough to
have jobs should stop whingeing and work harder so that the economy will
recover and their ex-colleagues will be re-employed. It strikes me that if
employees did more, the management would have the perfect excuse for
shedding more labour.
Every day there are fresh estimates of what the strikes have cost the rail
industry, but there has been nothing on what it is costing companies. I have
tried to find out how many people are failing to get to work, but no one
seems to know.
To judge by the emptiness of the tubes and buses on rail strike days, people
would appear to be staying at home in droves. But in that case it is hard to
understand why companies are not more agitated about it. The CBI says its
members have barely mentioned the strike.
It is not as though companies are making up the slack with temps: according
to Alfred Marks, business is actually worse on rail strike days. Some people
may be taking their sleeping bags to work. Alternatively companies may be
getting on nicely without many of their workers. I hate to think what fate
could greet them when they finally start working a five-day week again.
If I had a penny for every time I heard someone say they do not believe
executives should be rewarded for failure, I would be as rich as some of the
failed executives themselves. The latest person to make this banal utterance
is Tim Melville-Ross, the incoming boss of the Institute of Directors. I
have yet to meet the person who can put their hand on their heart and say
they do believe in rewarding failure.
The issue is not what people believe in, but what they plan to do about it.
At least Melville-Ross has joined the still small band of campaigners
against the three-year rolling contracts that allow sacked executives to
collect large pay-offs.
When people say they do not believe in rewarding failure, they usually mean
they do believe in rewarding success. This is equally platitudinous. Nearly
everyone thinks success should be rewarded: the question is by how much. The
latest survey shows that 54 British directors earned more than Pounds 1m
last year. Presumably, most of those were successful. But were they that
successful? Would they have been any less successful had they been paid
less? There must be another book here for occupational psychologists:
meanwhile the message from the 20 intrapreneurs suggests the need to achieve
is a much stronger motivation than money.
