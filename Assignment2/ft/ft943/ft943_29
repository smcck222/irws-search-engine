FT  08 AUG 94 / Management: Who inherits the crown? - Executive misfortune
at Disney highlights the need for a succession plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, was almost
mauled by a lion.
Katzenberg appeared shaken but unhurt after the lion - brought on stage at a
video retailers show in Los Angeles to celebrate Disney's extremely
successful animated film 'The Lion King' - grabbed his leg and refused to
let go.
Yet it could have been a nasty incident. If anything had happened to
Katzenberg, it would have been the third piece of serious misfortune to
strike Disney's top management in almost as many months. In April, Disney's
president and chief operating officer, Frank Wells, was killed in a
helicopter accident. Then, in mid-July, chairman Michael Eisner was rushed
to hospital for quadruple heart bypass surgery.
The loss of Wells was regarded by analysts and shareholders as a big blow
for Disney. He was Eisner's right-hand man and played a critical role in the
day-to-day running of the company. Almost four months after Wells' death,
Disney has yet to replace him, a fact that only made news of 52-year-old
Eisner's emergency heart surgery especially troubling to shareholders.
After the surgery, doctors were hopeful about the prognosis for the Disney
chairman, who is expected back at work full-time by the middle of this
month. Yet their optimism could not stop Wall Street from speculating about
how badly Eisner's incapacitation had affected the company.
Although Disney insists it has been business as usual since Eisner's
emergency operation, the company was naturally caught off guard by the
developments. Some companies make preparations for the unexpected death or
serious illness of senior managers, particularly chairmen or chief
executives. But how many are likely to be prepared for the loss of their two
most senior officers in such a short space of time?
Ernie Glickman, managing partner of Harbridge House, a US consulting firm
owned by Coopers &amp; Lybrand which works with clients on succession planning,
says that although the chances of losing two top executives are very slim -
assuming they are not foolish enough to travel together - companies should
be prepared for the worst. 'You can't assume that just one tragedy will
happen. You've got to have succession plans in place right down the
management hierarchy,' he says.
But many companies, even if they have some form of succession planning,
rarely take it to the very top. One of the main reasons is that if chief
executives have a successor in mind they prefer to keep the name to
themselves, except where the number two is clearly being groomed for the top
job. If they publicly announce their choice, they run the risk of alienating
the other senior executives who might have considered themselves candidates
for the succession.
One way around that problem, says Glickman, is for chief executives to let
only their boards of directors, or board chairmen, know of their plans.
'Good leaders say: 'I've got to make sure my chairman of the board clearly
knows, if anything should happen to me, who should step in and run the
company.''
But, he says, most chief executives do not follow this common-sense policy,
because they cannot envisage life at the company without them. 'The egos of
CEOs can get in the way of principles of good leadership,' says Glickman.
Management consultants admit that the reluctance of chief executives to
prepare for a smooth transition of power is understandable. Although one of
top management's main responsibilities should be to plan for succession at
every level of the company, few bosses wish to think about when they
themselves may have to surrender power, willingly or unwillingly. A recent
survey by the New York executive recruitment firm Korn/Ferry International
found that among 348 large companies, only 34 per cent of chief executives
had identified their successors either publicly or privately.
Mortimer Feinberg, head of BFS Psychological Associates, a New York
consulting firm which specialises in executive selection and succession,
says that even if senior executives are sometimes forced to stop and
consider succession issues, they soon drop the subject as quickly as they
can. 'The CEO does not want to talk about it . . . because it's like taking
out a life insurance policy.'
At companies where a chairman or a chief executive is an especially dominant
figure, succession issues can be particularly troublesome in the event of an
incapacitating illness or death. At Time Warner in late 1992, the death of
the entertainment group's chairman and founder, Steve Ross, was immediately
followed by an internal clash among senior management. That clash led to a
significant shake-up of Time Warner's board - even though the chief
executive, Gerald Levin, had been hand-picked by the ailing Ross as his
successor long before.
Here, the void left by the departure of the charismatic Ross created special
problems for Time Warner - in particular, how to end the long-standing
conflict within the group between top executives from Time Inc and Warner
Communications, the two companies which merged in 1990. Ultimately, Levin, a
former Time executive, chose to settle the matter by engineering board
changes which led to the departure of eight directors, including key members
of the Warner camp.
The succession process at Time Warner might have been smoother if the
company had spread the management load from the start. Terry Fergus, a
partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in New York, says that, increasingly, big US
companies are sharing the burden of management at the top among more key
executives, partly to ensure that there is a team in place to keep things
going if anyone dies or is taken seriously ill. 'More companies are going
with an office of the chairman, or an office of the president  - where there
are three or four people actually running the company.'
Many management consultants go further, recommending that the process of
succession planning be institutionalised. 'You make it part of the culture
that you're always reviewing succession planning twice a year,' says
Feinberg. But few companies follow this policy, he says. 'Most just pay
lip-service to it.'
If most succession planning is aimed at handling sudden death or
resignation, serious and prolonged illness can cause problems which are
almost as severe.
The advice of most management experts in the event of serious illness at the
top is for companies to acknowledge the difficulties presented by the
situation as quickly as possible; to let shareholders, Wall Street and the
media know of the problem and to take action to ensure the illness does not
interfere with the smooth running of the company.
Two contrasting examples of how well US companies deal with illness at the
top were provided recently by Tenneco, the industrial conglomerate, and TLC
Beatrice, the foods group.
Tenneco faced the sudden prospect of change in January 1993, when its
chairman, Michael Walsh, was diagnosed as suffering from brain cancer. At
the time, Walsh was in the middle of completing a dramatic overhaul of the
company, so his health was critical to Tenneco's future. Although the
immediate announcement of his illness unsettled investors sufficiently to
slice 5 per cent off the company's share price in a single day, Walsh was
praised for quickly informing his company and its shareholders of his
predicament. Fortunately Tenneco had a strong number two in Dana Mead, who
had been chosen in 1992 as an eventual successor to Walsh. Mead was promoted
to chief executive when Walsh stepped down because of his health last
February, and when he died in May the transition was a smooth one.
In contrast, when the chairman of TLC Beatrice, Reginald Lewis, was
diagnosed as suffering from brain cancer in late 1992, he chose to keep the
information to himself. His death in January 1993 was a shock to all but a
few of his most intimate advisers.
Although Lewis had set up a special management team to handle the transition
of power when he was diagnosed as having cancer, the first year after his
death was a difficult one for Beatrice. Its financial position deteriorated,
and Lewis's chosen successor - his half-brother Jean Fugett - eventually
resigned in January 1994, creating uncertainty about the company's future.
As for Walt Disney, it appears to be coping well for now, but doubts remain
about how it will be affected over the longer term.
As John Tinker, analyst at the New York broking firm Furman Selz, says of
Eisner's illness: 'Short-term it's not an issue. It's a very strong company.
A lot of the management team has been in place for a decade and some a lot
longer. I don't think it affects them now. Longer-term, it becomes more of
an issue. I would expect the company to rejiggle its management structure a
little bit. They are going through a rate of unbelievably rapid change, and
big strategic decisions have to be made.'
Among those decisions is whether Disney should buy a US television network.
Just before Eisner was taken ill, Disney was reported to be considering
either buying, or forging a partnership with, CBS, the broadcast television
group. Since Eisner's surgery, most observers believe such considerations
have been put on hold.
The Disney chairman's illness created problems in another way - it
immediately focused attention on the vacancy in the spot previously occupied
by Wells. To some observers, Eisner's decision not to appoint a new
president and chief operating officer quickly was surprising, particularly
because in Katzenberg the company seemed to possess an obvious successor to
Wells.
Since Eisner's surgery, Hollywood has been full of speculation that the
ambitious Katzenberg might leave Disney if he is not offered the number two
job soon. For a company which has prided itself for years on its stable
management, the speculation is unsettling.
It will not die down until Disney appoints a new president, a decision which
cannot be made until Eisner recovers from his surgery. The decision,
however, may never be taken. Eisner may stick to the original interim plan
of leaving the post of president vacant - late last month, a Disney
spokesman questioned whether the company really needed both a chairman and a
president.
Given Disney's impressive management record, it is a valid question. But
with a chairman recovering from quadruple bypass heart surgery, the
succession issue will not go away in a hurry.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Nicola Foulston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicola Foulston, owner and chief executive of Brands Hatch racing circuit,
began running her own business at an early age. She inherited Brands Hatch
and three other racing circuits from her father, John, seven years ago when
he was killed in a race at Silverstone. Two years after that, aged 22, she
took over the running of Brands Hatch and quickly developed a reputation as
an astute and strong-willed manager.
What item of office equipment would you need, along with a fax and
telephone?
I'd like to take my PA who I rely on for many things and who I really
couldn't do without. But outside the human element it would have to be a TV
and video. I'd need those because I do a lot of reviewing of events, but
also I imagine that I would get pretty bored on a desert island, so they
would provide some amusement too.
Who would you take with you?
I'm newly married and I would definitely take my husband. Probably 20 years
on I wouldn't say the same thing, but right now I'd take my husband. He'd be
the best entertainment value. We met when I started learning to fly - he
used to be my flying instructor.
You can have a vehicle to get around the island?
The new Porsche 959. I've got sports cars and they're fun to drive, but I
especially like that model. It's very stylish.
You're allowed one type of food?
Chinese. I eat more Chinese than anything else and would miss it if I
couldn't have it. Like most of us, it is mainly the western-style Chinese
that I eat most rather than the true Cantonese from China.
One non-essential item to preserve your sanity?
It would have to be a light aircraft. I love flying, it's one of my
favourite pastimes. My aircraft has quite a limited range so I wouldn't be
able to escape from the island.
What would be the best thing about being marooned?
Being able to concentrate. People are always in and out of my office, and
while I like the buzz of that, just being able to get on with things would
be a bonus.
You're allowed to watch one sport.
It would have to be a motor sport. I'm not a big fan of other types of
sport, I've never been able to get into football for example. And also I
would need to keep up with what was happening in motoring.
One condition can be imposed on the island.
It would have to have a mountain that was snow-capped so that I could go
skiing. I'm a skiing fanatic and really love to go each year.
If you couldn't return from the island, what would you like to be remembered
for?
For commercial awareness. I've tried to make a lot of changes in what is
quite an old-style and very traditional business, especially with events
such as the touring cars. It is not a business that welcomes change very
readily so that is what I would like people to remember.

FT  08 AUG 94 / High achievers who 'fear only the creator': Those drawn to a
controversial Islamic group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KHOZEM MERCHANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We embrace Islam intellectually and we carry it politically. We are looking
for change,' says Abdul, a 25-year-old investment analyst with a City
merchant bank.
By day Abdul (not his real name) handles a multi-million pound portfolio for
private and institutional investors. By night he helps run Hizb-ut-Tahrir
(Liberation party), an Islamic revivalist group which advocates the
restoration of the Khilafah, a single borderless Moslem entity with one
leader, abolished by the father of modern Turkey, Kemal Attuturk, in 1924.
In the UK, Hizb-ut-Tahrir counts among its members British-born doctors,
gilts traders, computer analysts, university lecturers, accountants and
physicists. They are high achievers, outspoken and 'fear only the creator',
according to party spokesman Farrid Qassim, a former town planner now fully
absorbed with running the party.
Abdul, a physics graduate who recently completed his doctorate at London
University, is typical of the highly educated British-born Moslems whose
uncompromising articulation of their faith has set them apart from fellow
Mohammedans.
Yesterday thousands of Moslems like Abdul descended on Wembley Arena in
north London to hear speakers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, Pakistan
and the US at the International Moslem Khilafah Conference. Hizb-ut-Tahrir
was one of the organisers.
Brent council, the local authority, and the Union of Jewish Students, had
urged the government to ban the meeting. They cited Hizb-ut-Tahrir's
anti-semitism as likely to inflame tensions in a multi-racial area already
on edge after last month's two bomb attacks on Jewish targets in London.
The Board of Jewish deputies expressed its concern to the government but
stopped short of calling for a ban.
Brent Islamic Forum, an umbrella group, and leading Moslem scholars opposed
moves to ban the conference, saying it would simply make Moslems more
suspicious of government motives towards the Moslem community. Any ban, they
added, would backfire in Hizb-ut-Tahrir's favour.
But Islamic scholars have nevertheless denounced Hizb-ut-Tahrir's
anti-semitic comments, carried in leaflets distributed at universities. The
party's statements about 'killing Jews' were 'wrong in theology, wrong in
ethics, and wrong in British law', said Dr Zaki Badawi, principal of the
Moslem College in London.
Hizb-ut-Tahrir insists its published comments have 'been taken out of
context', and that it is the target of an orchestrated campaign. All this
attention has raised the profile of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which was founded in
1953 in the West Bank town of Hebron to revive the Khilafah, an aim which
led to its banning in many Middle East states. Yet its agenda - dismissed
privately by Moslem scholars as 'silly and Utopian'  - has attracted many
young Moslems in Britain.
Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, says: 'We provide
intellectual leadership. This forces us to argue our case and we are
equipped to do this. This will create public awareness (for the Khilafah),
then create a public force and then public demands.' Omar Bakri was expelled
from Saudi Arabia 10 years ago and today runs an Islamic school in
Tottenham, north London.
Much of the reason for the interest created by Hizb-ut-Tahrir is attributed
to disenchantment with the internal leadership of the ummah, the Moslem
community. It is denounced for failing to address contemporary issues that
concern young Moslems.
Sohail Nakhooda, a director of Islamica, a religious journal, says that
these issues include racism, employment and drugs in the UK. Overseas issues
include the plight of Moslems in Bosnia, the occupied territories and
Algeria, and injustices in, for example, western-supported Gulf states.
This discontent has, for five years, been tapped by Hizb-ut-Tahrir.
Universities and colleges have proved the most fertile areas for
recruitment.
The Union of Jewish Students says complaints from its members about
Hizb-ut-Tahrir activities have risen sharply in the past eight months.
The party's members probably number no more than 2,000. Typical is Zulfikar,
a former futures and gilts trader with Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch,
who quit the City and, after starting a physics degree at London University,
joined Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Today, London-born Zulfikar is studying Islamic
jurisprudence at Omar Bakri's Islamic school. 'What motivates me? The
intellectual pull and the desire for a Khilafah,' he says.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Pin-striped debt collectors to pin-point Names: The growing
business of demanding money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that the Lloyd's insurance market has decided to employ debt
collectors to help recover funds from loss-making Names may not be quite as
alarming as it sounds. The business of collecting debts is clawing its way
up-market, and is becoming a matter of pin-stripe suits and executive cars
as much as baseball caps and grubby vans.
Lloyd's has set up a committee, with Mr Bernard Bradford as chairman, to
examine ways of collecting money. He will have no shortage of offers of help
from collection agencies scenting commission and solicitors smelling
litigation fees. The companies he is likely to select will not be at the
frayed-cuff end of the trade and will adhere to guidelines of the Credit
Services Association.
These guidelines enjoin collectors to 'be circumspect and discreet when
attempting to contact the debtor whether by telephone or by personal visit',
and 'unless instructed otherwise, to accept all reasonable offers by debtors
to pay by instalments'.
The largest operators are quoted companies such as Intrum Justitia. 'It's
becoming a professional industry with sophisticated computer systems,' says
one practitioner. But it is still possible to be a debt collector without
any qualifications. Sharks are still about.
The Credit Services Association, the trade body, has 150 members but there
are at least 300 debt collection agencies competing for business which, like
the Lloyd's debts, often springs from the 1980s.
'When credit was abundant in the late 1980s, there was a lot of debt about,'
said Mr Roy Goldsmith, association secretary. 'People were concerned about
the front end of their business. They weren't so concerned about getting
debt in. A lot of debt collection people saw this as an opportunity to make
money.'
They still do. But the competition has been made more intense with the
arrival in the market of solicitors such as Dibb Lupton Broomhead, which is
working with Lloyd's.
'It's cut-throat,' said the credit manager of one finance house. 'Every day
I have people from these 300 firms ringing up and touting for business.'
Those which win Lloyd's business will almost certainly be association
members and their executives will probably be members of the Institute of
Credit Management. Their first task will be to decide the nature of the debt
they want to collect.
Mr Terry Robinson, the chairman of Commercial Credit Consultants in
Liverpool, said: 'Credit trading can be divided into two almost at the
start: trade credit and consumer credit. Although they share a lot of common
ground, their similarities will diminish with the ageing of the debts.'
With trade debt, a collector explained, the creditor may well be dealing
with a customer to whom he or she might wish to continue selling. This would
suggest the need for a more sensitive approach than with a consumer debt
where 'all you want is the money back the fastest and cheapest way'.
Mr Bradford and his colleagues will have to decide to what extent they want
to continue a relationship with their debtors. If they decide they are not
interested then the going, for the debtors, might be rougher.
At the start, the debt collection agency will try to contact the Lloyd's
loser by letter and then telephone, Mr Robinson said.
Mr Goldsmith said: 'Basically we are debt negotiators. We try and negotiate
initially and often the debtor is more ready to negotiate with a third party
than the party who's owed the money.'
In the Lloyd's case the agency will probably be referred back to the loser's
lawyer, which opens up the whole panoply of legal process.
The trick here for the agency will be to decide whether the debtor is a
Can't Pay or a Won't Pay. If the former, then the agency will settle for a
nominal amount, if the latter, then a summons will be quickly sent.
The agency will want a judgment in the County Court or the High Court and
then if the debtor still refuses to pay, an enforcement order. This is the
stage where, as last resort, a bailiff could be sent in by the County Court,
or a sheriff by the High Court, to seize belongings.
The agency could ask the court to attach the earnings of the debtor: this
would have the effect of seizing money held in a bank account. It could
claim a property as security.
But the system does not give all the cards to the agency. Lloyd's debtors
will have the chance to extend the legal process, the longer to avoid
repayment. The finance house credit manager said: 'We've got people on our
books with three or four County Court judgments against them and we still
can't get the money out of them.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Economists fear repeat of spending boom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Economists, having overcome their fears that this year's tax increases would
stop recovery, are starting to worry that consumers might be preparing to
repeat the late-1980s spending boom.
In its latest review of the economy, Oxford Economic Forecasting, an
independent forecasting company, warns that the electorate might not be
satisfied with steady growth and low inflation when the next general
election is held - in the second quarter of 1997 at the latest.
Separately, Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist of Nomura Research Institute,
suggests that the Treasury and financial markets might underestimate the
strength of consumer spending and housing market recovery in the next two
years before eventually having to impose 'monetary overkill' on the economy.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Companies queue to appear at Labour's show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-seven companies ranging from Sega, the Japanese electronic games
manufacturer, to Securicor Group have joined a waiting list of potential
exhibitors at the coming Labour party conference in Blackpool.
Ms Jackie Bate, the party's conference and exhibition manager, said it was
attracting 'the biggest commercial interest of any political party in
Europe'. She added: 'In the last few weeks we have had an increasing number
of calls from companies wanting to book for this conference and next year's.
We've got more people wanting to exhibit than we have room for.'
The party has acquired more floor space to accommodate 163 exhibition
stands. Of these some 150 are from the private sector and large public
organisations, paying an estimated total of Pounds 600,000 in rent.
J. Sainsbury and DHL are among the companies exhibiting for the first time.
The waiting list also includes the UK subsidiary of Norsk Hydro, the
Norwegian chemicals and metals group, and BSkyB, the satellite TV company in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
'It really feels as if we are pushing an open door,' said Ms Nikki Lewis,
the party's corporate relations manager. She has a specific brief to 'open a
dialogue' between the party and what she calls 'corporate UK'.
'Corporate UK has become quite clearly disillusioned with the Tories,' she
said. 'I think that in the fullness of time that positive feedback will turn
into money.'
So far there is no evidence in the form of large corporate contributions to
Labour party funds. Sainsbury is denying reports that its chairman Mr David
Sainsbury backed financially Mr Tony Blair's successful campaign for the
party leadership.
The company said it was continuing to maintain an 'apolitical stance'. The
decision to exhibit at the Labour conference was because the event was
viewed as an 'opportunity to talk to influential legislators about important
issues'.
Meanwhile, the Institute of Public Policy Research, the left of centre
think-tank, says it is receiving 'an increasing amount of money from major
companies' for research projects. Its clients now include News
International, Glaxo and Shell. The precise monies involved are not
disclosed, but IPPR's chief economist Mr Dan Corry says the unit's research
projects command figures of between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 90,000.
Mr Corry said: 'Our clients want to know what a Labour party is going to do
because it is quite obvious to some of them that a Labour government is what
they are going to end up with.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Sales of new vans and trucks up 24.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Registrations of new commercial vehicles increased 24.2 per cent last month
as the recovery in sales of vans, trucks and buses spread to all types of
buyer including small businesses, Kevin Done writes.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association,
said: 'On the philosophy that commercial vehicle operation serves as a
barometer of economic welfare, the signs seem set fair for overall national
economic recovery.'
Total sales of new commercial vehicles rose last month to 8,739 from 7,038
in July last year, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders showed. Sales in the first seven months have risen 15.2 per cent to
120,109 from 104,255 in the corresponding period a year before.
Registrations of three and four-axle rigid trucks have risen sharply with a
jump of 74 per cent year-on-year in July. Overall, sales of heavy trucks
(above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 29.4 per cent in the first seven
months of the year to 12,227.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Experimental crop of wheat harvested
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first experimental crop of genetically engineered wheat has been
harvested in Cambridgeshire.
The success of the trial, carried out by Swiss-owned Ciba Seeds, shows that
scientists can alter the characteristics of important cereals in a reliable
way by giving them genes from other species.
The work is expected to lead to new wheat varieties with increased
resistance to drought and disease, less requirement for expensive
fertilisers, and other improvements.
The wheat grown at Great Abington, Cambridgeshire, contains 'marker genes'
of no commercial significance, chosen to prove that foreign genetic material
can be passed on predictably from one generation of plants to the next.
Some of the plants contained a red pigment gene taken from wild Peruvian
maize. When they were harvested last week, all their grains showed red spots
 -looking unlike any wheat grown before.
The other plants produced bacterial enzymes which Ciba detected in simple
tests, proving that the new genes were switched on successfully.
Mr David Thompson, head of research at Ciba's cereal breeding business, said
the 16 sq m trial plot yielded several kilograms of the wheat.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Union demands pensions payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty-six pensions companies will today receive letters from the GMB
general union demanding compensation for alleged bad pensions advice given
to some of its members, Chris Tighe writes.
Ninety cases relating to the companies have been selected from hundreds of
calls to the union's pensions helpline, set up in May to assist members who
believe they may have been wrongly advised on opting out of company schemes
and into personal pensions.
Mr John Edmonds, the union's general secretary, has also asked the Serious
Fraud Office to investigate the cases. The SFO said it was considering the
matter.
The union says it wants each case to be thoroughly examined by the pensions
companies, and full compensation - likely, it estimates, to exceed Pounds 1m
in total - to be provided.
The union said the 'worst culprit' among its 90 cases was the Prudential
with 17.
The Prudential said it had yet to receive any evidence from the union. The
transfer of active members of company schemes to new schemes had never been
its policy, it said, adding: 'We believe we have behaved properly and well
within the regulators' rules and regulations.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Consumers seem cautious amid rising credit demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for consumer credit continued to rise in June although there were
growing signs of reluctance to take on heavy or longer-term commitments, say
two credit industry reports released today.
Both the Finance and Leasing Association and Infolink, a credit information
group, suggested that discussion of possible interest rate increases
deterred some borrowers.
The FLA said its members supplied consumer credit worth Pounds 1.37bn in
June, an increase of 31 per cent compared with June 1993 but up only 1 per
cent from May. While credit granted on store cards rose sharply, fewer
people took out personal loans and motor finance fell 6 per cent compared
with May.
According to the FLA's non-seasonally adjusted figures, store card
borrowings jumped 14 per cent to Pounds 415m between May and June and were
up 51 per cent on June last year. However, personal loans at Pounds 219m in
June were down 9 per cent compared with May and, although 12 per cent higher
than in June last year, recorded their lowest annual rate of increase for 18
months.
Infolink reported a strong 13.1 per cent year-on-year increase in demand for
credit in the retail sector. However, applications for credit in the new-car
sector slowed, while growth in demand for credit from finance houses was the
lowest in recent months, it said.
Mr Brian Bailey, Infolink chairman, said his company's figures provided
'anecdotal evidence that consumers were reluctant to make heavy credit
commitments in June'.
Mr David Hardisty, FLA chairman, said: 'The reluctance of consumers to take
on longer term commitments in June confirms our view that consumer
confidence remains fragile.'
The FLA, whose members provide 80 per cent of consumer credit not provided
by banks and building societies, and finance about 30 per cent of fixed
investment in plant and equipment, said business finance at Pounds 1.21bn in
June was unchanged from June 1993. Although business lending and leasing
showed a typical end-quarter increase of 24 per cent between May and June,
the second-quarter total of Pounds 3.18bn was only 1 per cent up on last
year's second-quarter total of Pounds 3.15bn.
The shake-out in manufacturing is coming to an end with companies shedding
fewer staff and closing fewer production sites, says a survey by Remploy
Manufacturing Services, a contract manufacturing company.
Its survey of more than 7,000 manufacturing sites found 20 per cent
increased their workforce in the year to June, 25 per cent reduced staff and
55 per cent reported no change in the workforce.
The survey showed that just under 4 per cent of the sites had closed in the
year to June, against 8 per cent in the previous year and 13 per cent the
year before.

US business groups fear tighter restrictions will be placed on non-European
citizens visiting the UK for business purposes under a change to Britain's
immigration regulations.
The London branch of the American Chamber of Commerce intends to protest to
UK trade and industry ministers about the move, which it believes could
force short-term business visitors from non-European Union countries to
apply for a work permit.
The Home Office described the amendments to the Immigration Act, due to take
effect on October 1, as a 'clarification' of existing rules.
The chamber is concerned by a clause which states that a business visitor to
the UK will be granted entry without a work permit only if he or she 'does
not intend to produce goods or provide services within the United Kingdom'.
It fears that visitors who plan to speak at international conferences,
provide consultancy services or engage in marketing activities will have to
obtain work permits before being allowed into the country, even if they plan
to stay for only two or three days.
Mr Eric Deakins, consultant to the American Chamber of Commerce, said:
'These rules go against the spirit of the Gatt agreement on international
free trade.'
Previous immigration regulations, last revised in 1990, state that
passengers admitted to the UK with 'visitor' status 'are free to transact
business during their visit'.
Mr Deakins said: 'This is a substantial tightening up of the rules. Whatever
it means, in practice may be another matter.'
The Home Office said the 'clarified' rules would be enforced in 'exactly the
same way as they were before'.
Earlier this year, the Home Office issued guidance notes which clarify some
points. But the status of conference speakers and outside consultants is
still unclear. The notes state that non-EU citizens may enter the UK without
work permits as speakers 'in a conference where this is not run as a
commercial concern and the conference is a one-off'.
Mr Deakins said this note did not make clear what was meant by 'commercial
concern' and did not set out the status of speakers who were not being paid
but were speaking at commercial conferences.
The Home Office said a conference speaker who was not being paid would not
generally need to secure a work permit before arriving in the UK.
But each case would be judged individually and conference speakers could be
evaluated on the length of their stay in Britain, whether they were
receiving any payment in kind, and the nature of the conference at which
they were appearing.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Japan pledges Aids drive: A coup for Tokyo's health ministry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan must strengthen its Aids prevention programmes because public health
is a 'foundation of social and economic development', the country's prime
minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, said yesterday.
He was speaking at the opening of the 10th annual international conference
on the disease, being held this week in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Crown Prince
Naruhito, also in attendance, added his 'fervent desire that the not too
distant future will see all Aids-related problems resolved' in Japan and the
rest of the world.
To have drawn both head of government and heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne
to speak on a subject many western leaders have shunned represents a coup
for the Japanese health ministry, which has been co-ordinating domestic
organisation of the conference. More than 9,600 delegates are participating,
about half from outside Japan. It is the first time the conference has been
held in Asia, which scientists say will soon have more new infections with
the HIV virus than any other continent.
Hundreds of thousands have already contracted HIV in countries such as India
and Thailand. Fewer than 4,000 in Japan have tested HIV positive, and most
public hospitals maintain they are not equipped to treat Aids symptoms. Mr
Murayama, who has been in office barely a month, pledged no particular
measures beyond a commitment to work with other countries in dealing with
the problem.
'When one thinks of the needs of the people living with Aids, waiting
eagerly for the earliest possible establishment of care strategies, and of
the efforts by those who offer support for these people, we have to
strengthen our national programmes for the prevention and care of Aids and
further promote international co-operation,' he said. Within Japan, however,
the event promises to change attitudes.
Press and broadcast media have been running daily features on HIV as a
Japanese as well as global issue, and the arrival at the Yokohama venue
yesterday of prince and premier will contribute to Mr Murayama's expressed
desire for a 'mitigation of social prejudice' about the disease.
A survey of 210 Osaka-based companies released last week showed that more
than half would have no idea how to react to an HIV positive employee and
only a tenth had conducted any Aids education for managers or workers.
Although the health ministry has committed Y10.86bn (Pounds 71m) in the
latest year to combating the disease, the Y150m it has spent on the
conference may repay a greater dividend.
National television footage last night showed Prince Naruhito and Mr
Murayama sharing the platform, and a quiet word, with Mr Toshihiro Oishi,
aged 25, the Japanese representative of the Global Network of People Living
with HIV and Aids, an organisation which calls itself GNP+ for short. In
their presence Mr Oishi told the conference he was gay, HIV positive, and
that 'Japanese society is still far from being empathetic.'
But Japan has made a start. The government is attempting to set aside some
sexual taboos in order to ensure that the GNP it cares most about regains a
plus-factor at the end of the country's longest postwar recession.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Labour attacks water profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday launched a new broadside against the profits made
by privatised water companies in England and Wales, in spite of recent
assurances from the industry regulator that consumer costs would be kept
within strict limits.
In a detailed attack on the activities of the 31 privatised water companies,
Mr George Howarth, shadow environment minister, said their overall profits
had risen 125 per cent since privatisation in 1989 and that the salaries of
their chairmen had risen an average 135 per cent over the same period.
He also said that about a third of the water companies' chairmen held senior
posts in other companies which were benefactors of the Conservative party,
and had donated a total of Pounds 745,000 to Tory funds in the past 15
years.
Mr Howarth said, for example, that Mr Andrew Simon, the director of Severn
Trent Water, was also a director of Laporte, the chemicals group, which has
donated Pounds 231,200 since 1979.
Mr Howarth said he was not alleging any impropriety. 'The point is that when
all these interests get so closely snuggled up together the borderline
between the various public interests, private interests and the Conservative
party itself becomes blurred,' he said.
The Gas Consumers Council has asked the government to restrict British Gas's
ability to increase prices to some of its customers before the introduction
of competition in the domestic market, Robert Corzine writes.
In a letter to Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, the council accused British
Gas of mounting 'an intensive campaign to warn that higher gas bills, for
some, are an unavoidable prelude to competition'.
Last month British Gas said it intended to remove cross-subsidies between
the 18m household consumers of gas in a process known as 're-balancing'. It
claimed that 2m to 3m of its best customers subsidised many more millions of
consumers who either use small amounts of gas or who are problem payers.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Unions stand up for non-members / TUC to debate
representation and rights in the workplace for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress is about to launch a fundamental debate on the
future of labour law that could lead to a transformation in union attitudes
towards legal rights.
An interim document going to next month's congress argues - for the first
time in TUC history - that workers, not just trade union members, must have
legal workplace rights and representation.
A group of senior union leaders plans to visit Sweden and Germany in
November to see systems of employee representation in the workplace. Some UK
union leaders are certain to resist the TUC view. They would rather press
simply for new laws from a future Labour government which would provide them
with means for union recognition from reluctant employers and exclusive
rights for their members.
But Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, knows that Mr Tony Blair,
the Labour leader, does not favour restoring the legal immunities and
privileges that unions enjoyed before the Conservatives came to power 15
years ago.
Mr Monks is keen to show that today's unions are concerned with all
employees, not just their own members who now account for only a third of
employed workers. There are no trade unionists in 49 per cent of workplaces
and there is a further 9 per cent of places in which unions are not
recognised by employers. The TUC's conversion to legal rights for workers
and not just trade unionists has also been strongly helped by the
development of European Union employment law.
This December all member states of the EU except the UK are expected to
approve the works council directive. This will establish information and
consultation arrangements for employees in large multinational enterprises.
Each company will have a negotiating body to represent employees, whose
members will be elected or appointed according to the rules established by
each member state. If agreement within a company cannot be reached on this,
a 'statutory fall-back arrangement' will apply which involves imposing a
council, with an agreed EU format, on the company. Britain has opted out of
this proposal but nearly 100 companies based in the UK will be obliged to
establish such bodies because of the size of their operations on the
Continent.
Pressure for the development of employee representation is also growing
after recent European Court judgments that the UK had infringed directives
on collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings by not providing for
employee representation.
The UK government is still deciding what to do about a judgment which rules
that workers, and not just trade unionists, are entitled to consultation and
information on such matters.
The TUC argues that the employee representation required by EU labour law
needs to be integrated with its own proposed 'step by step' strategy to
enable unions to secure recognition from employers. It talks of a 'twin
track' approach to extend legal rights to individuals as well as unions. The
TUC is convinced unions will be able to show workers as well as employers
that they are needed in the workplace.
As the interim document explains: 'Unions will be able to show that only
they have the resources, independence and track record to provide effective
representation for individuals and to make the best use of information and
consultation machinery.'

FT  08 AUG 94 / Mercosur pact on customs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four member countries of South America's Mercosur trade pact have agreed
on a compromise formula allowing the creation of a customs union on January
1 1995.
The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed on Friday
at a summit in Buenos Aires documents establishing a common external tariff
structure that will come into effect next January.
The four overcame a long-standing dispute between Argentina and Brazil over
common tariffs by agreeing to tariffs of 0-20 per cent for nearly all their
imports. They also compromised over protection for the high-tech goods that
comprise 15 per cent of their trade. Brazil wants to protect its struggling
telecommunications, computer and capital goods industries.
Disagreement over tariffs, plus Brazil's inability to stabilise its economy
and Argentina's informal request to join the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) last year, threatened to disrupt establishment of
Mercosur.
However, Argentina and Brazil agreed that each country would apply separate
tariffs for high-technology goods until next decade, when all four countries
would introduce a common tariff of 14-16 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's leading supplier of medicines for Aids and HIV, Wellcome,
yesterday effectively admitted its second-top selling treatment, the
controversial AZT, would no longer be prescribed on its own.
'The era of monotherapy for the treatment of Aids and HIV is over,' Dr David
Barry, research, development and medical director at Wellcome, told the 10th
International Aids conference in Yokohama. HIV, the virus that causes Aids,
mutates so rapidly that eventually it develops resistance to all
anti-retroviral medicines when they are administered on their own, he says.
AZT is the world's top-selling HIV and Aids treatment.
However, Wellcome's admission is not the end of the AZT story. Dr Barry is
now proposing AZT should be used simultaneously with at least two other
drugs. 'We're talking about three drugs - three magic wands. New data about
combinations of medicines are giving rise to a renaissance of hope for the
control of this disease.'
This hope is based on at least two studies involving three drugs, including
AZT, which Dr Barry presented yesterday. These trials demonstrate that the
medicines can completely stop HIV, the virus that causes Aids, from
replicating. They would not destroy the virus, which would remain in the
body, but it would be controlled by the drugs. Dr Barry believes the drugs
may work together, possibly halting different parts of the virus's
life-cycle and possibly attacking the virus in different parts of the body.
Wellcome and Dr Barry are anxious not to be over-optimistic. 'We have not
yet tried to repeat the test-tube data in humans,' he stresses. 'But it
appears that two drugs are better than one, and three drugs are better than
two. With three drugs, we appear to reach a threshold. This was true of
tuberculosis, when researchers 40 years ago discovered three drugs were
required to defeat the disease, and it's probably true for HIV.'
'We need to identify the most effective and best-tolerated agents which can
completely suppress viral replication and thus suppress the development of
resistance over an extended period. Such trials are not only possible but
urgently needed,' he said. Dr Barry plans to start these trials next month.
The patients would be those who were HIV-positive and with CD4 counts of
between 200 and 400. CD4 is one of the most important measures of the
performance of the immune system.
The studies would include combinations of AZT, Roche's ddC and the same
company's protease inhibitor, Saquinavir; AZT, Bristol-Myers Squibb's ddI,
and Boehringer-Ingelheim's Nevirapine; AZT, ddI and 3TC, a drug discovered
by Biochem Pharma of Canada and partly developed by Glaxo; and AZT, ddC, and
Nevirapine.
Dr Barry believes it should take less than two months to find the 100
patients for each arm of the trial. All of the trials involve AZT because
combinations with that drug appear more powerful than those without. The
three drugs should be given simultaneously, rather than adding them one by
one, says Dr Barry. This avoids the virus building up resistance to each of
the drugs separately. For that reason the new trials will involve only those
people who have not previously taken AZT or other anti-viral drugs.
Although AZT has a reputation for being toxic, Dr Barry does not expect
severe reactions to the drug because the combinations chosen have relatively
low toxicity and do not interact. The initial data will be ready by this
time next year, says Dr Barry. 'Even with the triple therapy, we don't know
if the disease will progress in five or 10 years. We don't know the duration
of benefit, but it should certainly be longer than at present.'

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concern was growing last night about the welfare of Nigeria's detained
opposition leader, Mr Moshood Abiola.
Mr Abiola's aides said he had refused to accept the conditions for his
release on bail, set by a high court judge whose intervention on Friday was
sanctioned by the military government.
The terms prevent the opposition leader from talking to the press or
addressing public gatherings.
Mr Abiola is the deposed winner of last year's general election who has been
jailed on treason charges for proclaiming himself president.
The oil workers' strike in support of Mr Abiola continued over the weekend.
Union leaders will decide today whether to resume a general strike which was
suspended last Friday.
Mr Abiola's staff say that he was moved every few hours between different
prisons in Abuja until they lost contact with him on Saturday night.
'They are keeping him incommunicado because we were able to frustrate the
attempted bail order on Friday,' said one of Mr Abiola's assistants in
Lagos. 'But we are worried because so far they have refused to allow access
to his doctor and lawyer,' he said.
Mr Abiola's lawyers have not petitioned for bail but for unconditional
release and for all the treason charges to be struck out.
Until Friday's emergency hearing, the high court in Abuja had been adjourned
until August 16, when the judge is due to rule on whether the court has
jurisdiction to try the case.
Leaders of the 41 trade unions in the Nigeria Labour Congress will meet in
Lagos to decide whether to re-instate or to call off for good the stoppage
while Mr Abiola remains in jail.
The decision was postponed from Saturday, because Mr Pascal Bafyau and other
NLC leaders had not returned from Abuja, where they were involved in a
failed attempt to break the political deadlock by securing conditional bail
for Mr Abiola.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Power review poised to please City but irk users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is likely
to face severe criticism on Thursday when he announces price controls which
could cut household bills from next April by more than 3 per cent.
His review, which will determine the profits of the 12 English and Welsh
power distribution companies for the next five years, is widely expected to
be tougher than last month's price limits for water companies.
But the market remains optimistic, and electricity shares have risen sharply
recently. Consumer groups and opposition political parties are expected to
condemn the price cuts as inadequate in light of the growth in profits of
regional electricity companies.
Analysts expect Prof Littlechild to cut the average base distribution price
 -which accounts for about a quarter of final bills but 80 per cent of
profits - by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in April 1995. He is then
expected to limit price increases between 1996 and the year 2000 to 2
percentage points below inflation.
The average range is wide largely because few people have any clear idea of
the methodology being employed by Prof Littlechild in making his decisions.
It seems almost certain, however, that the rate of annual increase from 1996
will be common across the sector while the initial cut in distribution
prices next April will vary from company to company.
Mr Nigel Hawkins of stockbroker Hoare Govett expects the range for the base
reduction to be tight, with cuts of between 12 per cent and 18 per cent for
individual companies.
Most analysts expect Eastern and Southern Electricity to be well placed in
this regard, while the regulator is likely to take a tougher approach to
South Western and Swalec.
Brokers SG Warburg, in a note published today, expect an average reduction
of 10 per cent in distribution prices next year and an annual real increase
of RPI minus 3 percentage points afterwards. This is not expected to be too
painful for shareholders, however. Warburg is confident the sector can
return 7 per cent real dividend growth between 1995 and 2000 assuming
companies are prepared to reduce cover to two times.
'Even under the most draconian prospects, real dividend growth of at least 4
per cent is sustainable,' it says. The real risk for shareholders was
whether electricity companies would decide to exercise their right to appeal
against the regulator's decision to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
One analyst said after talks with most of the 12 companies that he did not
expect referrals to the commission. 'They are in a jubilant mood,' he said.
He was now forecasting a base reduction of 14 per cent and annual increases
of 2 percentage points below inflation, which would allow real dividend
growth of 6 per cent.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Heatwave boosts already rising Vimto sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of Vimto, the soft drink best known in the Midlands and north of
England, have risen 15 per cent in the recent heatwave after increasing
steadily for 10 years, Maurice Samuelson writes.
Launched by an industrial chemist 86 years ago in Manchester, where it is
still made from 29 ingredients, Vimto was first marketed as a pick-me-up at
a time when many families could not afford a visit from the doctor.
The managing director and finance director of J. J. Nicholls, the company
that produces Vimto, are grandsons of the founder. The drink has become so
much of an institution it is the subject of a travelling exhibition,
currently at Gunnersbury Park in west London. The advert shown dates from
the late 1930s.
About 60 per cent of the drink is still sold in its traditional heartlands.
Once favoured by the UK temperance movement, its main export sales go to the
teetotal markets of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Credit check plan on hold: Banks suspend change to company
probes on customers' status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks have yielded to protests against forcing companies to contact
customers' bank branches when checking credit.
Banks have agreed to continue temporarily with a modified version of the old
system, which allows companies to make inquiries through their own banks.
Organisations including the Association of British Factors and Discounters
told banks that their members would have to pay thousands of individual
cheques to bank branches under the new system, adding substantially to
costs.
The change was proposed by the British Bankers' Association because of
concern that banks do not seek their customers' consent before providing
credit references under the status inquiry system.
The bankers proposed that companies should be required to seek individuals'
written consent for credit checks, and to pay the bank branch doing the
work. Banks have set charges of between Pounds 7 and Pounds 9 for each
check.
Bankers have now decided, however, to allow companies to continue checks
through their bank. Talks have started on how to simplify payments.
But the association has resisted calls from groups such as the Institute of
Credit Management for a 'two-tier' system under which companies could check
the credit of other companies without obtaining written consent.
The bankers introduced 'transitional arrangements' for bulk users of status
inquiries when it changed the system in March.
It originally intended these arrangements to last only until July, but has
just extended them further.
Mr Gareth Davies, who is representing the institute in talks with the
association, said some users had protested at having to gain written consent
because 'although it may be a good thing philosophically, it is hard in
practical terms'.
However, Mr Davies said most companies had now accepted the need for
consent. They were pressing for a means of payment which would not involve
staff having to write thousands of cheques for differing amounts to bank
branches.
Mr Andrew Mason, assistant director of the association, said that a possible
way of simplifying payments would be for companies to send all check
requests to central offices of banks, which would dispatch them to branches.
Banks have pressed for branches to be paid individually in order to end the
former system of cross-subsidies, under which a branch of Midland might
carry out work on behalf of a Barclays branch without being paid.
The old system was also criticised for allowing private detectives to mount
'fishing expeditions' about individuals' accounts. The association wanted to
stop banks routinely disclosing information to each other.
The institute protested to Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
who replied that he understood its worry.

FT  08 AUG 94 / China to assess state assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China plans a nationwide survey to assess the value of assets of some
150,000 state-owned enterprises, as part of its efforts to salvage an
indebted state sector and establish procedures for the sale of state assets.
The official China Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the survey
was aimed at improving the management of state assets and follows a pilot
project last year that found 10,000 state-owned companies had understated
their assets by 42 per cent, or Yn180bn (Pounds 13.3bn).
Assessing the true value of their assets has become one of the most vexed
issues facing China's economic reformers in their efforts to rescue
faltering state enterprises whose best hope of survival lies in being
converted to shareholding companies or merged with other enterprises,
securing foreign partners, or being sold to the private sector. But
questions over the real value of assets in a country where markets are
primitive has become a sensitive political issue, with claims that the
state's birthright is being squandered.
The State Asset Management Bureau estimates that 'losses' of state assets,
mostly by undervaluation, amounted to Yn500bn in the past decade. The bureau
also said two-thirds of state businesses setting up joint ventures with
overseas companies had not properly evaluated their assets.
The State Council, China's cabinet, issued regulations last month requiring
proceeds from the sale of state assets to be lodged in a central fund which
would be used to 'promote the development of large and medium-sized state
enterprises', according to China Daily.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Israel close to trade conflict with Europe: Officials have
attacked the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel may be making peace with Arab states but it seems on the brink of
trade conflict with the European Union.
In recent days Israeli officials have bitterly attacked the EU, its main
trading partner, for a 'complete lack of political vision' in negotiations
over a new free trade agreement and threatened to take trade sanctions and
switch public procurement from European to US companies.
Officials negotiating the new accord aimed at reducing Israel's Dollars
5.7bn (Pounds 3.67bn) trade deficit with member states say the EU has
refused to make concessions which recognise the political and economic
sacrifices Israel has made to achieve Middle East peace.
Israel's campaign to be granted a special status with vastly improved access
to research and development programmes and agricultural markets has been
blocked in two rounds of negotiations earlier this year originally aimed at
completing a new agreement by December.
Israel says it deserves a special agreement tailored to its developed
economy in recognition of the economic concessions it is making to Arabs -
such as opening its agricultural market to Palestinian produce - as part of
the Middle East peace accords.
'We are not asking the EU to contribute to the political and economic
stability of the new Middle East by granting us jets and tanks but by giving
us access to their markets,' said Mr Oded Eran, the co-head of the Israeli
negotiating team. 'We are asking them to have the vision of the US to
recognise the political and economic risks we are taking for peace and to
allow us to be more bold in future talks and economic arrangements with Arab
neighbours.'
Israeli frustration at EU obstruction led Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister, to warn recently that unless the EU showed more flexibility in
trade negotiations, Israel would consider switching some of its public
procurement away from the EU and flexing its 'tremendous purchasing power'.
Israel's public procurement programme is worth Dollars 6bn a year, a
significant part of which goes to buy goods and services from EU states.
Officials also said the government could consider giving incentives to the
private sector to import from non-EU states. Total imports from the 12 EU
members and the four associate members last year was more than Dollars 11bn.
Mr Rabin is known to be particularly angry and impatient about the EU's
opposition to Israel's demands. Other Foreign Ministry officials play down
the row and the threats and say a favourable agreement will be concluded.
'We are merely looking for a free opportunity for our exports into the
backyard of our economy and with our natural ally,' Mr Uri Savir, foreign
ministry director general, said yesterday.
'Jacques Delors spoke about Israel's special place in Europe and I believe,
despite the problems, Israel is more pro-Europe and Europe is more
pro-Israel than ever before.'
Israel says new EU agreements with Eastern Europe and Magreb states, and
changes in Israeli production have eroded the concessions of the existing
1975 agreement or made them obsolete.
Jerusalem is seeking concessions in five major areas - research and
development; flour exports; citrus fruits; competition for EU public
procurement tenders in communications; and a revision of the rules of origin
to expand Israeli high-tech and textile exports into the EU market.
Mr Eran says the greatest disappointment is in research and development
where Israel is seeking to participate in the EU's 'Fourth Programme'. The
Commission originally recommended Israel be granted 'Full Association' of
the programme but the move has been blocked by France, Britain, Belgium and
Ireland.
Israel says it deserves entry to the programme because it invests 3 per cent
of GDP a year in research and development. It is also prepared to pay the
full entry fees of Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m a year and sign all necessary
treaties to protect intellectual property.
In the flour sector Israel is seeking an increase in its preferential quota
of exports from 19,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes a year. In agriculture it
wants an improvement in the trade of fresh and processed products, a shift
in existing quotas to new products not covered by the 1975 agreement.
Israel would also like a relaxation in the EU rules of origin and an
agreement on a mutual recognition of standards, tests and certificates to
allow greater access of Israeli textiles and high-tech products. Israel
wants its companies to be able to compete for public procurement contracts
in the communications sector and says the EU's demand for opening all
sectors of public procure ment to mutual competition would worsen its trade
deficit.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Clashes prompt Cuban police to seal off port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuban police have blocked roads leading to Havana's port following a rare
outbreak of civil disorder in which police clashed with anti-government
protesters nearby and in two other parts of the city over the past four
days.
The clashes left two policemen dead and followed the hijacking of ferries by
Cubans fleeing to the US.
The police also increased patrols in the Plaza de Maceo and the Paula
Boulevard in Havana, the capital. This followed the arrest of several people
after supporters and opponents of the government had fought with metal bars
and sticks.
Describing the disorder as a US 'strategy' to entice Cubans to leave the
island, President Fidel Castro threatened to allow thousands of Cubans to
leave for the US. The US government has said Cubans should stay calm and not
be caught by a 'dirty trick' by the Cuban government.
There were indications last night that the US government was considering an
increase in its naval presence in the waters between the Caribbean island
and the Florida peninsula, to deter Cubans fleeing their country.
The clashes, unusual for Cuba in the past 15 years, were followed by what
diplomats in Havana said yesterday was a 'perceptible' increase in political
tension in the city.
It was not clear how the policemen were killed, but President Castro said
they were part of a contingent of officers which had tried to prevent a
group of Cubans from commandeering a ferry and taking it to the US.
A ferry, which was hijacked by Cubans two weeks ago, was intercepted by US
ships and 15 of the 30 people on board asked to be returned home. Another 76
people asked to be returned to Cuba when US boats intercepted another
hijacked ferry on Wednesday, with 32 asking to go to the US.
Mr Castro said at the weekend that his government had provided all
facilities for Cubans to emigrate to the US and that the latest disorder was
part of a US strategy intended to 'create discontent'. The US State
Department asked the Cuban government not to use force against dissidents
but Washington is apparently concerned about a possible flood of refugees.

Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, tried to calm tensions between
Syria and Israel yesterday after a weekend surge of violence on the
Israeli-Lebanese border overshadowed his current Middle East peace shuttle.
The renewal of Arab-Israeli violence comes in spite of dramatic recent peace
moves between Israel and its neighbours, crowned today by the opening of a
new Red Sea border between Israel and Jordan.
Pro-Iranian Lebanese guerrillas of the Hizbollah killed two Israeli soldiers
at the weekend in Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon
and fired salvos of rockets into northern Israel which slightly wounded
three children. The Hizbollah attacks came after Israeli jets bombed an
apartment building in south Lebanon on Thursday killing seven people.
Israel and Syria yesterday traded accusations. Syria said Israel had stepped
up its military attacks in south Lebanon in order to sabotage Mr
Christopher's efforts to break a deadlock in Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
'The escalation in south Lebanon is a firm proof that Israel is trying to
direct a severe blow to the US efforts aimed at rescuing the peace process,'
said the official Syrian daily Tishreen. 'The one who wants peace does not
kill peace with bombardment and does not resort to destruction and
massacres.'
Israel earlier accused Syria of not preventing attacks by Hizbollah in
southern Lebanon. 'It is clear the Syrians, if they want, are able to
influence the Lebanese government to constrain the activities of Hizbollah,'
said Gen Ehud Barak, Israeli army chief. 'Unfortunately, they don't want to
do it until now. As long as they are not doing it we are determined to keep
fighting.'
Mr Christopher met Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister,
in Jerusalem before flying to Damascus yesterday where he held five hours of
talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
In Jerusalem, he said he had intervened to prevent an escalation of violence
which 'underscores the need for a peaceful resolution of these problems'.
Despite the hostilities he remained cautiously optimistic about making
incremental progress in stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which focus on a
return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in return for peace.
Israeli officials said Mr Christopher was pursuing possible detailed
scenarios of the timetable and phases of an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan and what security measures, such as demilitarisation, would be taken
at what stage. Publicly, however, Syria insisted that there would be no
progress until Israel stated clearly that it would withdraw fully from the
Heights.
Mr Christopher will attend an Israeli-Jordanian border ceremony today, 3.5km
north of Eilat.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Whitewater probe plea by Panetta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House yesterday urged the new Whitewater special counsel not to
reopen investigations already resolved by his predecessor.
Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of staff, said he hoped Mr Kenneth Starr would
'not trample over old territory time and time again.' Mr Starr said he came
to the job with 'no preconceptions' but declined all substantive comment
pending discussions due to start tomorrow with his predecessor, Mr Robert
Fiske, who has already cleared government officials of attempting to
obstruct justice.
Mr Panetta also insisted that 'at this point in time' President Bill Clinton
retained full confidence in senior treasury and White House personnel,
including Mr Roger Altman, the deputy secretary of the treasury. Mr Lloyd
Cutler, White House legal counsel, said Mr Altman had been a key member of
the team responsible for the current economic expansion.
Mr Altman's resignation has been demanded by several members of Congress
because he had briefed the White House on the status of criminal
investigations into Madison Guaranty. This is the now defunct Arkansas
savings and loan bank implicated in the real estate ventures and financial
dealings of Mr and Mrs Clinton in their home state over the last 15 years.
Mr Starr, a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan and later
solicitor general in the Bush administration, was named late on Friday to
take over from Mr Fiske by a special judicial panel acting under the terms
of the renewed Independent Counsel Act.
The panel said it was not impugning Mr Fiske's integrity but that the
investigation should be conducted by someone not appointed by the
administration.
The selection of Mr Starr comes as a disappointment to the White House, and
not merely because it had no reason to be displeased with Mr Fiske's
findings to date. A new independent counsel suggests a longer investigation,
with a final report conceivably delayed until the 1996 presidential election
year.
Last January Mr Starr was on the shortlist considered by Ms Janet Reno, the
attorney general, before she named Mr Fiske, a lifelong Republican. But some
of Mr Starr's subsequent comments have been seen as hostile to the
president.
This summer, he took public issue with Mr Cutler's contention that civil
lawsuits against a sitting president (in this instance the sexual
harassment-related case brought by Ms Paula Jones) should be deferred until
the president had left office. Mr Starr found this argument 'astonishing'
and reportedly considered filing an 'amicus curiae' brief on Ms Jones's
behalf.
The circumstances of his appointment to the Whitewater case are also
controversial. Last month, a group of right-wing members of congress wrote
to Judge David Sentelle, head of the special panel, complaining about Mr
Fiske's impartiality, as did Mr Floyd Brown, an ultra-conservative activist.
Judge Sentelle, a Reagan appointee to the bench refused to comment on
whether these letters had played any part in the panel's deliberations. No
mention of them was made in its ruling, however.

Hyundai Heavy Industries, South Korea's largest shipyard, says it has lost
Won338bn (Pounds 274m) in sales as a result of a strike by its workers that
began on June 24.
The Korea Federation of Small Business warned that continuation of the
Hyundai strike could push many of HHI's 1,500 suppliers close to insolvency.
Labour disputes at HHI have become an almost annual event since 1987, when
the trade union movement was freed from government controls.
Strikes last year at HHI and other Hyundai companies cost the country's
largest conglomerate an estimated Won900bn in lost sales.
The small business association urged the government to call for emergency
arbitration in the dispute and punish the HHI workers who have been
occupying the shipyard since the company imposed a lock-out on July 20.
Although the government recently warned that it would get tough with
striking workers, it believes that police intervention to break the HHI
strike could trigger labour unrest in other ind-ustries.
The Hyundai trade unions are known as being the country's most militant.

FT  08 AUG 94 / International Press Review: A bone to chew but not much red
meat - Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's press seized the opportunity to probe the weaknesses of the
country's centre-left coalition government following publication of a report
last week into the Irish beef industry.
Despite attempts by the government to play down the report ahead of its
publication, expectation was high in Dublin that the three-year inquiry  -
which had already contributed to the downfall of one government in 1992 -
would be critical of the role of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, for
granting IPounds 100m (Pounds 99m) of export credit insurance for beef
exports to Iraq more than six years ago.
Irish papers had all dutifully carried statements from Mr Reynolds - ahead
of the report's publication but after it had gone to the government - that
he had been 'totally vindicated', that he had 'acted in the national
interest' and that 'there was no political favouritism in his decisions'.
However, there was still the possibility that the Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition, already weakened by a series of minor political embarrassments,
might break. Mr Reynolds' statement, issued by the government spokesman,
intensely irritated the deputy prime minister, Mr Dick Spring, who leads
Labour, the junior coalition party.
In a late-night phone call to the Irish Times from his home in Tralee,
County Kerry, after the release of Mr Reynolds' statement, Mr Spring made it
clear that it did not reflect the view of the government collectively.
Thus the scene was set. Leaks to the mid-market broadsheet Irish Independent
seemed to back Mr Reynolds' verdicton the report, but the truth would only
be known last Tuesday afternoon when the media received copies of the
1,400-page report.
Mr Reynolds' vindication turned out to be something less than total. 'While
it does indeed clearly uphold Mr Reynolds' integrity by quashing suggestions
that he acted for improper motives, it contains strong criticism of the
manner and the effect of the decisions on export credit insurance, which he
took in 1987 and 1988,' reported the Irish Times.
Interest was focused on Mr Spring's response. After all, it was questions in
the Irish parliament by Mr Spring and others that had led to the inquiry in
1991. The deputy prime minister's 1,000-word response was scoured for any
direct criticism of Mr Reynolds. However, all that could be found was some
implicit blame in a sentence describing the export credit insurance affair
as 'a major failure of public policy. . . a policy disaster'.
Strong words, but unlikely to bring the government down: 'Hardly the words
of a man planning to go it alone,' pointed out the Irish Times in its
editorial on the report. The Irish Independent saw them as potentially more
serious, remarking in its editorial yesterday: 'It is inconceivable
therefore that political relations between the two men will ever be the same
again or that the coalition can be anything but a very shaky structure from
now on.'
On the Wednesday immediately after the report's publication, both Mr
Reynolds and Mr Spring moved publicly to play down the possible damage to
the coalition from the report. However, their efforts were frustrated by the
chairman of the Labour party, Mr Jim Kemmy, who told the Irish Times that
the report would have 'serious implications' for the coalition and that the
whole issue of the Labour party remaining in coalition would have to be
discussed at a parliamentary party meeting later this month.
But it got no worse than that. By Thursday the Fianna Fail leading daily
tabloid, the Irish Press, had splashed: 'Beef: we stay together' across its
front page, reporting that Mr Spring had moved to heal the rift between the
two parties.
By the end of the week, front-page tension had shifted to the death of three
racehorses at a beach race meeting north of Dublin and public anger was
being vented on the fact that Goodman International, the beef processor at
the centre of the inquiry, was likely to avail itself of the general tax
amnesty to avoid paying penalties on tax underpayments uncovered during the
inquiry, which had cost Irish taxpayers about Pounds 30m.
By yesterday it all appeared to be over, with the Sunday Business Post
claiming: 'Senior Labour sources say the party would have no difficulty in
voting confidence in the Taoiseach later this month when the Dail meets to
debate the outcome of the beef tribunal.'
A month is an eternity in politics, particularly the peculiar brand
practised on this island, but the whole beef tribunal report seems to have
fitted nicely into what the Irish Times described in its editorial of the
day before the report's publication as 'the by now familiar model of the
Labour-party-in-outrage-for-a-while. First the angry invocation of the
party's separate and distinct position; then the hint of threats to match
the sense of outrage; later the announcement that, having looked into the
matter, everything appears to be alright.'

Some 6,000 delegates and observers from Mexico's main radical and leftist
political groups set off for the Lacandon jungle in the southern state of
Chiapas yesterday to participate in a self-styled convention of democracy
convened by Zapatista insurgents.
The convention was called by Sub-Comandante Marcos, the Zapatista spokesman,
after the rebels rejected the government peace proposal for a resolution to
the eight-month old Chiapas conflict.
The Zapatistas launched their rebellion in the impoverished southern state
of Chiapas on New Year's Day.
Mr Marcos has said the delegates will discuss the need for a transitional
government, a new constitution, and a peaceful movement to democracy.
A preliminary round of talks began on Saturday in the city of San Cristobal
de las Casas. In highly disorganised sessions, delegates generally read out
prepared speeches late into the night, mostly supporting Zapatista demands
for an end to rule by Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party and
establishment of a transitional democratic government.
The convention has been dismissed by many as an exercise in propaganda by Mr
Marcos, who commands a force of a few thousand poorly armed peasants based
in the Chiapas jungle, which is encircled by the Mexican army. The
government has done nothing to prevent the event going ahead, insisting that
the meeting and delegates pose no threat to national security.
Even some of those present sought to play down its significance. Mr Pedro
Moctezuma, an aide to presidential candidate Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, attending as an observer,
described the meeting as an exercise in 'verbal therapy' for the left.
Nevertheless the convention has put Mr Marcos at the centre of the political
stage less than two weeks before the presidential election on August 21.
Some are concerned he will use the event to unite radical groups around him
to protest against the election results. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate
of the ruling PRI, is well ahead in opinion polls and is strong favourite to
win.
Many of the delegates said the real objective of the assembly was to press
the government into holding fair elections, and to prepare a common response
if fraud is detected. But those interviewed disavowed violence, claiming, as
Mr Marcos has said in recent interviews, that the convention is intended to
prevent Mexico sliding into civil conflict.
'We believe that Mexico is at a turning-point,' said Mr Javier Estrada, a
34-year-old teacher who travelled 70 hours in a bus from the central state
of Zacatecas to reach the convention. 'We are here to show that civil
society wants a free election and is prepared to act to get it. But we have
to avoid armed struggle.'
Each delegate supposedly represents a popular organisation made up of a
handful to several hundred people, giving them a little more influence than
their small numbers suggest. The large majority seem to support the
presidential candidacy of Mr Cardenas, who has sent observers to the
convention but is keen to maintain his distance from it.
The response to the first day of talks was mixed. 'It was absolutely awful,'
said one writer present as an observer. 'It was a diatribe of leftist,
populist rhetoric.' However, others claimed to be inspired by the
experience. A member of a dissident oil union said that 'after 65 years of
(one party rule) we are going back to political school'.
The convention delegates will be living rough in the Lacandon, where there
is no accommodation for them, running water, electricity or sewage
facilities. The organisers will not let anyone leave the convention until it
ends, probably on Wednesday, and have imposed a news black-out until final
declarations are made.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Liberals back in Quebec election race: On the campaign trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The election campaign which could determine Quebec's future role in Canada
is turning out to be more closely fought than many political observers
predicted.
When Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's prime minister, called the September 12
poll two weeks ago, his ruling Liberal party had been all but written off to
win a third successive term. The Parti Quebecois, whose main goal is to lead
the francophone province to sovereignty, was far ahead in public opinion
polls.
It was widely assumed that Mr Johnson, who took office only last January,
would be unable to turn things around with his diffident style and a new,
inexperienced team.
But those who dismissed Mr Johnson are having to eat their words. A poll
published over the weekend indicates that the Liberals have made strong
gains in the past fortnight. According to the poll, conducted by the Centre
de Recherche sur l'Opinion Publique (CROP) in Montreal, support for the PQ
among decided voters has dropped in the past fortnight from 52 per cent to
48 per cent, while the Liberals have climbed from 42 per cent to 46 per
cent.
If the election were held now, the PQ would probably still win a sizeable
majority of seats in the National Assembly. Much of the Liberals' support is
concentrated among English-speaking and immigrant communities around
Montreal.
On the other hand, the CROP poll suggests that many rural, francophone
voters have begun to have second thoughts about the PQ.
Although the Liberals' campaign has lacked sparkle, it has shone in
comparison to the separatists'. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ leader, began by
attacking Canada's 'straitjacket' federal system, saying Quebec could assure
its social and economic future best by breaking away.
If the PQ won the election, it would immediately pass a National Assembly
resolution proclaiming the goal of separation and begin talks with Ottawa
about ways to achieve this. A referendum on independence would follow within
10 months.
But polls consistently show that while voters favour a change of government,
they are far from wanting separation or independence. Most Quebec voters are
worried by the prospect of losing their Canadian passports, their federal
pensions and unemployment insurance cheques, and possibly the Canadian
dollar.
A new PQ platform stresses 'sovereignty', which to most Quebeckers implies
something less than full independ ence.
Mr Parizeau has repeatedly had to paste over divisions within his own party.
Some of his trusted lieutenants have said a PQ government cannot start the
machinery of separation before the voters make their choice in a referendum.
But this contradicts the party platform and Mr Parizeau's own promises.
Among those presenting a more gradual approach to independence are Mr Lucien
Bouchard, the charismatic leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the federal
counterpart of the PQ which became the official opposition in the federal
parliament in Ottawa in last year's general election.
Mr Bouchard joined the election campaign last week. One senior Liberal says
Mr Bouchard's job is to play the 'good guy' in the PQ campaign. Though he is
unabashedly dedicated to Quebec independence, he says the Quebec election
'should be the first step towards what will come afterwards, the
referendum'.
Mr Parizeau also invited ridicule when he claimed to have obtained 'private
assurances' from US officials that Washington would back an independent
Quebec's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The US State
Department quickly insisted that no such assurances had been given.
Other PQ candidates have touched politically sensitive nerves by suggesting
that an independent Quebec could replace the Canadian dollar with the US
dollar as its currency, and that French-only language laws would be
stiffened after a PQ victory.
Mr Johnson has seized on these inconsistencies. 'Who's in charge?' he asks
rhetorically. The Liberals have tried to hammer home the message that the
best way to create jobs is for Quebec to remain part of Canada. A PQ win,
the Liberals argue, would generate months if not years of economic
uncertainty.
In the run-up to the election, the Liberal government has backed the
reopening of two big pulp mills in PQ strongholds, and has supported other
industrial plants with loan guarantees. Closer to grassroots, it has
introduced measures to force recalcitrant spouses to make child-support
payments on time.
The latest poll clearly shows that these tactics, coupled with the PQ's
gaffes, are turning the tide towards the Liberals. But Mr Johnson still has
a long way to go.

FT  08 AUG 94 / France to tighten security measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government said yesterday it was tightening security measures
after a militant Algerian group warned of reprisals if France failed to free
17 suspected Moslem fundamentalists it has placed under detention.
The warning, which follows a crackdown by France on Moslem militants after
last week's attack on a French embassy building in Algiers, raises concerns
that the violent struggle between fundamentalists and the military-led
Algerian government could trigger incidents in France.
The threat of reprisals was made in a statement issued at the weekend by the
Islamic Salvation Army, linked to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The FIS
has been outlawed by the Algerian government, which in 1992 cancelled a
general election the FIS was poised to win.
'The arrest and detention of these brothers means that France has declared
war on the FIS and on Algerian Moslems,' the statement said. 'France should
renounce this policy of belligerence or it will assume responsibility for
what will happen.'
France rejected the demand, but said it took the threat seriously. It said
that security had been tightened at embassies, airports and railways, while
random police checks on papers and identity cards were also increased.
The 17 activists, rounded up since Thursday, are held at an army camp in
Folembray, north east of Paris. All have been served with expulsion orders.
But the French Interior Ministry said they would not be returned to Algeria,
in the interests of their own safety. They will be detained until a country
is found willing to accept them, according to one government official.
The French crackdown has two aims; to demonstrate firm action following last
week's attack in Algiers in which five French people were killed, and to
send a message to Moslem activists that France will not tolerate the
planning of guerrilla actions within its borders. The militant Armed Islamic
Group, which is more radical than the FIS and its military wing, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
France has criticised the failure of its western partners to take tougher
measures against Algerian Moslem fundamentalists. The accusation has been
rejected by Britain, Germany and the US. But the tough French line has
highlighted differences in policy with its western partners, who see a
greater role for dialogue with moderate Moslem groups.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Ukrainians prosper as state withers away: A three-part
series on the ex-Soviet republic - Ukraine Stirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On paper, Ukraine is on the brink of economic collapse. Production fell by
more than 40 per cent in the first quarter of this year. The government has
no official budget, but if it keeps on spending at its current rate it will
have a deficit of more than 30 per cent by the end of the year. Officials at
the Ministry of Finance estimate hidden unemployment at 2.5m people.
But in defiance of these dire statistics, Ukrainians appear to be living
quite well. The streets of Kiev and other big cities are jammed with flashy
western cars and lined with new, well-stocked shops and expensive
restaurants. The countryside, once squeezed dry to finance Soviet heavy
industry, is now gripped by a construction boom as Ukrainian farmers replace
their modest cottages with sturdy, three-storey brick houses.
'The people we talk to are absolutely flabbergasted at the difference
between the image of Ukraine and the reality,' says Mr Andy Bain, an
American businessman based in Kiev, who believes that 'right now in Ukraine
you can buy attractive assets for pennies to the dollar.'
'I keep asking myself what we're missing,' admits a perplexed official from
a western financial institution. 'It's really a mystery how this country
keeps on going.' Part of the answer, he suspects is that 'no matter how hard
you try, you just can't turn this country into a Zaire.'
One reason why official statistics are a poor yardstick for measuring the
Ukrainian economy is that, 70 years after the Bolshevik revolution, one of
Marx's promises is finally coming true: in Ukraine, the state is withering
away.
In other east European countries, like the Czech republic or Estonia, the
transition from communism to a market economy has been a fairly well-ordered
process, guided by governments with clear plans for the future. But in
Ukraine, the state, laboriously and bloodily constructed over seven decades
of Soviet rule, is being dismantled by default rather than by design.
Thwarted by byzantine government regulations, Ukraine's nascent private
sector - which according to the vastly conservative measure of official
statistics accounted for more than 30 per cent of GNP in the first quarter
of this year - is thriving by circumventing the state.
'Maybe this is a relic of the stubborn mentality of Ukrainian peasants,'
explains Mr Oleksandr Tkachenko, a Kiev journalist in his 20s who left a
secure job with a western news agency to found a private television
production company a few months ago. 'We have a tendency to go ahead and
build our houses and maintain our gardens no matter what the external
circumstances.'
Increasingly, Ukrainians like Mr Tkachenko are doing just that: toiling
steadily in their own business patch despite a government which at times has
seemed determined to create the worst business climate possible.
Ukraine's shambolic, frequently amended tax code can, depending on how you
count, eat up more than 100 per cent of an enterprise's profits. Exporters,
who ought to be a privileged group in a nation burdened by a negative trade
balance, face particularly intimidating legislative obstacles: quotas
restrict their room for manoeuvre, and the compulsory sale of half of hard
currency revenues to the state at artificially low rates means exporters
often come out making a loss.
But Mr Mikhail Chertkov, president of a financial company in Odessa,
explains of regulations, 'Those who are smart find ways around them, those
who aren't have just stopped working.'
At local level, where the government's writ runs weakest, market reforms are
making the most headway. Over the past six weeks there has been a wave of
small-scale privatisation in half a dozen of Ukraine's most progressive
cities.
It was made possible, explains Ms Roberta Feldman of the International
Finance Corporation, which advised on the project, when municipal
governments found a way to work around Ukrainian legislation which blocked
privatisation. Ms Feldman predicts that in the six cities where it is being
employed this strategy will allow all small and medium-size enterprises to
be sold to private owners by the autumn.
While the more agile private sector is quietly getting on with business,
many of the state-owned behemoths which were the pride of Soviet central
planners are dying a slow, lingering death.
Their executioner is Mr Viktor Iushchenko, who since January has been the
author of a monetary policy which even western financial institutions
describe as 'draconian'. Apart from a wave of new credits last month,
granted primarily to farmers, Mr Iushchenko has simply shut down the
printing presses. As a result, inflation, which at the end of 1993 was
exceeding 100 per cent a month, is down to 5 per cent in June.
As Mr Iushchenko admits, this macro-stabilisation 'is fragile because it is
the result of monetary measures alone. Unfortunately, other economic reforms
 -restructuring, privatisation - did not occur to shore up these
developments.'
In the absence of more fundamental reforms, many Ukrainian factories are
effectively going bankrupt: they keep their workers on the books, but have
not paid them for months; theoretically still functioning, they have slashed
production to almost nothing. These are the forces behind plummeting
industrial production, but some businessmen think it no bad thing. 'Our
state officials would never intentionally kill the big state enterprises but
unintentionally that's what they've been doing,' explains Mr Chertkov. 'We
have a Darwinian struggle for survival of the fittest.'
The challenge for Ukraine's new president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, if he hopes to
make good his pledges to his people - and recently to the International
Monetary Fund - to reform the Ukrainian economy, will be to resist the
temptation to revive his country's dying industrial dinosaurs.
Instead, he must, as he has promised, remove government impediments to the
growth of the resilient private sector and to the survival of those state
enterprises able to adapt to the market. If he does, he may find Ukraine
prosperous enough to support those people who will become formally
unemployed when inefficient state factories close their doors.

Eleven people have now died from a cholera outbreak in southern Russia, a
health ministry official said at the weekend. Mr Vasily Agapov, deputy
minister of health, told the Itar-Tass news agency that 256 cases of cholera
had been reported in the Dagestan region of Russia in the Caucasus. Five
towns in the area have been put under quarantine, bus routes to other
regions have been cancelled and air and rail travel has been restricted.
However, one person, believed to have contracted the disease in Dagestan,
has already died of cholera in Moscow. The outbreak of cholera, a disease
historically so prevalent in the country that 'cholera' is a common curse in
spoken Russian, is the most recent of a wave of infectious illnesses in the
former Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday said the European fighter
aircraft, a joint project between Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, should
be scrapped because of soaring costs. But in an interview in Die Welt am
Sonntag Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, continued to defend the aircraft,
which is already behind schedule by two years. Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier,
deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD, said the taxpayer would have to
provide an extra billion D-Marks if the project goes ahead. The federal
audit office last month calculated that the price of each aircraft has
already increased to DM150m (Pounds 62m) instead of earlier estimates by the
Defence Ministry of DM90m. The SPD has consistently argued against the
project following the end of the cold war and the demise of the Warsaw Pact.
But supporters of the aircraft say it will meet western Europe's air defence
needs well into the next century. Mr Ruhe is also under pressure from
Deutsche Aerospace, which is developing the Eurofighter. Dasa is seeking
DM1.2bn more to fund the project.

Workers at Ireland's state-owned flag carrier Aer Lingus threatened
yesterday to disrupt flights next week, stepping up a dispute over
dismissals and cost-cutting. Maintenance workers at the airline's TEAM Aer
Lingus subsidiary are due to meet today to discuss strategy after talks with
the company and mediators fell apart. Union leaders said they expected the
meeting to authorise further action. About 18 flights were delayed at Dublin
airport for up to two hours on Saturday when maintenance staff walked off
the job. Ireland's Labour Court has said it will investigate the row over
attempts to save money in the maintenance division, where 1,300 people have
been dismissed. Unions are refusing to accept a package of redundancies and
a 28 per cent pay cut as part of plans to save IPounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.3m) a
year in government subsidies to the loss-making airline.

An Icelandic trawler was held in the Norwegian port of Tromso last night
after a violent clash in Arctic waters with Norwegian coastguards on Friday
over disputed cod fishing rights. Norwegian authorities were set to bring
charges against the crew of the Hagangur 2, which they accused of firing
shots at coastguard officers attempting to stop the trawler fishing in
Norwegian-controlled protected waters off the Svalbard islands in the
Barents sea. The coastguards fired blank shells at the Icelandic ship during
a subsequent chase before boarding it and escorting it to Tromso. The
Icelanders denied firing directly at the coastguards. It was the most
serious clash to date in a long-running dispute in which Icelandic fishermen
facing diminished cod stocks in home waters are seeking quotas in the
Svalbard area and in another protected zone jointly controlled by Norway and
Russia called the loophole.

The government of Italian prime minister and media magnate Silvio Berlusconi
has launched a TV advertising campaign to try to improve its battered image.
The first of the 45-second slots, accompanied by the slogan 'Facts which
citizens should know to exercise their rights', was broadcast on Saturday
and outlined the achievements of the right-wing coalition government since
its election in March. Mr Berlusconi already controls three private
television channels which opponents say he exploits for his political ends.
Italian law allows the government to use the media to publish information of
'social relevance' but the advertisements have sparked a row over political
bias. The opposition has demanded a similar platform. Mr Mauro Paissan, a
member of the opposition and vice-president of the parliamentary commission
on RAI (state radio and television), criticised Mr Berlusconi. 'These
advertisements that Berlusconi has made are propaganda in favour of the
government and of no help to the citizen at all,' he told Sunday's La
Repubblica newspaper. The government has just weathered a storm over the use
of preventive detention custody and conflicts of interest stemming from Mr
Berlusconi's continuing ownership of Fininvest, the holding company which
groups his many business interests.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's monthly inflation rate fell from 50 per cent in June to 7 per cent
last month following the introduction of a new currency, according to Fipe,
a leading research institute. Although the rate is slightly higher than most
economists expected, it was partly caused by a carry-over of inflation in
the old cruzeiro real currency at the end of June as well as by frosts,
which pushed up food prices. The new Real currency, which is part of a
government anti-inflation plan and linked to Brazil's foreign exchange
reserves, was introduced on July 1. Economists are generally optimistic that
the new currency will keep inflation down in the short term, at least until
presidential elections in October-November, and are forecasting a rate of
1-2 per cent for August. This is expected to benefit the presidential
campaign of former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
negotiated the currency plan through congress. Mr Cardoso, the
centre-right's candidate, is currently neck-and-neck in the polls with Mr
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' party.

<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrats will cut taxes for the low-paid but
introduce a supplementary 10 per cent increase for higher income earners if
they win the next election, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD's main economics
spokesman, said yesterday. The federal elections are due to be held on
October 16. In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, Mr Lafontaine said an SPD
government would also raise energy taxes and abolish the 7.5 per cent
solidarity surcharge on income tax, easing the burden for 80 per cent of
taxpayers. This tax was imposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing
Christian Democrats to help finance the cost of German unification. The SPD,
which is trailing the CDU by eight percentage points in the opinion polls,
is trying to attract the lower paid as well as environmentalists. But its
decision to impose an extra tax burden on high income earners was criticised
when the SPD unveiled part of its economic programme earlier this year.
Mr Lafontaine said lower taxes would be financed in three ways. Married
couples earning over DM120,000 (Pounds 49,600) a year, or DM60,000 for
single people, would pay 'a supplementary charge of 10 per cent. . . which
would produce about DM25bn'. This amount, he said, would finance the cost of
abolishing the solidarity surcharge. Energy taxes for petrol, electricity
and gas would be increased, but Mr Lafontaine did not say by how much. In
addition, tax breaks for married couples would be reduced, raising an
additional revenue of DM11bn.

holding company, over the appointment of Michele Tedeschi as the new
chairman.
The appointment of a new board for Iri, the holding company founded in the
1930s under Mussolini and the symbol of state presence in the economy, has
highlighted the spectrum of opinion on the state's economic role held by the
different members of the government.
The 54-year-old new boss has spent all his working life in various parts of
Iri. Only 14 months ago, he was switched from being Iri's chief executive to
head Stet, the telecoms utility, making way for Prof Romano Prodi - whom he
now replaces. 'We could feel the government was undecided over how to
replace Prodi,' observed a senior IRI official. 'What we feared most was an
outsider who would take long to learn the ropes at a time when IRI is
focusing on delicate privatisation issues.'
It took the Berlusconi government two months to decide on a replacement for
Prof Prodi, who resigned in May, and the appointment of Mr Tedeschi was a
last-minute compromise within the right-wing coalition. The compromise is
the outcome of a tortuous attempt to find a consensus in the government
between two different approaches to the future of Iri.
At one extreme were those like the members of the populist Northern League
who regard the state holding as wholly irrelevant to a modern market
economy. They believed Iri should be wound up as soon as possible through an
accelerated process of privatisation and debt write-offs. At the other end
of the spectrum, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance was reluctant to see
Iri disappear, especially in economically depressed southern Italy. The MSI
felt a state holding had an essential role in certain strategic sectors such
as defence and other areas of high technology.
In the middle of these contrasting approaches, the government's economic
team took a more sanguine view. They saw their priority as improving the
precarious state of Iri's finances and giving the right signals to the
markets on continued privatisation - especially telecoms, next on the list.
In this it is significant that Mr Tedeschi has a long experience in the
telecommunications sector and comes directly from helping to prepare the
Stet privatisation.
The new six-man board reflects the sense of political compromise by
containing elements of all these views. The treasury, the ministry with the
most powerful say, has ensured that Mr Mario Draghi, the director-general
and a key figure on the previous board, remains. The prime minister's Forza
Italia movement has placed as its candidate Mr Diego Della Valle, the
41-year-old head of the highly successful Tods shoe group. His appointment
is the first occasion a real entrepreneur has been allowed near Iri's
decision-making process.
The MSI succeeded in nominating two board members sympathetic to the
movement's ideals - Mr Roberto Tana, a company executive, and Mr Giuseppe
Urciuoli, a southern industrialist. The League is represented by Mr Enrico
Zanelli, a northern corporate lawyer, while the minor partner in the
coalition, the Christian Democratic Centre, has a voice through the sixth
board member, banker Mr Piero Gnudi.
The more intriguing question is whether Mr Tedeschi will have a free hand to
formulate policy or whether he will be tied by the conflicting tensions
within the coalition. The first signs are that Mr Tedeschi wants to get his
own way and he has proceeded quickly to place his nominees in Stet. The
broad outlines of Iri's restructuring he planned himself anyway almost two
years back. These were then refined and hastened by Prof Prodi.
Under Prof Prodi the process of slimming Iri began in earnest. Within the
last year it has sold the bulk of its financial/banking assets (Credito and
Comit), privatised most of SME, the agro-industrial group, and split the
loss-making Ilva, with special steels just sold to a German-Italian
consortium. Asset disposals for 1993-1994 are due to bring over L3,700bn
(Pounds 1.53bn), part of which has already been used to reduce the debt
stock.
The main immediate problem remains financial. Iri last year recorded losses
of L10,191bn on a turnover of L80,000bn. This was due to a combination of
the cost of servicing L75,000bn in debt and the restructuring of steel
(Ilva), shipbuilding (Fincantieri) and civil construction business
(Iritecna). This restructuring, plus privatisation revenues, should cut 1994
losses to L1,360bn. However, some L20,000bn of debt is still considered at
risk. The rest has been mainly contracted by strong cash-flow members of the
group - Stet, and its autostrada division.
In his first comments Mr Tedeschi, said this week: 'In parallel with
improving Iri's finances, one must speed up and go on with privatisation -
whether those on the table like SME and Ilva at Taranto (flat steel
products) or those which must be quickly made operational, particularly
Stet.'
Knowing Iri from the inside means he can start work immediately. But such
knowledge will not necessarily help him navigate the political minefields
ahead. In the case of the remaining SME privatisation - GS-Autogrill
supermarkets and autostrada restaurants - political differences have already
surfaced, Last month the sell-off was postponed until September because the
MSI raised objections over the pricing.
But behind this move lies MSI's broader concern over the break-up of the Iri
empire. This is also evident in MSI's anxiety to avoid Alitalia, the
national carrier controlled by Iri, passing out of direct state control. The
neo-fascists find more support for their corporatist philosophy when it
comes to discussing the defence industries and high technology which are now
concentrated in Finmeccanica, the industrial and financial holding.
Here it would probably be fair to say that a majority in the government
still instinctively likes the idea of a state presence in the businesses
controlled by Finmeccanica. In other words, Mr Tedeschi is unlikely to
become a glorified liquidator of Iri. Rather, he will preside over the
slimming down and refining of the state holding's presence in the economy,
and privatisation will not always mean the surrender of state control of
management.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs prepare to stand alone

Bosnian Serbs have begun mobilising their resources to withstand increasing
isolation, maintaining a defiant stand against international pressure to
make peace in Bosnia.
But they averted the threat of further Nato air strikes by returning heavy
weapons, including a tank, taken from a United Nations compound.
The Nato air strike on Friday, the first for four months, coincided with
signs that the Serbian government in Belgrade may be serious about enforcing
an economic blockade against ties with its intransigent kinsmen in Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, at the weekend ordered all
able-bodied adults to report to compulsory work brigades, as the territory -
which has been completely dependent on aid from Belgrade - appeared in
danger of becoming paralysed.
'It seems to us that we have to grow up to be separate from our mother and
to be older and adult, and we have to fight,' Mr Karadzic told Reuters news
agency. Bosnian Serbs are now 'totally, totally alone', he said.
Mr Karadzic spoke after Belgrade government officials stopped hundreds of
trucks from crossing from Serbia into Bosnia. He acknowledged that he must
do without Belgrade's lifeline of arms, fuel and other supplies.
Another high-ranking official also signalled determination to defy the
tightening cord around them. Bosnian Serbs were ready to endure indefinite
isolation, said Mr Aleksa Buha. 'We don't have any choice. We have to
survive even in this isolation.'
But Mr Buha, foreign minister of the self-declared Bosnian Serb state, hoped
Belgrade's embargo against its kinsmen in Bosnia would not last.
'Fuel is a problem but we will have to deal with it in various ways,' he
said. 'I would think the pressure from Belgrade will not be a long-term
pressure.'
He reaffirmed the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan sponsored by
the five-nation contact group of the US, Russia, Britain, France and
Germany. The plan, which would amount to effective partition of Bosnia,
would require the Bosnia Serbs to give up a large area of land they at
present occupy.
In Belgrade, an efficient propaganda machine has swung into action, designed
to convey the impression that Serbia is united in its support for President
Slobodan Milosevic over Bosnia.
Tough border controls were still being enforced yesterday at crossing points
along the river Drina, but little was being shown of it on state-controlled
television.
Mr Milosevic is apparently intent on bringing Mr Karadzic to his knees, but
does not want to run the risk of generating sympathy for the Bosnian Serbs
through TV or press portrayal of Bosnian Serb hardship.
Internal Serbian politics are murky and complicated. Mr Milosevic's move to
isolate Serb kinsmen across the River Drina may anger the right, led by the
hardline nationalist and former ally Mr Vojisl Seselj. The Yugoslav army -
whose leadership has been purged several times by Mr Milosevic - is also an
unknown quantity.
Gen Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army leader, opposes the international
peace plan, but has not been seen during recent meetings of the Bosnian Serb
leadership. His role is crucial - particularly the question of where he
stands on the dispute between Mr Milosevic and Mr Karadzic.
The crisis within the Serbian camp has been brewing for months. For Mr
Milosevic the looming fear was that stricter financial sanctions by the west
would endanger the new super dinar currency - the backbone of rump
Yugoslavia's fragile economic stabilisation plan. Mr Dragoslav Avramovic,
national bank governor, said last week that if UN sanctions against Serbia
were not lifted soon 'it's all over for us in three weeks.'
To that end, Serbia yesterday was maintaining its tough policy of strict
controls at the border and of keeping phone links cut.
Mr Milosevic has made no secret of his desire to get Mr Karadzic out of
power.
But Mr Karadzic sounds more accommodating towards the man who originally put
him in power. 'We do understand that Yugoslavia cannot support us any
longer,' he said. The Bosnian Serb cabinet also said it was still ready to
hold further talks - but repeated its determination to 'preserve the vital
interests of the Serb people'.
Russia at the weekend endorsed the Nato air strike against the Bosnian Serbs
on Friday and called on them to give a final answer to the western-brokered
peace plan.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Russia finds new heroes in the nouveaux riches
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Sergei Mavrodi, the president of the troubled MMM pyramid scheme,
was arrested in a dramatic raid last week a crowd of angry Russian investors
gathered outside his apartment. But instead of baying for the blood of the
man who gave them a painful initiation into the rites and risks of
capitalism, the investors clutched banners reading 'Hands off Mavrodi]'.
The strange mood of the investors - who have seen the value of their MMM
stock tumble from Pounds 35 to 77p over the past two weeks - is part of a
broader transformation gripping Russia. For 70 years party apparatchiks
ruled this country but, increasingly, Russia's new heroes are its
capitalists.
Moscow's bustling streets bear witness to the fact that Russia is in the
grip of a cash fever. For the first time since the Bolshevik revolution
thousands of Russians have become extremely wealthy, and although many of
Russia's new capitalists work as hard as any Wall Street banker after dusk
they have none of the western bourgeoisie's inhibitions about flaunting
their newly acquired riches.
The most bruised egos in Moscow today belong to foreigners, once the city's
unchallengeable upper crust but now a pale shadow of Russia's new
biznesmeny. A few years ago, only foreigners could escape the wretched
Soviet world of queues and scarcity but today they have begun to mutter
about their enfeebled lot. 'I can't dine in Moscow's best restaurants very
often any more, only the Russians are rich enough to afford them,' complains
one British businessman.
One of Moscow's top pop radio stations recently replaced its American disc
jockey with a Russian after advertisers said that their best customers were
now locals. The English language billboards advertising western consumer
goods which invaded Moscow a few years ago are steadily being replaced by
Russian advertisements.
Even western diplomats have begun to complain that the most beautiful
Russian girls no longer grace their receptions, preferring to be feted by
Moscow's homegrown nouveaux riches.
Moscow's health clubs are dominated by muscle-bound Russians sporting gold
chains. On Sundays they escort girls in bikinis and full make-up to the
Chaika swimming pool, once a foreign enclave.
The new assertiveness of Russia's elite was on display this weekend at
Marika, one of Moscow's trendiest night clubs where the cover charge is a
hefty 150,000 roubles (Pounds 45). This Saturday night, the American boys
were on the defensive. The electronic message board flashed slogans in
Cyrillic rather than in English. Forlornly eyeing a scantily clad Russian
girl who was cavorting under Marika's strobe lights with a female friend, a
handsome Princeton graduate explained that he dared not ask her to dance
because the week before he had approached a statuesque blonde with
disastrous results.
Natasha, it emerged, was escorted by a diminutive Russian whose silent
bodyguards made altogether too evident their disapproval of her new
transatlantic friendship.
Willowy companions such as Natasha are one of the obligatory status symbols
for Moscow's nouveaux riches. The young women - the truly successful
entrepreneur brings along at least one for each arm - are part of a package
that includes a fleet of gleaming Mercedes, and a bevy of burly, gun-toting
bodyguards.
Rich Russians - who range from former Soviet factory directors to a new
breed of entrepreneurs who have graduated from dismal communal apartments to
fabulous wealth - realise that their collective preoccupation with
ostentation is an anomaly.
'An established bourgeoisie is conservative in its habits,' explains Mr
Sergei Zverev, deputy director-general of the Most financial group, owned by
the richest man in Russia, Vladimir Gusinsky. 'But here, everything is
upside down.'
Many ordinary Russians, for whom the extravagances of the nouveaux riches
remain an unattainable marvel, have sensed this transformation, and the
genius of the MMM investment fund was to tap into their desire to become a
part of it.
Mr Mavrodi, who is to be held by police for a further 10 days, offered his
compatriots an ostensibly painless way to acquire that which has replaced
the Communist party card as the ticket to power in the new Russia: capital.

FT  08 AUG 94 / TUC may seek wider rights for employees: Proposal for works
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month's Trades Union Congress will debate proposals that all employees
 -not just union members - should be given new legal rights of workplace
representation.
The proposals, drawn up by the TUC secretariat, led by Mr John Monks, the
general secretary, reflect a radical shift in TUC policymakers' thinking on
future employment law.
Among the ideas to be discussed is the legal right to a German-style works
council in any company in Britain with more than 20 employees, whether or
not they are union members.
The suggestions, in an interim paper, will please Mr Tony Blair, the new
Labour party leader, who opposes special legal privileges for trade unions
but backs workplace rights for workers.
The discussion document cautions, however, that the proposals 'should be
seen as one contribution to the debate' and adds they are not yet being put
forward for adoption as TUC policy. A final decision on the shape of the
proposed new labour laws will come at the 1995 congress.
Britain's trade unions have traditionally favoured workplace representation
only for their own members. But now the TUC staff believes workers in plants
without recognised unions should have 'the legal right to trigger the
formation of statutory employee representation committees which would have a
range of specific information and consultation rights'.
Unions would have rights to recruit, organise and claim recognition 'with
appropriate levels of support', it adds. 'In practice, the new legal rights
for individuals would provide an opportunity for unions to demonstrate the
value of membership.'
The TUC believes the new 'employee representation committees' based on
German works councils should have a legal right to information covering a
company's corporate strategy; its financial affairs; production, sales and
employment projections and restructuring plans.
The committees would also enjoy consultation rights covering grievance and
disciplinary procedures, pensions, equal opportunities, training, working
hours, child care arrangements, new working or production methods and
impending redundancies, closures and business transfers.
The proposed statutory workplace bodies would not deal with collective
bargaining issues such as pay and benefits negotiations.
The TUC secretariat believes trade unions would come to dominate the
proposed committees even if they lack legally exclusive representation, so
there would be 'an institutionalised union presence at the workplace'.
The document also calls for legal rights for collective bargaining.
It proposes an employee representation commission to deal with union
recognition claims where they could not be settled by agreement with
employers.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Triple drug therapy offers hope on Aids, says Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YOKOHAMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New combinations of medicines could restore the normal life expectancy of
people infected with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, according to Dr David
Barry, research, development and medical director, at Wellcome, the UK drugs
group.
At the 10th International Aids conference in Yokohama, Dr Barry spoke
yesterday of renewed hope that illness from HIV infection might finally be
brought under control and that the benefit might be measured in decades
rather than years.
Dr Barry argued that by treating HIV with three drugs simultaneously, the
virus could be stopped from replicating itself. Without the ability to
replicate, the virus would be incapable of mutating strains resistant to
drug therapy, he explained.
Controlled by the medicines, the virus would also be unable to damage the
immune system further. Indeed, the system could recover, leaving it free to
prevent the opportunistic Aids infections, such as pneumonia, that kill Aids
patients.
'This sort of triple therapy would not cure Aids or kill HIV, but it could
allow us to keep the virus at bay, controlling the disease like diabetics
control their condition with insulin,' Dr Barry said.
Claims for effective treatments against Aids and HIV have been made before,
but have proved illusory. Dr Barry's assertion is likely, however, to be
taken seriously by Aids researchers because of his stature in the scientific
community, and the reputation of Wellcome, the world's leading
pharmaceuticals company for the treatment of HIV.
Dr Barry presented data from two combinations of three drugs which, he
claimed, stopped the virus replicating. The first involved Wellcome's AZT
(also known as Retrovir); ddI, a drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb of
the US; and Saquinavir, a treatment of Roche in Switzerland.
The second consisted of AZT, ddI and 3TC, a treatment discovered by Biochem
Pharma of Canada and partly developed by Glaxo Holdings of the UK.
Other trials involving AZT, Roche's ddC and Saquinavir, or AZT, ddC and 3TC
failed to stop the virus replicating, but Dr Barry said this might have been
because doses had been too low.
He stressed the trials had only been carried out in test tubes and not on
humans. He also admitted there were potential limitations to triple therapy.
The ability of the drugs to stop the virus might be limited if the disease
had progressed too far. There was also the possibility the doses required to
control the disease might be too toxic.
Clinical trials involving at least four different combinations of drug would
start in early September, Dr Barry said.

FT  08 AUG 94 / China and Taiwan achieve breakthrough in relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A breakthrough in delicate bilateral talks between China and Taiwan
yesterday helped the two countries reach their first substantive political
agreements since nationalist Chinese forces fled the mainland in 1949.
Eight days of talks in Taiwan ended with agreement to repatriate airline
hijackers and illegal immigrants, and on ways to resolve fishing disputes.
The leaders of both the Chinese and the Taiwanese delegations to the talks
described their agreements as a 'major breakthrough'. A previous attempt to
establish a political dialogue between the two countries in Singapore in
1993 failed.
This time, said Mr Tang Shubei, Beijing's chief delegate at the Taipei talks
and vice-president of the Chinese semi-official body that handles relations
with Taiwan, 'both sides tried to understand the position and views of the
other'. The agreements would be signed at a later, unspecified date by more
senior officials, the two negotiators said.
Under the agreements, hijackers will be repatriated and dealt with in
accordance with the laws of their country of origin. Illegal immigrants may
be repatriated within 20 days after their identity has been established.
China has previously refused to recognise the jurisdiction of Taiwanese
courts.
On the fishing issue, both sides agreed that government vessels from both
sides should be able to mediate in disputes between fishing boats.
The breakthrough appears to have been possible because both sides avoided
addressing sensitive issues concerning sovereignty which have proved a
stumbling block in past talks. Beijing does not officially recognise the
Kuomintang government on Taiwan, while Taiwan has consistently rejected
Beijing's efforts to secure reunification.
However, the Taiwanese government is privately anxious to dispel any idea
that a successful round of meetings might imply the two sides are moving
towards reunification, observers said.
Although the arrival of the mainland Chinese team in Taiwan was accompanied
by sporadic protests, the suave Mr Tang, the highest-ranking Chinese
official to visit Taiwan in 45 years, became so popular with the Taiwanese
news media that the government felt compelled to warn newspapers and

Expectations ahead of the talks were quite low on the Taiwanese side. But
Beijing, anxious to mend fences after the March 31 robbery-murder of 24
Taiwanese tourists in China, which plunged ties to the lowest level in
years, apparently granted Mr Tang leeway to make concessions.

FT  08 AUG 94 / UK companies' profits hit by using Japanese work methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies which are big users of Japanese-style manufacturing
methods - such as 'just-in-time' stock control and total quality management
 -have smaller profit margins than low users or those which do not use them
at all.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study released today by Cambridge
University, which has examined the use of Japanese methods by 68 UK
manufacturers, and their profitability, between 1986 and 1992.
The study found that significant improvements in manufacturing efficiency
could be made through the use of Japanese methods by UK companies, but
'translating these manufacturing improvements into enhanced financial
performance in a fluctuating economic environment is much more problematic'.
Dr Nick Oliver, a lecturer in management studies at Cambridge, said the
study had 'quite profound implications' for the use of such methods in the
UK.
It found that sales per employee were greater for the high users of the
methods from 1987 onwards, and by the end of 1992 were about 30 per cent
higher than those of the low users. But these 'lean' companies using
Japanese methods had lower profit margins than their competitors.
This may have been due to a collapse in their profitability during the
recession of the early 1990s, during which they fared worse than their
buffered counterparts.
One of the high-user companies in the study revealed that its de-stocking
programme had led to problems in ability to meet customer demands, and in
fluctuating market conditions it had lost orders to competitors.
The low users of Japanese methods averaged 64 days of stock compared with 48
days for the high users,
Dr Oliver suggested one other explanation could be that the Japanese
production methods required willing co-operation from the workforce rather
than mere compliance.
In return, workers may have received guarantees that their jobs were safe,
resulting in companies operating with too many staff.

Oliver and Gillian Hunter. Judge Institute of Management Studies, University

FT  06 AUG 94 / High pass marks for new solicitors spark fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Law firms yesterday expressed concern at the high exam marks awarded to
trainee solicitors who have just completed the Law Society's controversial
new exam course.
The firms fear that the introduction of the course has diluted standards and
failed to test students sufficiently.
The College of Law, responsible for training about half of all trainee
solicitors, released results of its legal practice course yesterday which
showed that more than 85 per cent of the 3,339 entrants passed. The pass
rate has been as low as 65 per cent.
More than 80 per cent of those passing achieved a distinction or
commendation. Only 497 students failed to pass and 66 per cent of those will
be resitting just one paper in September.
The new qualification - the legal practice course - replaced Law Society
finals as the solicitors graduate entry qualification. It involves regular
assessments, some based on video, and exams spread throughout the year. The
old Law Society finals were based entirely on end-of-year exams.
According to Mr Richard Holbrook, chairman of the College of Law's board of
management, last year's first-time pass rate was 'in the low seventies'. The
college said it was unable to give exact figures for last year's pass rates.
Mr Trefor John, trainee partner at City law firm Stephenson Harwood, said:
'Generally there must be a concern that the qualification is being
devalued.' He said his view was supported by the mixed reaction of trainees
on the course, some of whom found its standards quite easy to reach.
A partner in another City law firm said: 'We have just seen that most of our
trainees have got distinctions, and I'm sure it's not because we have been
lucky with our recruitment this year.'
Mr Holbrook defended the results, saying that the main reason for the
improved pass rate was the higher standard of candidate.
Ms Anita Tovell, head of personnel at Lovell White Durrant, said it was too
early to judge the new exam. Under the old system, passes could have been
largely the result of good examination technique rather than a test of legal
knowledge.
'It is too early to reach final conclusions,' she added. 'We will wait until
our trainees come into the firm first and then see what benefit they have
gained from the course.'
Freshfields, the London law firm, said yesterday that it had been given
permission to open an office in Hanoi.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Soap war rivals set to clash again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend national newspapers will again be carrying full-page 'soap
wars' advertisements, as Unilever defends its new-generation detergent,
Persil Power, against last weekend's onslaught by arch-rival Procter &amp;
Gamble.
The advertisement in today's papers from Lever Brothers, UK subsidiary of
the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, is headlined 'Why this aerial bombardment?'
in a clear reference to Procter's com-peting soap powder, Ariel.
Last weekend Procter took advertising space to proclaim that 'only Ariel
washes so clean yet so safe'. Persil Power was not named in the
advertisements, but there was reference to the manganese-based 'accelerator'
which is at the centre of the row.
Unilever is promoting the accelerator as the ingredient which allows
superior stain removal at lower washing temperatures. Procter says the
accelerator could damage garments, causing fading and holes, and claimed in
its advertisements last week that residues left in clothes could continue to
cause damage even if consumers switched to another brand of detergent.
Those advertisements led to a complaint to the Advertising Standards
Authority, the advertising watchdog, by Lever Brothers on Monday. Lever
Brothers is challenging the test results quoted by Procter and disputes the
claims of product superiority made for Ariel.
This weekend's Lever Brothers advertisements reiterate the results of tests
com-missioned from independent institutes which are said to have found
Persil Power causes no damage to fabrics.
At the same time, says Lever Brothers, some of the tests showed
'significantly superior cleaning performance' by Persil Power when compared
with 'another leading concentrated powder'.
Mr Tim Hammond, Lever Brothers' detergents marketing director, said that the
new product launch had taken Persil to the number one slot in the UK
detergent market. 'Persil Power has been used in 50m washes by families
across Britain - all of them using product containing the revolutionary
accelerator,' he said.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Independent Whitewater counsel Fiske replaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Whitewater investigations were thrown into some confusion last night
when Mr Robert Fiske was replaced as independent counsel by Mr Kenneth
Starr, former solicitor general in the Republican Bush administration.
A federal appeals court panel, acting under authority granted when the
independent counsel act was renewed earlier this year, ruled it was in the
best interest of 'the appearance of independence' that a person 'not
affiliated with the incumbent administration' be appointed.
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, named Mr Fiske, a Republican, as
independent counsel in January to much bipartisan applause. In July, in line
with the renewed act, she recommended to the court his engagement be
continued.
The court stressed it was not impugning Mr Fiske's integrity or
independence. It made no mention of allegations aired by Republicans in
congressional hearings this week that as a lawyer, he had longstanding
professional relations with lawyers for President Bill Clinton and his
administration that amounted to a conflict of interest.
Republican discontent with Mr Fiske had centred mostly on his interim report
earlier this summer which said Mr Vincent Foster, the former White House
aide, had died by his own hand last summer.
He also cleared administration officials of any criminal violations in
discussing the case against Madison Guaranty, the bankrupt Arkansas savings
bank owned by the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land development
scheme. Two congressional committee have spent the last 10 days grilling
officials on Madison.
It was unclear last night if the status of these findings would now be
called into question. The court order merely gave the new independent
counsel 'full power, independent authority and jurisdiction' over the
Whitewater affair. In a brief statement Mr Fiske promised full co-operation
with Mr Starr and praised Ms Reno for her support. But it seems probable the
investigations will now be stretched out. The administration had hoped the
Whitewater affair would be over by the time the 1996 election season began.
That may now be in doubt.
Mr Starr, also a former judge, is currently in private practice in
Washington.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Chile seeks copper investigations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to ask UK and US regulatory
authorities to investigate a 'series of unusual operations' said to have
been conducted with brokers on the London and New York metals exchanges last
year. Codelco said it might take legal action against the brokers concerned.
Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, lost up to Dollars 270m
(Pounds 174.1m) between September 1993 and January of this year when its
chief metals futures operator, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, went on a disastrous
trading spree. He is believed to have dealt with more than 20 London and New
York brokers.
Codelco executives yesterday left Santiago for London, where on Monday they
are due to present findings from an interim report prepared by Ernst &amp;
Young, the British consultant, to the Securities and Investment Board, the
Securities and Futures Authority and the London Metal Exchange. They are
later expected to offer similar evidence to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission in Washington.
Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco's president, said preliminary investigations had
revealed 'a series of unusual operations which. . . may have permitted Mr
Davila to hide his huge losses'. He admitted there 'may not be enough
evidence to prove the existence of fraud'. or that brokers necessarily acted
'with the intention of helping Mr Davila to defraud Codelco'. However, he
called on UK and US regulatory authorities to investigate because 'they have
direct access to the brokers' accounts, which we do not.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Buy a ticket, win world peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
I have been straining my brain so as to devise a new world game. The notion
that we need a new world game was advanced by Miss Lee, my executive
assistant, during the soccer World Cup a few weeks ago. Most games, says
Miss Lee, are fundamentally silly. She had read, however, that the man who
founded Nike had set himself the target of inventing a new game so as to
cheer us all up, and imagined that I could help.
Miss Lee is not in London. She is travelling in Umbria with next door's
gardener, a tall and braided youth whose grasp of gardening lore is scarcely
more profound than the instructions on a seed packet.
In her absence I have been sweeping and dusting the flat, producing
exquisitely tasteful meals for our exquisitely snotty cat - and straining my
brain so as to devise a new world game with which to astound Miss Lee when
she returns to London in the company of the braided one.
Here is my idea: global lotteries to fund good causes. In November we shall
see the debut of Britain's first national lottery since 1826 - a giant
tombola which is expected to produce an annual turnover of at least Pounds
4bn, part of which will fund massive donations to five good causes:
charities, the arts, sport, national heritage and the Millennium Fund.
Surprisingly, there are still a few grey souls who are not turned on by
Britain's national lottery. One of them is Allison Pearson, a columnist on
the London Evening Standard, who was rabbiting on this week about the
misfortunes likely to be visited on some of those who win big prizes.
'Poverty erodes the spirit, certainly,' wrote this pompous wowser, 'but
unearned wealth, wherever it comes from, can do the same.'
She has rather missed the point. What does it matter if a few big lottery
winners splurge their loot in decadent fashion because they are unable to
handle such large amounts of cash? In sub-Saharan Africa more than 34m
people are facing famine or severe food shortages because of the intractable
wars and strife that plague that doomed continent.
I would bet everything I own that all those people would like nothing more
than to get their hands on some 'unearned wealth'.
The gambling urge is ancient, universal and ingrained. Internationally, the
gambling business is growing frantically. You cannot extinguish gambling,
just as you cannot suppress various other human urges, so you might as well
regulate it and allow it to develop in a civilised manner as free of
shysterism or criminal influence as - oh - banking or insurance or financial
services.
While you are at it, you might as well cream off a percentage of gambling
turnover and direct it where it will do considerable and visible good. This
is why Britain's national lottery is so well-conceived and is likely to
establish itself as the world's biggest tombola.
But why stop there? Sooner, rather than later, I want to see the
introduction of globe-girdling lotteries to help fund planetary
rehabilitation. We have the computers, satellites and TV sets, so what are
we waiting for?
Instead of wringing our hands every time the UN fails to march into Rwanda
or Bosnia or some other hell-hole because it hasn't got the money or the
equipment or the nerve, why not fund our efforts at international
peace-keeping, or tackle catastrophes such as Rwanda's, with a UN mercy army
hundreds of thousands strong funded not by member governments but directly
via our first global lottery? I would buy tickets, and so - I suspect -
would you.
Want to save the elephant? The ivory holocaust and the explosive growth of
human population that have so endangered the African elephant affect Asian
elephants as well. Both Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus are running
out of living space.
To survive, elephants will need huge tracts of land. So let us buy it. Let
us launch a global lottery that has as its declared aim the saving of animal
life, starting with the elephants. I would buy tickets for that lottery as
well, and so - I suspect - would you.
Who cares what dreary Allison Pearson thinks? We have got very little time
in which to do many of the things we have got to do if our world is not to
become known throughout the galaxy as Planet Stinko. Global lotteries will
prove our salvation, mark my words.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The British way with murderers: Dominic Lawson considers
examples of English and American justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's topical piece of advice to my readers: if you are going to
commit a murder, do it in Britain, not America - especially not in Texas or
Arkansas. Last week, Winston Silcott, currently serving a life sentence for
the fatal stabbing of Anthony Smith, was awarded Pounds 10,000 by Sir David
Calcutt, QC, the Home Office assessor, in compensation for the time Silcott
had spent in custody prior to his quashed conviction for the murder of
policeman Keith Blakelock.
The fact that Silcott had already been charged with the Smith murder, is,
under English law, deemed irrelevant.
Silcott's main response, in a letter sent to The Independent, was to protest
his guiltlessness for the murder of Anthony Smith. He was acting in
self-defence, he claimed.
Meanwhile, in Huntsville, Texas, on the same day as Winston Silcott's escrow
account was being set up by the Home Office, Robert 'Frenchy' Drew was
executed, by lethal injection, for the murder 11 years ago of a teenager
called Jeffrey Mays.
We read much about this in the British press because an English mother of
three, Judith Tomlinson, had become Drew's penfriend and had travelled to
Texas to plead for a stay of execution.
She believed Drew's protestations of innocence.
All to no avail: at 12.15am on Tuesday, he was injected with a lethal
combination of chemicals. He sobbed, coughed, snorted, and fell silent.
'I love you,' said Tomlinson, on the other side of a perspex screen. But
Drew was dead.
Perhaps it was not surprising that a number of British newspapers appeared
very sympathetic to Tomlinson. But I was surprised by how few, in their
accounts, did other than present the claims for Drew's innocence.
Only one gave space to the full details of the brutal murder of Jeffrey
Mays, for which Drew was convicted. It was said that when police arrested
Drew, at a strip club, he was found with the murder weapon and also had the
victim's watch, wallet and bloodstained shirt.
On the very next day, in Arkansas, three men, Clines, Richley and Holmes
were dispatched, also by lethal injection.
A long article in the Daily Telegraph, entitled 'And so they had to die'
stigmatised this procedure as 'a drastic frontier style of justice'. It
commented: 'The idea of three men being strapped, one after the other to the
same trolley to have their veins filled with poison may strike many as
grotesque.
'The three men, guilty of murdering an Arkansas businessman in a house
robbery that netted Dollars 1,200 in cash, were declared dead by doctors
whose fees for attendance were thus cut by the economies of scale.'
The timing, it seems to me, is not in itself grotesque. The three men had
been found guilty of the same murder. And the Telegraph's man was a little
brief with the details of the murder of the Arkansas businessman.
To be precise, Clines, Richley and Holmes first tortured the businessman's
wife and daughter, and then forced them to watch while they killed, not very
efficiently, the family breadwinner.
I am not arguing that we should reinstate the death penalty in Britain: but
it represents a form of the state's outrage against a terrible act by one of
its number upon another. That outrage is unfairly caricatured if the cause
of it is understated or ignored.
Opponents of the death penalty will argue, reasonably, that if we had the
ultimate sanction in Britain, Winston Silcott would probably have been
executed for the murder of PC Blakelock, for which his conviction was
subsequently found to be unsafe. Silcott's letter-writing to The Independent
would have been cut off in its prime.
A friend of mine once tried to explain the British system of justice to a
visitor from China, where the death penalty is widely enforced. 'We
believe,' said the Englishman, 'that it is better that 99 murderers go free
than one innocent man is hanged'.
The Chinaman paused for some seconds. 'Better for whom?' he asked.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The French choose their words carefully: Not everyone is
enthusiastic about France's attempt to preserve its language. David Buchan
hears both sides of the argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If it should happen that French loses its present place as Europe's premier
working language, then Europe will never be totally European'
President Georges Pompidou, 1972
'French must not become to English what today Latin and Greek are to French'
Jacques Toubon, culture minister, 1994
Paint out those 'exit' signs and replace them with 'sortie'. Remember, when
publicising your latest car model, that it has a sac gonflable, not an air
bag. And, while planning that conference in Nice, do not forget to budget
for the expense of interpretation and of producing at least a resume or
precis in French of all those papers on applied widgetry.
If you fail to heed these cautions in France, it could cost you up to
FFr20,000 (Pounds 2,400) in fines under the country's new Loi Toubon.
According to Jacques Toubon, the culture minister, his law is designed to
restore French to its proper place 'as the language of our culture, cement
of the nation and the flag under which we sail in the world'. Put rather
more simply, it is to ensure that French remains what is spoken and read
predominantly in public in France.
Its opponents in France, however, have denounced it as linguistic
totalitarianism. They include libertarians in general, and the advertising
and scientific communities in particular. And on July 29, France's
constitutional court struck down two provisions of the law.
It complained that the law infringed the constitutional freedom of
expression by covering private citizens as well as public officials or those
performing public services, and by making too unconditional the denial of
state research money to scientists publishing their work in a language other
than French.
But Toubon reacted by calling the court's ruling 'generally positive' in
endorsing the government's right to require the use of French in most
aspects of French public life. His ministry says it will now simply amend
the law slightly during the Parliament's autumn session. Judging by the
original law's easy passage this spring, it should not have much difficulty
in getting its way. Few politicians want to be seen opposing such a
motherhood issue as protection of the French language.
The Loi Toubon coincides with an upsurge in French cultural nationalism.
Indeed, the issue on which the Gatt world trade talks nearly foundered last
December was the French government's determination to resist US objections
to its subsidies to things French. At the same time, the French parliament
passed a measure requiring the country's radio stations, to their great
irritation, to broadcast a minimum 40 per cent of French songs by January
1996.
This cultural nationalism has political, as well as trade, consequences.
President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur insisted on
retaining a French speaker at the helm of the European Commission: both
their first preference, Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, and
eventual choice, Luxembourg prime minister Jacques Santer, are francophones.
Luxembourgers, half of the Belgian population and some Swiss speak French,
which means French is spoken as a first language by more Europeans than
English. (German, the muttersprach of 80m in the federal republic, is ahead
of all.)
But the French refuse to settle for being a regional culture and still set
out 'universal' claims for their language (as well as for the political
values of the French revolution), while acknowledging such pretensions are
becoming increasingly phoney.
There are, for instance, 49 countries which belong to la Francophonie (the
community of French speakers). Some member countries, such as Bulgaria, seem
to have joined as much for political as for cultural reasons.
Even without the Bulgarians, a recent French Senate report estimated the
number of 'nominal' French speakers at 120m. But the number of 'real' French
speakers was far fewer, said the report.
It said only 10 per cent of north and sub-Saharan Africans actually spoke
the language and that this ratio was declining rapidly under the twin
impacts of Islamic (anti-western) fundamentalism in the Maghreb, and of the
growing appeal of black American music to black Africa.
In Asia, the report admitted that for all the fanfare of France's recent
political and economic 'return' to Indochina, French was now used or
understood by just 0.1 per cent of the population in Vietnam and Laos.
Ironically, the only region where English is in slight retreat is North
America, where the Canadian province of Quebec has taken draconian action to
forbid public use of English and where several US states have in recent
years made English their 'official' language, to blunt growing Hispanic
influence. Toubon cites these moves to justify his law, the aim of which, he
says, is to ensure the right of his countrymen to use the one language they
all understand.
Will it work? Linguistic legislation has a long history in France. In 1539,
French was declared the language of justice. In 1635, that watchdog of
linguistic purity, the Academie Francaise, was established. And in 1975, a
law was passed requiring advertising, job offers and product labelling to be
in French.
This was billed mainly as a consumer protection measure, enforcement of
which was left to a division of the finance ministry. But no one took it
very seriously. In some years, no convictions resulted; in others, about a
dozen. Typical was the FFr2,600 fine which a Cherbourg tribunal imposed on a
company in 1992 for selling windsurf boards with instructions only in
English.
In another case, the French subsidiary of Quick, the Belgian fast food
chain, countered a charge of giving its wares foreign (English) names by
arguing that consumers were perfectly well informed of the products through
accompanying photographs.
When that argument failed, Quick began trying to register its
'cheeseburgers' and other products as trademarks. This technique was
exploited by Nike, the sports equipment chain, which included in its
trademark the advertising slogan: 'Nike. Just Do It]' One of the aims of the
Loi Toubon is to put a stop to such moves.
But the culture minister says he is not trying to stamp out Franglais, a
bastardised form of English. It would certainly be difficult as stamping out
some Franglais terms would be killing something indigenously French. For
example, the term 'le smoking', for formal men's evening wear, has never
existed in English. Another example of an English word used in a sense that
would mean nothing in England is 'tilt'. 'Ca me fait tilt' is a common
French phrase for 'I suddenly realised', with 'tilt' taken from
pinball-machine parlance.
Generally, though, the new law forbids official use of foreign words where
French equivalents exist. Where they do not, they are being invented by 19
ministerial committees which, this spring, published their lexicon of 3,500
official Gallicisms. Progress has been rather quicker than the Academie
Francaise's revision of its dictionary. Work began in 1935 and has reached
the letter F.
Part of the Loi Toubon is designed to give new bite to old law. It allows,
for the first time, various unofficial associations to initiate court
action. It is promised that this power will only go to 'approved'
associations - but these linguistic vigilantes have proved unnerving
already.
One of the associations' targets will undoubtedly be the advertising
industry. Dominique Mauduit, vice-president of Publicis, a large advertising
agency, says it is 'intolerable and imbecile' to legislate on the everyday
language which his industry uses to put its message across. 'Publicity is
the language of the street . . . and we don't use any more Franglais than
already exists in common French usage,' he says.
Toubon explains the main aim of his law as being to 'forbid the forbidding
of the use of French'. His culture ministry claims an increasing numbers of
employees have complained they are getting important internal company
documents in foreign languages. Henceforth, these will have to be in French,
as work and commercial contracts have had to be since 1975.
While the law applies to internal company documents, Toubon says he does not
intend to apply it to external company document such as annual reports to
shareholders. It is not surprising that his ministry should shrink from
trying to cut France's financial community off from 'le bottom line' and 'le
cash flow' to which they have become firmly attached. The attachment is not
surprising when you consider that cash flow becomes 'le marge brut
d'autofinancement' in French.
So the culture ministry is only planning to establish 'cercles de
reflexions' with the banks and the Bourse to discuss ways of gallicising
their terminology.
The law stipulates French as the language of teaching, but an increasing
number of French business schools teach courses in English, as does Patrick
Messerlin, a trade specialist at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris.
He says he has Korean students who want to work in English, and 'if they
can't they will simply go to Brussels', a more accommodating francophone
university centre. 'I'll just keep on in English, and let them fine me,' he
says defiantly.
But scientists are even more strongly opposed to a law which they feel has
been passed by politicians in wilful ignorance of the fact that English has
become the language of international scientific publications and
conferences.
Toubon's law requires that conferences must print their programmes in French
(in addition to any other language), that all working papers must be
accompanied by at least a resume in French, and that interpretation must be
provided.
In a fruitless appeal to deputies in April, the Academie des Sciences said
that at large conferences 'it would be materially impossible to ensure
French resumes and financially impossible to provide simultaneous
translation'.
The law also makes state money for research dependent on the fruits of that
research being published eventually in French. 'A French researcher does not
have to publish his work first in French,' says Toubon. 'He can put it first
into Nature or the New England Journal of Medicine. But at some point or
other, the French taxpayer ought to be able to read what he pays for.'
In reply, three particle physicists wrote recently in Le Monde: 'We are
grouped in laboratories whose number can be counted on the fingers of two
hands. Obviously there is no public in France to publish our work to,
because it would only sell 20 copies . . . How can a discipline of several
thousand people on the whole planet publish their work in 20 languages?'
It would be far better, says Paul Germain, secretary to the Academie des
Science, for politicians to subsidise the writing of indigenous French
schoolbooks on, say, biology, instead of just translating American ones,
because these are read by hundreds of thousands of children and not just a
handful of scientists.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: L. S. Lowry - the myth exploded / Why this artist was
not as naif as he seemed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LS Lowry
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
we may drop the Laurence Stephen straight away, for the bare name and
initials were always enough - remains in many ways as strange and
contradictory a figure of 20th century British art as ever he was in his
life. Born in 1887, he lived to a great age, dying in 1976 loaded with
professional, civic and academic honours. His career began effectively with
his years of study under Adolphe Valette at the Manchester College of Art
before the first world war, and ended with a memorial show at the Royal
Academy in the year of his death that was seen by some 300,000 visitors. Few
British artists have been the subject of so many biographies and television
documentaries. He was in many ways as popular an artist as we have ever had.
Yet the myth persists.
The popular imagination loves the idea of the naif, the innocent and the
self-taught, and then again that of the artist condemned to his lonely
studio through long years of critical neglect. Genius denied yet staying
obstinately true to itself is always good copy. And then what about that
critical neglect and condescension confounded by immediate popular acclaim?
Lowry in his mythical reputation has enjoyed them all, and not just turn and
turn about, but all at once. And none of it is true.
An innocent and self-taught artist? Lowry's studies began with private
classes in 1904 and continued intermittently until the early 1920s. There is
no doubt that he was a man of reclusive and apparently eccentric habits, but
isolated through years of critical neglect? He first showed his work at the
Manchester Academy in 1919; had a painting bought by the Manchester City Art
Gallery in 1926; in 1930 showed at the Salon d'Automne in Paris and the New
English Art Club; showed at the Royal Academy in 1932; was elected to the
Royal Society of British Artists in 1934; had his first London one man show
at Lefevre, and was bought by the Tate, in 1939 . . .
Small as it is, the fine and representative Lowry's show now at the Crane
Kalman makes the point inescapable. For here are works across the full
career, from the 1920s to the '70s, that celebrate the artist in all his
quality and sophistication. Mr Kalman's own natural enthusiasm for his
subject may run away with him just a little - 'a selection of masterpieces',
the show's title, sets the tone - and he may also serve the myth in his
persistent belief in Lowry's continuing critical neglect - the Tate has
lately given a room to him. But then he has been stalwart in support of his
artist, in Manchester and London, through thick and thin for more than 40
years.
It is commonly supposed, since Lowry is superficially so singular in his
work, that he stands entirely alone. And yet the industrial city and the
urban masses that animate it have many antecedents. Leaving aside the
18th-century humanist and scientific interests of such as Wright of Derby,
or the Victorian urban realism of Atkinson Grimshaw, we have only to look to
an Impressionist such as Pissarro to register an interest in the city, its
thorougfares and commerce, as a legitimate subject for the artist. In
England, Lowry's own teacher, Adolphe Valette, himself lately the subject of
an exhibition in Manchester, brought his own Impressionist's eye to the
local cityscape, while at the same time the German Expressionists were
turning a fiercer, more dyspeptic eye to the subject. As for the crowd, from
Avercamp and Teniers to Frith and Cruikshank and the contemporary
illustrators of Punch, parallel examples are everywhere to hand.
If Lowry often came close to self-parody in the formulaic idiosyncracy of
his mature and familiar work, he will not be the last artist to fall into
that trap. But even in that later work, we so often find an inventive and
radical eye, ever open to new imagery and visual ideas, and still working to
organise and simplify the image in ever more radical terms. Who would think
of Lowry as an artist of the countryside or the seascape, and how
beautifully simple and convincing are the standing stones he painted in
Cornwall in the 1950s, or the moorland fields and hedges at Fylde, or 'the
old grey widow-maker,' the simple seascapes of the 1940s? There is not a
figure in any of them.
And where the figures do persist, even in the latest works, they retain a
liveliness and freshness of characterisation and animation, so closely
observed yet achieved by purely painterly means. A flick, a dab and dot of
colour, and the figure, alone or in the crowd, is there to the life,
scurrying and bustling out to the jetty across the canvas.
But the earliest works are still the more fascinating, for they give us
Lowry before his conventional method was fully established, though with
hindsight we can see what is coming. The tone is darker, the contrast
closer, the figures larger and more closely seen. In the earliest of them
all, the cityscape of 1922, smoke fills the sky, the children run through
the blackened town, men stand gossiping in the street, and already Lowry has
imposed his vision of the world upon our own. But then who, just a little
later, is this little girl with her back towards us, in white dress and hat
and her racquet in her hand and her long black pigtail falling down her
back? This is a show full of surprises.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: On ritual pain and abuse - Sophie Constanti witnesses
some queer traditions in the name of art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What kind of radical theatre grows out of a multicultural urban sprawl where
riot, arson and racially motivated killings have become the kneejerk
response to perceived social injustice? As the Rodney King case so
frighteningly illustrated, Los Angeles is no laid-back global village. And,
as Ask the Angels - a recent selection of work imported from the city's
Highways Performance Space and presented at London's ICA Theatre - revealed,
only those inclined towards rampant self-expression stand a chance of being
seen and heard in this melting pot of ugly tensions. That the most
articulate victims of a sick society might, through performance, find some
cathartic release is unsurprising. But beyond broadcasting their
disadvantaged status, what are these performers trying to say?
Ron Athey's 4 Scenes in a Harsh Life is not for theatregoers who are liable
to pass out at the sight of blood and needles; or for those who do not wish
to be anointed with body fluids; or for anyone who feels out of place in the
company of the extensively tattooed and pierced. It is a show in which
convulsive self-loathing is made so horrendously graphic, and acts of
mutilation are carried out in such a matter of fact way, that even those
people entertained by the beer-and-ketchup vomiting misfits of Jim Rose's
Circus are sure to be left worried for Athey and his tribe of consenting
sado-masochists, and confused as to the purpose of this spectacle of ritual
pain and abuse.
Athey, a former pentecostal preacher and ex-junkie, draws heavily on his
chequered background and nihilist tendencies for much of the show's content.
Take the prelude to the evening's four, mercifully brief scenes: this
features Athey in Edna Everage-style drag, recounting his childhood interest
in the phenomenon of stigmata and his parallel fascination for blood-letting
on a stage littered with wooden crutches. Meanwhile, a St Sebastian figure,
her flesh skewered with arrows, gazes upwards. While there is some peculiar
dignity in her martyrdom, we see only frenzied self-mutilation and rabid
despair in the later scene, entitled 'Tattoo Salvation', which has Athey
create a chevron effect along the entire length of his forearm with some 20
diagonally inserted syringes - a mere practice run for his next task which
has him ramming a set of fat needles into his forehead. Equally
anxiety-inducing is the scene where another naked 'addict' enters, his head
already pierced with a here's-one-I-made-earlier crown of thorns, only to
have each needle removed by a surgical glove-wearing Vestal Virgin.
Athey's most assured and reasoned performance - as a bespectacled minister
delivering an hallelujah sermon - comes in the final episode: here, the
threads of his dramatic subtext, if not the shocking, physical exorcisms it
provokes, begin to make some sense. But the overall picture relies too much
on the 'shabby shamanism' which Athey vehemently rejects in his call for a
framework of meaningful queer traditions.
In Tim Miller's Naked Breath, body fluids are talked about rather than
produced. Miller, one of LA's most vociferous gay activists and co-founder
of Highways, accurately describes himself as a 'loud, obnoxious fag'. He can
be funny and frank, but his autobiographical texts are tediously
one-dimensional. In Naked Breath, an 80 minute monologue, Miller recounts
his exploits as a carpenter in New York: he built beds in hundreds of the
city's apartments - 'and had sex in all the rest'.
But these stories of his numerous sexual adventures are hardly untrampled
ground. When Miller appeared at the same theatre during the 1986 Dance
Umbrella festival, we learned a great deal about this agit-prop artist's
obsession with his own sexuality. Eight years on, he is still telling us
that his first boyfriend was a prostitute on Santa Monica Boulevard. Naked
Breath is evidence that Miller's theatrical material has become even more
self-referential and that he now frequently lapses into contrived, airy
sentimentality.
Like Athey, Turkish born choreographer/dancer Mehmet Sander is openly
HIV-positive. But while Athey hooks into an obsession with flesh, decorating
and destroying it with jewellery, tattoos and ritual scar patterns, 27 year
old Sander highlights the vulnerability of corporeal matter through
self-inflicted, systemised assault to bones, muscles and joints, turning the
solidity and weight of his own body into both object and subject of five
brief and brutal solos.
Sander, whose stout physique owes more to circuit training than to any
regime designed to elongate the limbs and develop flexibility, is concerned
with testing the limits of the body, rather than celebrating its gymnastic
capabilities, and the effect is simultaneously impressive and disturbing as,
over and over again, he rockets through space and crashes to the floor with
a sickening thud. But in spite of the admirable precision of Sander's work,
its skull-cracking, genital-pulping cruelty registers as just another take
on the inhumane activity which characterises Athey's brand of lunatic
sensationalism.
Whether or not we are able to understand what impels people to commit such
acts of pain and risk upon themselves and others, this kind of unswervingly
extreme performance work does force us to think about issues of personal
freedom and choice. For if, by law, consenting adults involved in S&amp;M face
criminal prosecution, does this mean that, theoretically, our bodies belong
to the state? I would guess that even those of us who are not turned on by
the thought of being choked with a dog lead or submitting to a good whipping
do not wish to be given guidelines on permissible pleasure - in, or out, of
the theatre.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Moves afoot at the Accademia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is going on at the Accademia Italiana, which for five years brightened
up London with some impressive exhibitions of Italian culture and even
better parties? Last week seven of the 11 staff were made redundant and the
Accademia will shortly leave its grand Rutland Gate premises for the
decidedly utilitarian Smith Galleries in Covent Garden.
According to its moving spirit, Rosa-Maria Letts, the Accademia is still up
and running, with six shows of modern Italian art scheduled. One, devoted to
the cultural ramifications of footwear, should cause as great a stir as the
recent in-depth investigation of the bra. In addition Mrs Letts is
energetically fund-raising for a new venture, the European Academy, which,
sponsors willing, will add arts from other countries to the exhibition list.
These expansionary plans are very galling to the 180 unpaid creditors of the
Accademia, who range from advertising agencies, security firms and
transportation companies to its previous landlord, Glaxo. They are owed a
collective Pounds 480,000 and have been promised 54p in the pound if they
are patient, perhaps for years. They would prefer that some of the new money
being raised from Italian sponsors went to them rather than on ambitious
ventures, like negotiating to take over the Italianate Royal College of
Organists as the future home of the various Academies.
Next week-end sees the start of the Edinburgh Festival. The omens look good.
The box office has already taken around Pounds 1.3m towards its Pounds 2m
target, more than it secured during the whole of the 1992 Festival. Even the
inevitable last minute crisis has already happened - the NDR Orchestra from
Hamburg has cancelled its performance of Bruckner 8, citing rehearsal
problems, although it is still coming over for Beethoven.
What with the 1993 Festival registering a Pounds 12,000 profit; the old row
over the absence of a decent opera venue resolved by the opening of the
Festival Theatre; and the local District and Regional Councils, now fully
supportive and substantially raising their funding, this long running
controversy is now a success.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: More exposure on photography - Marina Benjamin talks
to the new director of the Photographers' Gallery, Paul Wombell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARINA BENJAMIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Photographers' Gallery has recently been the subject of a heated dispute
conducted principally in the letters pages of The Guardian. Prominent
members of Britain's photographic community denounced the gallery as 'old,
tired and out-of-date', called for the immediate resignation of its Board of
Trustees, another chimed in with 'Why not shut it down? It's a moribund
institution.'
Without a director at its helm to defend it, the Photographers' Gallery has
not been able to reply. But now, the newly-appointed director, Paul Wombell,
plans to respond with deeds, not words. He feels that photography is one of
the most important forms of communication developed in the last 200 years,
and that those working in photography ought to be aware of this and proud of
it, and ambitious for the medium.
Wombell is in fact hugely ambitious for the medium. 'Photography is
absolutely central to visual arts in Britain,' he proclaims, 'some of the
most important work in the last 15 years has been photography-based and this
trend will continue. The Photographers' Gallery has to play into that
central role, defining contemporary photography, raising issues abut
photography, and re-inventing ways of looking at historical work. No one
else is doing this.'
This country has a poor track-record when it comes to photography:
photographic projects receive only 14 per cent of the Arts Council visual
arts budget; at Pounds 597,000, this is roughly half the amount France
invests in the medium. . While the Museum of Modern Art in New York has been
collecting a broad range of photographic work for over 60 years, the Tate
only began acquiring photographs in the 1970s.
The sitution, however, is changing. According to curator Sean Rainbird, the
Tate is renewing its commitment to collecting photography; the V&amp;A hopes to
open a new photography gallery in 1998 so that the national photographic
collection can get a permanent airing; while the Barbican, ICA, and Hayward
are all regularly staging large-scale photographic exhibitions.
Much of the credit for this current, albeit belated, institutional interest
rests with the Photographers' Gallery, founded in 1971 by Sue Davis to give
photography a proper footing in the art world. Now that it has fulfilled its
original purpose, it can turn itself into an institution as opposed to being
a thorn in the side of the arts' establishment.
But is there room for another heavy-weight institution? Has not the Barbican
for instance taken photographic history on board, and the Hayward provided
its cutting edge? Paul Wombell gave this suggestion short shrift. 'The
current Hayward exhibition should have been shown five years ago. Its
leading ideas are German, but young German photographers' work today is more
personal and installation-based. As for the Barbican, I came out of the Bill
Brandt show thinking 'I don't like Bill Brandt'. History needs to be made
exciting for young audiences, and a dialogue should be created between
contemporary photographers and the likes of Brandt.'
Wombell plans to develop the gallery less as an institution than a centre
with new computer technology, R&amp;D workshops and darkrooms where artists can
experiment, forging links with companies to use new equipment, and to join
computer networks giving access to photographic libraries around the world.
'Photography has undergone vast changes in terms of technological practice
over the last 20 years, and we need to engage with this new mode of
photographic practice.'
New technology is something of a Wombell speciality. While director of the
Impressions Gallery in York he organised the mixed-media show, Photovideo;
and The Globe, an exhibition charting representations of earth since the
first NASA space photographs. He also nurtured links with Europe; and he
succeeded in raising Pounds 250,000, which last year enabled the gallery to
relocate to larger premises.
With this track-record Wombell seems to hold the right formula to take the
Photographers' Gallery into the 21st century. But can he repeat his York
achievement in London? Though he would not be drawn on larger premises,
saying 'we need to make the case for us to exist first', he did offer this
reflection: 'The reason the Photographers' Gallery is this size is that when
it opened the only work being shown was 16x20 document work. The medium has
changed phenomenally since then and its principal gallery has to accommodate
those changes.' This sounds like a very good pitch for a share of the
Millennium Fund.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Welsh excel on Wagner Night - Promenade concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first two of its four Proms this season, the BBC National Orchestra
of Wales confirmed the high reputation it has established under its
principal conductor, Tadaaki Otaka. Theirs seems to be a mutually beneficial
relationship - the Japanese conductor's special affinity for the Romantic
repertory and the orchestra's warm, cultivated playing complement each
other.
The programme on Wednesday suited them well. Billed as Wagner Night, it was
an attempt in the 100th anniversary season at recreating the past: until the
death of Henry Wood in 1944, Wagner Nights were a tradition, which accounts
for Wagner's status as the Proms' most-played composer - 4,449 performances
in all. Recordings have made such programmes unnecessary and 'bleeding
chunks' are now out of fashion, but Wednesday's concert was a canny
box-office move: the Albert Hall was packed.
The Overture to Tannhauser (played 103 times in the first ten seasons alone)
and the Venusberg ballet music provided scope for polished orchestral
playing. Otaka favoured slow, deliberate tempos - on its return, the
Overture's chorale theme nearly ground to a halt - but gave the music shape
to justify his approach. His expansive view of the Wesendonck Lieder meant
that the orchestra never quite established the contrasting moods of the five
songs. But Anne Evans, a lyrical Wagnerian, was an ideal soloist.
'Schmerzen' was achingly beautiful. The sultry 'Im Treibhaus' seemed to take
on new meaning for the audience sweltering in the Albert Hall hothouse.
Miss Evans is, of course, one of Britain's leading Wagnerians - a
distinguished Brunnhilde at Bayreuth and elsewhere, and recently Isolde for
Welsh National and Scottish Operas - and the chance to hear her in
Brunnhilde's Immolation was especially welcome. With gleaming tone, she rode
all but the biggest climaxes. Balance was bound to be a problem: one singer
without the projecting help of the proscenium arch, pitted against a
Wagnerian orchestra normally sunk below the stage. The Gotterdammerung
finale was preceded by two other extracts from the opera, Siegfried's Rhine
Journey and Siegfried's Funeral March, which found Otaka on form, able to
make something genuinely dramatic of chunks that in isolation can pass as a
succession of sound effects.
Thursday's concert was an all-British programme, all late-Romantic - even
Daniel Jones's 1976 Dance Fantasy, a genial eight-minute puff that gave the
orchestra an opportunity to fly its Welsh flag. 'The Walk to the Paradise
Garden' from Delius's opera A Village Romeo and Juliet followed, Otaka
drawing sensuous playing from the excellent strings.
His conception of the Walton Viola Concerto - premiered at the 1929 Proms
with Hindemith, no less, as soloist - was less convincing. The scherzo
lacked panache, and some uneasy ensemble fell short of the 'molto preciso'
marking. But Nobuko Imai was an imaginative, flexible soloist, who brought
shape to Walton's long lines.
Otaka had firmer idea about Elgar's Symphony No 1. Conducting from memory,
he welded the first movement with a clear sense of its structure, though he
was too generous towards the brass. The swaggering, syncopated subject in
the scherzo was also too heavy, and unduly aggressive as a result; the
heartfelt Adagio was as seamless as it should be. There is more Elgar than
Otaka found here, but this was nevertheless a gripping performance.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Messages in Broken Glass / Review of the British
premiere of Arthur Miller's latest play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Glass is the kind of play that only Arthur Miller knows how to write
any more. At its British premiere on Thursday there were starry eyes and
cheers amid the audience, and, when the 78-year-old playwright rose to
acknowledge the applause, a good many people leapt to their feet.
Indeed, Miller has not given us so echt a play in quite a while. Which means
that it is about the point where private repression and public events
overlap: in this case, the point where the twin causes of the heroine's
partial paralysis are sexual problems and Jewish consciousness.
The play, which has six characters, is set in Brooklyn in 1938. It is some
feat to make the sudden psychosomatic non-functioning of Sylvia's lower body
be prompted simultaneously by (a) 20 years of marriage without sex, and (b)
Kristallnacht. Miller, however, is not the man to stop there. He lards his
play with questions-and-answers like this. Patient: 'So why is it so hard to
be a Jew?' Doctor: 'It's hard to be anything'. Or this one. Patient: 'So
what is the solution?' Doctor: 'To forgive yourself, I guess. And the Jews.'
Oy vey.
If you think the test of a play is its message or messages, then you may
like Broken Glass a good deal. The messages here include the following:
women are people too; Jews can be anti-semitic; you should be aware of what
is happening outside your own four walls; repressing guilt is bad for you
and others. Miller has been saying worthy things like these for so many
years that he should get a Nobel prize. Not, however, the one for
literature. The messages of Broken Glass thud around like so many missiles;
but they do not constitute serious drama.
Those of you who have been trying to forget the ending of Peter Shaffer's
Gift of the Gorgon (with poor Judi Dench yelling 'I forgive] I forgive] I
forgive]' to the angry shade of her dead husband) would be well advised to
leave before the close of Broken Glass, a triple whammy of the second
onstage heart-attack and probable death of Sylvia's husband Philip; Sylvia's
cries of 'Wait] Philip] There's nothing to blame]'; and a stand-up-and-walk
miracle for Sylvia. And who could have predicted that even Miller, writing a
play about a doctor trying to get a woman to use her pelvis and legs and
realising that her real problem was psychosexual, would call the doctor
Hymen?
There are some cute jokes. Sylvia: 'I never saw an opera. They must be hard
to understand. Doctor: 'Nothing to understand . . . Either she wants to and
he doesn't or he wants to and she doesn't. Either way one of them gets
killed and the other one jumps off a building.' Miller could be writing gags
for Bob Hope. Instead, he writes plays. He has been called a realist, but he
is a lot too schematic to be realistic. There is nothing seriously
individual about his characters; each seems to function like a demographic
diagram. The stage world they inhabit has no persuasive reality. Everything
is subordinated to message. OK, the doctor likes opera and riding, while
Sylvia likes Bing Crosby. But this is mere tokenist realism. And would
anyone in 1938 have said 'This Crosby's the one I like. You ever hear him?'
(My Crosby discs date back to 1927.)
Acting these roles is a matter less of serious impersonation than of tact;
and David Thacker, directing, paces the dialogue so well that you always
want to know what will happen next. The leading actors here - Margot
Leicester as Sylvia, Henry Goodman as Philip, Ken Stott as the Doctor -
perform as well as their roles permit, though Leicester is not the beauty
that the Doctor describes. Some American accents are creaky, and Sally
Edwards is distinctly weak as the doctor's wife.
Shelagh Keenan has provided an interesting steep-raked set with a lot of
reflecting glass - alas, because of the title, half the audience must be
waiting for it to break - which makes characters at the back loom out above
those speaking in the foreground. Between scenes, an onstage cellist, Andrea
Hess, plays music by herself and Gary Yershon which suggests a climate of
psychological tension as effectively as anything else in the play.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Macbeth into EastEnders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of course it has been done before, but never so ineptly. Transposing
Shakespeare's Scottish play into a blood and thunder set in modern gangland
goes back at least to 1955 and the cinematic Joe Macbeth. A London gangster
version of Macbeth now swelters in the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, thanks to
a company called London via Stoke, whose journey may not have been entirely
necessary.
The setting of Tony Longhurst's adaptation is the 1950s East End when
professional crime was carving out its territory, though the Krays could
never have been as dull as this. The rationale behind the concept, I
suspect, is to give a chance of playing Shakespeare to actors who might in
normal theatrical circumstances not get their tongues around the Bard. Thus
the cockney Macbeth lapses into excitable gabble, which is sometimes
unintelligible. Banquo's emergence as a phantom in the witches' prophecy
scene is marked by the most unvarying monotone since the Daleks. And the
lesser characters utter their lines with determinedly chatty casualness as
if determined to transform highlanders into EastEnders.
The ploddingly slow production, with its gaps, pauses and lack of rhythm, is
by Longhurst and Elle Lewis. This may explain the inclusion of the usually
omitted Hecate whom Miss Lewis plays as a bedizened whooper in black
draperies wearing a torch in her cleavage, who bounds on stage snarling,
spitting and yowling, like Mme Arcati auditioning for Cats.
We lose the porter (which this company might have done well) and Lady
Macduff - the latter a shame since the women are better than the men.
Jacqueline McCarrick's Lady Macbeth, in a succession of little black
numbers, plays like a young Joan Collins but gets all her words out clearly;
and Lucy Christofi's First Witch is thoroughly professional. The updating
consists of depicting the witches as three old tramps, bagladies without
bags, who make up their magic menus as they go along, contributing to the
dustbin/cauldron from a bottle of booze or grit produced, Atherton-style,
from their pockets. The Scots nobility is represented by embarrassed-looking
men in grey suits who stand fixedly displaying true British stoicism until
moving off, as if by numbers. There seems no point to the modernisation, and
references to kingship, armour and magic sound absurdly out of place, even
in this age when updated productions are the norm.
Bright spots are provided by Robert Niero, apparently Italian but whose
Duncan better at enunciating English than his colleagues; and James
Osborne's Malcolm. Mr Osborne knows how to speak with variations of volume,
pitch and pace, can express emotion, and understands what he is saying. This
is that rare thing, a production of Macbeth where the England scene - that
often interminable testing of loyalty by the exiled Malcolm - is a highlight
of clarity and drama.
Michael McKell has, according to the programme, an impressive background as
song-writer for Elaine Paige and Paul Nicholas. To judge by his Macbeth, his
foreground as actor is less imposing, except towards the end when the
'Tomorrow' speech patently moves him and therefore us. This production, most
of which would not pass muster with the average amateur dramatic society, is
mystifyingly sponsored by the Evening Standard, oddly identified in the
programme as 'The Quality Writing Paper'. I shall stick to Basildon Bond.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Knussen's knack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Tuesday's BBC Symphony Prom reminded us, it seems a palpable waste that
Oliver Knussen is called upon to conduct only his contemporaries' works -
and his own. He is a searching practical musician, unlike many one could
name; there is no reason to doubt that his wide-ranging gifts could be
lavished fruitfully upon a lot of older repertoire.
Here, his account of Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements was terrific:
from the opening flourishes (to which he refused any rhetorical indulgence,
but held strictly within Stravinsky's unrelenting rhythmic terms), through a
graceful, well-sprung Andante, to a final Con moto that finally dazzled. It
is years since I heard it so satisfyingly performed.
Alexander Goehr's Colossos or Panic, inspired by Goya's painting 'The
Colossus', was having its British premiere. In two solid movements, it is as
suavely assured as it is distinctly odd. It does indeed begin with some
colossal ritual howls, and the first movement rises to menacing peaks
several times later.
Yet the tone and manner are basically those of a Mahlerian dance-movement -
playful, gracious, mock-neo-classical; there is even a sweet, Straussian
violin. All that is truer still of the second movement, ingratiating and
elegant: tuneful, in fact, and touched with pathos despite some hefty surges
with minatory brass. Like the first, it finally dwindles and fades, this
time to celesta and pizzicato strings, with poignant solo phrases.
The public face of the music is 'accessible' as could be, the construction
superbly polished. It was very warmly received. The overall sense of the
piece remains quizzical; as with Mahler, it will doubtless reveal itself on
further acquaintance.
Knussen also conducted, and Lucy Shelton sang, his own recent, exquisite
(Walt) Whitman Settings. Marvellous orchestration, neo-Impressionist and
beyond (there is some candid Britten in the first song); ingeniously wrought
vocal lines; formal economy, unerring point. We have heard little new from
Knussen lately, but the skill and originality of these Whitman studies -
more than studies - promise splendid things to come. Miss Shelton was
impeccable.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Aristocrat with a vicious streak / Review of Patrice
Chereau's production of 'Don Giovanni' for the Salzburg Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can have been few more enticing festival prospects this summer than
Patrice Chereau's new production of Don Giovanni at Salzburg. Despite the
success of his centenary Ring at Bayreuth and the inducements offered by
major companies, the French director has been a rare visitor to the opera
house. He is now vowing to give up the theatre altogether and devote himself
to film, a medium in which - judging by the recently-released La Reine
Margot - he still has something to learn.
Gerard Mortier can, therefore, count himself lucky to have won Chereau's
services for Salzburg and for a work which, ever since Furtwangler's
legendary performances, has been a stern testing ground.
The new production has been cooking for a long time. A Chereau Don Giovanni
was first mooted by Rolf Liebermann in Paris in the 1970s, and the idea was
later picked up by Daniel Barenboim in his ill-fated plans for the opening
of the Opera Bastille. So it is no surprise to find Barenboim conducting in
Salzburg, with a cast as glittering as can be gathered today.
As in Chereau's staging of Lucio Silla (Brussels 1984), Richard Peduzzi has
designed a single set consisting of a huge stage-wide facade. It is faintly
indented with architectural features, painted blue-grey with some red at the
side, and modulated where necessary to suggest a door, an alley or a window.
The sinking or raising of stage platforms lends the same subtle variation to
the playing area, which - despite the width of the Grosses Festspielhaus
proscenium - is well focused.
In the churchyard scene, two giant stone heads appear - one signifying
retribution for Giovanni, the other presumably for Leporello - and the
larger of the two returns for the finale, crashing through the wall and
trapping Giovanni beneath it. Moidele Bickel's costumes are rococo, and the
subdued lighting illuminates the cast's movements rather than their faces.
The character of the performance is determined entirely by Chereau's
choreography, which flows with the music and is often strikingly realistic.
After his swordfight with the Commendatore, for example, Giovanni hurls
Leporello to the floor in a fit of angry remorse, only to end up beside him
 -kneeling over his victim's corpse. The scene in which Elvira interrupts
Giovanni and Zerlina has an almost balletic impulse as he swirls them across
stage holding one and then the other. And there is a very human touch in Act
2, when Leporello's guise is uncovered and he still wants Elvira's hand -
but is rejected.
Beyond the choreography, Chereau seems unwilling or unable to take a strong
interpretative stance. The performance develops an air of uncompromising
austerity - there is precious little humour - and the characters are not
strongly etched. Donna Elvira fares best, partly because of the
larger-than-life stage personality of Catherine Malfitano. Chereau has her
veiled and prostrate in a distant corner for 'Ah] chi mi dice mai', but
never overplays the lovelorn neurosis. Malfitano underpins her performance
with a confident display of Mozartian coloratura, showing again what a
versatile artist she is.
At the other end of the spectrum is Donna Anna, a figure embodying fragility
and sorrow rather than fire and passion. Lella Cuberli's singing was brittle
and sometimes barely audible. Don Ottavio profited from her weakness:
looking more like an advocate than a wimp, Peter Seiffert seemed very much
at home in the part and sang exquisitely. Cecilia Bartoli's petite Zerlina
was sparky rather than sexy, the voice perfectly tuned but a bit small for
this theatre. Andreas Kohn was the shadowy Masetto, Matti Salminen a massive
Commendatore.
Which leaves the central pair of master and servant, a distinction Chereau
respects. It would be hard to imagine a more sympathetic Leporello than Bryn
Terfel, boasting a long mane of hair and an easy stage presence. His
intelligent grasp of words and musical line, allied to his soft-grained
bass-baritone, is in Salzburg's finest Mozart tradition.
Ferruccio Furlanetto, who sang Leporello in the Karajan production, cuts a
handsome figure in the title role and sounds effortlessly suave. His
Giovanni is an aristocrat with a vicious streak, whose sole misdemeanour is
to have killed the man who challenged him to a duel. He shows too many pangs
of conscience, too much gentlemanly courtesy, to rank as a libertine.
Sensuality is in short supply, not least in the Serenade and there is no
sign of debauchery. In short, Giovanni does not stand out enough from the
rest of the cast.
The biggest disappointment is the contribution of Barenboim and the Vienna
Philharmonic, whose soft-focus accompaniments sounded like background music,
shedding little light on character or drama. For long stretches one could
comfortably forget the orchestra was there - until Barenboim produced one of
his sudden forte outbursts. Anyone looking for Mortier's revolution in
Salzburg would find little evidence of it here. But the show is a useful
crowd-puller, certain to impress the festival's rich, unrepentant clientele.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: A triumph of excess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most nights for the last 50 years George Melly has sung 'Frankie and
Johnny', or rather he has performed, camped up, nourished, and milked this
old American ballad. He is doing it tonight, and until August 13, at the
Green Room of the Cafe Royal and the world is a happier place as a result.
If the modern age could produce a Renaissance Man it would probably be Melly
 -the jazz singing historian of Surrealism who also created the Flook
cartoon strip. There is something definitely quatrocento about his
appearance - the bright turquoise suit, the crimson shoes, the battered
straw hat. He celebrates the triumph of excess, Silenus having the last
laugh.
First appearances are not encouraging as the four elderly gents, accompanied
by a plump youngish man, fall on to the small stage. But as soon as Melly
plunges into his signature tune, 'Good Time George', and trumpet player and
leader John Chilton leads his Feetwarmers into their first solos, you know
you are safely in the hands of old pros.
This ensemble has spent years on the road, playing everything from jazz
clubs to Winter Gardens. The Green Room surrenders without a fight. For a
man nudging 70 George Melly still sings with amazing energy and precision,
and he cleverly slices into his act anecdotes, jokes, and a little jazz
history, much of it cheerfully smutty, all of it delivered with casual
panache. There can be few cabaret artists who rejoice in the death of their
libido by quoting a Greek philosopher 'I feel as if I've been unchained from
a lunatic', and tops it up with a Dr Johnson drollery about his penis.
Melly relishes the seedy low life origins of jazz. He joyfully tells of
hearing a DJ introduce 'a funky Cliff Richard record'; Melly knows that
'funky' was originally black slang for 'smelling of stale sex'. Give him a
song like 'You've got the right key, but you're working on the wrong
keyhole' and he is in his element.
It is not all barrack room bawdy. Melly can still deliver a romantic ballad
like 'Stardust Memory' with some emotion, and he does not ignore the
desperate times of the first jazz musicians as he honours his heroine Bessie
Smith with 'Wasted Life Blues'.
But refreshed by constant sit downs while the band share out the solos,
Melly is at last ready to plunge into the audience. It is an awesome sight
to seem him approach a mesmerised female crooning 'You want a hot dog in
your roll'; and only a man of impeccable middle-class origins could get away
with tales of shipboard life during his gay youth. 'I don't like bending
down these days' he confesses. 'It is neither profitable nor pleasurable'.
After a lengthy, perhaps a midge too lengthy, set, Melly is ready for
'Frankie and Johnny'. The shoes come off, to be used as props in the love
making verse; the camp accent is re- created for the bar tender's
contribution; and we are back ten, 20, 35 years to when we first saw Melly
do his party piece. He is now much too portly to run his hands up and down
his back but what he loses in agility he compensates with charm. For any
visiting tourist, bored with the blandness of American cabaret, a view of
George would be a shockingly enjoyable eye opener to one of the great
traditions of British music hall.

LITERATURE &amp; REVOLUTION IN ENGLAND, 1640-1660 by Nigel Smith Yale University
Press Pounds 30, 425 pages
A new book full of fascinating information about that violent period from
the beginning of the Long Parliament to the Restoration of the monarchy
helps us to see how much truth and how much legend there is in the received
wisdom about the English civil war and its effect on ordinary life.
Undoubtedly there was irreversible destruction in many areas. The one with
which Nigel Smith, Oxford fellow in English at Keble College, is concerned
is literature. After the regicide, old rhetorical forms and genres of
writing were radically undermined. Smith demonstrates how they then became
adapted and reconstituted to meet the changing needs of the times right
across the board - in drama, history, fiction, political theory, epic and
lyric poetry.
The fate of the drama is a striking example of this process: the London
theatres were gradually dismantled by the Puritans, as were other places of
public entertainment such as the bear-gardens. But plays continued to be
published and even to be privately performed in country houses or in exile.
While the clamp-down on public theatre remained unrelenting for the whole of
the Protectorate, drama re-surfaced in other areas. Its spirit energised
related forms such as the political pamphlet whose writers used dramatic
scenarios to present highly 'sensitive' political material.
In 1648, for instance, there appeared a polemical tract written in the form
of a play entitled Craftie Cromwell. The emergent Oliver appears in it as a
stage Machiavelli. The King was then a prisoner. The Levellers were aiming
to abolish Parliament. In such a confused time the appropriate genre, the
pamphlet's authors considered, was low comedy rather than high tragedy.
'Smooth Plautus, Aristophanes his vein/ We now affect, not Sophocles high
streine', they explained.
One of the authors was Marchmont Nedham, a prolific writer active in the
publications that now sprang up to supply information about the progress of
the civil war. These Newsbooks were the forerunners of the modern newspaper.
They came out daily with a date-line, and contained both news and
rudimentary editorial comment. In an age when classical erudition was taken
for granted Mercury, winged messenger of the gods, became their emblem,
hence Mercurius Aulicus, Mercurius Britanicus, and many more similar titles
 -emanating first from the parliamentary side, and then in reprisal from the
royalist, each Newsbook heavily slanting the news according to its
allegiances.
The hard-worked writers combined production of them with other occupations.
Nedham and his rival Sir John Berkenhead were both gentlemen; Henry Walker
was an ironmonger and church minister; John Dillingham an innkeeper and
tailor; towards the end of the period we have in one Samuel Pecke,
newswriter, an example of a full-time journalist.
The old classical models remained precariously in place and were made to
serve as mirrors and metaphors in innumerable ways. When Cromwell returned
from Ireland, Andrew Marvell celebrated the event in An Horatian Ode famous
for its ambiguities. Who is the real hero - Cromwell or 'the royal actor'
who on the day of his execution 'nothing common did or mean/ Upon that
memorable scene'? Smith exonerates Marvell from fence-sitting and suggests
that the double meanings are 'replications of the tensions which are
necessary to the life of republics'.
Even a seemingly innocent bucolic text like Izaak Walton's The Compleat
Angler does not escape this writer's perceptions of hidden meanings. Walton
was an unrepentant royalist whose complete Angler is also a complete
Anglican. Angling is analogous to ministry, fishing to preaching - 'the
unusual oscillation of genres . . . relocate the national crisis in a
natural landscape'. Whether dealing with gallant love-lyrics by Herrick or
Lovelace or with a major work of the order of Hobbes's Leviathan or Paradise
Lost, Smith shows the same sensitivity to inner tensions and topical
resonances. He has done a signal service to all students of this watershed
period.

FLESH AND THE IDEAL: WINCKELMANN AND THE ORIGINS OF ART HISTORY by Alex
Potts Yale University Press Pounds 29.95, 294 pages
Johann Joachim Winckelmann became immensely famous in the late 18th century
as a result of his writings on Greek and Roman sculpture - above all, his
History of the Art of Antiquity (1764). A striking feature of these writings
is his rapturous enthusiasm for the smooth-limbed, boyish, naked male body,
as exemplified by the sinuous torso of the Belvedere Antinous in the
Vatican, illustrated on the cover of Flesh and the Ideal.
Winckelmann is well-known, too, for his declaration that his life only began
when he left behind a gloomy existence in Saxony and devoted himself to
hedonism and self-realisation in Rome; he described his dalliances with
young Italian boys as research into 'living beauty' that supplemented his
work as an antiquarian scholar. Unsurprisingly, then, cultural historians
have often emphasised his role in consolidating a tradition of homoerotic
fantasy that centres on visions of untrammelled desire in the warm south.
In this book, Alex Potts approaches such themes obliquely and cautiously.
Eighteenth-century accounts of the classical ideal are, he observes, more
often concerned with the female nude, which 'is constituted almost
exclusively as an object of delectation for the male viewer'. For
Winckelmann, in contrast, the male nude supplies a more complex and
enthralling focus of erotic fantasy: not merely 'a thing to be gazed at' for
gratification, but also 'a mythic image of perfectly integrated manhood',
with which the viewer can identify.
Elaborating on this image of manhood, Winckelmann devotes much of his
attention to figures such as the Antinous, which appear calmly
self-absorbed, lost in an 'enjoyment of self in which the senses are
gathered inwards and withdrawn from any external object'. In identifying
with such figures, the spectator identifies with their state of narcissistic
self-contentment, in which all potentially disruptive desires and passions
are suspended. The wish to regress to such a state, Potts cogently points
out, is 'hardly distinctively homosexual'.
He makes a similar point in discussing Winckelmann's presentation of the
great ideal nudes - not only the self-absorbed Antinous but also, for
example, the more active Apollo Belvedere - as figures that seem 'to require
no female other'. This 'blanking out of the feminine' is, he argues, given
its 'charge and necessity' not by the critic's homosexuality, but by a more
general 'male disavowal of femininity, or a fear of castration as Freud
would have it, operating in the dominantly heterosexual culture of his
period'.
In setting Winckelmann within this wider context of 18th-century
masculinity, Flesh and the Ideal is unapologetically concerned with male
rather than female desire. And throughout the book, Potts is at pains to
emphasise the fascination with violence lurking within the ideal of
classical calm: he notes Winckelmann's dramatic elaboration of a response to
the Apollo Belvedere that entails not only identifying with the power of the
god but also experiencing a frisson of masochistic subjection to him.
Flesh and the Ideal faces a major problem of presentation: the classical
sculptures that Winckelmann so rapturously describes have, since the late
18th century, come to be seen by many as dry and insipid. Artists of the
1960s, far from happily 'imagining being seduced, even violated, by the
Apollo Belvedere', in the manner of the 18th-century man of taste, rudely
dislodged plaster casts of them from their established place in art schools.
Potts makes vigorous attempts to seize the imagination of contemporary
readers, and offers a wide array of interesting starting-points and helpful
pieces of analysis. Often, however, the book resembles a fragmented series
of essays: the reader waits in vain for a moment when the full excitement of
the project as a whole will become apparent.
The author makes his task yet more difficult by saying very little about the
literary qualities of Winckelmann's writings - the language of erotic
longing and febrile speculation in which his vision is traced out. This lack
of interest is not, perhaps, a mere coincidence: for all his emphasis on the
darker, more disturbing side of the classical ideal, Potts is himself, in
his prose style, surprisingly unimpassioned.

VALUES: COLLAPSE AND CURE by Lord Hailsham HarperCollins Pounds 12.99, 177
pages
There have always been at least two Quintins, quite apart from whether he
was called Hogg or Lord Hailsham at the time. One is the rather wild,
bell-ringing politician who gave up his title in order to seek the
premiership when Harold Macmillan became ill. Another is the
lawyer-philosopher who has written around 20 books. Along with Enoch Powell
he must have been one of the most erudite members of a postwar Tory cabinet
and, like Powell, he is a great survivor. Both have a flair for publicity.
In a famous passage Hailsham once wrote: 'Conservatives do not believe that
the political struggle is the most important thing in life. In this they
differ from Communists, Socialists, Nazis, Fascists, social creditors and
most members of the British Labour Party. The simplest of them prefer
foxhunting, the wisest religion.'
Half a century on, Hailsham airs his doubts, not about politics, but about
religious belief. Values: Collapse and Cure is a remarkable book in several
ways. It is the facsimile of a manuscript. It is very short, at times - like
his memoirs, A Sparrow's Flight, very personal - and does not come to any
startling conclusion.
Hailsham explains that around the end of 1992, when he was well into his
eighties, he fell into a mood of deep depression. The principal reason seems
to have been the perception that the great hopes that had been entertained
for the future in 1945 had not been realised. Thus he re-examined the basis
of his religious and philosophical beliefs.
If there is one single thread, it is that he believes in the need for order.
But it is not order of an authoritarian kind. The libertarian in him comes
out when he defends minorities - 'protecting the weak against the strong'.
Humility emerges when he accepts 'judge not that ye be not judged' as one of
the safest rules when passing judgment on the conduct of others. His
preferred definition of law is that it is 'natural morality translated into
the enforceable'.
The sharpest attack in the book is directed at the logical positivism
associated with Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle. Hailsham thinks that it
is unduly modest and defeatist to conclude with Wittgenstein: 'That of which
we cannot speak intelligibly is something about which one is bound to keep
silent'. But it is striking that he no longer makes a leap to any kind of
religion or theology.
What Hailsham is seeking is a set of moral and religious values on which
society can be based. In the end they may amount to no more than an
appreciation 'that the song of a nightingale is beautiful, or that it is
better to be kind than cruel, honest than fraudulent, or that it is better
to be loyal to friends than to betray them'.
To judge from the title, the depression was cured by the very act of
thinking and writing, and in its brief way it covers much of the best that
has been thought and said.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Books: Tales of resistance to Nazism - German opponents to
Hitler acted with extraordinary courage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN HONOURABLE DEFEAT by Anton Gill Heinemann Pounds 20, 293 pages
Between Hitler's assumption of power in 1933 and his suicide in 1945, three
million Germans spent time in prison or concentration camps on political
grounds or for Resistance activities. Efforts were made to overthrow Hitler,
and a number involved assassination attempts: bombs in Smolensk, Gerdorff
and Rastenburg, guns elsewhere; one man, Maurice Bavaud, tried to shoot him
on three separate occasions. But Hitler seems to have had an evil
inviolability.
These facts, Anton Gill tells us in his history of internal German
opposition to Nazism, speak for themselves. They bear witness that there was
honour in Germany in those terrible years, when to go along with the
criminal regime's excesses was easier by far than to dissent. Dissenters met
with a brutal answer: torture, imprisonment or a Gestapo bullet were the
likelihoods, yet nearly a tenth of the German population risked them.
Gill is an historian and commentator who has made the Germany of the period
brilliantly his own. In A Dance Between Flames, an account of life in Berlin
between the wars, he anticipated some of what this book records: the courage
of Germans faced with the cruel hubris, or the supine acceptance of the
majority of their fellows.
Opposition to Nazism came from the Social Democrats, the Communists, some
churchmen, student groups, and the patrician right. Because the two former
were organised parties with identifiable members - and because they were
hopelessly at odds with each other and therefore ineffective as oppositions
 -they were relatively easy for Hitler to destroy. He did so quickly,
leaving only isolated groups of pastors, students and noblemen working
uncertainly in a murderous environment of fear.
The most dramatic of the attempts against Hitler is well known. It has just
occupied centre-stage in the 50th anniversary celebrations of the German
Resistance. On July 20 1944 a colonel in the German army, Count Claus von
Stauffenberg, exploded a bomb in the conference room of Hitler's
headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg, while Hitler sat consulting his
staff. By a perverse miracle Hitler survived practically unscathed although
a number of those sitting around him died. Back in Berlin a secret
government-in-waiting was readying itself to take power. But the failure of
the plot meant that within hours they and Stauffenberg were being dragged
before a firing-squad.
This vertiginous effort was motivated by the fear of some Army officers that
if peace were not made quickly Germany would be pulverised. They were right,
although they could not foresee the benefits this painful expedient would
yield in the longer term. But it is not clear how much they were motivated
by still deeper reasons: by horror at the slaughter of Jewry, and by
opposition to the Gestapo state.
Such resistance came from other quarters, from men like the theologian
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who died in a concentration camp, or the student
activists of the White Rose, a Resistance group that leafletted against the
Nazi regime under its very nose during the height of the war. With terrible
inevitability such people were arrested and shot or hanged. It is surprising
how many of them there were, and with what extraordinary courage they acted.
Gill details them all, and their tales make compulsive reading.
One young man, Hans Scholl, who with his sister Sophie was executed by the
Gestapo, was moved to resistance by witnessing the maltreatment of Russian
prisoners and Jews. 'One day he gave his tobacco to an old man,' Gill
relates, 'and his iron rations to a girl. The girl had thrown the rations
back at him, but he had picked them up, plucked a daisy, placed it on the
pile of rations, and laid them at her feet. After a moment's hesitation she
had accepted them, and put the flower in her hair.'
This story is emblematic of suffering on the one part, courage on the other.
Struggle against tyranny is one of the noblest human endeavours, just as
tyranny and oppression are amongst the most vile. In Germany during the Nazi
years a Manichaean struggle was waged internally; an unequal struggle,
because the evil was great, the complicity of the majority weighty, the
resisters relatively few and their struggles fragmented. But it was an
honourable struggle, full of hope for the human condition.

<TEXT>
Some of us go off on holiday with Shirley Conran or Freddie Forsythe; a very
few take Anthony Powell or Marcel Proust. But Literary Companions are
different, and appear to be a growth sector of the publishing industry. They
are a species of anthology, and the idea is very simple: take a country,
hire a diligent author for a pittance, and tell him to string together
hundreds of extracts, quotations, gobbets, from first-hand accounts of
earlier travellers and writers.
Curiously enough, the end-products are very different one from the other, as
we can see from this summer's batch. Most of them are excellent and will
certainly deserve space in your hand baggage. The distinction is between
those which follow a geographical scheme and those which divide the material
into categories.
For instance, Martin Garrett has edited Greece: A Literary Companion (John
Murray Pounds 16.99, 228 pages) according to a simple progression around
mainland and islands. His style is to arrive somewhere and weave together
various historical facts, quotations and references, add a (slightly) longer
chunk, and move smartly on. The references are footnoted. The two Byrons -
Robert and Lord - emerge as the stars. Bernard Shaw offers an iconoclastic
view of the Aegean in an 1899 letter to Ellen Terry: 'Ugh] Cold, storm,
sleety grey, pitching and rolling, misery, headaches, horrors of universal
belchings]'
By contrast, AC Grayling and Susan Whitfield's China: A Literary Companion
(John Murray Pounds 16.99, 289 pages) adopts a schematic system, with
chapters on 'Pleasures', 'Mutual Perceptions', 'Rites and Festivals', and so
on. Freed of the obligation to report from every province and backwater, the
editors bring together a fascinating range of material, from infanticide to
footbinding, opium to executions, privies to pornography, and much else, not
forgetting a final section on communist China and its heroic dissidents.
I imagine you can only edit these books if you love the country: here we
have no doubt of the affection, with a quote from Lord Dunsany in
illustration: 'If China had not been there, this land of dragons,
peach-trees, peonies and plum blossoms, with its ages and ages of culture,
slowly storing its dreams in green jade, is just the land that poets would
have invented'.
Jimmy Burns does not just love Spain, he half belongs to it. His Spain: A
Literary Companion (John Murray Pounds 16.99, 240 pages) makes an opening
gesture to the geographical school with chapters on Madrid, Barcelona and
Seville, but then settles for a looser format - 'Jewish Spain', the Civil
War, 'Flamenco', and so on. He is more inclined than his colleagues to run
longer extracts (though he might have sourced them more precisely) and he
has an imaginative choice of authors - Richard Ford, Kate O'Brien, Cela,
Montalban, VS Pritchett, Disraeli - as well as the longest bibliography.
Best of all in a good John Murray bunch is PJ Kavanagh's Voices in Ireland:
A Traveller's Literary Companion (Pounds 19.99, 354 pages). It is the most
substantial of the four and was obviously commissioned for the series (and
advertised as such), but at the last moment it has been given a different
format.
The scheme is geographical in the extreme. Kavanagh, a considerable poet of
Irish extraction though born and resident in England, travels indefatigably
around the island to produce a text dense with anecdote and history,
complete with meticulous footnotes. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong
emphasis on poetry. It is hard to believe that this task will ever be done
better: a book to be carried in the car and read aloud at every pub and
crossroads. Its theme is 'the heart of Ireland, hidden, but not concealed,
in its writing'. As a second mission, Kavanagh wants to persuade the reader
to explore this extraordinary landscape. He succeeds triumphantly.
The latest examples of 'Traveller's Literary Companions' from In-Print
Publishing are less successful, and I am surprised that Margaret Drabble
should describe them as the series she has been waiting for all her life.
Japan, by Harry Guest, (Pounds 12.95, 339 pages) is basically a guide book
scattered with short extracts and tiny potted biographies.
Africa, by Oona Strathern (Pounds 13.95, 524 pages), has the impossible task
of including every African country in a single volume, requiring, for
example, that South Africa and its literature be squeezed into 30 pages,
half of which are taken up with a ragbag of minute extracts: Zimbabwe gets a
dozen pages. I would argue that there is a lesson to be learned here:
editors must be prepared to run extracts that are long enough to give the
newcomer some flavour of an author's style and impact. Anything less than a
page is surely an absurdity, no more useful than a Dictionary of Quotations.
Incidentally, Ms Strathern confuses VS Naipaul with his late brother, Shiva.
Finally, the simplest idea of all: Travelling in Italy with Henry James
(John Curtis/Hodder, Pounds 20, 413 pages) is a near- complete anthology of
the Master's essays and letters extending over nearly 50 years. The editor
is Fred Kaplan, author of the recent biography. No-one would dare to reduce
James to snippets.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Sport: Dirty tricks - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES

<TEXT>
Michael Atherton may keep his hands clean at Headingley this weekend as he
leads England against South Africa, but bowlers on both sides will be
working at the ball in search of the elusive movement which makes deliveries
much more dangerous.
Hardly anyone understands how the bowler makes a ball move. Some find swing
and dip, others cut and jag. The important thing for a medium-pace bowler is
to get the ball to do something. Straight-up-and-down merchants do not make
much progress unless they bowl at 100mph.
Mike Hendrick, the former England bowler, and a master at making the ball
nip about off the pitch, said he expected to land the ball on the seam every
time but confessed he never knew which way it would deviate.
This is not the case with swing which the bowler can control. A
through-the-air, rather than off-the-pitch, movement is achieved by
positioning the shiny side of the ball a particular way and propelling it
with a round-arm action, a supple wrist and plenty of hip swivel. Each
individual has his own method.
Angus Fraser is too rigid and high to generate swing. He jams the ball into
the pitch searching for crannies, occasionally tweaking his wrist on release
to encourage cut. Philip DeFreitas's deliveries are fuller and kiss the
surface, enhancing away swing.
A proud seam, acting as a rudder, helps this process (which is why some
artificially raise it). The reduction of the seam may be one reason why
bowlers do not swing the ball as much as they once did - except on certain
days, that is.
There are many theories to explain swing. Scientists have suggested it
equals barometric pressure, divided by wind resistance, multiplied by the
price of beer. High humidity and cloud cover exaggerate swing, wind enhances
or inhibits it, depending on the direction, and a moderate beer belly gives
the bowler momentum, or it did once.
Today, pacemen are sleek, sculpted athletes, but they are finding new ways
to make the ball move in an era when most advances (bigger bats, lifeless
covered wickets, protective equipment, one bouncer per over) favour batsmen.
One method is reverse swing. Instead of polishing the ball to keep it
pristine, you want one side to deteriorate so that there is a weight
imbalance. This only happens on certain dry, cracked pitches - Lord's, the
Oval and many in Asia - where the ball soon looks as if it has been in
contact with sandpaper.
By moistening and rubbing one side, and allowing the other to become
gnarled, you can make the ball behave in the opposite way to one at a lush
place such as Headingley or Trent Bridge. Bowlers hold the ball for a normal
outswinger, and it goes the other way. Even some bowlers become confused and
have to be reminded how to grip the ball. Reverse swing moves more and is
easier to obtain.
The issue of ball-tampering enters the story here. A few bowlers do not wait
until the ball becomes naturally ragged, and they surreptitiously scratch
it. One overseas player can mimic the blemishes and abrasions caused by
different surfaces so his handiwork is impossible to detect.
There is a recent school of thought that believes that rubbing dirt into
cuts on the dry, scuffed side exaggerates the difference between wet and dry
and creates air pockets. A problem is that the laws are woolly. Law 42.5
permits polishing but forbids any action to 'alter the condition of the
ball', this includes applying soil but could also include bowling or hitting
the ball.
Movement is only effective if the ball is put in a dangerous area. The
advantage of swing is that it can turn a bad ball - say a half-volley - into
a good one as it curves away late.
What the administrators forget is that cricket is a contest between bat and
ball, not leather paying homage to willow. If you try to clip a bowler's
wings he will find another way to fly.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Call it luck or good planning, but I have just spent a week driving, turn
and turn about over familiar roads in normal conditions, what I reckon are
Europe's two best medium-sized and priced diesel cars.
There is no better way to gain a realistic idea of how a car will perform in
a buyer's or user-chooser's hands. New model launches in glamorous places
are all very well. They are entertaining and enjoyable to go on. But a few
hours driving gives only a taste of a car.
The two cars were a Citroen Xantia 1.9TD VSX - my current personal transport
 -and a VW Golf 1.9TDI GL. The Xantia, which has been consistently
outselling the Rover 600, Nissan Primera and Toyota Carina in Britain, is
beyond argument the most elegant family car of all. Though VW's Golf will
not win beauty contests, its looks are clean and inoffensive.
Styling apart, the strongest feature of the Xantia is its gas/hydraulic,
self-levelling suspension. No other car in its class comes near to it for
ride comfort over every kind of road. Bumps are swallowed. Electronic
sensors detect and stifle incipient roll on fast corners by stiffening the
suspension on the left or right side as necessary. Regardless of its load,
the Xantia always remains on an even keel and the quality of its ride is
unchanged. There is nothing wrong with the Golf's ride or handling, either,
but it simply does not rise to the same heights of excellence as the Xantia.
Both cars have 1.9-litre capacity turbo-diesel engines. The Citroen's is the
latest development of the XUD unit which for more than 10 years has set a
standard against which others have been judged. It may well be approaching
the end of its production life in its present form but has few rivals for
refinement and performance. The Golf's is a direct injection (DI) engine,
the Citroen's (like those of practically all other diesel cars) has indirect
injection (ID). Without going into technicalities, DI means that fuel is
injected straight into the cylinder, ID that it goes into a chamber a few
millimetres to one side. Direct injection is inherently more economical. But
it is also noisier.
On paper, the performance statistics of both cars are remarkably similar.
The Golf's engine puts out 90 horsepower at 4,000 revolutions per minute,
the Xantia's 92hp, also at 4,000rpm. Their maximum torque (pulling power at
a given engine speed) is virtually identical, but the Golf's peaks at
1,900rpm, the Xantia's at 2,250rpm. What this means is that the Golf wins
hands down for flexibility at low to moderate speeds.
The Xantia's engine is smooth but feels lethargic until the turbocharger
begins delivering useful boost at just under 2,000rpm. The Golf's, though,
comes alive at little more than 1,500rpm and is pulling like a heavy truck's
diesel long before 2,000rpm is reached.
The Golf 1.9 TDI climbed hills strongly at least one gear higher than the
Xantia. Keep the tachometer needle over 2,000rpm and the Xantia's
performance is beyond reproach. Hard driven, it is a flyer. The Golf TDI is
far more economical than the Xantia, easily capable of bettering 50mpg (5.65
l/100km) against the Citroen's figure of just over 40mpg (7.06 l/100km). But
the Golf is also noisier.
The VW engine, which starts instantly from cold without needing a few
seconds pre-heating from glow plugs, is decidedly throbby at low speeds and
is never so self-effacing as the Xantia's. The Xantia's engine is so quiet
that the modest sounds from the tyres and the air conditioning drown its
hum.
Both cars have five-speed gearboxes; the Golf's is the silkier of the two.
Citroen has just given a facelift to the Xantia and the big XM for 1995,
adding driver-side airbags while keeping the radio controls on the steering
wheel. The XM turbo-diesel now has a 2.5-litre engine - still an indirect
injection unit - but comes only with manual gears. No automatic transmission
is strong enough to handle the 2.5's pulling power.
Buyers wedded to diesel and two-pedal control must still have the original
12-valve, 2.1-litre engine.
If anyone at Citroen is listening, I have a suggestion. Put the XM's
2.1-litre engine - I am assured it would fit - and automatic transmission in
a Xantia. It would have 20 per cent more power and torque than the current
1.9-litre turbo-diesel, which is not available at all as an automatic though
the non-turbo version is.
Given Citroen's traditionally keen pricing, it would knock sideways what
little competition there is among mid-sized executive two-pedal
turbo-diesels.

FT  06 AUG 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Condor brings a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker aim to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip. They are now in South America.
We have not set the world on fire with our skiing exploits in July, but we
may have set a new towing record, following the final and humiliating
immobilisation of our borrowed Lada vehicle.
For 500 rainswept kilometres, drivers of four breakdown trucks from the
Automovil Clubs of both Argentina and Chile, working in relay, towed us from
the shores of Nahuel Huapi, trundling tank-like through the snow-clad
Eucalyptus trees of the Puyehue Pass across the Cordillera, back to Temuco
and the hamlet of General Lopez, from where we borrowed our Russian vehicle
three weeks ago.
Our troubles had started just 5.7kms from the lakeside Dut Club Hotel, where
we had left our last Argentine money as a tip. Whining and juddering noises
came from the back-axle region, accompanied by smoke from our undercarriage:
the FT Ski Expedition seemed to be falling apart.
Abandoning the vehicle at the roadside, we summoned our usual cab - because
of our transport crisis, we had been getting to the slopes by taxi all week
 -to take us to the Gran Catedral resort, where we found that none of our
credit cards would deliver us fresh funds and no one would change our
American Express travellers cheques. (The Argentines are funny about
travellers cheques.)
After 10 consecutive days of rain, we now found ourselves with no transport,
no money and nowhere to stay for our unscheduled extra stop in Argentina.
Perhaps we had tempted fate by celebrating our 200th consecutive day of
skiing the night before with a champagne dinner in Bariloche.
As Lucy and I rode the Telesilla Del Condor chairlift trying to unscramble
the mess we were in, a huge condor soared above us, its wings flapping
languidly. Low-flying condors are supposed to signal bad weather, but this
one brought our first sunshine for weeks. It was a good omen. Our luck was
about to change.
Funds were suddenly forthcoming from our credit cards, and although
Bariloche was packed with families enjoying the school holidays, Heini
Kempel, director of the Catedral ski school, found us just about the last
empty apartment in the resort. Now we could eat, sleep and ski - but not
drive.
At first we were reconciled to having the Lada repaired locally, where it
would cost more than twice as much as in Chile.
Then Lucy had the bright idea: it would be much cheaper to get it towed back
to Chile for repairs. When it was fixed, the vehicle's owner, Robert
Stanton, would put it on the night train to Santiago, where we could collect
it and continue our journey east of the Andes.
Our marathon tow ended at the Automovil Club de Chile's garage in Temuco,
where we faced a further problem: how were we going to get to the snow
without the four-wheel-drive vehicle? Local taxi companies confirmed our
fears: no one wanted to drive us to the foothills of the Llaima Volcano (the
only ski area for more than 100 miles). But in torrential rain and gathering
darkness we managed to lay our hands on a Chevrolet truck and set off into
the night.
It was 50 miles from Temuco to the nearest snow. Over half the distance was
along unpaved and deeply pot-holed roads, with several sections under water.
We had to drive past vehicles trapped in the flood amid uprooted drainage
pipes. Fortunately we did not become bogged down ourselves or we would have
been unable to ski for the first time during our travels.
It was a truly wretched night, and the 'skiing', in fields and along the
road in almost total darkness and pouring rain - was grim. So was our return
journey.
The following day we had to repeat the whole process before boarding an
all-night train to take us north back to Santiago, and on to what promised
to be the best skiing region in the southern hemisphere: the three resorts
of La Parva, Valle Nevado and El Colorado - the nearest thing in South
America to France's Trois Vallees.
At least it was daylight this time, and the flood waters had receded. We
took the ancient train from Temuco to Santiago and slumbered fitfully as the
ancient locomotive built up speed on its way towards the Chilean capital. We
dreamt of volcanoes and condors.
Or was it champagne and smoked salmon by the Thames at Henley?
Our travel arrangements ware made by Passage To South America, 41, North End
Road, West Kensington, London W14. Tel:071-602 9889.
We stayed at the Club Hotel Las Lomas De Correntoso in Villa La Angostura,
six miles from the Cerro Bayo ski area, and at the Dut Club Hotel near Llao
Llao, 13 miles from Gran Catedral ski area, Bariloche.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Sport: Princess Anne negotiates a tricky course -
Equestrianism / Keith Wheatley learns about the economics of eventing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold medal success for the British eventing team last weekend at the World
Equestrian Games should give attendances a welcome boost at the Calor Gas
British Open championship beginning next Friday. It will be a relief to one
of the event's co-founders, the Princess Royal.
She and former husband, Captain Mark Phillips, both former Olympic
competitors, have created something at their home that has grown far beyond
their original vision. Equestrian entrepreneurs with a creative urge and
some spare land should read their story before building the first fence.
'We simply wanted to build a demanding advanced course as a contribution to
the sport in Britain, because that was our joint interest,' said the
Princess, strolling on the sunny south-facing terrace at Gatcombe Park. The
steep Cotswold valleys in front of the mellow, but ungrand, house provide a
natural amphitheatre for the cross-country course.
'It was very debatable whether it could be commercially successful in terms
of the outlay. It can be if you have a good sponsor, but you're not going to
run the property on it.'
The 1,400-acre estate is still farmed by Phillips, in spite of the couple's
divorce.
Althorp Park, family home of Princess Diana, has recently gone into the
horse trials business with its own three-day event. Earl Spencer, by his own
admission no horseman, went on record as saying it was a purely commercial
venture. 'If the event doesn't make it worth its while, I'd have to take a
fairly mercenary view and pull the plug.'
His kinswoman by marriage could have counselled him to take the long view.
'When you have a lot of permanent grassland, which we have here, it gives
you a chance to do something other than graze sheep. They'll improve the
going no end but it doesn't pay very much.'
Through her own experience as a member of the International Olympic
Committee, the Princess has an insight into the relationships between sport
and business. On the recent commercial crisis at the top end of British
eventing - riders of the calibre of Ginny Elliot and Mary Thomson have
talked about selling their top horses just to keep going - she observed:
'The good news and the bad news about sponsors and riders is that they
enable people to compete when they otherwise might not be able to, but also
that they tend to keep a relatively limited number of people at the top.
'The ones trying to get on the ladder will have more difficulty climbing
upwards because the major sponsors will keep the top riders in good horses.
This factor is more obvious in showjumping than eventing.'
The Princess's own discipline of eventing (she was in the British team in
1976 at the Montreal Olympics) is the fastest-growing equestrian sport,
particularly at the base of the pyramid. She has contributed by establishing
two Novice trials (in spring and autumn) at Gatcombe, as well as the British
Open in midsummer.
Like many landowners who are also keen on horses, the Princess is eager to
make productive use of land no longer wanted for agriculture. And, like many
landowners, she is driven to distraction complying with Byzantine
regulations from Brussels.
In the eyes of Eurocrats, horses are not 'an alternative land use' and their
presence compromises land put into 'set-aside'.
'We suffer, I suspect, because in some parts of Europe horses are still farm
animals. We've had to measure corridors for 'the track' across particular
fields that are in set-aside but if the authorities really want to get
difficult I suspect they could say that spectators shouldn't watch from
those fields because they've paid at the gate. It infuriates me,' the
Princess complained.
'Although the numbers of people taking part in horse trials are increasing,
maintenance of the sites is becoming more difficult. Some have had to close
because they just couldn't fit in around set-aside regulations. But you're
not running a commercial project, it's a sports competition on which you
hopefully won't lose money.'
Such issues have often managed to divide landowner and tenant. How much more
difficult, potentially, when the two individuals concerned were once husband
and wife?
'Capt Phillips is the farmer and I'm the landowner,' she explained.
'Regulations for set-aside land say usage should not be lucrative to the
farmer. Well nobody will explain to me why it is that the landowner has to
suffer the same restrictions.
'In this instance I don't see any money from the set-aside payments but I'm
equally not allowed to use the land for horse trials in case there's any
financial benefit. It's a difficult debate and I think it's one that's
soured by the fact that Brussels is paying out vast amounts of money for
people to do nothing.'
Hand-outs are not part of the natural style of the Princess Royal. Next
weekend she edges modestly into the retail business with the launch of
Gatcombe Park polo shirts and sweat shirts.
'People have often asked for them in the past, so it's by way of an
experiment,' she said. 'What's the point of letting outsiders do it, when it
can benefit people on the estate if we handle it ourselves? But we won't be
selling them outside Gatcombe itself. I don't see myself taking a trade
stand at Burghley and Badminton.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Property: Name on the wall - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our competition (Weekend FT, July 9/10) for the best suggestion for a new
blue plaque to commemorate a famous person who had lived or stayed in London
produced intriguing suggestions. We had to exclude 6 Roland Gardens, SW7,
where Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, opened her first
school in 1926 since Dame Ninette is still alive. But it is one to pass on
to English Heritage.
James C Currey of Dallas, Texas, had an unusual proposal: the legation of
the Republic of Texas, 1838-1846, in St James's Street, SW1. Two years after
the state won independence from Mexico it sent a minister to London. The
British government proposed dominion status, as Canada obtained in 1867, but
in 1846 Texas joined the Union.
Antoin Daltun, of Dublin, suggested two sites connected to the Anglo-Irish
Treaty negotiations of 1921, which led to the Irish Free State: 22 Hans
Place, SW1, the Irish delegation's headquarters, and 15 Cadogan Gardens,
SW3, where Michael Collins stayed. Both good ideas, and unusual locations.
Thomas Hackett, in Luxembourg, wants to celebrate 90 years of the entente
cordiale with France by honouring the philosopher-poet Paul Valery, who
worked at 15 St Swithin's Lane, EC4 in 1896.
Among other suggestions was the former home of Wallis Simpson (later Duchess
of Windsor).
But the winner of the bottle of Laurent Perrier champagne must be the writer
Peter Hopkirk, who points out that John Buchan (later Lord Tweedsmuir and
Governor- General of Canada) is a surprising omission. He lived at 76
Portland Place, W1, from 1912 to 1919 where he wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps
and Greenmantle. Across the road is the Turkish ambassador's handsome
residence - 'fittingly, perhaps, as much of the action of Greenmantle is set
in Turkey'.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Mediterranean Property: a Two-Part Series - The rocky path
to your dream villa - Holiday Homes / Gerald Cadogan weighs up the pros and
cons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why not turn the Mediterranean holiday into something permanent? It becomes
a big temptation when the fifth carafe arrives at four in the afternoon. 'We
could buy a place out here.'
Think many times before you even decide to look. Do you really want the
burden of another home a long way from the UK? How would it affect your
life? Can you afford it? Can you find someone to look after it, or to manage
the letting, when you are away?
If the answers are yes, then review the special difficulties of life in the
Med. Can you cope with the toughness which seems to grow out of the rocks,
thorny scrub and parching winds? Tourists may not notice it. But if you live
there, it is bound to hit you.
What sort of trouble arises? A dispute over boundaries, mysterious
happenings to the water supply, or nasty rumours in the village; how
convenient to blame a foreigner.
If you are still game, take lots of holidays to find out where you want to
be and in what type of home: a flat in Nice or a luxury villa, a farmhouse
to convert, or one already converted?
How close must you be to the sea, the motorway or an airport? For how many
months are there cheap flights home? And, not least, where is the nearest
emergency hospital? (Gashing myself last week in Crete, I visited three
casualty units in three days. All were quick and effective, but it may have
helped that I spoke Greek.) To enjoy the Mediterranean do not be a
chauvinistic expatriate. Make the effort to learn the language and the way
of life. The house hunt becomes much easier when you can pick up what is not
said as well as what is said.
Become friends also with the village mayor, or someone in the mayor's
office. He eases hassles, and can put in a word to the right official when
you want a building permit. Throughout the Mediterranean knowing the right
person is vital. Do not take part in village quarrels or politics. This
could rebound on you if the other side wins the next election.
The truly fluent may find a house on their own or through friends, but most
people need an agency. If it is not a well-known name, ask how long it has
been in business, what it has bought or sold and what lawyers it uses.
'How is the water supply?' must be one of the first questions. Water is
always chancy in the Mediterranean and, if you are uncertain, it is better
not to buy. With a public supply, ask if it has been cut off in recent
summers. That will mean buying buckets for the loo. If it is a well, does it
run dry? Is there enough water for a swimming pool? That matters most when
you are inland. 'You can't let a house without one,' says David
Rosslyn-Smith of French property agent Sifex. If you want to put a pool in,
check that you will get planning permission before you buy.
To avoid trouble, or even litigation, be certain where the property
boundaries are and let your potential neighbours see that you know. Inquire
about new roads, sewage works and other projects. The EU has been pouring
money into Mediterranean infrastructure schemes.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Mediterranean Property, a Two-Part Series: Beware in Greece
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece has no universal land registry, so if you buy property there you must
know the boundaries and check the title thoroughly. Vendors, economical with
the truth, may claim sole ownership of a property, when it is split between
20 members of the family half of whom are in Australia. You need a good
lawyer to avoid a court case later. Greek lawsuits take years.
The safest people to buy from are friends of friends - involving the whole
complicated network of obligation and honour - or foreigners. But a good
agent will have gone through the necessary checks first, and will explain
the system and such matters as the declared value for tax (which may be less
than what you paid). A British lawyer versed in Greece may spot problems,
but you will need a Greek lawyer whatever happens. And only a Greek
architect may submit plans for permission. The agencies will help to find
builders and architects. Holly Properties, for example, has its own
development arm.
If prices seem steep, it is because for centuries there has been a distrust
of paper wealth in Greece. Property has been the main investment. (Until
recently, the price was in sovereigns. The buyer collected a bagful from the
bank, which the vendor then took to his bank.) Pay cash if possible and do
not take out a loan, at least not in Greece where rates are high to combat
high inflation. Convert money into drachmae as late as is safe, to take
advantage of the slow lowering of the Greek currency. Many observers see it
as overvalued by as much as 20 per cent.
Frontier areas, where foreigners were banned from owning property, are
officially no longer a problem for EU buyers - but you might need help from
the lawyer. In Crete and the Ionian islands all seems well, but there are
reports of difficulties in Rhodes (as it is so near Turkey).
If your dream is an island, think first about how you will get off it. Many
smaller islands have summer charter flights but winter storms regularly cut
them off. Skiathos, Skyros and Alonisos in the Sporades are attractive, as
is Crete.
John Goodwin offers a large selection of old and new island houses. It has
building plots (from Pounds 29,000 for 1.5 acres at Georgioupolis in west
Crete where there is a marvellous beach) with a design-and-build service;
old cottages in the Pounds 20,000-Pounds 30,000 range to renovate (probably
costing as much again); and a luxury villa, near Rethymno, for Pounds
370,000. For Pounds 165,000 you could buy the traditional-style house an
English sculptor built on Paros, in the Cyclades, in 1979. It has no pool,
but does have 35 olive trees.
The alternative is the mainland - perhaps in the Peloponnese or Poros, which
you reach by Flying Dolphin hydrofoil from Piraeus or by road via Corinth
and Epidaurus. Halcyon offers an old town house in Poros for Pounds 52,000,
and cottages on the nearby Methana peninsula from Pounds 18,000 (an old
olive press) to Pounds 59,000. All need work.
Where would I go? Crete in the hinterland of Rethymno or Chania.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Food and Drink: Enjoy the flat times - Champagne's crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The champagne industry is in a deep crisis, albeit often to the benefit of
the consumer who can enjoy wide variations in price but does not always
appreciate sharp differences in quality.
The crisis largely started with the big 1990 vintage, when some deregulation
of grape prices led to a general rise of 25 per cent to a record FFr32 per
kg - plus bonuses paid by grape-hungry merchants who believed that a
continuing boom would leave them short of supplies.
Around FFr36 to FFr38 a kg was paid in the leading vineyards on the Montagne
de Reims and the Cotes des Blancs, and a minimum of FFr25.6, plus bonuses,
in the outlaying districts of the Marne, Aube and Aisne. It takes 1.2kgs of
grapes to produce a bottle of wine, and this accounts for 70 per cent of net
cost. So merchants secured all the grapes they required - at a price. And
the maximum permitted limit of yields was as much as 12,000kg per hectare.
The commonly prescribed and publicised maturing time for a bottle of
champagne is three years before it is put on the market, although the
minimum legal limit is one year.
Since 1990, the opening grape price, as agreed by the merchants and growers
has fallen each year. Last autumn it came down to FFr20.50 for the top
districts and FFr16.40 at the bottom, with only nominal bonuses.
Moreover, the fall in sales and the big vintages led to a three-year
agreement to cut the maximum permitted yield to 8,400kgs. So the growers
last year received half the 1990 price for their grapes, and were only
allowed to produce two-thirds of the previous quantity for making into
champagne. Accordingly, many of the nearly 16,000 growers are in trouble.
Of the 29,000 hectares in production in Champagne, only 13,000 are owned by
their growers. A further 16,000 hectares are worked under costly leases or
share-cropping agreements.
All but a tiny proportion of the top 35 merchants are running at a loss.
There are several reasons for this. Their current non-vintage blends include
the over-priced 1990 wines. Most are heavily in debt to the banks. They hold
an average of four years' stock and interest charges are between 5 and 8 per
cent a year. Those with substantial holdings of vineyards in relation to
sales, such as Bollinger and Roederer, are better placed.
Many champagne consumers in the UK believe that the 28 grande marques,
headed quantitively by Moet &amp; Chandon, and the wider-known independents are
unreasonably dear. What is less appreciated is that, although there is only
one authorised appellation - 'Champagne' - there are essentially two
sectors: one is high-quality wines and the other, which has stolen the
limelight and some of the sales since the recession, the premier prix.
These brands buy a large proportion of the second pressing (and they used to
buy the third, until it was banned). They are sold as soon as possible after
the one-year minium bottle-ageing. Recently, I tasted a bottle said to be 18
months old, but which may have been even younger. It had a very odd nose and
did not taste like champagne at all.
Wines of this class, the basic cost of which is FFr34, sell in the French
supermarkets at about FFr45 francs a bottle, including VAT. Somewhere along
the line someone is losing money, possibly at the insistence of the banks.
These premier prix champagnes have between 25 and 35 per cent of the French
market, and have hurt the 5,000 growers who sell under their own label at
medium prices and the co-ops. Together these two groups used to account for
nearly half the French market.
This does not imply that all premier prix champagnes are unacceptable or
that champagnes that sell in the UK at between Pounds 12 and Pounds 10 are
poor. But they are in a different class from the brands that have made
champagne's reputation throughout the world.
The grandes marques buy a large proportion of their grapes from the grands
and premiers crus that occupy a third of the total appellation area. They
will press the grapes in their own or other approved press-houses. But it is
the selection of their still wines, perhaps from as many as 100 villages,
that provides their quality and their house style.
Then there is the expensive three years in bottle before marketing.
Inevitable too, are the promotion costs. Omitting vintage champagnes and
special cuvees, which are in a different league, does it mean that finer
champagnes are over-priced? But are the crus classes of Bordeaux and the
single vineyards of the Cote d'Or too dear? It depends on how much one likes
fine claret and red and white burgundy.
In Champagne, with its blending system, the finer champagnes are at least
much more consistent in quality.
As the more expensive grapes pass out of the blends, will the classic
champagnes become cheaper to consum-ers?
No, because prices have already been cut. In France the normal price on the
shelf of Moet &amp; Chandon's Brut Imperial is FFr115 (Pounds 13.83) a bottle -
the same as in 1988.
However, the price of grapes at the coming vintage is likely to alter
little: perhaps 50 centimes or a franc more than last year's FFr20.5 for the
grand crus. A rise in the maximum permitted yield from 8,400kg to 9,000kg
was a small concession to the growers.
But the banks are unlikely to increase their loans either to the merchants
to pay more for their purchases or to the growers to make a bigger harvest.
Overall, the total indebtedness of the industry is greater than its
turnover. Jean-Claude Rouzaud, head of Roederer and president of the
Syndicat des Grandes Marques said: 'We need five years of low grape prices.'
This will not be welcome to the growers, who may prefer instead to sell
their grapes to the co-operative or produce their own champagne, but for
champagne lovers now is the time to buy. Competition has led to marked
technical improvements, and this extends down to some of the premier prix
brands.
At the classier houses, where stocks often exceed five years' sales, it is
resulting in more mature champagne sold at stable prices and the quality /
price level is higher than ever.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Cookery: Serious salads for summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salads that consist of a few fragile leaves are all very well for ladies who
toy with lunch, but now that the summer holiday season is here, lunchtime
salads need to be substantial enough to satisfy grown men and ravenous
teenagers.
Salade Nicoise used to be one of my regular summer lunchtime standbys. Greek
salad with cucumber, tomato, thyme, oregano, feta cheese and black olives is
another old favourite. I am partial to a waxy potato salad with a robust
mustardy dressing, a snowstorm of mustard and cress and thick slices of good
meaty Cumberland sausage or bratwurst.
A cheese, egg and crouton-rich Caesar salad, with or without anchovies, is
excellent albeit lightweight. Better is a salad of raw baby spinach mixed
with segments of orange and slivers of fennel laced with snippets of fried
bacon, sauteed chicken livers and chopped hard-boiled egg.
SAVOURY SUMMER SALAD Drawing inspiration from both Salade Nicoise and Greek
salad, this makes an attractive lunch dish for four or a first course for
more people.
1 1/4 lb or so French beans; 1 lb salad potatoes (preferably La Ratte,
Charlotte, BF 15 or Pink Fir Apple); 2 1/2 -3oz walnut pieces; 2-3 shallots;
2-3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves; 4 tablespoons vinaigrette
dressing; 2 dozen black olives; 4-5oz feta cheese; 2-3 pot marigold flowers
(not tagetes or French marigolds, which are poisonous); a nosegay of
nasturtium flowers, carefully inspected and shaken to rid them of any
wildlife.
Chop the shallots finely. Put them into a salad bowl, pour on the
vinaigrette and leave to soak while you prepare the other ingredients.
Spread the walnuts on a baking tray and toast them in an oven heated to
375'F (190'C) gas mark 5 until their colour deepens and their flavour
intensifies. This will happen swiftly so watch them like a hawk. If
overcooked they become horribly bitter.
Steam or boil the potatoes and beans until just tender. Slice the cooked
potatoes thickly and strip away the skins or leave them on, as you wish. Add
the potatoes and coriander to the shallots and toss until everything gleams
with the vinaigrette dressing.
Add the beans, which can be left whole or cut in half, and the olives and
toss again to anoint the beans.
Crumble the cheese into small pieces and sprinkle it over the salad together
with the toasted walnuts. Toss once more, briefly and very gently this time.
Turn the salad out on to a large flat serving dish. Pull the petals from the
marigolds and scatter them over the top. Finally, tuck the nasturtium
flowers into the salad here and there. Serve with good bread.
AUBERGINE FATTOUSH
Here is an agreeably quick and easy way to cook aubergine. It is equally
good whether or not the aubergine is salted prior to cooking, so I omit that
preliminary. This dish will serve two to four depending on appetite and on
what else is served. If you make larger quantities it is probably best to
saute the vegetables in batches - just   1/2 lb or so at a time.
1 plump, glossy and firm aubergine weighing 8-10oz;  1/2 lb courgettes; 1
tablespoon virgin olive oil; 1 lemon;  1/2 -1 naan bread; 2 tablespoons or
more chopped coriander leaves; 1 1/2 tablespoons or more chopped mint; 1
tablespoon or more chopped parsley.
Partially peel the aubergine, stripping the skin from stalk end to base, so
it is striped with peeled and unpeeled bands. Then cut the aubergine across
into  1/2 - 3/4 in thick slices, cut each slice into two half moons, then
into wedges.
Cut the courgettes into pieces about the same size as the aubergine chunks.
If the courgettes are young and slim, thickly sliced rounds are appropriate.
If they are large round the girth, each slice will need cutting into wedges.
Thoroughly heat a large saute pan. Sizzle half a tablespoon of olive oil in
it and saute the courgettes over fairly high heat for three minutes only, so
they retain some crunch. Tip them into a shallow serving dish and add
another half tablespoon of oil to the pan. When it is sizzling add the
aubergine. Toss quickly in the modicum of hot oil and saute over high heat
for three minutes until just tender and streaked with gold.
While the vegetables are cooking, damp and refresh the bread with a splash
of cold water. Shake off excess liquid and grill for one minute on each
side. Cool slightly before tearing into bite-size pieces.
Tip the cooked aubergine on to the courgettes. Add the herbs, toasted and
torn bread, a good grinding of pepper, a little salt and at least 1
table-spoon of lemon juice. Toss to mix well. Taste and add extra herbs,
lemon and / or salt as needed. Serve soon while the bread is flavoured with
the other ingredients but before it turns soggy.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Food and Drink: Having me some fun with the crawfish -
Nicholas Woodsworth joins Cajun fishermen and samples their catch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Jambalaya, crawfish pie, file gumbo . . . Son of a gun, gonna have me some
fun, On the bayou . . .'
I had heard the song many times, as I expect most people have. It is a
rambunctious, toe-tapping hymn to the food and exuberant way of life of the
Cajuns of backwoods Louisiana. In fact, I had heard it so often while dining
in New Orleans that I was getting downright tired of it.
Ruminating over a julep, I decided it was time to stop listening and start
imitating. From the tourist restaurants of the French Quarter, the levees of
the Atchafalaya Basin - the largest freshwater swamp in north America - are
just four hours away. I decided to have a little fun on the bayou myself,
and go crawfishing.
So it was, a few mornings later, that I found myself standing in a drizzle
in a pitch-dark sugar-cane field on the edge of swamp country south-east of
Lafayette. I was waiting for a couple of Cajuns, Horace Broussard and Moses
Rebert, to arrive from nearby St Martinville. Horace and Moses were
energetic, baseball-capped young men in foul-weather gear driving a shiny
pick-up truck.
Off we splashed through the cane fields, the tyres slipping and spinning on
a dirt road made soggy by days of heavy rain. It was too early and too dark
to see the flooded rice field where we stopped at last, and too cold and wet
to enjoy sitting in the little flat-bottomed skiff that we pulled from the
bullrushes at the edge of the water. Perched on an aluminium seat, my bottom
was quickly numbed.
Some fun on the bayou, I thought, shivering as Horace whipped the engine
into life and we pulled away from the bank. I fell into a daydream of
fragrant coffee and beignets being served at that very moment in the
early-opening cafes at the New Orleans market. All I could smell was mud.
Slowly, though, the day dawned, the drizzle let up and the world around us
took on a misty shape. I gazed around. Horace calls this work 'running the
pond'. It was an extraordinarily large pond, though - we were floating
across acres of silvery-grey water, the surface broken only by the
protruding tips of long rows of thin metal stakes. From a leafless bough on
the near shore, a curious owl stared down. Snowy egrets, their heads and
necks making perfect 'S' shapes, stood motionless in the brown, dead rushes.
Like us, they were interested in catching crawfish.
Lying skewered at the bottom of each metal stake, in about 2ft of water, sat
a wire mesh trap that works on the same principle as a lobster pot. Lured
into the trap through a narrow, one-way opening by a tasty morsel of bait,
the unwary victim finds it cannot make its way out and, soon after, becomes
a tasty morsel itself.
As we ran the pond, chugging up and down the rows of stakes, Moses in the
bow scooped the traps from the water, dumped a dozen or so wriggling little
creatures from each into a suspended, nylon-mesh sack, and handed the trap
to his partner at the rear. Before the stern of the skiff had passed the
stake, Horace, one hand on the tiller, had re-baited the trap with a fish
head and dropped it back down in place. I sat in the middle beside the
fast-filling sacks and contemplated the twisting, tail-flipping,
claw-snapping little beasts before me.
In France, they are called ecrivisses and cost a bomb. In Australia, they
are yabbies and are rare enough to be the subject of midnight raids on
farmers' reservoirs and lakes. In Louisiana, they are crawfish, crawdaddies
or mudbugs - anything but crayfish - and are found in vast quantities in
freshwater bayous, swamps and flooded fields throughout the state.
Cajuns, who have traditionally thrown into the cooking pot just about
anything that can be hunted, fished or trapped, have been eating these
miniature, lobster-like shellfish ever since they settled around the
Atchafalaya Basin in the 1700s. But, in the 1950s, the humble crawfish -
swamp food for the poor man - achieved a new, elevated status. It became the
subject of a nascent industry - commercial farming in stocked ponds - at
precisely the time Cajuns were re-discovering their rich and different
French-based culture.
The result was that the crawfish became a sort of mascot of Cajun
regeneration. It moved rapidly from the homes and bars of the Basin to the
restaurants of New Orleans and on to elegant tables around the world. Today,
crawfishing is big business in Louisiana. Followed closely by China, the
state is the world's biggest producer, harvesting more than 100m lbs every
year.
Crawfishermen aside, just about everyone else around the Basin - bait shops,
marinas, trap-makers, boat-builders, pond owners, peelers and processors -
depends on the crawfish for a living (to say nothing, of course, of the
tourist industry: in the summer, it is almost impossible not to stumble
across a fiddle-scraping, beer-guzzling crawfish festival).
I left Horace and Moses to their endless rows of traps - with more than
1,000 in three Atlantic-size ponds, they had their work cut out. I drove
through rice and soya bean fields, past shacks surrounded by junk and old
cars and through thick, waterlogged forests of black willow and cypress
trees. Finally, miles from anywhere, at the point where terra firma gives
way to alligator country, I stopped in at Crawdad Unlimited, one man's
little empire in the swamps.
Buddy Duchamp is an amalgam of two generations, a mixture of old-style swamp
Cajun and high-tech entrepreneur. I met him in his panelled office, his
fingers skipping restlessly over a computer keyboard; he was trying to
project catch totals for the coming season and scheming ways to break into
the French market. Outside, the freezing units of his new plant were humming
and the automatic peeling machines banged away.
Buddy's cousin, Phillip, was going to show me a second kind of crawfishing:
deep-water swamp fishing. While he fuelled his boat, I wandered past the
petrol pumps to the more old-fashioned side of Crawdad Unlimited: a bar, a
restaurant serving all the beasts that can be hunted, fished or trapped in
the surrounding swamp, and a grocery store.
There were deer heads and mounted bass hanging over blueberry cheese
danishes. Stuffed foxes and bobcats glared glassily from above chocolate
Twinkies. Wild turkeys, martins and squirrels overlooked cases of cold beer
and Dr Pepper. No one could doubt Buddy's Cajun origins here.
I had a chat with Katherine Blanchard, who was sitting behind the cash
register. She used to go to school by boat. She agreed that, in spite of the
intrusion of roads and modern life, many of the favourite traditions, feasts
and get-togethers of the Basin had survived. Take a crawfish boil, she said.
When her own family of 15 gathered for a boil, it needed at least five sacks
of crawfish - 200lb - to satisfy its needs. The great thing, she added, was
that one needed only to jump out the back door into a boat to fetch them.
If I had jumped out of Buddy's back door on my own, I would have been lost
in five minutes. The Basin, which collects run-off from the Mississippi
river and takes about 25 per cent of its flow, is large: about 20 miles wide
and 150 miles long. It teems with wildlife and, below water, with crawfish.
With all signs of civilisation falling behind, Phillip and I shot at great
speed up narrow, winding channels into a great, confusing labyrinth of
backwaters. Here, on silent stretches, some dark and open, others covered
with bright green water hyacinth, he showed me where long, joined strings of
traps lay; only coloured ribbons attached to stumps and overhanging boughs
indicated their presence. But eight, 10, 12ft below the surface, small claws
were busy trying to pinch their way out of underwater prisons.
In vain. That evening, in the Jungle Dinner Club at Ville Platte, I ordered
a plate of crawfish. In the upmarket restaurants of New Orleans, crawfish
tails are often served in a rich, roux-based bisque or etouffe, smothered in
a butter-simmered stew of peppers, onions and garlic. Here, in Cajun
country, true crawfish aficionados appreciate them simply boiled in vast
numbers with salt and cayenne.
Four pounds of crawfish - about 80 steaming crawdaddies - arrived on a tray
and I began the long process of pulling off heads and peeling back shells.
Tedious? Not a bit. There was no jambalaya, no file gumbo, and I was some
distance from the closest bayou. But that did not matter. After just one
bite of tail-meat, I knew I was going to have me some fun.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Fashion: Exotic evenings from deep in the wardrobe / A look
at ways to add glamour to a summer night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you ever have the urge, in this era of sober and minimal dress, to break
out into something wildly flamboyant and opulently decorated? Are you fed up
with restrained neutrals? Do you long to throw taste and caution to the
wind, to indulge in a splash and clash of colour or layers of rich
adornment?
If your world is a round of business meetings and rushing for the 7.15 this
could be tricky in your daily life. But there is one area of fashion where
you can legitimately let your fantasies take wing and that is eveningwear.
Many women have begun to feel that a monochrome and beige fashion world is a
dull place indeed and to thirst for colour somewhere in their wardrobes.
This can often be done by reappraising your wardrobe, putting together
pieces which have lain unworn for years in a new way.
Perhaps you have an old velvet evening jacket with some embroidery or
beading?
Try it over a rich brocade waistcoat. A length of sari-silk makes a
wonderful sarong. Any genuine ethnic item can be pressed into service, from
a gauzy embroidered peasant blouse to a Moroccan kaftan or a Japanese silk
kimono. The new designer versions are good value in the sales.
The fun is in experimenting and layering, seeing which combinations work and
which fail because the proportions do not work or the colours clash.
Generally, one brilliantly-patterned piece per outfit is enough, although
that does not preclude others from being beaded, textured, metallic or even
all three. You will be forgiven on taste grounds if you pile on the
jewellery, provided it is the non-sparkly ethnic kind. Dull, antique-looking
silver with amber or turquoise beads hit the spot. Subtle excess is the aim,
aided by elements of surprise and drama that can give one cleverly
home-concocted outfit more impact than a roomful of expensive plain frocks.
For beginners at the ethnic evening game the most straightforward approach
is to adopt an easily-identifiable one-nation look making sure you keep in a
few items of contemporary fashion to prevent the whole becoming fancy dress.
The choice is yours: most designers have tweaked both our fashion sense and
our social conscience with Chinese worker jackets made in silk or
romanticised versions of the swirling skirts and layers worn by east
European gypsies.
Others choose the more opulent fantasy of high-collared Indian jackets and
richly embroidered waistcoats, long, split-sided Moslem-style tunics over
trousers or, such as Roland Klein, of brilliant shades and veiling
transparencies that might have been worn in a Sultan's harem.
Chloe, Romeo Gigli and Alberta Ferretti look backwards instead of far away
for inspiration, with draped, high-waisted tunics and dresses modelled on
designs from ancient Greek frescoes. The advantage for those wishing to
experiment is that by this stage of the season the sales provide the means
to a reasonably-priced end.
The one exception to the national identity rule is Jean-Paul Gaultier who
takes ideas at will from India, Africa and the 18th century and then rolls
them into one with a hard-edged, neo-punk urban style. Tribal-looking
jewellery apparently pierces (but is actually clipped to) odd parts of the
anatomy and his men wear clusters of shiny gilt hairdressing pins. The
overall effect is innovative and beautiful. Only those with great confidence
could carry off such an unlikely clash of influences with panache but it is
a look of which La Piaggi would approve.

FT  06 AUG 94 / How To Spend It: Effortlessly naff on a hot summer evening -
Who can, and can't, wear white dinner jackets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In this, the hottest English summer for many a year, the question of the
white dinner jacket has reared its lapels. Once they were strictly for the
tropics - in winter no gentleman could be seen wearing one north of Port
Said. Once through the canal, however, the lightweight barathea cloth meant
the Englishman abroad could keep up sartorial standards without fainting.
Between the wars, the white dinner jacket became rather fashionable back
'home', trailing intimations of long-distance travel and danger on the
North-West frontier.
But what, I mused, as we wandered the lawns of Glyndebourne on Sunday on a
perfect English summer evening, is its current status? Most of the male
Glyndebourne-goers were in black dinner jackets and there were a few
eccentric interpretations of contemporary opera-going gear - most
idiosyncratic was a black leather kilt accessorised with a spiky hair-cut
and an ear-ring. But in the end, convention ruled and black dinner jackets
(the experts tell me that the ultimate colour for a dinner jacket is not
black but midnight blue) outnumbered white by something like 100 to one.
Sir Hardy Amies, that legendary arbiter of masculine style, is in no doubt
that 'a white evening coat is effortlessly naff'. More contemporary style
advisers, such as John Morgan, Associate Editor of GQ, and Ashley
Lloyd-Jennings of Hackett, assure me that while white DJs can be 'extremely,
horrendously naff' they can also be appropriate in very hot weather.
John Morgan thinks that nobody too young and too dashing can get away with
wearing one: 'It looks like too much of an over-statement as if you're
trying too hard.' If you are, sartorially speaking, a shambles, or happily
rotund or what could be called an 'older' (whoops, mature) sort of chap then
 -if the weather is really hot - Morgan thinks it can look thoroughly
distinguished.
Lloyd-Jennings says the white dinner jacket should on no account have any
facings and careful attention should be paid to the collar-shape - the
shawl-collar may pass muster on Humphrey Bogart (oh, the dash of Bogart as
the world-weary Rick Blaine in Casablanca) and snazzy band-leaders but the
rest of you should go for a double-breasted blazer shape with a peak lapel.
Lloyd-Jennings adds that white DJs should only be worn in very hot weather -
that, after all, is their point. 'They also look extremely nice in linen,'
he tells me.
The white DJ should be worn with a white marcella dress-shirt with a normal
attached collar (not winged), a black bow-tied (hand-tied, it goes without
saying) and studs in stone or mother-of-pearl (not black). The black
trousers should have braiding.
Those who are optimistic about the weather and have a full formal diary for
August might like to know that Hackett of 137, Sloane Street, London SW1
sell plain white (in reality, of course, they are cream) double-breasted
jackets for Pounds 249 and linen ones can be made to order for about Pounds
375. But, remember, not if you are too dashing or too young.
Perhaps, though, the more persistent problem is what do you wear over your
DJ when it rains?

FT  06 AUG 94 / How To Spend It: Why beautiful legs are so painful
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few of us are blessed with the legs of a thoroughbred and those whose legs
seem less than perfect might be comforted by looking back at how notions of
leggy pulchritude have changed through the ages. The pins of such legendary
icons as Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Dorothy Lamour would not hold a
candle to those of the super-models of today. Nicely turned ankles were
their speciality. Nobody seemed to mind the dimpled knees and podgy thighs
that came with them.
But whether it be Betty Grable or Naomi Campbell, the real lesson about legs
 -which is equally true of sexual allure - is that confidence is all. We all
know femmes fatales who have little in the way of conventional beauty to
explain their success but who radiate an inner sense of who they are. So it
is with legs. There is no need to go around all summer swathed in long
skirts or floaty trousers - short skirts, a tan (preferably fake) and some
well-chosen tights and there are few legs that cannot be shown with pride.
But for those whose confidence is poor there is now a vast panoply of
palliatives, beautifiers, toners, exfoliators, creams, gadgets and therapies
all of which claim to help the quest for the streamlined pins.
No single pair of legs could find the time to test them all but the How To
Spend It team has been on a quest for the perfect pins and here, for those
heading for the beach and pool, are some of the conclusions.
The bad news is that the most successful treatments, the ones which showed a
measurable improvement, were the least pleasant - this may suit the puritans
who feel more psychologically at ease with the notion that il faut suffrir
pour etre belle but personally I would prefer a soothing aromatherapy any
day.
I started back in the spring with Fisiotron. This is not only aimed at legs
but claims to be a complete body contouring system which promises to achieve
a 'reduced body size'. I spent two lunch-hours a week for three weeks being
exfoliated, oiled, wrapped and shrunk in Erica Scott and Sue Douglas's
Health and Beauty basement at 28 Motcomb Street, Belgravia, London SW1X 8JU
(tel: 071-235 2228).
After the exfoliating treatment you are wrapped from neck to toe in warm,
damp bandages through which electronic pulses are regularly transmitted to
stimulate the muscles. This is not a pleasant sensation and at one stage I
got quite severe leg cramp but it did seem to work. After six treatments the
measurement chart revealed an overall loss of just over 7 inches, mainly
from the stomach and the top of the thighs and the general tone of the top
of the legs is much firmer.
It requires, however, a commitment of time and money - occasional treatments
are of no use and a proper course should ideally involve 10 visits with
batches of two being taken within 36 hours of each other. The full course of
10 treatments costs Pounds 280. For a local Fisiotron specialist ring
081-202 2264.
Even more unpleasant but certainly very effective is the G5 treatment for
legs. Also based on electric currents which stimulate and, it is claimed,
'educate' the muscles, this was not pleasant but it brought about an
immediate and evident firming effect after just one treatment. For those
wanting serious improvement G5 suggests six treatments in a row (daily or
weekly), followed by a single follow-up visit after three weeks. Many health
farms and beauty salons offer this treatment but for Londoners a truly
relaxing environment in which to have it is Harrods' revamped Health and
Beauty Salon. Six treatments of half an hour each cost Pounds 110.
Much more relaxing and enjoyable is Aromazone - legs are anointed with oil
and then encased in leggings through which moving impulses stimulate the
lymphatic system. The results are less dramatic than with either the
Fisiotron or the G5 but I do believe it improves the tone. Again Harrods, as
well as many other beauty salons, offer this treatment - a course of six is
Pounds 100.
Finding myself, most happily, in The Oriental Hotel in Bangkok what could be
more inviting than a bit of oriental massage? It is a long way to go (if you
start from London) and its real aim is less to pander to western notions of
pulchritude than to work on the inner being - 'The oriental path to the
well-being of mind and body' is nothing more nor less than its aim.
In the spa, across the river from the hotel, all is beauty, calm and quiet.
As you sip your lemon-grass tea you decide which of the treatments on offer
will be yours - stimulating leg treatment? Jet lag massage? Oriental
Massage? Here you can while away the time most deliciously, you are
pampered, massaged and powdered like a baby. Those who can stand the thought
of being checked for 'cellulite, water retention, skin elasticity, and
imperfections such as stretch marks and varicose veins' by a 20-year-old
beauty with not an imperfection in sight could have a complete Body Analysis
and body service.
I opted for an Oriental massage which reduced some of our party to yelps of
pain but which I felt had to be doing some good somewhere, and later a Body
Toning Treatment. I emerged feeling at peace with the world and planning my
return visit. As for the thighs, they remained resolutely the way they were.
If all these prices are beyond you, do not worry - the simplest and cheapest
of all the remedies, and one that every beauty editor in London recommends -
is to buy a body brush from The Body Shop for Pounds 4.95 and use it to
brush the skin daily. Start with the soles of the feet and brush gently
upwards and towards the heart.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Travel: The red tribe of the Namibian veldt - Nick Haslam
drives across Kaokoland, one of the last great stretches of African
wilderness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first I thought it was the setting sun which made them seem reddish in
colour. We had seen them from afar, a group of figures on donkeys surrounded
by the golden grasses of the veldt.
As we came closer, we saw that they were women, and that their skins were
oiled to a bright henna colour. It was our first meeting with the Himba, a
tribe of nomads in the far north of Namibia.
We had left Windhoek, the capital, a week previously, but it seemed more
like light years. With the full tanks and jerry-cans of the Land Rover
giving us a range of more than 1,000 miles, we were travelling in Kaokoland,
a huge area in north-west Namibia and one of Africa's few remaining
wildernesses.
Already, an asphalt road seemed like a distant memory, and we had become
adept at cooking on wood fires, sleeping under the stars and waking at first
light to strike camp. It was surprising how natural it felt, and how easy to
forget about washing, shaving and all the other trivia of civilised life.
Our way into Kaokoland lay along the Hoanib River. Running down to the
Atlantic from the hinterland, the river cuts through canyons in the
mountains, making a natural highway to the sea.
It was the rainy season, but rivers in this part of Namibia may stay dry for
years, and we were able to drive along the river bed. Perched on the roof of
the Land Rover, we scanned the foliage at the bottom of the cliff walls. The
river is used by desert elephants, which have adapted to the harsh climate
of northern Namibia.
But our luck was out. There were many elephant spoor, and droppings the size
of a loaf but our guide crumbled the soggy mass of half-digested grass
between his fingers and pronounced it at least two days old.
We camped that night beside the river under a huge tamarisk tree which had
been gouged and torn by elephants. There were fresh spoor everywhere, but
the only excitement came when the most nervous member of our small group,
startled by some jackal calls in the middle of the night, decided to forsake
his hammock between the branches of the tree and sleep in the security of
the Land Rover.
Afraid of stepping on scorpions, he shuffled through the camp still in his
sleeping bag and, in the gloom, fell over the recumbent guide. Anglo-Saxon
curses rent the soft African night and we were all immediately awake,
struggling out of our bags, convinced that a rogue elephant had run amuck.
We left the Hoanib after two days, and struck north-east. The country
changed from rocky bare mountains to wide, sparsely grass-covered savannah.
It was hot: about 35'C (95'F) in pools of shade cast by the few thorn trees
dotted across the plains. There was plenty of wildlife here: herds of lithe
springbok grazing on hillocks and bounding away if we came too close;
ostrich and their chicks running at speeds of more than 30mph beside the
Land Rover; and oryx: beautiful grey-and-black antelope with long straight
horns.
We drove along tracks made decades before by poachers who had decimated the
black rhino population. Only 150 rhinos survive in Namibia; not
surprisingly, we saw few traces of these rare animals.
At dusk, a day later, we came out on to the Marienfluss, a swathe of prairie
bounded on three sides by mountains and on the fourth by the Kunene River,
Namibia's border with Angola. This area had seen fierce fighting between the
South African army and the South West African People's Organisation when
Namibia was ruled from Johannesburg. The occasional bullet-riddled car wreck
was a reminder of the guerrilla war fought over these hills.
It was here that we met the Himba. They were a family of five, on donkeys,
and at first were wary of a Land Rover full of unshaven, dust-caked whites.
The two women finally rode over and asked for a little salt. They were
dandling babies, and the donkeys were slung about with numerous leather
pouches which held everything they needed. Rolled in goatskin within easy
grasp was, I noticed, a heavy knobkerrie, a club which looked as if it could
do some damage.
In addition to the pleasant, spicy aroma of their oiled skins, the women
exuded an air of dignified independence. It felt symbolic, this meeting, of
two different ages. We, with our cumbersome vehicle, were intruders on these
graceful people who live in harmony with their environment.
Our last night in the bush was spent at Epupa, a Himba word meaning 'the
place of water noise'. The Kunene River here plunges over a 60ft drop, and
its constant roaring filled the night.
The sandy beaches above the falls were dotted with crocodiles, though an
Afrikaaner setting up a permanent tented camp told us that they were
relatively timid, because they had been used for target practice during the
border war.
'But downstream of the falls, watch out]' he said. 'The crocs'll come
running for you there.'
There was torrential rain that night, or, as the Afrikaaner told us, it
'rained old maids with knobkerries'. We set off to cover the last few miles
of dirt road but found our track cut by a torrent of brown water. Three
Namibians, workers at a local mine, had parked their old Ford pick-up on the
edge and were staring disconsolately at the turbid waters. They told us that
the waters could take three days to go down.
We waded across, and found the water only 3ft deep. For 10-day veterans of
the bush, this posed no problem. Our vehicle stuck half-way, but we quickly
staked out an anchor and winched ourselves out. Once on the other side, we
pulled their pick-up safely through the waters. Then we shared our last cans
of beer before shaking hands and heading down the road to Windhoek.
Nick Haslam flew to Windhoek c/o Air Namibia, London tel: 081-543 2122.
Twice-weekly flights cost Pounds 499 for a low season return.
His safari to Kaokoland was organised by Namib Travel Shop, PO box 6850,
Windhoek, Namibia, tel: 26461-226 178 or 174, and Bruce Hatton, PO box 5794,
Auspannplatz, Windhoek, Namibia, tel/fax: 26461-222 845.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Truth of the Matter: England's God
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why was Sussex vicar Anthony Freeman sacked? Was it a question of theology
at all or something altogether more worldly? Don Cupitt, the intellectual
founder of the Sea of Faith movement to which Freeman belongs, gives a
typically robust and distinctly non-metaphysical response: 'It is all a
question of power.
'There is considerable anxiety in the Church because of its financial crisis
which makes it turn on those who do not quite fit, people who are
homosexual, people whose beliefs are regarded as threatening. Now there is
the move to abolish the parson's freehold, which will give the bishops
absolute power over people's jobs and housing.
'It is coming as a shock to the English clergy that the legal protections
they have always enjoyed are disappearing and that they are now as
vulnerable as Catholic priests. There are parallels with what is happening
to university teachers, and even the BBC. This is a kind of Birtism.'
Welcome to Cupitt's ever-shifting world of free association, conspiracy
theory, random signs and stripped illusions. Although sympathetic to the
fate of Freeman and other followers of his ideas ('I feel awful that they
are getting into difficulties'), he has the slightly detached air of one who
can afford to speak freely on a subject which, away from the confines of his
Cambridge college, is causing bitter divisions among ordinary Anglicans: can
one talk of a non-objective, anti-realist God and still call oneself a
Christian?
He acknowledges the distance between senior common room and congregation: 'I
am trying to bring creativity back into Christian thinking, to make it
plural and adventurous, while people seem to want stability and to cling to
the old philosophical values. So much of our culture is so old and
exhausted, and it is very hard to renew.'
Cupitt's own attempt at renewal, beginning with the publication of Taking
Leave of God in 1980, has seen him work in the tradition of radical
continental philosophy which has not been popular in England; yet he finds
this puzzling. 'The talk of English men is in the very highest degree mild,
devious, allusive, ironical and indirect . . . it is the strangest paradox
of English culture that while we remain intellectually in bondage to Plato
and Aristotle, our manner of speech among ourselves has for a century and a
half been postmodern,' he wrote in Creation Out of Nothing.
Yet the established Anglican Church, far from exploiting this temperamental
affinity with radical ways of thinking, has buttoned up; Cupitt looks
instead, and improbably, to Rome and the untapped potential of Liberation
Theology: 'There are signs in the Roman Catholic Church that the present
Pope is so repressive that things are bound to loosen up in the next
Papacy.'
If, as Cupitt says, we create God and reality from language, rather than the
other way around, it is obvious to him that any attempt to police that
language must fail. 'Language is oblique and complicated, rather like the
conversation between a husband and wife, who respond to the sub-texts in
what they are saying, rather than to what is actually said. Language will
always find a way of escaping censorship.'
Does he not feel insecure about the proposition that language is all there
is? 'We need to get used to holding our beliefs lightly, to continually
improvising. There is a western metaphorical tradition which emphasises
stolidity, down-to-earthness, heaviness, a vocabulary of ponderousness, of a
thickly-furnished universe. You only need to compare all those heavy western
landscapes, from Rubens to Constable, with the lightness and beauty of
Japanese flower and landscape painting. Perhaps only Monet reached that
quality, in his final years. The western tradition sees landscape as a lost
paradise or in terms of property.'
The move from pulpit to pallette is effortless; Cupitt's philosophy sees no
meaningful distinction between a religious view of the world and that of the
artist. His regret is that the Cubists, the Dadaists, the abstract
expressionists of theology have been so comprehensively marginalised.
Perhaps they can be eased into the fray by events of the past week; perhaps
they will finally be ejected altogether. As England reaches the end of its
sweltering spell of thunderous weather, its Church's storm has only just
begun.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The Nature of Things: Jupiter's shockwaves - How a comet's
bombardment has sparked activity on Earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter bears the dark scars of last month's cometary bombardment. Any
amateur astronomer with a telescope can see a band of bold black marks
across the giant planet, some as large as Earth.
The 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 also made a powerful impact on
the public imagination - partly because professional astronomers had
prepared the ground well, for example laying on press conferences to brief
the media about what some predicted would be the greatest cosmic spectacle
since the invention of the telescope. Fortunately the show lived up to the
advance billing.
Why did it arouse so much interest and excitement? Although the television
pictures were impressive, showing fireballs and debris rising hundreds of
miles above Jupiter's thin atmosphere, we have seen more spectacular views
from space. Think of the close-ups of Saturn's twisted rings taken by the
two Voyager spacecraft in the 1980s, let alone man's first steps on the moon
25 years ago.
And for us as individuals, what we see in the heavens with our own eyes  -
for example an unexpected shower of shooting stars or the flicker of the
Northern lights - surpasses in beauty and visual impact anything we
experience through the electronic media.
The great appeal of Shoemaker-Levy lay in the event's unscripted cosmic
violence, spiced by imagining what would have happened if the series of
kilometre-sized rocks had hit here instead of Jupiter. They would have wiped
out most life on Earth, just like the giant meteorite that is believed to
have ended the dinosaur era 65m years ago when it left a crater stretching
180km across what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
The dark marks smeared across Jupiter's southern hemisphere are dust and/or
soot thrown into the upper atmosphere by the explosion of the cometary
fragments. Astronomers expect them to persist for many months. On Earth,
that much smoke and dust would plunge the whole planet into a sunless, icy
'impact winter'. As human agriculture and natural food chains collapsed, few
living creatures could escape starving or freezing to death.
Earth is a far smaller target than Jupiter; its surface area is 100 times
less and it weighs 300 times less. But the bombardment of Jupiter has
strengthened the hands of those who argue that we are at greater risk of
destruction by an aberrant asteroid or comet than astronomers had believed -
and that we should be doing something to protect ourselves.
Over the past 20 years or so, the view that Earth's history is punctuated by
cosmic cataclysms has moved from the bizarre sidelines of astronomical
theory to the mainstream. A respectable estimate now is that for an average
American or European the likelihood of dying because a comet or asteroid
hits Earth is similar to the chance of being killed in an air crash: about 1
in 20,000.
In Washington, the Shoemaker-Levy show has convinced doubting politicians
that the risk is real - not just a ploy by astronomers to extract federal
funds. Congressmen are rallying to support plans to spend Dollars 250m over
the next 20 years on an early warning network of telescopes. The proposed
Spaceguard system would map the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 asteroids and
comets whose paths may cross Earth's orbit around the sun.
Spaceguard would give warning times of impact with Earth ranging from
several decades for an asteroid with a circular orbit to perhaps a year for
a comet with a highly elliptical orbit. That might or might not be long
enough to send a rocket to detonate a nuclear weapon and deflect the
intruder into a non-threatening path.
However, for the thousands of astronomers, amateur and professional, who
observed the Jovian bombardment and are watching its aftermath, the
implications for Earth are very much a secondary consideration. They are
interested above all in learning as much as possible from the collisions
about the nature of Jupiter and of comets.
Few firm scientific conclusions have emerged yet from the vast mass of
observations. Previous space spectaculars, such Voyager's planetary fly-by
and Giotto's encounter with Halley's Comet, were based on specific
spacecraft, co-ordinated by mission controllers. The Shoemaker-Levy
collision, in contrast, is a free-for-all with no one in charge.
An unprecedent amount of data flew around the world's computer networks
during the bombardment, as astronomers exchanged the latest news by
electronic mail; indeed the event was said to have caused the first serious
jam on Internet. The lines are now humming with preliminary thoughts about
what to make of it all.
Key questions still to be answered include: how deeply the comet's fragments
penetrated Jupiter's atmosphere before they exploded; whether they arrived
as solid lumps or as loose aggregates of ice and rock; and what chemicals
were thrown into the upper atmosphere from the lower levels.
Shoemaker-Levy may have faded from the headlines but its marks on Jupiter
are proving longer lasting than astronomers had predicted. For Earth, its
legacy will be a better understanding of planetary science and - conceivably
 -an early warning system to save us all from a cosmic cataclysm.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Gardening: The flower of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unless it continues to rain for a fortnight, I might as well have been
gardening this summer in France. Outsiders would never agree, because they
only see the difficulties. In France, lawns are impossible. Hired gardeners
do odd things to clematis. French nurseries are supposed to sell none of the
things which we all like in Britain. A hundred years ago, French breeders
were raising most of the shrubs which we all scramble to grow nowadays: is
there really no good nursery, I have been asking myself, between Dieppe and
Nice?
In English folklore, expatriates have to take their plants with them. A few
bushes of lavender may turn up in a local market; you might hit on a
specialist grower of one variety for the makers of women's scents;
otherwise, it is back to Hilliers, of Hampshire (tel: 0794-368733) no longer
with an export licence since the EC rules relaxed for imports from approved
nurseries last year.
As often, expatriates are doing their new home down. I picture some of you,
travelling or sweating in France this month, and I hope you will enjoy my
sharing of addresses and nurseries which seem to be completely unknown to
most of my fellow gardeners.
I owe them to the essential starting-point for ambitious gardeners in
France: next May, go to the amiable flower-show at Courson near Paris,
publicised at the Domaine de Courson, 91680 Courson Monteloup.
The organisers, Patrice and Helene Furstier, described to me how even they
did not know what to expect when they first advertised for exhibitors. The
Courson show has drawn little-known nurseries from overlooked addresses and,
with their help, I have weeded out a selection of the best throughout
France.
The English myth is that only the English are growing the old-fashioned
roses of France. I now see that this is untrue.
At Domaine de la Plaine, Chamagnieu, 38460 Cremieu, in the Rhone-Alps
region, Jean Pierre Guillot quietly presides over a family nursery of roses,
founded in 1829 when our own Peter Beales was doing something else. The
Guillot family claims credit for rescuing old Bourbon roses which English
gardens cherish. Their old-fashioned catalogue is charming: it lists old
roses of France for gardeners who live there.
Alternatively, try Andre Eve of Morailles, 45300 Pithiviers-le-Vieil,
especially for ramblers and climbers, and the remarkable Roseraie de Berty,
07110 Largentiere. This organic nursery lies in the wild scenery of Ardeche
and has banned pesticides and weedkillers. The owners reckon to grow 400
varieties without black spot, refuting lazy emigrants, who try to tell you
that healthy roses will no longer grow in France.
What about the 'Dame aux Camellias' and the glorious range of camellias
which were sold in Paris during the 19th century? The trade has shrunk, but
in Aquitaine, at the Chateau de Gaujacq, 40330 Gaujacq, Jean Thoby still
lists hundreds of varieties along with hostas, pieris and the types of shrub
which expatriates remember in Cornwall. French lilacs and deutzias also used
to be famous, but some of them survive in the good list of Maurice Laurent
at Les Granges, 69560 St Romain en Gal: he is also great with viburnums,
honeysuckle and orange blossom. As for irises, their natural companions, you
can buy enough to satisfy anyone by applying to Richard Cayeux, La
Carcaudiere, 45500 Poilly-lez-Gien whose family has been growing and
breeding these plants since 1892.
To most of us, French summers mean drought. French nurserymen are much more
aware of the possibilities than English visitors: before you give up, try
the list and knowledge of Dino Pellizarro at 290 Chemin de Leouse, 06220
Vallauris in Provence. Match him with the intelligent list of a former
journalist, Thierry Denis, at Le Barillet, 581070 Savigny Poil Fol, in
Burgundy, who specialises in plants with a history and the ability to
survive in extreme climates.
My personal favourite is a great grower of salvias glimpsed at English
shows: Pepiniere de la Foux, at Chemin de la Foux, 83220 Le Pradet, in
Provence. It lists more than 100 salvias - without the awful red variety
which we all know in French public parks. I am also impressed by the fine
catalogue of the Filippis, two botanists who specialise in plants for dry
and difficult places at Route Nationale 113, 34140 Meze, in Languedoc.
Near the channel, the challenge is different and many good nurseries reflect
it, of which I would single out Martine Lemonnier at Beaumont-le-Hareng,
76850 Bosc-le-Hard. Amazingly, it sells and grows more than 30 varieties of
blue Himalayan poppy. They will direct you to other local experts, but I
would like to put in a good word for Paris. There, you can buy the latest
blue Corydalis and hellebores from the aptly-named Ellebore at the Jardin
d'Acclimatation, Bois-de-Boulogne, Paris 75116. Although English residents
seldom realise it, French style would not be French without the world of
fantasy: the yearly prizewinners at Courson are Jardins Imaginaires, which
may be as far as most of you wish to go at 9 Rue d'Assas, 75006 Paris.
For range, advice, and innovation, which is the best general bet?
Unanimously, the experts refer me to Luc-Andre Lepage, at La Fontaine,
Chemin des Perrins, 49130 Les Ponts de Ce in the Loire. Two years ago,
almost every one of these established nurseries was unknown to me and I have
never seen references to them in any English books or endless magazine
articles.
The compost may still be spread very thin across the country. But it is
quite untrue that good nurseries no longer germinate in France or retain
their old roots. As always, it pays to hunt with the professionals: I hope
that my list of addresses directs you to an unexpected opening for that
friend, home or holiday across the Channel.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Lunch with the FT: Banker with a fine line in bonk chat -
Lucy Kellaway is left breathless, after meeting the loquacious and outspoken
Janet Cohen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Can I afford the soupe au poisson? Who am I going to breathe on this
afternoon?' Well might Janet Cohen wonder. She could be breathing on
merchant bankers at Charterhouse, where she is a part-time director.
Alternatively, it might be fellow governors at the BBC. Or colleagues from
the various companies and educational bodies where she sits on the board. Or
her three children. Equally she might be breathing over the word processor
at home as she dashes out 1,000 words an hour on her latest novel or
thriller.
The afternoon ahead turns out to be a quiet one: back to the office at
Charterhouse, with the most immediate task deciding who to ask to the BBC
Proms. That leaves her free to have the garlicky fish soup, but she
continues to study the italic scrawl on Soho Soho's oversized
pastel-coloured menu, considering other options.
Her interest is professional. In her spare time she has founded various
London restaurants, including the Cafe Pelican on St Martin's Lane, selling
out just before the recession. She dismisses monkfish as 'a caterers' fish',
preferring the 'panache de sole' and inquiring politely whether the FT's
budget runs to it. I tell her that the sky's the limit, although privately I
note that Pounds 13 is a bit steep for a small piece of fish. The
restaurant, which she explains is owned by a good friend, seems to be
neither one thing nor another: too trendy to be a routine expense account
place, too pricey to appeal to fashionable young people paying for
themselves.
She is likewise hard to pigeonhole. Parts of her CV are thoroughly
establishment - the legal qualifications, the long career at the DTI, the
seat on the board at Charterhouse, the job at the BBC. But the books tell a
different story. She has written four racy thrillers under the name of Janet
Neel, and is now trying to establish herself as a serious novelist. Last
month her latest book, Children of a Harsh Winter, was published - an
unputdownable blockbuster about illegal arms deals, philandering MPs,
borstal, child abuse, nervous breakdown, wife-beating and lots of sex.
I tell her how much I enjoyed her earlier book, The Highest Bidder. She
looks pleased and says how much she liked it herself. This extraordinary
volume, ridiculed by Auberon Waugh for containing some of the worst writing
on record, was a cross between a guide to management buy-outs and Joan
Collins. One moment it was explaining the finer details of leveraged
finance, the next the solicitor was kicking off her high heels and climbing
into bed with a silver-haired cabinet minister. I loved every page of it.
I ask her whether we are really meant to believe that sort of thing goes on.
She tells me - with considerable relish - about a dinner she had with a
group of high-flying women. 'One of them raved about the description of the
affair, saying it was so well-described, so accurate. She is a few years
older than me and frightfully distinguished. She explained that the same
thing had happened to 'a friend', but you could see it wasn't a friend at
all.'
In the book, a private detective is hired to find out what is really going
on between the politician and the solicitor - a bit far-fetched, I thought
at the time. But Cohen insists that a similar thing happened to her when she
was involved in the privatisation of a national industry. Her (perfectly
innocent) friendship with a senior official was deemed so fishy that private
detectives were set on him.
Cohen's women friends may have loved the risque detail, but what did her
staid colleagues at Charterhouse make of all that heavy breathing? 'They
encouraged me to put more sex in so that it would sell better,' she says.
'They are very unstuffy. It's partly because they are Jewish, and are used
to being kicked around by women.' She proceeds to tell me that Victor Blank,
the chief executive, secretly believes that women should stay at home, but
is so accustomed to being yelled at by his wife, that he does not turn a
hair when he gets similar treatment in the office. 'He is used to strong
women who speak their minds,' she says.
Janet Cohen does not exaggerate about speaking her mind. As we discuss her
varied career she says uncomplimentary things about every line of business
she has been in. Over the years she has hopped from 'one bastion of male
prejudice to another', and has concluded that all men of her generation -
she is 54 - are misogynists. The construction industry, where she worked in
her 20s, and where her husband works now, is a hotbed of fraud. Merchant
bankers she describes as 'a funny, uniform lot of people. Not very deviant'.
From her this does not sound like praise. As for ministers and civil
servants, she is full of indiscreet tales of men 'making policy on the hoof
with their left hand'.
She receives her fish without comment and eats it quickly, telling me as she
does so, an anecdote (which I do not quite follow) about a meeting between a
cabinet minister and the chairman of a big engineering company. 'It was
riveting to watch two grown men not speaking the same language,' she says.
The point of the story is clear: it was she who brought them together and
did the deal.
Neither does the BBC get off free. She talks about the amazing
professionalism, and likens it to 'a well- run bit of the army'. She
professes great respect for John Birt, but cannot resist pointing out that
he 'does not have a terribly user-friendly personality. He comes over as
slightly autistic. But it's a good mind.'
Greatly diverted by my lunchtime companion and amused by her indiscreet
stories, I am nevertheless beginning to wonder if she is a bit of an
exhibitionist. As the conversation moves on to Children of a Harsh Winter, I
see that she not only knows her own need for attention, but has devoted the
book to people like her. The premise is that people who have had a bad start
in life often become very successful, usually in areas where they get a lot
of attention. 'They crowd the expressive professions. They go into politics,
acting, writing, certain kinds of business, running a media empire rather
than a steel mill.' The BBC, she says, is crawling with them.
She comes to know about these deprived children because she was one herself.
At the age of four her mother had a prolonged spell in hospital. At 11 her
father died, and her mother went away. 'I was left with a housekeeper and
two distraught brothers. Nobody had any time to worry about us. You end up
thinking: I want everyone's attention after this.' She relates this in the
brisk way that she relates everything, and does not change the tone of her
voice to say to the waiter that she will not have pudding but would like a
large espresso.
I protest that the book makes it look as if all children with difficult
childhoods do well. She admits real life is not like that and tells me
(rather too casually) about the disasters her two younger brothers have made
of their lives. Still, she insists that there is a syndrome there (the
Russian proverb is: 'children of a harsh winter grow up strong'), and says
she can spot them anywhere.
'Am I one?' I ask. She requests details of my job history, which I provide.
'The fact you went for journalism suggests it,' she says. 'But you've had a
rather steady career, not too flashy. You do have a column with a photo on
it, that is attention-seeking and usually means a difficult childhood
somewhere.'
My childhood was fine, I tell her, but she does not seem bothered.
As the bill arrives we talk about her career as a restaurant proprietor, and
she, child of a harsh winter to the last, tells me how much fun it was to be
called Madame at the Cafe Pelican and how there is not a member of the
cabinet she has not lunched with there.
On the way out we go to the lavatory together, having drunk a certain amount
of wine, and an even greater amount of water. She keeps up the chat from the
next door cubicle, telling me authoritatively that the Evening Standard's
early account of that day's cabinet reshuffle was pure gossip. Out in the
blazing heat she insists I take the first taxi, and waits for another to
bear her back to the bank.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Understanding French funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1983 my wife inherited shares in a small French Sicav (offshore fund)
whose portfolio comprises international stock and shares.
If these were sold would any gain since January 1, 1984 be treated by the
Inland Revenue as income under the legislation set-up to deal with roll-up
funds? Although the annual income is paid to shareholders and my wife
reports this to her tax inspector, there are few, if any, other shareholders
and the Sicav managers have almost certainly not sought distributor status.
Is there anything my wife can do to mitigate the taxation position?
The first step is for your wife to ask the Revenue whether the Sicav has
been certified as a distributing fund.
If the Sicav managers have not applied for certification, and your wife is
consequently assessed to income tax on part of the gain realised upon a sale
of part (or all) of her holding, she can serve a notice under paragraph
18(1) of schedule 27 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988:
'Without prejudice to paragraph 17 . . . (see below), in any case where no
application has been made under paragraph 15 above in respect of an account
period of an offshore fund, any person who is assessed to tax for which he
would not be liable if the offshore fund were certified as a distributing
fund in respect of that period may by notice in writing require the Board
(of Inland Revenue) to take action under this paragraph with a view to
determining whether the fund should be so certified.'
Paragraph 17 says:
'No appeal may be brought against an assessment to tax on the grounds that
an offshore fund should have been certified as a distributing fund in
respect of an account period of the fund.'
On the other hand, paragraph 19 gives your wife the right to apply to
postpone payment of part of the tax assessed (subject to the risk of an
ultimate charge to interest if certification is eventually refused), by
giving notice to her tax inspector - after giving the notice under paragraph
18(1) but within 30 days of the date of issue of the notice of assessment -
specifying the amount of tax which she believes has been overcharged, with a
calculation to support that figure, and saying briefly why she believes that
the Sicav qualifies for certification in respect of each account period
since 1983. Failure to qualify for just one account period carries the same
consequences as a complete failure to qualify: MPs decided against making
the rules equitable, since the primary purpose of the rules is to raise
money for the Treasury.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My shares in my name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I hold ordinary shares in a company in which shares are dealt in under Rule
535(2) - ie, a 'matched bargain' basis. The company operates an employee
share scheme. For the purposes of this, a value of the shares to be issued
is agreed with the Inland Revenue each year.
I spent my working life with this company but am now retired. I wish to
retain the balance of my shares and anticipate that, one day, they may yield
a significant capital gain. I therefore wish, in annual stages, to move my
holding into an 'own choice' personal equity plan.
Would a sale of shares, and their immediate re-purchase into an own-choice
Pep at a price demonstrably in line with present transactions in the
company's shares, be acceptable to the Inland Revenue?
Can such a transaction be executed by my stockbroker without any risk of his
'losing' the shares to a third party in the process?
In order to transfer your shares directly into a single company Pep, the
Revenue must be satisfied that they have been acquired from an approved
all-employee, savings-related share option scheme. A scheme which is
restricted to, say, directors would not be acceptable.
The Revenue booklet IR 98 will give you more information and can be obtained
by writing to the Revenue at Somerset House, London WC2.
The transfer into the single company Pep must take place within 90 days from
and including the date that you direct the trustees of the scheme to
transfer the ownership of the shares to yourself, or direct to the Pep
manager.
The price must be the open market value of the shares for the date on which
the transfer takes place.
The transactions can be achieved without any risk of 'loss' because, if the
time scale is adhered to, there would be no change of beneficial ownership.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The general in his strawberry
field - James Buxton meets an old soldier with green fingers and a seasonal
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before John and Belinda MacMillan set up their little commercial fruit farm,
they invited a horticultural expert to come out to see them. He approved of
the site, gave them some tips and could not seriously fault their plans.
However his encouragement was somewhat restrained. 'I take it you've got
another source of income?' he inquired before he drove off.
That was in 1990. Lieutenant-General Sir John MacMillan was shortly to
retire on his 59th birthday as commander of the Army in Scotland. He felt it
was rather late to start a conventional business career and 'I didn't want
to become a city gent'.
He and his wife wanted to live in the country. But, he says, 'if you live in
the country you've got to have something to do'. They chose soft-fruit
growing because, as his wife Belinda says, 'John has always had a knack for
making things grow'.
They bought Boghall Farm with its 33 acres in Stirlingshire. It faces south
over the upper Forth valley with views to the mountains of the Trossachs.
That year they planted their first acre with strawberries and raspberries.
They now cultivate eight acres and grow currants and gooseberries and an
acre of vegetables.
Soft fruit is the ultimate seasonal business. The fruit needs to be sold as
soon as it ripens during a season which in Scotland begins in mid-June and
ends in September.
Having a market to hand is crucial because the MacMillans had been advised
that soft fruit-growing was only economic if you ran a pick-your-own
operation, with people helping themselves from the rows and paying by the
punnet, weighed on the scales.
Offering a few vegetables as well - 'everything you would expect to find in
a Victorian kitchen garden like spinach, courgettes, leeks and potatoes' -
gives the business an edge over other fruit farms.
Boghall is ideal for pick-your-own because it is near tourist areas such as
Stirling and the Trossachs, and not far from several caravan and camping
sites. The MacMillans started by putting 250 green cards with a sketch map
of their location under windscreens in Tesco's car park in Stirling, and
pinning them up at the tourist sites. 'The most successful one was outside
the ladies' loo at the Blair Drummond caravan park,' Belinda says.
Pick-your-own took the MacMillans into a new world. Local customers came to
buy fresh fruit or to make jam for their grandchildren. The MacMillans
encountered people who drove from England for their holidays every year and
went back with their car boots full of fruit to stock up their freezers.
People even make jam in their caravans, they discovered.
They found that far from considering picking hard work, people came because
it was fun. Once a coach-load of Belgians descended on the farm. 'It was
like scavengers on the field of Bannockburn,' says the general. 'Their
courier told me they had absolutely insisted she stop the bus when they saw
the farm.'
But there are snags about pick-your-own. A woman let loose on the spinaches
uprooted most of the crop: the MacMillans now insist on picking the
vegetables themselves. Although the picking zones are fenced off, the
pickers invariably stray.
A more important snag, John says, is that 'the pick-your-owners are like
butterflies. They only come out in the sun.' It was therefore essential to
supplement pick-your-own with pick to order, not just for busy or elderly
customers, but for shops and hotels.
That business, accounting for about 20 per cent of turnover, is a less
arcadian affair. While pick-your-own may keep the MacMillans or their three
helpers, on duty weighing punnets until about 10pm in the long northern
summer evenings, some shops require fruit to be picked that morning and
delivered by 10.30am.
Part of the key to success, MacMillan says, is maintaining quality. That, he
says, depends more on following the rules than on having green fingers. But
for the shops and hotels it also means keeping up a high standard of
picking.
Sensible pricing is another requirement. Pick-to-order is affected, but not
dictated, by the price of imported Spanish or east European fruit.
Pick-your-own prices are determined by what rivals within 20 miles are
asking.
'We try to have a consistent price for the season, otherwise some people
will hold off till the end, hoping it will drop,' says Belinda.
Even though the business is highly seasonal, soft-fruit farming is a
long-term business. 'It requires time and money. It takes 18 months from
planting to getting your first crop of strawberries, and after four to five
crops you have to let the land lie fallow for four or five years,' says
John. They had to invest in plants, a small tractor, fertiliser and sprays,
and at one point the overdraft reached Pounds 40,000.
Although pickers arrived from the start, revenue grew slowly. It started at
Pounds 8,000 in 1991 and reached Pounds 26,000 last year. That produced a
surplus of Pounds 9,000 after paying for labour and inputs.
John expects turnover to rise sharply this season before reaching a plateau
next year and is optimistic about profits. Rotation is bringing some better
land into use and yields from the fruit bushes increase steadily for a time
as they grow bigger. Above all, far more people have been coming to pick
this year, attracted by better advertising, word-of-mouth and sunny weather.
In mid-July almost no fruit went to waste.
As the adviser warned, the MacMillans could not live comfortably off their
fruit farm and still need their general's pension. But, at the end of a warm
day, on which takings had approached Pounds 1,000, John was beginning to
wish he had land on which to expand. And there is no suggestion that he does
not enjoy biting autumn days in the fields cutting down the old raspberry
canes.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Revenue warns on mis-sales - Debbie
Harrison alerts readers to the latest concerns over pensions.  And a private
investor explains how hos own plan performed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue this week warned life offices that it will take a tough
line on any cases of mis-selling executive pension plans up to the September
1 deadline when rules on contribution levels change.
The Revenue fears that life offices will lock investors in to high regular
premiums which, under the new rules, must be cut over a five-year period.
Executive pension plan providers will charge investors a penalty for
reducing premiums, even though sales staff were aware of the impending rule
change at the time of the sale.
Bob Lusk, controller at the Revenue's Pension Scheme Office, which approves
schemes for tax purposes, said: 'Life offices must understand that the
five-year transition period is not a five-year free-for-all during which
time the higher contributions can be paid. In most cases, if the level of
contribution is high, the life office must start to adjust it immediately
after the September 1 deadline.
'Moreover, if the life office sells a product now in the full knowledge that
it will penalise the investor as a result of these reductions, this implies
a degree of mis-selling. We will take a very dim view of salesmen who use
the new rules as a 'buy now while stocks last' sales spree.'
The Revenue also signalled its intention to limit the amount that can be
paid into the UK's most popular pension arrangements for small businesses -
small self-administered schemes. Discussions are underway between the
Revenue and the Association of Pensioner Trustees - the small schemes
lobbying group. New contribution rules for small self-administered schemes
are expected by the end of March next year.
Under existing executive pension plan and small scheme rules, the maximum
combined employee and employer annual contribution for young employees is
more than 100 per cent of salary. This will be cut to about 30 per cent for
executive plans sold after September 1. Existing contracts have up to five
years to bring contribution levels down but, in most cases, must start the
adjustments from the date of the deadline (see table above).
Small scheme contributions and, until September 1, contributions to
executive plans, are not calculated as a percentage of annual salary but,
instead, are based on the pension payable, a maximum of two-thirds final
salary (restricted for some higher earners).
From the salesman's point of view, the high executive plan contributions
result in correspondingly high levels of commission since providers base
commission payments on premium levels and the term to maturity.
Ian Hammond, managing director and actuary at James Hay Pension Trustees,
was concerned about the hard-selling approach of some life offices which,
inaccurately, indicate that the maximum pension level under these plans will
be cut from September.
'The changes do not affect the level of executive and directors' pensions,
it is merely the rate at which money is put aside to meet these pension
liabilities that is affected,' he said.
Stewart Ritchie, director, pensions development, at Scottish Equitable,
said: 'In recent months the pensions industry has been warned that a dim
view would be taken of any activity which was seen to be promoting large
annual premiums up to the current maximum levels, knowing that these could
be cut dramatically at the end of the transitional period.'
Hammond saw a clear example of this type of mis-selling earlier this week.
'A prospective client showed me a policy that a well-known life office had
just sold to him. The salesman had suggested maximum contributions of Pounds
30,000 a year which is the current level of the investor's salary.'
There were two significant problems with this sale. First, the client had
not noticed the details on the back page of the contract. These said that if
the policy was terminated, the transfer value after one year would be Pounds
20,000. 'The other Pounds 10,000 would disappear in charges,' Hammond said.
Second, under the new rules, the contribution would have to reduce from 100
per cent of salary to about 30 per cent by 1999. 'Most regular annual
premium contracts would charge a stiff penalty for these reductions which
the client would have no option but to pay,' said Hammond.
Executive plans may not be the most appropriate pension arrangement even if
you avoid the high premium trap. Most advisers say they are over-complex and
expensive and that better value is offered by personal pensions and self
invested plans (see below).

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: The jargon explained
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Executive pension plans are company pension schemes designed for individuals
or small groups of senior executives and directors. Employer contributions
at present are virtually unlimited provided the pension at retirement does
not exceed two-thirds of final salary (restricted for some higher earners).
New rules from September 1 will cut total contributions in the early years
from more than 100 per cent of salary a year to about 30 per cent.
With an EPP the administration and investment are combined under an
insurance company package so all of the contributions must go into the
provider's funds.
Small Self-Administered Schemes are more flexible than EPPs since you can
run your own portfolio, as Leslie McClements does (right), or you can
appoint a stockbroker. SSASs are available from firms of consulting
actuaries and insurance companies and are particularly popular with small
family businesses.
Self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) are a special type of personal
pension that can be used by employees, the self-employed and partnerships
and are available mainly from life offices. Total annual employee and
employer contributions are limited to 17.5 per cent of earned income for
younger employees (restricted for higher earners) but there is no monetary
limit on the final pension which is bought in the form of an annuity from a
life office.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table (right) shows the latest compulsory purchase annuity rates for
those with Pounds 100,000 to invest. Since the payout can vary greatly
between life offices, it is important for those buying an annuity to shop
around for the most suitable and the best rate.
'The annuities market has slowed from the rapid increases it experienced
during the first half of the year especially after gilt rates, upon which
annuity rates are dependent, dropped by half a percent over the last month,'
said Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau.
'A number of providers have lowered their rates since the last annuity
table, with Royal Life dropping by 2 per cent and the Prudential by 1.9 per
cent. Companies which have increased their annuity rates include Britannic
Assurance, Axa Equity &amp; Law, Equitable Life and Norwich Union.'
William Burrows, of Annuity Direct, said: 'After a stable period for annuity
rates in June, rates increased slightly in the middle of July. Since January
annuity rates have increased by over 14 per cent, a direct response to the
increase in gilt yields.
'The future trend for annuity rates will be influenced by expectations for
inflation and interest rates.
'The indicators suggest that annuity rates will continue to increase, albeit
slowly. However, I do not expect rates to rise significantly during the rest
of summer even if interest rates are increased.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Run your own scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE McCLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After leaving a public sector scheme, LESLIE McCLEMENTS took a lump sum
transfer into a unit-linked personal pension. When the annual charges rose,
he decided he could do better by himself and transferred the personal
pension into a small self-administered scheme. He now reports on the
progress of his pension portfolio.
UK base rates were unchanged in the second quarter of 1994. However, medium
and longer-term interest rates continued the increase which began in early
February.
Equities fell sharply in late May, declined further during June but largely
recovered last month. By the end of July, the FT-SE-A All-Share index was
8.1 per cent down on its value at January 1.
There is a growing consensus that base rates will rise later in the year.
Increases in the narrow money supply, higher earnings, stronger economic
growth and worries about inflation are expected to result in some monetary
tightening.
I believe that much of this has been anticipated in market interest rates
for bonds. In consequence, I do not believe that the changed economic
outlook requires a major portfolio adjustment at this stage.
However, the fall in equities at the end of May created an opportunity to
benefit from any subsequent recovery. I considered buying FT-SE 100 call
options. These can be very volatile and the spread between selling and
buying prices is wide. To be effective, I would need to follow the market
closely at times of rapid change and this is not possible.
Alternatively, several investment trusts have equity index loan stock which
track the All-Share. In addition, Malvern UK Index Trust aims to mirror the
index by investing in a representative sample of companies.
At the beginning of April, my pension fund was fully invested. With 15
holdings it was becoming cumbersome and one of these, Exmoor Dual Income,
was too small despite the 14.5 per cent yield. This investment trust has
three classes of share (income, ordinary and zero dividend preference): they
tend to be more volatile than comparable instruments where there are fewer
categories of stock.
As a first step in reducing the weighting of high income shares, I sold
Exmoor Dual Income for 90.5p in late May, taking a 6 per cent loss on the
middle market price at the beginning of 1994. To raise further cash, the two
zero dividend preference shares (Exmoor Dual and Sphere) were sold for a
small overall loss on the January valuation. All three sales yielded
substantial capital gains - 25, 45 and 15 per cent respectively - on their
purchase prices in early 1993.
I invested most of the proceeds in Malvern UK Index Trust at Pounds 1.31.
Following Northern Foods' results in early June, I sold this holding and
reinvested in ACT, the software company, hoping for better medium-term
growth.
By the end of July, the portfolio had declined by 1.9 per cent of its value
at the beginning of the year. This compares with a 5.9 per cent fall in the
All Share index adjusted for gross dividend income. Bristol &amp; West Pibs
(permanent interest bearing shares), ACT, Mucklow and Abtrust Preferred
Income have shown the largest price falls since the New Year or since I
bought them (see accompanying chart).
In retrospect, the portfolio would have performed better if it had been more
liquid early in the year when the market peaked. However, it is now in a
strong position to benefit from any further recovery in the second half of
1994.
An increase in base rates to 6 or even 6.5 per cent should have little
impact on the interest-sensitive stocks - their prices could recover if
short-term interest rates remain unchanged.
In the meantime, the retention of these shares is justified by their
excellent yields.
The next few months should see the relisting of Queens Moat Houses and
audited accounts for Artesian Commercial, the unquoted property company.
Both events are expected to result in higher valuations.
This, combined with the prospect of a continued market recovery, augers well
for the end of the year.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Building society snapshot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Kingsley Amis' novel Lucky Jim, Jim Dixon expounds a theory that nice
things are nicer than nasty ones. On a similar theme, one could say that
well-managed building societies are better managed than poorly-run ones.
The publication this week of the annual analysis by UBS of how the 20
largest societies performed, in terms of 12 financial ratios, should be some
guide to how well societies are run. Its authors, however, emphasise that it
is a snapshot, based just on 1993 results.
Top of the table, for the first time, was Halifax, the UK's largest society.
In joint second place were Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester - which has had a Pounds
1.8bn cash offer from Lloyds Bank - and Yorkshire.
Fourth and fifth places are taken by Northern Rock and Leeds Permanent.
At the other end of the scale, Skipton comes in last, behind Bristol &amp; West
(19th) and Leeds &amp; Holbeck (18th).
A quick glance, right, at the 'Highest rates' table shows that there is no
direct linkage between it and positions in the UBS league. Halifax and
Yorkshire each appear only once in the best rates table - but Skipton and B
&amp; W also feature.
On that basis, what use is the UBS analysis to potential customers?
It is probably least useful for those looking at fixed-rate investments than
it is for customers considering borrowing or saving at rates that can vary
over time.
Over the long term the stronger societies should be able to offer keener
rates. At the very least, they should not need to keep existing customers at
uncompetitive rates to make up for mistakes in or beyond the core business.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Old firm with a longer view - The
Professionals / A look at Barings' distinctive ownership structure and
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings is London's oldest established merchant bank and it has grounds for
claiming that it first learnt how to judge markets as an 18th century
merchant.
Barings' equity has always been privately-owned, and the voting share
capital is held by its senior executive management. The non-voting equity
capital, which has exclusive rights to the dividends, is in the hands of the
Barings Foundation, a UK registered charity.
Michael Chamberlayne, the chairman of the London-based private client
division, argues that the advantage of this structure is that private
clients know that Barings will remain wholly independent, and that it has a
shareholder that understands and supports the long-term nature of its
private client business.
The international dimensions of Barings' activities are reflected in the
existence of three centres - London, Guernsey and Geneva - from which
private client portfolios are managed. It has more than 50 offices in 31
countries, and its regional specialists conduct 2,000 company visits each
year, including meetings with businesses operating in the smaller and more
obscure markets.
Differences in the business terms of its three private client centres make
Barings somewhat secretive about some aspects of its activities. It is
tight-lipped about private client numbers and average portfolio turnover,
for instance and it cannot put a figure on the minimum investment required
for a portfolio directly invested in shares.
According to Geoffrey Burnand, the marketing director, this depends on 'who
you are, where you are coming from and what you want.' However, the minimum
fee for management of a direct equity portfolio in London is Pounds 10,000 a
year, although transaction charges are capped at Pounds 150, on the grounds
that Barings prefers to charge for investment skills, not investment
mechanics.
This Pounds 10,000 figure suggests that UK investors will need assets of
around Pounds 1m to benefit from a portfolio of direct equity holdings. An
alternative for more modest investors is Barings' managed fund service of
unit trusts and investment trusts, where the minimum investment is Pounds
20,000, or even a Pounds 500 stake in the Barings Portfolio Fund unit trust,
which replicates the portfolio of a UK private client.
In London, private client money is managed on a discretionary basis,
although Chamberlayne concedes that 'the question of discretion can be
frayed around the edges, if it is sensible to do so.' He explains: 'We say
to clients that it is very important that we meet to discuss their views,
but we like to go away with a broadly-agreed brief. Obviously the client may
telephone us at any time, and if there is some sea-change in the markets we
will contact them. But what we cannot undertake to do is clear with clients
whenever we buy and sell a stock.'
Barings' private client managers favour a broad portfolio spread of 40 to 50
stocks, with overseas and emerging markets money invested through collective
funds.
Chamberlayne says: 'Emerging markets are an area that the whole business
takes very seriously. There are some private clients that view these markets
as very high risk, but I think that if you invest globally, and don't try
the rifle shot approach, you can spread the risk. The other crucial thing is
the length of the view you are prepared to take. I always take the view that
the dangers of volatility are short-term.' Long-termism should come
naturally to anyone steeped in the history of Barings. The bank took more
than 30 years to realise a profit on the purchase of 1.25m acres of Maine,
in 1797.
All private client fund managers have access to Barings' specialist
stock-pickers, but there is no prohibition on buying stocks that the
managers themselves have researched.
'One of our strong beliefs is that people should be involved in stock
selection on the spot, and in the markets concerned,' explains Chamberlayne.
'We see the analytical role as a mixed role, rather than as a pure number
cruncher. We think it is quite important for people to be operating in the
real markets.'
Turnover in the private client portfolios is low, and Chamberlayne quotes
with some approval the guru who argued that turnover is a voluntary tax, so
why pay it?
The asset allocation committee, which represents the three private client
companies, meets once a quarter and tax considerations will dictate some
differences between the allocations recommended for funds managed out of the
different centres.
The current recommended asset allocation for a UK taxed fund is 16.5 per
cent bonds and cash; 57 per cent UK equities; 7.5 per cent US and Canada; 7
per cent contintental Europe; 2.5 per cent Japan; 5 per cent Far East; and
4.5 per cent emerging markets.
Chamberlayne comments: 'Possibly the surprising thing about these asset
allocations is the low exposure to Japan, which we have had for three years
now. Our problem with Japan is principally one of valuation. We felt that
the rating in Japan historically had got out of hand, and we didn't see why
a private client, who does not have a formalised benchmark, should take that
risk. We will be going back at some point, but I think we are looking for a
period of consolidation. Japan is a very difficult one to call.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Negative equity worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of negative equity - when the value of a mortgage is greater than that
of the property - conveniently becoming a thing of the past were unsettled
this week with the publication of a new report which found that house prices
may need to rise by as much as 15 per cent to eliminate it.
The report, issued by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research
organisation, was based on interviews with home owners in Bristol, Luton and
Glasgow. It found a quarter of those with negative equity owed more than
Pounds 10,000 above the value of their homes.
Although negative equity has been associated with first-time buyers, the
report found that more than a third of those surveyed were buying their
second or subsequent homes. Most were aged under 40, and many were in
professional or managerial occupations.
A big factor in the creation of negative equity has been mortgage equity
withdrawal, where borrowers raise cash by securing it against the value of
their home. As house prices increased strongly in the 1980s, many homeowners
increased mortgages to finance home improvements, buy furniture, or even
holidays, believing that the capital value of their home had risen
sufficiently for them to be able to afford it.
Negative equity is not a problem for everyone. Those who are happy with
where they live need not be concerned about notional values, so long as they
maintain mortgage payments. It only becomes a problem for those who want to
move.
Your lender
If you do not have enough capital to move, the first step is to talk to your
lender. Some banks and building societies have structured schemes but since
individual circumstances vary greatly, it is worth approaching your lender
even if the scheme does not appear to match your needs exactly.
All lenders stress that only those with a good payments record are
considered. Most schemes are in the form of a loan larger than the value of
the property to be bought. Abbey National, Halifax and Nationwide will all
lend 125 per cent of the value of the new home. The maximum negative equity
portion is Pounds 25,000; Halifax says that the average negative equity
among its borrowers is Pounds 6,000-Pounds 7,000.
Abbey National says that, in some circumstances, it is prepared to allow
borrowers to rent out their existing homes for short periods - usually six
months - in the hope that house prices will have risen by enough to reduce
or eliminate the negative equity. It usually charges a 2 percentage point
premium on the second mortgage but this is waived for those with negative
equity.
Anyone considering this, should seek professional advice about the tax
implications. Other lenders
Few lenders are prepared to help borrowers other than their own. Those that
do include Centrebank, the direct banking arm of Bank of Scotland, and
Household Mortgage Corporation.
Centrebank offers a combination of a 100 per cent mortgage on the value of a
new property, supplemented by a loan. The mortgage is charged at the Bank's
standard variable rate, currently 7.64 per cent. The interest rate on the
loan is two percentage points above the bank's standard variable rate to a
maximum of Pounds 30,000 or 20 per cent of the value of the mortgage,
whichever is lower.
The maximum combined mortgage and loan is Pounds 300,000 and there is a
Pounds 200 fee, which can be added to the borrowing.
The scheme is only available to those earning a minimum income of Pounds
25,000 a year or to a working couple earning Pounds 20,000 each.
Centrebank says the scheme is not confined to those with negative equity but
is also open to anyone wanting to make a purchase but lacking the cash for
home improvements.
The structure of the HMC scheme is similar but the interest rate on the loan
element is higher than Centrebank's. The 100 per cent mortgage is at the
lender's standard variable rate (currently 7.69 per cent) or at fixed rates
of 4.99 until January 1996 and 7.69 until mid-1996. The loan portion, which
is for a maximum of Pounds 7,000 or 10 per cent of the mortgage, is charged
at a variable interest rate, currently at an annual percentage rate of 24.7.
It is payable over 10 years or over the life of the mortgage but it can be
converted into a further advance after five years and charged at the
mortgage rate.
The fee for the scheme is Pounds 200 and it is open to those earning Pounds
10,000 a year. The maximum mortgage is Pounds 150,000.
Other measures
If you do not need to move immediately and can afford to pay more than your
monthly payments, one way of protecting against negative equity is to pay
off the mortgage more rapidly. The least efficient way of doing so is by
paying extra every month. Instead, tell your lender you want to make lump
capital repayments, so that the lender reduces the capital sum sooner rather
than later.

Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe component and footwear group, is set to return
to the market after a six-year absence with a placing and offer to brokers
which values the company at Pounds 73.6m, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The company is placing 22.9m shares at 165p, of which 7.7m will be subject
to clawback for applications from brokers. Chamberlain was bought from Evode
in 1992 by US investor Dan Sullivan and Legal &amp; General Ventures for Pounds
12m.
The business has been rationalised and reinforced its strong hold on the UK
market by snapping up competitor Larkhill Polymer. More recently, Sullivan
has led Chamberlain into shoe manufacturing through the acquisition of two
French companies.
The shares on a p/e of 10.5 times appear to have been reasonably priced,
given the risk surrounding the group's move into footwear manufacturing.
There is, however, some discomfort over Sullivan's plans for aggressive
equity-based expansion. There is also caution regarding the earnings
incentives being offered to Sullivan, who already has a 25 per cent stake as
a result of his initial investments.
Nevertheless, Chamberlain has room to improve margins.
The offer closes on Tuesday and trading is due to start on August 15. The
offer is sponsored by Samuel Montagu.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The week started very quietly with few transactions being reported. Where
there has been dealing, the bias remains towards buying, with two companies
having open offers. Directors at both Computer People and EFT Group took the
opportunity afforded by the new stock to increase their existing holdings.
Largest sale of the week was at Camellia Group, the agriculture and
financial service provision company. David Bacon, managing director, sold
5,000 shares at Pounds 25.50p. The sale accounted for over 5 per cent of his
holding, leaving him with 89,000 shares. Shortly before the closed period at
the end of March another director, Donald Green, a non-executive, also sold
stock.
Asprey, the jewellers, featured recently when John Asprey, the chairman,
sold 375,000 shares at 306p. His total stake accounts for 50 per cent of the
company so relatively the sale was not significant. This time Timothy
Cooper, who manages the Bond Street branch of operations, exercised 35,740
options and then sold them all. The company is anticipated to show pre-tax
profits growth of 18 per cent over the next year. Relatively, the share
price is underperforming the market.
Filofax, the personal organiser people, has also featured on this list
before. Richard Koch, the non-executive holder of over 2m shares - 8 per
cent - of the company, continues buying with two separate purchases of
10,000 shares at 186p and 30,000 shares at 203p.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Profits cheer - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the UK's largest composite insurers are expected to report
substantially increased profits in their interims next week.
The results will be boosted primarily by recovery in UK underwriting,
reflecting high premiums and stable claims. Analysts warned that the balance
sheets may be weaker as a result of the turbulence in equity and bond
investments.
General Accident is set to announce its half-year results on Tuesday.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 177m-Pounds 200m are expected, against last time's
Pounds 126m. The forecast dividend is in the range 10p to 10.25p, against
9.7p last time.
Commercial Union is expected to unveil its results on Wednesday, although
the timing may be changed or separated from details of the way in which the
insurer is to pay for its purchase of Groupe Victoire, the French insurer,
earlier this year.
Analysts are predicting half-year profits of Pounds 168m-Pounds 180m, up
from Pounds 66m. The dividend range is 10.1p to 10.25p, against 15.1p last
time.
Royal Insurance is due to report on Thursday, with forecast profits of
Pounds 127m-Pounds 150m, with an average of Pounds 138m. This compares with
just Pounds 52m last time. The predicted dividend range is 3p to 3.5p,
rising after the company cut its dividends substantially two years ago.
Interim results this week for the two marketing services giants, Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi and WPP, are expected to reflect the growing confidence in a gradual
worldwide recovery in advertising expenditure.
On Monday Saatchi is expected to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m-Pounds
13.5m, compared with Pounds 9.1m.
WPP's interim results on Wednesday are likely to show pre-tax profits of
between Pounds 36m and Pounds 37m, compared with Pounds 24.1m in 1993.
British Airways is expected to report strong first-quarter pre-tax profits
on Monday with estimates of the range of Pounds 85m-Pounds 95m. It reflects
the airline's strong traffic growth in the first quarter which has continued
into the start of the second.
The resumption of dividend growth is expected at Barclays, when it announces
its interim results on Tuesday. After it cut the full-year pay-out last
year, analysts expect an increase in the interim to between 7.5p and 8p from
last year's 6.5p. Bad debts will be down, leading to pre-tax profits
forecast to rise to Pounds 670m-Pounds 770m from last year's Pounds 335m.
GKN, the engineering, automotive components and defence equipment group, is
expected to announce a sharp increase in first-half pre-tax profits on
Wednesday. Underlying profits are likely to grow by at least 28 per cent to
Pounds 77m (Pounds 60m), although some analysts say they could reach Pounds
95m.
Interim figures for Shell Transport and Trading and Royal Dutch Shell are
due on Thursday. Analysts say the presence of a number of exceptional items
in the figures make it difficult to assess the underlying trend in profits.
But most expect modest growth, with replacement cost profits of around
Pounds 800m.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group at the centre of
controversy about its Persil/Omo Power soap powder, is expected on Friday to
announce a small decline in second-quarter pre-tax profits, from Pounds 590m
to about Pounds 560m - although City forecasts range from Pounds 530m to
Pounds 600m.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Take care when you pick a pensions
adviser - Independence does not always mean expertise / A look at the
pitfalls to avoid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complexity of company schemes and individual contracts makes it
virtually impossible and certainly unwise for non- professionals to take a
D-I-Y approach to pension planning. Good independent advice is essential and
it will not come free. Nor will it be easy to find.
Essentially there are just two types of adviser: those who represent and are
authorised to sell the products of only one company; and independent
financial advisers (IFAs) who are supposed to select the best product on the
market to suit your needs.
IFAs vary in their level of competence. They also vary in the way they are
remunerated. Some work solely on a commission basis paid by providers on the
sale of products.
Others are fee-based and are paid directly by the client. Yet others take
part of the commission from the provider and charge a reduced fee for each
sale. And then there is a growing number who will operate on a commission or
a fee-basis depending on the client's preference: if you want to pay a fee,
that's fine but if you want to pay by commission that's fine too. Helpful,
perhaps. Confusing, certainly.
If you end up paying commission, the most flexible method is to pay a series
of one-off 'single premium' contributions since this avoids the heavy
up-front commissions and related early termination penalties associated with
regular premium contracts.
In theory, fee-based advice should be clean and simple. You should know
exactly what you are paying and the adviser's remuneration is not linked to
the sale of a product.
How you pay
How you pay your fees should also be clean and simple but even here the life
and pensions industry has managed to build in layers of confusion.
Many advisers who accept work on a fee basis recommend that the fee, once
agreed, is deducted from the commission paid by the provider. In theory this
has certain tax advantages. For example, you avoid paying VAT on the fee
since the adviser receives it in the form of commission from the provider.
In the case of pension products, you also receive tax relief on the payment
because it is derived from your pension contributions which are themselves
subject to tax relief. Where the commission paid is worth more than the
agreed fee, the excess is either reinvested in the plan or used to reduce
the provider's charges.
However, you may end up paying more in commission than you intended, since
the adviser will earn extra 'renewal' commission each year and 'incremental'
commission when you increase contributions.
Moreover, even if the initial commission has been reinvested, the provider
often leaves the early surrender and transfer penalties in place, so check
this with your adviser.
How much?
Fee based advisers charge anything from Pounds 30 to Pounds 200 per hour
depending on whether you go to a local high street adviser or a leading firm
of consulting actuaries. For a simple case such as the purchase of a
personal pension you should expect to pay a minimum of Pounds 250 to Pounds
400. Complex cases will cost more.
If you are only interested in a simple purchase then it is worth asking what
the expected total will be. However, you should also find out what future
charges will be incurred if you need to change your arrangement. How to find
a fee-based adviser
A good way to find a fee based adviser is to use the register run by Money
Management, the FT's monthly trade magazine for the financial services
industry.
The register provides a database of 750 independent financial advisers, some
of whom only work for fees and some of whom operate primarily on a
commission basis but are prepared to negotiate a fee.
When you contact the register you will be sent details of six firms in your
postcode area. To get your list, telephone 0272 769444 and be prepared to
give your address including postcode and explain what type of advice you
want. The specialisations offered include: life assurance; company pensions;
regular savings schemes; unit and investment trusts; mortgages; personal
pensions; health insurance; lump sum capital investment; and tax and estate
planning.
A Freepost address is available for written requests.* The register
information is supplied free (apart from the cost of the phone call which is
charged at normal rates) and no salesmen will call as a result of your
enquiry.
Selecting your adviser
Once you have your list of contacts, you need to select the most appropriate
for your needs. The register checks that the firm is independent and
authorised to conduct business but it is important to appreciate that
fee-based advice is not synonymous with expert advice.
You should ask the following questions: How long has the firm been trading?
How long has it offered specialist pensions advice? (If it is a large firm,
does it have a dedicated pensions department?)
How many people can provide skilled pensions advice?
What qualifications do they have and how senior are they?
Can the firm provide tax planning services? (Pensions and tax interrelate,
so this is important.)
Can it provide a portfolio management service? (You may not need this if you
already have your own stockbroker.)
How many pensions clients does it have?
How many clients in total?
How many offices?
If your adviser is away, who will look after your business?
Does the adviser handle client cash?
What criteria does it use to select a pension provider?
What research resources does it use? Are these in-house or external?
Does the firm provide regular updates on client accounts and / or regular
newsletters?
How much will the advice cost? Eg fees per hour / case?

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: What's in a name?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Annie Armandias is a senior sales secretary for London stockbrokers, Crosby
Securities. The firm does not provide an occupational pension scheme, so she
is keen to take out a personal pension plan to ensure an adequate retirement
income.
Armandias read Weekend FT articles about the merits of fee-based advice and
wants to find an independent fee-based adviser to avoid any commission bias
on the selection of the plan.
We suggested she should try the Money Management register to obtain a list
of firms in her area and follow the selection technique explained in the
story above.
A list arrived promptly and Armandias set to work. 'The register does not
give any indication of the quality of advice offered, so it is essential to
follow the selection procedure to find which are pensions experts and which
simply sell pensions along with every other insurance product,' she said.
Out of six names one in particular, Aspen Actuaries &amp; Pension Consultants,
seemed to meet all her requirements at a reasonable price. 'This company I
liked very much. They were courteous and explained everything precisely to
me but did not make me feel like an idiot.'
She said product selection was based on four main criteria: investment
performance, expenses, administration and the stability of the organisation.
The firm is independent and has been trading for six years as a specialist
pensions adviser. Aspen has seven fully-qualified actuaries who are also
associates of the Pensions Management Institute (PMI). The rest of the
consultants are training for professional qualifications. The firm has 70
corporate pension clients and 250 individual clients.
Aspen's fee for a typical personal pension is approximately Pounds 400, plus
VAT, which can be paid by cheque or deducted from a commission. The rest of
the commission would be reinvested in the plan.
Armandias was also interested in two other advisers but was concerned about
the rate charged by one and the fact that the second would not give details
of fees by phone.
If you have a straightforward request or problem to sort out, then getting a
fixed quote for the job is vital. Advisers who take commission may be under
pressure to sell but, with fee-based advisers, time is money and there may
be a temptation to make the case more complicated than it is.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Check for the best deal on charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension providers do not have to reveal how much they deduct from your
contributions to cover the cost of sales commission and their own
administration expenses.
Instead they use a meaningless 'standard charges' formula devised by the
Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) - the
self-regulating body for the life industry - which enables high-charging
life offices to disguise their true costs.
Life offices can use this confusing formula up to January 1 1995 but
advisers can tell you what the real charges are now. Jolyon Minchin,
managing director of independent adviser Pensionline, said: 'Investors
should ensure that their adviser has the technology to show real charges
rather than the meaningless Lautro formula. If you are offered a
Lautro-style quote, be suspicious and ask why.'
Behind the scenes, life offices are in turmoil as providers gear up for the
end of year deadline. The ten largest providers said that they will be 'more
flexible' on charges after this date.
This means that you will be able to negotiate with your adviser on the
amount of commission, if any, he receives from the life office on the sale
of a product. Further, the adviser will have more scope to negotiate with
the provider on the proportion of your premiums that are actually invested.
To take advantage of the expected reduction in charges, make sure that your
adviser is independent so that he can compare what is on offer and select
the best deal.
Some two-thirds of regular premium life and pensions contracts are sold
through company representatives - that is direct sales forces and 'tied
agents' which are authorised under the Financial Services Act to sell the
products of only one life office. Even if a salesman knows that better terms
are available elsewhere, he cannot tell the client.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: Seedy side of pharmaceuticals - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life is hard for farmers east of the Elbe. Winters in the former communist
bloc are grim, customers are penniless and the seeds are rotten.
The first two problems are not new in eastern Europe. But the last is the
result of fighting, civil unrest and a deteriorating transport
infrastructure. Perishable seeds are left lying on the docks, marooned in
railway sidings or languishing in warehouses.
At least if the seeds are of low quality, farmers can refuse to pay for
them. It may save the farmer from going bust, but it upsets export credit
banks in the west, which are obliged to pay exporters, and the seed
manufacturers themselves which lose sales.
One such manufacturer, Zeneca, revealed in its six month figures precisely
how economic problems in Russia, Ukraine and Balkans can hurt. Export credit
guarantees are suddenly hard to come by and Zeneca's European seed sales
have fallen by 13 per cent compared with 1993.
It is more than a matter of lower profits. The company has been selling
seeds in eastern Europe for just three years. Now it plans to reduce its
sales effort. It has set aside Pounds 100m to cover the costs of cutting 500
jobs, some of which are in the seeds operations.
Blaming problems with seed sales for job cuts might sound eccentric for a
company that most investors regard as a pharmaceuticals business.
In fact, Zeneca shareholders who thought they had a stake in the drugs
business must be grateful this week that they were mistaken.
The shares have risen 15 per in the past five days to 811 1/2 p, not because
of the success of high tech drugs, but because of the performance of the
company's agricultural businesses. Even with falling seed sales in Europe,
trading profits rose 46 per cent to Pounds 123m, compared with the first
half of 1993.
This is a remarkable turnaround. For most of the 1990s, every agricultural
company has had a rough time as a result of the European Community Common
Agricultural Policy which cut the amount of land under cultivation. Zeneca
says that the CAP recession has now bottomed out.
Recession in north and south America also hurt, but these areas are now
beginning to see economic recovery. Sales of new Surpass, a herbicide, grew
by 23 per cent in the US.
Share price sentiment was also helped by a hostile Dollars 8.5bn bid in the
US on Tuesday for drug company American Cyanamid by rival American Home
Products.
That figure represented a 50 per cent premium to the Cyanamid share price.
But what provoked the City to re-evaluate Zeneca was the fact that Cyanamid
has a highly profitable agricultural division: if one huge US corporation is
prepared to pay over the odds for Cyanamid's drugs and agriculture
operations, then another might get interested in Zeneca.
Compared with the excitement in agricultural products, Zeneca's drugs
division gave a modest performance. Sales rose 6 per cent to Pounds 976m and
profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 320m.
The company was afflicted by the familiar set of ailments suffered across
the drugs industry: sales of products that have lost their patent protection
fell, with sales of heart drug Tenormin dropping 24 per cent in the US.
These were offset by good results from cancer and gynaecology drugs Zoladex
and Diprivan, where sales rose by 33 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
Zestril a heart treatment that has taken over from Tenormin as the company's
biggest seller, improved 15 per cent to Pounds 238m.
The company's overall performance in the first half of 1994 is a far cry
from what was envisaged when it demerged from chemicals company ICI two
years ago. Then it was assumed that the buoyant drugs division was being
held back by the staid and cyclical chemicals and agricultural operations.
Anyone who sold shares in chemicals company ICI and bought Zeneca when the
latter achieved a stock market quotation in May 1993 would have spent most
of this year regretting the decision. ICI shares have climbed a more-than-
respectable 35 per cent or so since. Only with this week's events did Zeneca
shares reach that level.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: The roller-coaster takes another dip - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week it was inventories, this week it was jobs. Last week it was good
news, which translated into lower bond yields and higher share prices. This
week it was bad news, which translated into higher bond yields and lower
share prices.
Wall Street's attempts to read the economic tea leaves have sent share
prices jumping one minute, diving the next. This has been the pattern for
several months, and it is making everyone feel a little dizzy. The failure
of the stock market to establish and sustain a firm trend has been the
feature of the summer.
The root cause of this inconsistency has been the determination of traders
and investors to make snap decisions about the likely direction of long-term
interest rates based upon the latest batch of statistics on the economy.
They do this sort of thing all the time, but what is different this summer
is that the stock market lacks a firm foundation in the form of a
consistency of underlying sentiment.
Uncertainty about monetary policy is to blame. For most of 1991-1993, almost
everyone agreed that interest rates were either going lower, or staying low,
as the Federal Reserve took its foot off the monetary brakes in an attempt
to keep the economy rolling and stave off a crisis in the banking industry.
From this February through to May, almost everyone agreed that interest
rates were heading higher, as the Fed stepped on the monetary brakes -
lightly at first, but later with more conviction - in order to prevent the
economy from overheating and inflation reviving. Since then, the Fed says
that monetary policy has been on hold, which makes sense if it believes that
its round of four policy tightenings this year have been enough to choke off
any inflationary pressures building up in the economy.
Unfortunately, many investors fear that the Fed has not finished raising
interest rates. It is an understandable concern - the central bank itself
has warned that policy may have to be tightened further if the economy
begins to expand too rapidly again.
Yet, there is a marked lack of agreement on Wall Street about what will
happen to the economy over the next year. There are almost as many opinions
about the economic outlook as there are people to express them. Essentially,
there are three camps.
The first camp believes that the economy is still growing too fast, that the
Fed has not done enough yet to slow it down, and that more interest rate
increases this year are, therefore, inevitable.
The second camp believes the opposite: that the recent tightenings of policy
are already taking effect, and that the economy will slow down in the second
half of this year and on into 1995. This camp thinks that the Fed has gone
too far with its policy tightenings, and the most pessimistic members
believe that interest rates should come down, probably early next year.
The third camp is not so sure about where the economy is headed, feels on
balance that the Fed is right to keep policy on hold for now, but is worried
that the policy makers will suddenly sanction another rate increase when it
is least expected.
The bulk of investors appear to be in this third camp, which explains why
the market has failed to maintain any kind of firm direction this summer. In
mid-May, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was as low as 3,629, then climbed
somewhat erratically up to a high of 3,814 in early June, only to retrace
its steps and tumble back to 3,624 by the start of July.
Since then, although the Dow has steadily regained its lost ground, there
has been little sign of a genuine summer rally of the kind that many were
hoping would emerge from an encouragingly positive second quarter corporate
results season.
Which gets us back to inventories and jobs. The big news in last week's
second quarter gross domestic product report was a large jump in
inventories, which the markets took as a sign that the economy was slowing.
This judgment helped bond yields drop sharply, stock prices rise, and buoyed
optimism that the Fed would not raise interest rates again soon.
This week, the market latched on to the July employment report, and another
bigger-than-expected rise in non-farm payrolls. The result was a jump in
bond yields and a decline in share prices yesterday as investors sold bonds
and stocks in anticipation of another policy tightening from the Fed.
There will be no respite next week, when key inflation data for July will be
released. In this up and down summer, no one expects the rollercoaster ride
to end soon.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: Ancient pyramids found in Britain - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Collapsed Russian finance group MMM has been besieged by anguished
depositors in Moscow this week. The group's success had been based on
selling shares in itself to millions of people.
The share price rocketed from Rbs1,600 in February to over Rbs100,000 and
back down to Rbs950 before the shares were suspended last week. MMM did not
have anything so prosaic as an underlying business: it was a share pusher,
pure and simple.
Caritas, the Transylvanian pyramid scheme, which made millions of Romanians
rich before it collapsed late last year was a bit similar. It had promised
investors a sevenfold return on their money in 100 days, and had no trouble
meeting those promises - until the new money stopped flowing in.
Some pundits argue that former eastern bloc countries are particularly
vulnerable to double your money schemes, because they are only beginning to
develop financial markets.
As the South Sea bubble was to Britain in the 18th century, and the Ponzi
scheme to Boston in the 1920s, so Caritas and MMM are to Romania and Russia.
And of course the proletariat in developing countries lacks the financial
nous to distinguish between sound investments and scams.
The inference is that all the deeply sophisticated citizens of the Western
world can tell a pyramid selling scheme from 1,000 metres. Well maybe. But
only this week the department of trade and industry shut down a clutch of UK
pyramid selling schemes operating under the apposite name of 'Alchemy'.
Members' profits did not come from anything so humdrum as selling a product.
One of Alchemy's irresistible offers was that it would turn Pounds 140 into
Pounds 600 - though it could not tell you how. The DTI describes it as
'redistributing' members' subs. Very Ponzi.
Alchemy was shut because it was 'not in the public interest' for it to
continue to recruit members. As the judge said: 'Schemes of this nature are
bound to fail because the pool of those willing to join is not
inexhaustible'.
Pyramid selling as such is not illegal in the UK. The DTI even has a handy
consumer booklet telling would-be salesmen how to spot the dud ones. Some
pyramid schemes, such as Amway, have been operating in Britain for more than
20 years.
Am-Who? The first thing any of its distributors (salesmen) tell you about
Amway is that it is not, repeat not, a pyramid selling scheme. It operates a
multi-level marketing strategy, which is entirely different. Indeed, the
head honchos at Amway are exceedingly cross with the DTI for tagging it with
the 'pernicious label - legal pyramids'.
One important difference between schemes such as Alchemy and those like
Amway is that Amway has a product to sell. Much of the money flowing into
the group is sales revenue, rather than subs from new members.
Based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Amway has global sales of over Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 3.2bn). It is big business in Japan. And it has floated its
Asia-Pacific subsidiary in order to make the push into China. It sells
mainly basic products, such as detergents. It has around 50,000 UK
distributors.
But a successful distributor's main money comes not from selling goods to
the public but from recruiting new salesmen, and sharing their commission.
Each salesman pays Pounds 70 to join, with an annual renewal fee of Pounds
15.
New recruits are shown charts with scores of interdependent, ever-widening,
circles. (The term pyramid is tempting.) They are told to make lists both of
all the people they know and of all the people they might meet, and work out
how to approach them. Some of the people high up in the - er pyramid - do
make a lot of money. And successful distributors come from all over the
world to seminars packed with wannabees.
The average amount earned by each distributor is around Pounds 1,300. But
the top 1 or 2 per cent of the sales force mop up more than half total
earnings of perhaps Pounds 38m. The hierarchy of distributors and bonus
systems is mind-blowing.
In the US, Amway has sometimes seemed akin to a religious movement. A few
years ago, for instance, rival soap giant Procter &amp; Gamble successfully sued
Amway distributors for spreading rumours that P &amp; G and its products were
instruments of Satan.
In Britain the seminars are described as very tasteful - none of this coarse
American hard-sell. And a local network can often be traced back to some
local dignitary, which is a great consolation for anyone who feels squeamish
about peddling soap to his friends - or his friends to Amway.
All so much more sophisticated than Russian peasants buying shares in MMM.
And quite different of course.
                          *       *       *
A real stockmarket rally - or just dead cat bounce? Robin Griffiths,
technical guru at James Capel, is his normal passionately equivocal self. If
the FT-SE 100 index can stay above 3,050 you can relax. (The dreaded head
and shoulders pattern was a false omen.)
But even if the rally survives, it will run out of steam at 3,200 and dither
until the autumn. Then you can expect a surge continuing into the start of
next year. Now you know.

The fight between Tesco and Sainsbury, the UK's two largest supermarket to
acquire William Low, the Scottish supermarket group, ended this week with
Tesco victorious.
Tesco, which had originally bid 225p a share three weeks ago, was obliged to
increase its offer after Sainsbury stepped in, securing the deal with a
final 360p a share.
William Low's shares have more than doubled from the 169p they stood at
before Tesco's original bid, having touched 368p before Sainsbury's

Halifax said prices rose just 0.2 per cent on average to Pounds 63,563, the

reported price falls in April and May.
Nationwide said that prices had risen 1.8 per cent last month, the biggest
monthly rise since May 1991 and following a 0.7 per cent fall in June.
Halifax said that the recovery in the housing market remains very weak and

Having got into a flap the previous Friday about a possible imminent
increase in base rates, the City was relieved by the Bank of England's
quarterly inflation report on Tuesday.
The Bank was not complacent, warning that the government could fail to meet
its target of reducing underlying inflation to a 1-2.5 per cent range by the
end of this parliament, unless interest rates were increased in the next few
months. However, the Bank also signalled that there would be no rise before
its governor and the chancellor of the exchequer next meet, on September 7.
The market's mood was further bolstered by a string of upbeat company
results. British Petroleum lifted its second-quarter profits by more than 40
per cent. Economic recovery in the US and Europe helped its chemicals
business move back into the black and the group said: 'We are more sanguine
about the spreading economic recovery.'
TI Group, the specialist engineering and aerospace company, attributed an 11
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to buoyant automotive production in
north America and growing orders from European manufacturers.
Glynwed International, the Birmingham-based engineer which makes Aga-Rayburn
stoves and a variety of industrial products, lifted interim profits by 59
per cent and said five of its six operating divisions had increased profits.
The group said confidently: 'There is a lot of economic growth to come. The
economic background is good.'
A Pounds 100m restructuring charge did not impede a rise in the share price
of Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged last year from Imperial Chemical
Industries. Underlying sales and operating profits rose. The share price
also reflected a market reassesment of the value of all pharmaceutical
groups, in the light of Tuesday's Dollars 8.5bn bid by American Home
Products for one of its competitors in healthcare, American Cyanamid.
National Westminster Bank reported an 83 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, aided by a sharp reduction in provisions for bad and doubtful
debts. Britain's second largest bank also lifted its interim dividend by 14
per cent, as a gesture of confidence.
However, NatWest warned that parts of the UK market were very difficult, and
said it did not intend to lose its strong market share. In particular, the
group said it might respond to the cut in authorised overdraft lending rates
by Abbey National, the home loans and banking group. Abbey National had the
previous day illustrated the growing competitiveness in the sector by
announcing a joint venture with Commercial Union, the UK's biggest insurer,
to sell general insurance to personal customers.
The most striking example of competitive pressure came when Tesco, Britain's
second biggest food retailer, made a knock-out Pounds 247m bid for William
Low, the Scottish supermarket chain. That was Pounds 93m more than Tesco's
initial offer, made a mere 18 days earlier.
The sharp increase in the bid followed the intervention of J. Sainsbury,
Tesco's bigger rival, which had topped Tesco's first recommended offer of
Pounds 154m with a bid of Pounds 210m. Sainsbury quickly said it would not
bid any higher - apparently content that it had forced Tesco to pay a much
fuller price for Wm Low's 57 stores and Scottish distribution network.
Some questions were asked over how the the board of Wm Low and its merchant
bank advisers, Baring Brothers, could have recommended the original bid as
'full and fair'. It emerged that Tesco had made its bid conditional on a
board recommendation - and the Scottish group had felt pressured by a sudden
deterioration in its trading position over the summer.
Barings said the only way to test whether more could be obtained for
shareholders was by making the offer public, and letting the market decide.
What few would have predicted - in particular Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of
Tesco - was that Sainsbury would abandon its long-standing tradition of not
becoming involved in takeover battles.
Sainsbury emerged well from the tussle, having demonstrated to the City that
it was now prepared to become involved in hostile takeovers, but not to
overpay. At the very least, it had the satisfaction of knowing it prevented
a rival from picking up strategically important assets on the cheap.
More doubt surrounds the value of the victory to Tesco, which was still
confident that the acquisition would enhance future group earnings - in
spite of having increased its original offer by 60 per cent. Sir Ian said
analysts who feared the deal would be dilutive underestimated how much Tesco
could improve the performance of the Wm Low stores.
The Bank's inflation report said the continuing reduction in inflation,
which the chart illustrates, reflected a squeeze in retail margins which has
spread well beyond the food sector. It said: 'Part of the reduction in
margins may stem from a structural change in competition, but a significant
cause is the continuing disinflationary effect of the recent recession.'
The Bank said these disinflationary pressures would be moderated by the
growing recovery in output. Share prices reflect the balance between
investors' optimism over the improvement in corporate performance and
concern about the inflationary outlook - and what that means for interest
rates. As the market moves into the dog days of August, with more people on
holiday and fewer companies reporting, further jitters could lie ahead.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Long View: New life for unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trust companies are having a wonderful year. While rival savings media
such as life assurance or even building societies are finding it hard to
repeat last year's savings inflows the unit trusts are pulling in record
amounts of new money.
For instance, the June figures just published showed net unit trust sales of
a record Pounds 1.1bn and the second quarter pulled in an unprecedented
Pounds 2.8bn even though the stock market was having a slightly rough patch
at the time. At this rate net sales for the year could easily reach Pounds
11bn.
Unit trusts, the British variety of open-ended investment funds - the
Americans know them as mutual funds and the French as Sicavs - have two big
positive factors going for them. First, rival life assurance products are
under a cloud because of regulatory attacks on the sales conduct of many big
companies. And anyway, much tougher disclosure rules for life assurance come
into force next January, when high commissions for intermediaries and
crippling penalties for early lapsing will have to be made more obvious to
investors.
Secondly, tax-free personal equity plans, which have primarily turned into
unit trust vehicles rather than the direct equity investment plans intended
by Nigel Lawson, have become very popular. Peps pulled in Pounds 1.1bn
during the second quarter, nearly 30 per cent of total sales, and peps now
hold unit trusts worth Pounds 10.4bn, about 11 per cent of all unit trusts
in issue. The big advantage for the unit trust companies is that peps are
very stable long-term investments. The money is rarely moved, whereas
ordinary unit trusts are churned quite heavily.
A few weeks ago I attended a private, unit trust conference in Scotland,
sponsored by Chase Manhattan Bank, which many of the leading unit trust
bosses attended. There was a clear sense of a great opportunity to break out
of a straitjacket: in more than 60 years unit trusts have only climbed to
about 3 per cent of personal financial assets. The enticing precedent is
that of the US where mutual fund penetration was also only about 2 or 3 per
cent in the 1970s but is now about 17 per cent.
Mutual funds have just overtaken life insurance companies in the US - but in
the UK life companies are four times bigger than unit trusts. Furthermore
this includes some double counting because many of the units are held in
life and pension funds. Indeed, 4 per cent of the unit trust industry is
being wiped out after this week's decision by Standard Life to wind up, for
tax reasons, its Pounds 4bn UK Larger Companies Trust, which has effectively
been an in-house fund. Only about half the current Pounds 95bn worth of unit
trusts are owned directly by private investors.
The opportunity for growth is indeed there, but some big changes of approach
will be necessary if the British unit trusts are to achieve anything like
the success of mutual funds. For example, unit trusts are excessively high
in risk, being almost entirely focused on equities, and they need to expand
into lower risk income products invested in bonds and money market
instruments.
They must also keep their costs under better control. The performance of the
average unit trust is far from satisfactory, largely because of high
expenses. Although the high costs of life assurance products have become
notorious the fact is that over 10 years a typical unit trust's costs to the
consumer are only fractionally lower than on the average endowment policy,
at 2.7 against 2.9 per cent.
However, unit trusts retain the advantage of greater liquidity: being lump
sum investments they are not subject to early surrender penalties when the
investor wants to sell. Also, they are transparent, whereas life policies
are murky in terms of charges and subject to the erratic whims of actuaries
when it comes to calculating the benefits.
But the likelihood is that unit trusts' costs will go up still further. This
is because of their dependence upon various kinds of intermediaries. In the
US 30 per cent of mutual funds are marketed directly to the public, so that
a lively sector consisting of low commission funds (no load and low load)
has developed. In the UK the direct business is tiny - accounting for only 4
per cent of net sales in June, for instance.
Many of the UK intermediaries generate most of their income selling life
products, which pay higher commissions than most unit trusts. If, because of
so-called 'hard' disclosure, life business is to shrink and unit trust
volumes are to grow the brokers and salesmen will face a net loss of income.
There is therefore an increasing demand from the intermediaries that unit
trust companies should pay an annual 'renewal commission', at  1/2 per cent
of a client's unit holdings. One or two companies already pay this. But the
typical profit margin is not large enough to absorb this cost, so there
would have to be another round of increases in annual management charges.
In fact the unit trust industry's marketing weakness leaves it vulnerable to
an effective takeover by the life industry. Until now the crucial continuing
advantage of the life assurance industry, after the loss of many of its tax
privileges, has been its ability, because of regulatory concessions, to hide
its charges through 'soft' disclosure and its use of aggressive sales
techniques (including cold-calling).
Next year's 'hard' disclosure regime will remove these advantages. So life
companies will increasingly drop endowment contracts and other traditional
life assurance plans and promote alternatives such as peps. The regular
savings pep is already one of the Prudential's biggest-selling products.
From the investor's viewpoint the unfortunate result of all this could be
less value for money. In principle unit trusts are excellent vehicles for
medium to long term investment, but investors need to avoid some of the
highest cost funds.
At least, with unit trusts, they can see clearly what they are buying.

FT  06 AUG 94 / A week in the Louvre: Nicholas Woodsworth doesn't know much
about art so he went to THE museum to learn more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It comes to us all, the sticky moment when we are expected to deliver some
sort of judgment on a piece of art. It is especially sticky when we have not
got the faintest idea what we are looking at.
I have accompanied friends to modernist exhibitions and failed entirely to
understand their appreciation. At moments like these I am one of those
people who finds refuge in that lame line: 'I don't know much about art, but
I know what I like.'
I like Impressionism. Why this is so I am not sure. I tell myself it is
because of a certain use of light, a particular liveliness of brushstroke, a
fidelity to visual experiences, and so on.
I have a sneaking suspicion, though, that I like late 19th century French
painting simply because I have been more exposed to it than other kinds of
painting. We all have. This is accessible art, purveyed to millions around
the world. It is the art of the advertising world and of the postcard from
Paris. Put a Monet, a Renoir or a Degas in front of me and I can look at it
with familiarity.
It was with some trepidation, then, that early one morning not long ago I
found myself in Paris and heading for a museum. Not to the Musee d'Orsay on
the left bank of the Seine, home of a superb collection of Impressionism,
but to the opposite bank, to the museum - the Louvre, which, while failing
to house a single Impressionist painting or any other work created after
1870, is known by name to more people than any other museum in the world.
To me the Louvre was a total mystery - more than 25,000 works of art from
every corner of the world and from every age of man. I had no hopes that the
Louvre would provide any blinding revelations on art. But I did want to try
to understand how people look at art there, and why the Louvre attracts more
than 5m people a year. I had given myself a week to do so.
In the past the Louvre has been a monument to the ornate 19th century
classicism favoured by Napoleon III, the last traditional renovator of this
800-year-old royal complex. Today it shares that classicism with the
elegantly austere modernist architecture of IM Pei, chief designer of
President Francois Mitterrand's 13-year-long, Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m)
Louvre renovation programme. In spite of the dramatic contrast, the marriage
is a happy one.
Pei's spectacular glass pyramid, which now forms the main entrance to the
museum in the Cour Napoleon, is but the tip of the iceberg. Formerly
badly-organised, poorly-lit and ill-equipped to receive masses of people
carried on the wave of today's cultural tourism, the Louvre in its new guise
is generally acclaimed a great success.
But if I had left behind busy Parisian streets and the familiar confusion of
life, I had entered into a much less familiar confusion of art. At the
reception desk below the pyramid, I picked up a museum handbook. The Louvre
has seven major departments: Oriental antiquities; Egyptian antiquities;
Greek, Etruscan and Roman antiquities; objets d'art; sculpture; prints and
drawings; and paintings.
Where to begin? Doubts assailed me. When it came to visiting museums,
Bernard Berenson, pre-eminent art historian of the Renaissance, had some
advice for his friends: never spend more than an hour in one. Any longer, he
said, and the eyelids grow heavy, the legs protest and the spirit begins to
numb.
Of all the schools of art the highly-praised principles and techniques of
which I have failed to understand, this is the one I understood least, so
before my resolve weakened, I made straight for the Grand Galerie and the
great works of the Italian Renaissance masters.
Summer-time visitors thronged the great long hall. In front of groups that
were constantly settling, moving on and reforming, scores of chef-d'oeuvres
stretched away into the distance before me.
I joined the crowds. I peered at Leonardo's The Virgin, the Child and Saint
Anne. I gazed at Raphael's The Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist.
I studied Caravaggio's The Death of the Virgin. There are endless virgins in
15th and 16th century Italian painting, though none of them swept me away.
Nor did most of my fellow visitors seem impressed with the bulk of
religious, classical and mythologically-inspired paintings that dominate
this part of the Louvre. Apart from those few works which are famous for
being famous, few held most people's attention for long. Was it the
paintings' fault, or ours? I began to feel depressed.
I was rescued by a man whose attention has been held in the grand galerie
for a very long time indeed. I met Amal Dagher in front of Reni's Abduction
of Helen, a painting which he has been looking at for hours every day for
more than two months. With brush and palette and easel in tow, Dagher has
been a copiste at the Louvre for 23 years.
'It was like a bolt of lightening,' he told me. 'When I first came to the
Louvre and saw the Italian masters I could not believe what they had done.
Nothing in the world of modern painting compares to their technique.' He
pointed upwards to a foreshortened, sandled foot. 'Look at those toes. Not
even a photo can get over the concept of toes as well. Aren't they
marvellous]'
Such accomplishments became a challenge, Dagher said. 'I had to try what
they had succeeded in doing. Each time I copied a painting I learned
something, and each time I was sure that the next copy would reveal the
master's secrets. I am still copying and learning today.'
When I told Dagher that I enjoyed Impressionism but had problems looking at
the paintings that so absorbed him, he laughed. 'That is no surprise - so
does everyone. Renaissance works are more difficult than Impressionist
works. Technically - but also philosophically - it takes a long time to get
to know them. I have spent half my life here and still don't. Impressionism
captures the passing moment. The classical master's work is more considered,
the result of long reflection on themes without time. We have lost the habit
of thinking and looking this way. We have to learn again. That is why the
Louvre is a valuable place.'
How, I asked him, should one go about looking at such a vast collection as
the Louvre's?
'Follow your instincts,' he said. 'First comes enthusiasm. The rest - the
study, the knowledge - can come later. But try to see things by period. It
is the only way we can situate them.'
My instincts were to get away from the huge numbers of people billowing into
the grand galerie. Just a short stroll down the hall from the mostly
neglected Helen hangs the most famous resident of the Louvre. I took a quick
peek over the heads of the crowd gathered in front of Leonardo's celebrated
work, but made no real effort at contemplation of the Mona Lisa.
It was hopeless. Like artillery barrages on a busy front the cameras
flashed, the video cameras rolled and the poor woman sat bunkered down
behind a screen of tinted, hardened, madman-proof glass.
But I did enjoy talking to Rosa Andrades, one of the Louvre's 650
grey-uniformed museum attendants. They like change as much as we do. Rosa's
favourite post is beside the Mona Lisa, not because she likes looking at the
painting but because she likes looking at the people.
Why, I asked her, do people come to the Louvre?
They come for all sorts of reasons, and behave in all sorts of ways, she
replied. Only a third are French. Many foreigners come simply because the
Louvre is as famous a French tourist fixture as the Eiffel Tower or the
Champs Elysees. There is sometimes, it seems, a confusion between museum and
attraction park. Sundays are Rosa's least favourite day: many parents bring
families through a sense of cultural duty and end up in aimless wandering.
And what of public behaviour, I asked, in a place intended for private
contemplation? The Japanese, she said, are obsessed with visually recording
the whole experience. The Italians are ill-disciplined and good-humoured.
The Americans like to talk. The French can get shirty with everyone.
There was no reason for everybody to approach the Louvre with hushed
reverence, but surely, I suggested, everyone treated it with respect. Not
always, Rosa laughed.
'Teenagers stick bubble gum on noses in portraits. Couples climb on to the
Great Sphinx to be photographed. Statues are a great temptation - we find
cigarettes between their fingers, sun-glasses on their heads, red lipstick
kisses on their cheeks and other places.'
What other places, I asked. Rosa was not saying. But she did tell me what
she thought was the strangest behaviour she had seen in her six years at the
museum: a tourist marching crabwise down the corridors at high speed with a
video camera to his eye, determined to take home an image of every single
item displayed in the museum.
As befits a place presenting the vast spectrum of human creation, the Louvre
is what you make of it. Leave behind the handful of objects that draw the
great crowds - there are only a dozen or so - and you will find people
gliding peacefully about near-empty corridors, absorbed in their own private
worlds.
Nor are all tourists vulgarians. Many take on the Louvre as Amal Dagher
would have them do it: slowly and thoughtfully, following their own
curiosity and preferences. Entering the secret world of art is never easy,
Pierre Rosenburg, the Louvre's curator of paintings, told me when I visited
his office: there are many different ways of getting inside it. As the days
followed and I made my own way about as a tourist, I realised that we all
have different motives and approaches.
In a room full of marble statuary I met an art student from Mexico who was
there to study Greek proportion - she could not find it taught in any
school. In the objets d'art department I chatted to a young French
intellectual couple, members of the Societe des Amis du Louvre, who each
week pursue a different theme. This week it was the life and times of Henry
IV.
In the King Francois I room, I watched an antique specialist, on his knees,
explaining the arcana of 16th-century cabinet making to a group of
connoisseurs. In the caryatid room I watched a class of round-eyed children
ponder the marble-carved breasts and penis of the Sleeping Hermaphrodite.
And I made my own discoveries. I now covet the ceramics and silk carpets in
the Louvre's Islamic art rooms. In the French painting rooms I found I was
enjoying not only precursors of Impressionism, such as Corot, but much
earlier French painters as well - Le Sueur, de la Tour, Chardin. I was
seduced by the clean, sensual lines of Ingres, and came to dislike the
pompous neo-classicism of David.
On and on it went. Dutch still-life, Burgundian medieval sculpture, Persian
palace art, early Italian tryptics, Egyptian sarcophagi. Finally, late one
afternoon, on the fifth day, I sat back in a reclining chair designed for
looking at the ceiling frescoes in the Beauvais room. In a few moments the
angels, doves, trumpeting musicians and naked women flying about high above
began to blur, and then faded altogether.
My eyes had closed. My legs were dead. My spirit was thoroughly numb. I was
terminally struck with Berenson's disease. I was not, I decided, going to
take another step. I had seen a small portion of the Louvre. I had learned
that there was art before Impressionism. But it is quite true - the secret
world of art is hard to enter in an hour, a week, a month. My next visit
would have to wait. The Louvre takes time.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Russia's Gasprom offers stake to western investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gasprom, the world's largest gas company and the 'crown jewel' of corporate
Russia, took the first concrete steps yesterday towards selling a
significant minority of its shares to international investors.
The company, which controls 35 per cent of the world's known natural gas
reserves, appointed Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, as its adviser
for the sale of 9 per cent of its shares.
'This is one of the most prestigious jobs the company has ever done,' said
Mr Philip Lambert, a Kleinwort Benson director. He declined to give details
on the timing, pricing or structure of the deal, although 'substantial
progress' is expected by the end of the year.
The offering is likely to attract the interest of a wide range of western
energy companies, some of whom already have co-operative agreements with the
company. Financial investors are also expected to be attracted to Gasprom,
because it is Russia's largest company and one of the few to be considered
creditworthy by international banks.
However, it could further stir the debate in Russia between reformers, who
argue that foreign investment is crucial if Russian oil and gas companies
are to be competitive on the world market, and conservatives who say that
national assets should not be sold off.
In this struggle Gasprom holds a powerful political trump card in Russian
prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who, as the former head of Gasprom, is
sympathetic to the company's needs.
Gasprom now joins the growing ranks of big Russian companies which have
decided to tap international capital markets, including Lukoil, Russia's
biggest integrated oil company.
The shareholding to be sold is owned by Gasprom itself. In addition, the
Russian government will retain a 40 per cent stake in Gasprom, 15 per cent
of which is owned by its employees. A third of the company was sold in the
spring this year to the public for privatisation vouchers.
Gasprom, which is the largest exporter of gas to western Europe, will need
to invest heavily in coming years if it is to expand its share of the
growing European market for natural gas.
Part of the money raised from the planned share sale is expected to be used
to help fund a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) 4,000km pipeline from the gas
fields in the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia to Germany, via Belarus and Poland.
That task will be complicated by the vast debts owed to Gasprom by much of
Russian industry and former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Vickers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubt that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars needs the sort of supply
agreements being discussed with Mercedes-Benz in order to spread its costs
and risk. The question is whether Vickers' strategy for the business needs a
complete overhaul rather than a bit of tinkering. Because of the specialist
nature of its limited model range, Rolls-Royce's sales are always likely to
be more volatile than those of broader-based manufacturers. This nearly
proved the group's undoing during the recession, when Rolls-Royce careered
into the red.
Since then Rolls-Royce's break even point has been halved to 1,300, which
represents under 40 per cent of its peak sales in 1990. So the chance of the
subsidiary once again threatening the life of the parent has been
dramatically reduced, if not eliminated completely. Rolls-Royce is now back
in profit and, once US sales recover, profits should ramp up rapidly -
analysts estimate that every car sold above the break even point will
generate up to Pounds 50,000 of profit.
Yet this does not mean that Vickers is the best place for Rolls-Royce, which
should be worth more to a larger luxury car group. After all the pain,
Vickers has firmly declared its resolve to retain the business. Given its
recovery prospects, most believe the group would find it hard to accept even
the most generous offer now. But then, that is just what they thought about
British Aerospace and Rover, until BMW drove by.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since turnover in the housing market has been rising this year, it seems
strange that the Halifax Building Society feels the need to expand by buying
up other people's mortgage books. Halifax argues that this is only part of a
strategy designed to keep it ahead in the mortgage market, and it certainly
is a less complicated way of expanding than buying another society. A number
of centralised lenders are leaving the business - in the case of BNP because
of its new management's desire to run down overseas retail activity. So it
makes sense to pick up what is on offer.
Two other points speak in favour of such deals. While base rates are low,
lenders like BNP, who fund themselves with wholesale money are in a strong
position. Once rates start moving up, institutions like Halifax, with a
retail funding base, enjoy a relative advantage. Second, despite increased
housing market activity, mortgage lenders still have to offer incentives on
variable rate lending to attract business. That increases the attraction of
buying ready-made loan portfolios.
The fact that mortgage lenders are choosing to purchase market share in this
way remains a sign of underlying market weakness. Halifax says it can grow
without such deals. The first half slippage in Abbey National's share of the
new mortgage market would have been more embarrassing had it not purchased
the mortgage assets of CIBC. Without a greater flow of genuine new business,
margins on mortgage lending look set to come under further pressure across
the industry.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a week of reflection, the new regulatory deal for the water industry
is still to the liking of shareholders. Water company share prices have
risen by anything up to 6 per cent since immediately before the announcement
on Thursday of last week. Yet initial enthusiasm has been tempered by the
thought that real dividend growth of 4 per cent - which most water companies
should be capable of delivering through to the end of the decade - is not
exceptional judged against the prospects elsewhere. With long-term
regulatory risks to consider as well, a yield premium to the wider equity
market of around 30 per cent looks about right.
But the new regime should sort the leaders from the laggards more
effectively. Five years after privatisation the equity market barely
differentiates. Ignoring South West, which is appealing to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, the yield gap between the highest yielding stock
(Thames) and the lowest (Wessex) is less than one percentage point. Since
companies have had no difficulty so far beating their regulatory targets,
this level performance across the sector is not surprising.
Companies which can beat the tougher targets over the next five years - by
keeping operating expenses and capital spending below budget - are likely to
stand out from the crowd. Interim dividend announcements next autumn, the
first under the new regime, could be the first indication of which companies
are confident of doing more than the regulator has asked. Shareholders will
have to ask seriously for the first time whether such confidence is
justified.

FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Manufactured optimism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After such a good run of economic statistics, the slight fall in UK
manufacturing output in June comes as a bit of a surprise. There is not much
ground for worry, though. In the second quarter manufacturing output still
grew 1.3 per cent, faster than the economy as a whole. Given evidence of
recovery on the continent, there should be increasing impetus from exports
which in turn will limit the damage to the balance of payments from the UK's
domestic recovery. Despite its hint of higher interest rates, the Bank of
England is reasonably sanguine on inflation. The equity market has reason to
look perky - which, after its 85 point rise this week, seems precisely to
reflect its mood.
With economic recovery now well-established, the equity market has less to
worry about from higher base rates in the autumn. Trading statements from
the likes of TI Group and Forte are becoming more optimistic. So earnings
growth should provide some decent momentum. But there are limits, not least
concerning the degree to which equities can decouple from gilts.
Yields on 10-year gilts rose slightly over the past week. That is
understandable since, however good the apparent news on inflation, it is
hard to see why yields should fall when the economy is so strong. An
equity/gilt yield ratio of 2.3 times looks reasonably comfortable, but
equities now yield less than index-linked gilts. Growing expectations of
real dividend growth are some compensation, but that relationship is
nevertheless a constraint.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Deep burial 'best way' to rid Britain of N-waste: Extend
cooldown period for old stations, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep burial remains the government's preferred way of disposing of the
radioactive waste generated by Britain's nuclear power stations and research
installations.
In a consultation document on radioactive waste management policy released
yesterday, the Department of the Environment said this provided the safest,
and most economical, permanent solution to the more dangerous forms of
waste, such as spent fuel rods and contaminated equipment.
It also said that the period over which retired power stations are allowed
to cool down before final dismantling could be extended from 100 to 135
years, in some cases.
The document was welcomed by the nuclear power industry because it stressed
both commercial and safety factors at a time when the two state-owned
nuclear power generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, are hoping
to be privatised. Mr Roger Hayes, director-general of the British Nuclear
Industry Forum, the trade group, said it showed the industry was on the
right track.
But it was quickly condemned by opposition parties and the environmental
movement for putting financial factors above environment and safety. Mr
Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said the government
was 'trying to cut down the cost in order to get shot of the problem'.
The 100-page document forms part of the government's review of nuclear
policy. Although much of it reaffirms existing policies, the results will
have a key bearing on whether Britain builds any more nuclear power stations
as ageing reactors are shut down.
The government's preferred method of dealing with high level nuclear waste
from Britain's 30 nuclear sites is to use a process called 'vitrification'
to transform it into a kind of glass. It will then be left for 50 years to
cool before being consigned to a permanent deep store several thousand feet
underground. But the paper also says that nuclear operators can leave the
spent fuel to cool in a dry store, if it makes more commercial sense.
The main shift in policy hinted at in the document is allowing nuclear
operators to decommission spent power stations over a longer period. Both
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear have been pressing for this. Stations
could be left to cool down for 35 years after closure, and then left for
another 100 years before final removal, rather than doing the whole job in
100 years.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Halifax in talks to buy BNP's Pounds 1.5bn UK mortgage
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society is negotiating to buy the UK mortgage business of
Banque Nationale de Paris, which has outstanding mortgages of Pounds 1.5bn.
The move would give Halifax, already Britain's largest mortgage lender, a
further 0.5 per cent of the total UK mortgage market, lifting its share to
16 per cent.
The two organisations, which announced the move yesterday, expect the deal
to be concluded by the end of this year.
BNP Mortgages will become part of Halifax Home Loans, the society's
subsidiary which already administers some Pounds 1.1bn of mortgages acquired
from other lenders. The company, which has 150 staff and 22,000 customers,
is being bought as a going concern.
In contrast to the position that often applies when a large high street
lender buys mortgages from a centralised lender - which sells through
intermediaries rather than a branch network - BNP's customers on the
standard variable rate are paying less than those of Halifax. BNP's rate is
7.59 per cent, while Halifax's is 7.64 per cent.
Halifax has set itself the aim of significantly increasing its share of
mortgage lending. Its share of net UK mortgage lending carried out in 1993
was 18.77 per cent, while Abbey National, the home loans and banking group,
was just behind with 18.74 per cent.
Mr Robert Amzallag, managing director of BNP's UK operations, said the
mortgages were almost exclusively residential and almost all were on
variable rather than fixed rates.
BNP Mortgages was bought by its parent company from Chemical Bank of the US
in 1988. Mr Amzallag said BNP bought the company on the basis that large
European banks should look to operate across Europe in retail banking in the
post-1992 single European market.
However, since its privatisation last year, BNP has focused in markets
outside France on wholesale banking, corporate lending and private banking.
Mr Michel Pebereau, BNP chairman, has said BNP is looking to forge
commercial links with other European banks to expand its retail banking.
BNP is not the only French bank leaving the UK mortgage market. Birmingham
Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, expects to acquire Credit
Agricole's Pounds 600m UK residential mortgage book this month.

FT  06 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks retreat after jobs
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday in the face of a July employment report which
increased the likelihood of higher interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
However, the reaction was mild in view of a sharp decline the data triggered
in the bond market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 18.77 lower at 3,747.02, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 was down 1.31 at 457.09. Activity
was light, with volume on the Big Board reaching only 230m shares. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 1.01 at 440.34, and the
Nasdaq composite slipped 1.52 to 718.66.
The negative tone was set before the market opened. At 8.30am, the Labor
Department announced that non-farm payrolls had increased by 259,000 jobs
last month, well ahead of the consensus forecast. Investors had keenly
awaited the data, looking for convincing evidence that would allow the
Federal Reserve to delay its next move to tighter credit conditions.
Instead the data suggested that a rate increase could come at any time. As a
consequence, the blue chips extended a decline which had begun in the
closing minutes of the previous session, when investors had sensed the bad
news to come.
However, the downturn paled when compared with the rout in bonds. Late in
the day the benchmark 30-year government security was down nearly a point
and a half amid an onslaught of selling pressure.
The hardest hit issue among the Dow industrials was Cater pillar, a stock
that prospered early in the economic recovery. With the cycle apparently
taking another turn its share price dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 104 3/4
after an order imbalance briefly halted trading in the issue. But the
stoppage coincided with the approval by shareholders of a two-for-one stock
split, suggesting that the decline was not simply a response to the
fundamentals.
However, Cummins Engine, another company whose performance is closely tied
to the economy, dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 , a 52-week low.
The recent spate of mergers and acquisitions showed no sign of abating. News
of two deals struck by Nextel, a New Jersey telecommunications concern,
added a touch of spice to a surprisingly bland session. The stock rose
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 3/4 after Nextel announced a tax-free merger
with Dial Page and agreed to buy certain wireless communications businesses
from Motorola. Dial Page was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 5/8 and Motorola
added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 52 5/8 .
Earnings news continued to straggle into Wall Street. Scientific-Atlanta, a
cable television equipment supplier, jumped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 39
after surprising Wall Street with net income of 53 cents a share, 10 cents
better than expected.
On the Nasdaq, Ben&amp;Jerry's share price dropped Dollars 1 5/8 or 10.8 per
cent to Dollars 13 3/8 after the Vermont ice cream company posted
second-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share, about a third of the level
forecast by analysts.

FT  06 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: German analysts offer high hopes for
1994 - Earnings prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's call for a 'sensible' discussion of profit prospects from German
engineering industry leaders was aimed at two distinctly different
audiences. One comprised investors whose expectations of gains are being
fuelled by increasingly optimistic analysts.
The other consisted of their own employees - due back soon from the
Mediterranean shores - whose expectations of fatter pay packets have been
encouraged by trade union leaders preparing for the 1995 pay round and
calling for a 'fairer' distribution of rising profits.
Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers association, reminded anyone
prepared to listen that the industry lost DM7bn last year, the worst 12
months in its history, and that convalescence was likely to be a long
process.
But market professionals appear undeterred, and have upgraded industrial
stocks on a wide front. One reason is that concerns about interest rates and
the US currency's condition have receded more into the background - at least
while the Bundesbank is still on summer leave. Meanwhile, as a series of
indicators has shown the economy picking up momentum far more quickly than
expected, they believe they have discovered further, previously-hidden
profit potential locked up in the likes of Daimler-Benz, chemicals and even
in the battered steel sector.
In the past week strong incoming orders figures, with a healthy contribution
from domestic demand for plant and machinery topping up robust export
bookings, have embellished the picture further.
Schroder, Munchmeyer Hengst, the private bank, claims to have uncovered
potential earnings rises this year of around 80 per cent for the 30
constituent companies in the Frankfurt Dax index, with another 30-odd per
cent to come in 1995. Taking a wider sample of 170 quoted companies,
Commerzbank's analysts forecast average earnings growth of 25 per cent both
this year and next.
Meanwhile, the accelerating flow of interim results has provided a steady
supply of optimistic commentaries from the companies themselves, confirming
turnarounds and improvements in most sectors.
Opinion on the big banks remained divided as the mid-year reporting season
progressed. Deutsche - banker to the Mittelstand - produced
better-than-expected results. But Commerzbank disappointed when it turned
out that unspecified losses on own-account trading in June had severely
deflated earnings. Only weeks before Commerzbank reported its chairman, Mr
Martin Kohlhaussen, had been making extravagant informal claims for the
first five months.
Bayerische Vereinsbank also suffered a fat loss on its own account, much to
the satisfaction of its local rival, Bayerische Hypo, which at least managed
to show a black figure in spite of an 83 per cent slump in this department.
Although the Frankfurt stock exchange is still trapped in the summer lull,
the past week has demonstrated how ready traders are to lock on to the new
mood in the economy.
The arch-cyclical chemicals stocks, already performing relatively well on
the strength of early recovery indicators, were bolstered first by
impressive interim figures from foreign competitors. A further boost was
provided by a better-than-expected first-half report from the VCI industry
association which showed aggregate sales and volume up 4 per cent. While
average chemicals prices were still marginally down on the first half of
1993, brokers liked the report that the industry workforce had been reduced
sharply and that further cuts were on the way.
A similar combination of continued restructuring and strong sales of
Mercedes-Benz cars, recently reported by chairman Mr Helmut Werner, helped
to prompt a flurry of 'buy' recommendations for its parent, Daimler-Benz,
and sharpened interest in the whole vehicles sector.
Events in the automotive industry, which was worst hit by the recession, are
typical of the underlying attractions investors see in other sectors.
Statements and actions confirm that management is determined to press on
with the rationalisation deemed necessary to restore lasting
competitiveness.
The latest moves at Mercedes are certain to lead to sharp cuts in the
workforce and significant economies of scale. Capacity at BMW, meanwhile,
has been straining to meet demand this year so far. But the company insists
that higher productivity rather than new capacity is the way to ease the
pressure.
Then there is the 'personality effect'. The recent confirmation of Mr Jurgen
Schrempp - a hard man from Deutsche Aerospace - as successor to Daimler's
chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, has reinforced expectations of continued
restructuring at Germany's biggest industrial group.
At Hoechst, after only a few months as chairman, Mr Jurgen Dormann has
administered a stern shaking to the chemicals giant's dozy bureaucracy. And
although BMW was not in need of any morale-boosting, the group's new head,
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, has already put his stamp on the company. Buying
Rover was one coup: another was his successful handling of the backlash from
the British group's disappointed partner, Honda.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in bond prices to a 14-month high prompted worries over fund
allocation by institutional investors, and share prices lost ground as
dealers adjusted their positions and individuals took profits, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 fell 155.14 to 20,521.70 after a high of 20,680.94 and a low
of 20,467.49.
Domestic institutions had buying orders just below the 20,500 level,
preventing a sharp slide in prices, but traders also noted sell orders
around 20,700.
Volume totalled 269m shares, against 270m. Arbitrage buying and purchases by
overseas investors supported low-priced issues, but share prices declined on
small lot selling by dealers.
Traders were also worried that the rise in the yield on the 10-year
benchmark bond above 4.6 per cent would attract some institutional investors
from the equity market.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.78 to 1,649.74, while the
Nikkei 300 sank 1.30 to 299.44. Losers led gainers by 659 to 317 with 193
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.04 to 1,336.87.
Profit-taking depressed electrical stocks and Hitachi fell Y20 to Y1,000;
but overseas investors bought steel companies and Nippon Steel, the most
active issue of the day, rose Y2 to Y363. NKK advanced Y5 to Y279.
Ricoh, the office automation equipment maker, jumped Y26 to Y960. Investors
were encouraged by the Yamaichi Research Institute's first ever top rating
of 1 for the company, which has been cutting costs through restructuring
measures.
DDI, the telecommunications company, saw active demand following its
ten-for-one stock split. The issue rose an effective Y62,000 to Y991,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 88.59 to 22,922.67 in volume of 72.2m shares.
Roundup
Fears of a further rise in US interest rates weighed on a number of the
region's markets.
HONG KONG fell back as investors took profits on a number of blue-chip
stocks following renewed fears of a rise in US interest rates.
The Hang Seng index lost 40.64 to 9,602.21, but up from an intraday low of
9,562.41. The market rose 1.3 per cent last week.
Brokers said that local and foreign investors engaged in selective selling
to hedge positions ahead of the weekend and Friday's US jobs data.
SHANGHAI's domestic market saw another substantial rise with the A index
rising 22 per cent to 700.58. Its gain on the week was 108 per cent.
By contrast the B index added 2.5 per cent to 74.40.
Turnover was Yn10.49bn.
SINGAPORE rose slightly on expectations of good second quarter economic
growth data due to be announced next week.
The Straits Times Industrials index rose 1.95 to 2,273.12, a 3 per cent
improvement on the week.
Turnover rose to SDollars 531.6m from SDollars 487.2m.
TAIPEI rose 1.9 per cent on the day on strong buying in the electronic and
plastic sectors.
The weighted index put on 129.64 to 6,919.21, 2.5 per cent on the week.
Turnover soared to TDollars 123.2bn from Thursday's TDollars 85.3bn.
SEOUL rose as investors renewed their interest in selective blue chips,
shares with low price/earnings ratios and some banking issues.
The composite stock index added 8.33 to 935.82, off a day's high of 943.48,
and up 0.2 per cent on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR improved as speculative stocks soared in the afternoon, led by
Idris Hydraulic which added 45 cents to MDollars 5.55.
Analysts said that optimism was fuelled by hopes for an announcement of an
early general election.
The composite index added 2.35 to 1,089.15, for a 6 per cent advance on the
week.
SYDNEY saw bargain hunting of blue chips push the market to a higher close
in spite of a sharp fall on Wall Street overnight. BHP climbed 10 cents to a
record close of ADollars 19.60: it is expected to rise further next week
amid buying enthusiasm related to the expansion of key projects.
The All Ordinaries index finished 8.4 stronger at 2,091.9, up 1.5 per cent
on the week.

After a reaction earlier in the afternoon to the US jobless figures and the
decline in the Dow, late-closing bourses seemed disinclined to follow Wall
Street down, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH focused on the half-year report from UBS and the SMI index, steady
for much of the day, gave up 14.5 to 2,600.8 as prices were marked down in
the last hour of trading in response to a drop in US Treasuries. The index
was little changed over the week.
UBS gave up SFr34 or 2.9 per cent to SFr1,150. Its 28 per cent fall in net
profits was within analysts' expectations after last year's exceptional
performance. However, a 68 per cent drop in trading profits came as a
surprise and, said one analyst, outweighed some very positive indications
for the second half of the year.
Baer Holding, which presented its own first half figures after the market
closed on Wednesday, fell another SFr20 to SFr1,275, taking the two-day
decline to 4.9 per cent.
Roche certificates pushed SFr75 higher to SFr5,600 on speculation that US
investment houses which had downgraded their recommendations on the stock in
recent months might be about to reconsider.
PARIS closed the week in subdued form with the CAC-40 index rising 10.62 to
2,107.07, up 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was FFr3.4bn.
Bouygues, the construction group, rose FFr26 to FFr660 following a broker's
upgrade. The group's shares remained well below the year's high of FFr752
seen at the start of the year, but interest has been renewed recently
following its award of a number of construction projects.
Carrefour, the country's biggest supermarket group, was helped by a 5 per
cent rise in July sales, the shares gaining FFr29 to FFr2,082.
AMSTERDAM was slightly weaker in a day dominated by economic news, as well
as confident expectations of next week's batch of results.
The AEX index slipped 0.12 to 419.67, 2.8 per cent higher on the week.
Investors were encouraged by better than expected July inflation data, a CPI
rise of 2.7 per cent comparing with analysts' forecasts of between 2.9 to
3.0 per cent.
Among groups reporting next week, PolyGram rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 82.60 and
Unilever Fl 1.10 to Fl 196.00. Those which had already reported were mixed:
DSM lost Fl 2.90 to Fl 140.00, but Akzo Nobel put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 219.70.
Hoogovens, the metals group which delivers second quarter figures next week,
was also a favourite, rising Fl 1.30 to Fl 78.20.
MILAN was lower on modest foreign selling. The Comit index fell 3.94 to
703.96, in very thin trading, down 0.8 per cent over the week.
BCI dropped L119 or 2.5 per cent to L4,643 after Creditanstalt, the Austrian
bank which holds a 1.7 per cent stake, confirmed that it would not subscribe
to BCI's capital increase on August 18.
Snia, Fiat's chemicals and synthetic fibres subsidiary, lost L34 to L2,428
in spite of a forecast from the chairman of much improved 1994 results after
first half revenues rose by 19 per cent.
MADRID closed higher on continued strength in construction shares. FCC
gained Pta640 or 4.9 per cent to Pta14,900, Dragados Pta70 to Pta2,280 and
Uralita Pta35 to Pta1,570 as the general index finished 1.97 higher at
322.00, 2.6 per cent better on the week.
Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel London said that the construction
sector could rise further on the growth of housing starts and cement sales.
'Uralita is particularly recommendable, as they have been underrated in
recent months,' said Mr Cooper. 'I believe that they will reach Pta1,750 to
Pta1,800 in the short term.' FASA Renault gained Pta20 to Pta755, still
reflecting the government's decision to continue subsiding new car sales.
STOCKHOLM, closing at a time when bourses were most sensitive to the US
jobless figures, saw the Affarsvarlden General index close 11.8 lower at
1,485.4, 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Astra B consolidated overnight
losses in the London market after Germany's suspension of the intravenous
use of its Losec anti-ulcer drug, falling SKr4 to SKr169.

FT  06 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca gains extended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca gained 16 1/2 to 811 1/2 p in response to
Thursday's interim figures and continuing bid speculation. However, profit
takers moved into the other sector bid target, Wellcome, and the shares fell
7 1/2 to 678p.
Glaxo was dragged down as US investors sold the stock on enduring fears over
the future performance of Zantac although a more positive stance from
Goldman Sachs saw the shares rally from the lows to close 3 off at 600p. And
after the UK market closed a sizeable US order suggested to some traders
that the New York mood might be softening.
Positive comment following the interim results prompted Kleinwort Benson
shares to improve 25 to 522p. However NatWest Securities argued that the
merchant bank would have difficulty repeating the interim performance in the
second half of the year and recommended a switch into SG Warburg, which rose
20 to 783p. In general, the enthusiasm spilled over into the sector and
rival Schroders jumped 45 to 1313p.
Electricity generators performed strongly in the wake of PowerGen's recent
share buy back. PowerGen improved 14 to 566p while National Power and
Scottish rose 12 to 474p and 10 to 390p respectively.
Newspaper groups were under pressure as NatWest Securities presented a
negative attitude.
The house said: 'Whether or not the Daily Express, Daily Mail or Mirror cut
cover prices, they will continue to suffer significant costs which will
impact their earnings growth prospects, balance sheet valuations and ability
to drive cross-media strategic moves.' Daily Mail Group Trust fell 12 to
1023p in the A's, Mirror Group slipped 8 to 128p and United Newspapers shed
9 to 529p.
There was general profit-taking in two of the engineering companies that
reported good interim figures this week.
TI Group closed 12 down at 400p with additional selling attributed to
'reduce' advice from NatWest Securities. Glynwed International relinquished
9 to 381p. Its two brokers, SG Warburg and Albert E. Sharp, are now
predicting full year figures of Pounds 64m and Pounds 66m respectively.
Bid-speculation returned to manufacturer Hazlewood Foods, lifting the shares
9 to 145p. Once again the market talk centred on Unigate as the likely
aggressor. There was a suggestion that Unigate would finance such a bid
through the sale of its 34 per cent stake in Dutch food company Nutricia.
However, an analyst dismissing the rumour said: 'This has been around before
and I very much doubt it is going to happen now.' There was also talk of
board changes at Hazlewood. Shares in Unigate jumped 15 to 380p.
Unilever and Perkins Foods continued to benefit from a recommendation by
Strauss Turnbull made earlier this week. The former finished 18 up at 1067p,
while the latter added 9 to 75p.
Nervous trading ahead of first quarter figures, combined with light
profit-taking, left airline British Airways a penny easier at 429p. The
range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 85m and Pounds 95m for the
quarter.
A squeeze in airports group BAA sent the shares climbing 12 to 972p. A
one-for-one share split agreed at the company's annual meeting last month is
to take place on Monday.
The strong rise in Tomkins continued as Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy
recommendation. The shares gained 6 to 240p, as 9.1m shares were dealt,
making it the day's most heavily traded stock.
Goldman's move followed a favourable company presentation at the investment
bank on Thursday evening. Mr Gavin Launder at Goldman said the stock did not
deserve its discount rating given the current growth in the old Tomkins
business and recovery prospects for RHM (its foods subsidiary).
A confident annual meeting and a buy recommendation from Robert Fleming
boosted Chubb Security. The shares hardened 4 to 334p.
Services group Inchcape gained 15 to 491p, in trade of 5.3m, after Robert
Fleming reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker cited the fall in the
value of the yen as the main reason why the shares were a good buy. Inchcape
is a big trader of Japanese cars.
A bearish note from investment house Credit Lyonnais sent chemicals Group
BOC down 11 to 754p ahead of next week's third quarter figures. Mr Colin
Isaac, analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said that 'cyclical recovery would not be
as strong as on previous occasions' and BOC had outperformed the market.
Hewetson climbed 14 to 82p. Mr Scott Faulton, analyst at Smith New Court,
suggested that the building materials sector was performing well due to good
market sentiment. Positive notes from NatWest Securities pushed BPB, the
building products group, and RMC, 12 to 347p and 14 to 1008p respectively.
Paper and packaging group Bowater gained 9 to 470p on speculation that
Hanson might be interested in buying the company. Volume in the US traded
American Depositary Receipts on Thursday night had been significantly higher
than normal daily turnover. Hanson fell 1 1/2 to 262 1/2 p.

FT  06 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Further demand for Recs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity company (Recs) shares hit all-time relative highs
against the broader market as dealers scrambled for stock ahead of the
pricing review on Thursday.
Analysts have been taking an increasingly optimistic view on how much the
Electricity Regulator (Offer) will order the Recs to cut distribution costs,
which make up about a quarter of electricity bills. From a staggering 30 per
cent in May the general belief now is that Offer will order a 15 per cent
one-off cut followed by price caps of 2 to 3 per cent below inflation for
the next five years.
The review could reduce household bills by 4 per cent and is being carried
out to redress the generosity of the terms at privatisation.
City optimism has been fuelled partly by the recent lenient attitude of the
water regulator and analysts believe that if their predictions are correct
the Recs will be able to generate real dividend growth of 5 to 6 per cent a
year.
However, a wide range of cuts is forecast with Eastern Electricity and
Southern, up 4 at 692p and 671p respectively, seen as benefiting from the
greatest leniency. London (off 6 at 615p) and East Midlands (off a penny at
667p) could be hit the hardest.

FT  06 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close in spite of uncertainty in
US markets - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market scored a further advance yesterday in spite of some
uncertainty with weakness in New York currency and securities markets
following unexpectedly strong US payroll figures for last month. Share price
trends remained erratic, reflecting uncertain prospects for domestic
interest rates but the stock market was encouraged by official actions in
the London money markets.
The FT-SE 100 Index challenged 3,140 in early trading, largely under the
influence of stock index futures, but quickly rebounded to record a 12-point
gain. The market then sold off again as US bonds and equities opened sharply
off on the news of growth in US July payroll numbers, described as
'unusually strong' by a US Labor Department official, had brought back fears
that the Federal Reserve might decide to tighten credit policy.
But with British government bonds standing up well to US credit fears the
stock market rallied. At the close of business, the FT-SE 100 Index was 17
points up on overnight at 3,167.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was in good form
again, adding 14.7 to 3,714.9.
Yesterday brought a firm close to a highly successful week for the UK equity
market which has recorded a gain of around 2.8 per cent on leading market
indices. Equities have been encouraged by perceptions that domestic base
rates are unlikely to rise for at least a month, in contrast with fears at
the end of last week that Bank of England actions in the money markets had
pointed the way to immediate action on interest rates.
Trading volume slackened a little yesterday, with 579.8m shares traded
through the Seaq electronic system, compared with 670.6m on Thursday.
Retail, or genuine customer business, in UK equities has remained high this
week.
Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.4bn, and the average of Pounds
1.38bn for the past five sessions was comfortably within the range of
profitable business levels from the viewpoint of the London-based securities
industry.
These relatively good levels of retail trading volume support a generously
optimistic view of market prospects among UK analysts. Although the big
investment funds have tended to stay on the sidelines this week, it has been
clear that share prices have found support whenever significant levels on
the equity charts were challenged.
At the close of yesterday's trading session, the UK government bond market
was narrowly mixed but this compared well with the weakness in US bonds.
Concern that US interest rates may rise soon was tempered by the signs that
British, and other European bond markets, may have disengaged from the US
fixed interest sector. However, some nervousness is expected this week as
further US data is disclosed.
Short-dated UK bonds, the most closely linked to base rate prospects, were a
shade easier at the close while the longer dates, more closely reflecting
future inflation concerns, had gained around  1/4 point.
The stock market was again helped by growing convictions that the
pharmaceuticals sector may be the arena for a multi-national takeover move.
Speculation has been stimulated by the Dollars 8.5bn bid in the US for
American Cynamid which has raised asset sights across the global
pharmaceuticals industry.
The market closed on an optimistic note as the focus continued to turn away
from interest rate prospects and towards the benefits of the steady rise in
UK corporate earnings and dividends. Some London-based securities houses
have raised their year-end forecasts for the UK market over the past
fortnight and optimism has remained bright this week as a clutch of large
British companies have reported trading progress for the first half of the
year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar firmed slightly yesterday on foreign exchanges despite US bonds
reacting negatively to the release of employment figures, writes Philip
Gawith.
The July non-farm payroll rose by 259,000, above market expectations. The
dollar initially firmed on the news, but later came off as bond prices fell.
It finished in London at DM1.5822 from DM1.581 on Thursday. Against the yen
it closed at Y100.485 from Y100.2.
In the UK, it was business as usual with the weekly treasury bill auction a
comparative non-event after last week's excitement. The highest rate
accepted at the 91 day T-bill tender was 5.3747 per cent, down from 5.7558
per cent.
There was little movement in Europe with markets exuding a perfunctory,
mid-summer feel. The lira maintained its firmer showing, without showing
much sign of strengthening, to close at L997.5 from L997.9 against the
D-Mark.
The dollar's performance - up on the expectation of higher rates, down when
the bond market reacts negatively to the same prospect - was in keeping with
its recent range-bound performance, between DM1.57 and DM1.60.
As far as the dollar's strength against the D-Mark is concerned, the
market's main concern is when and by how much the Fed will tighten monetary
policy. The latest figures lend support to those who favour the
policy-making FOMC moving at its next meeting on August 16.
This view already had support from comments made on Thursday by Mr Robert
Parry of the San Francisco Fed.
In a generally hawkish speech, he said that monetary policy decisions could
not be put off until inflation has appeared, while there were also signs of
labour market tightness.
The outcome of the UK T-bill tender was not much of a surprise since
interbank money market rates had already come off during the week, as
expectations of a near term tightening from the Bank of England disappeared.
Sterling three month LIBOR traded at 5 5/8 per cent, up from 5 1/2 per cent
on Thursday, but well below the 6 per cent level of a week earlier.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'We
have now gone back to the treasury bill 'so-what' market. The Bank has made
it very clear that the Treasury bill mechanism is unlikely to be used as a
mechanism for interest rate changes.'
'When the time for a change does come, it is likely to be through its normal
daily operations.'
Sentiment, however, continues to be very nervous, especially in the futures
market. The September short sterling contract expires soon after the next
monthly monetary meeting.
The futures market continues to discount a tightening of more than 50 basis
points before the September contract closes on September 21. The contract
closed at 94.11, down from 94.13. Volumes were reasonable, with the December
contract trading 28,640 lots.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
late assistance of Pounds 280m. Earlier it had provided Pounds 182m
assistance compared to revised forecast of Pounds 900m. Overnight rates
ranged from 4 3/4 per cent to 7 per cent.

is available on the spot in Europe. It became increasingly difficult to
obtain suitable material from origin as the supply position there also
seemed to be getting much tighter. Spot white pepper traded at USDollars

FT  06 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee selling put on ice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London coffee futures were yesterday able to hold on to most of this week's
gains mainly because of the reluctance of sellers, rather than the
enthusiasm of buyers.
The November at the London Commodity Exchange closed at Dollars 3,550 a
tonne, down Dollars 66 on the day but still Dollars 197 up on the week, as
the possibility of further frost damage to the Brazilian crop caused most
speculators to put selling plans on ice, until next week at least.
The return of cold weather to Brazilian coffee areas pushed prices up
sharply early in the week and news of another frost took the November price
up to Dollars 3,675 on Thursday morning. It quickly became apparent,
however, that the frost was only a light one and that it had touched only a
limited coffee-growing area. Nevertheless, with the cold weather persisting
speculators were not about to leave themselves short over the weekend.
In its latest Monthly Bulletin London trade house ED &amp; F. Man said that
coffee roasters were 'extremely suspicious of a market that has been fuelled
so much by expectations of continuing supply problems'.
The big test would come in October, it said, when producing countries
started marketing the 1994-95 winter crops and buying began for the peak
roasting season. With the sizes of crops and the extent of Brazilian frost
damage being clearer by then roasters would have to decide whether their
'hand to mouth' buying strategy was still appropriate or whether they should
extend physical cover.
LCE cocoa prices were under pressure for most of the week from technical
factors. The December futures position closed yesterday at Pounds 1,066 a
tonne, down Pounds 69 overall.
At the London bullion market gold yesterday ended a six-day sequence of
falls that had tested support at the bottom of its recent trading range. The
price closed at Dollars 378.50 a troy ounce, up 30 cents on the day but
Dollars 5.40 down on the week. The fall was probably a reflection of the
normal northern hemisphere summer lull in demand, suggested Mr George
Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Platinum meanwhile continued its retreat from recent long-time highs,
'fixing' yesterday afternoon at Dollars 409.85, up Dollars 5.60 on the day
but Dollars 9.65 down on the week. Silver was also weak, ending 12.25 cents
down at Dollars 5.16 1/4 a tonne.
It was a similar story at the London Metal Exchange, where copper led a
general price decline.
Three months metal closed yesterday at Dollars 2,403.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 39 overall, having dipped to Dollars 2,362 on Tuesday. The price had
tested the area below Dollars 2,400 again yesterday morning, on news of
another rise in LME warehouse stocks. Traders told the Reuters news agency
that copper continued to be influenced by speculative interest at both ends
of the market, amid a lack of consumer demand during the summer slowdown in
industrial activity.
For aluminium the continuing drawdown from LME stocks could not prevent an
extension of the retreat from last week's 3 1/2 -year highs. But an early
fall yesterday below Dollars 1,440 a tonne for three months delivery
attracted buyers and the price closed at Dollars 1,448.75, down Dollars
29.75 on the week.
Although its fundamental outlook remained positive the LME three months lead
price this week abandoned its struggle to stay above Dollars 600 a tonne,
ending at Dollars 596.50 a tonne.

FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: First-half income dives 28% at
UBS - Weak financial markets take their toll of Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland has reported a 28 per cent slump in first-half
consolidated net income to SFr929m (Dollars 703.7m) mainly because of a
two-thirds crash in profits from trading.
The bank described the result as 'satisfactory despite the unfavourable
market environment'. It remained optimistic for the full year, expecting
financial markets to recover and economies in many industrialised countries
to strengthen. It would not forecast whether its 1994 net profit would be
higher or lower than last year's SFr2.27bn.
The UBS results are broadly similar to those reported by Credit Suisse a
week ago. The third of the big Swiss banks, Swiss Bank Corporation, is due
to report its first-half results on August 16, and they too are expected to
be well down from last year's high levels.
UBS's operating profit before taxes and provisions fell 28.6 per cent to
SFr1.97bn in the first half, mainly because trading income plunged from
SFr1.5bn to SFr493m.
UBS said the surprising rise in interest rates depressed customer demand for
derivative instruments. Income from foreign exchange, banknote and precious
metal trading also fell short of expectations.
Meanwhile, net interest income was down 6.9 per cent to SFr1.78bn, as the
rise in interest rates contracted margins. Commission income was up 10.8 per
cent to SFr2.14bn.
Operating expenses fell by 2.8 per cent to SFr2.64bn, as profit-related
compensation pushed down personnel expenses by 4.4 per cent to SFr1.85bn.
The drastic SFr1.05bn fall in trading profit raises the question of whether
a triple A rated bank like UBS should be so dependent on this volatile
activity.
The bank's spokeswoman said the group believed its profit sources were 'well
balanced' and that the volatility of trading profits was normally within
reasonable limits. Income from trading was extraordinarily high in the first
half of last year, she observed.
At the operating level, the UBS performance is similar to the 27 per cent
profit fall announced by Credit Suisse a week ago. But UBS has apparently
not benefited as much as its rival from the drop in provisioning needs this
year.
Credit Suisse, the flagship bank in the CS Holding financial services group,
did not give precise figures for provisions, but indicated that they had
almost totally offset the fall in first-half operating income. Net income,
it said, was 'only slightly down'. UBS reported a 26.4 per cent drop in
provisions to SFr790m, but that did not prevent net income from falling 28
per cent.
The reason is that Credit Suisse's provisions in the whole of 1993 were much
larger than those of UBS, both in absolute terms and in relation to net
income.
UBS's total consolidated assets at June 30 were SFr337.4bn, 8.4 per cent
higher than at the end of last year. Shareholders' equity advanced 0.6 per
cent over the same period to SFr21.8bn.

FT  06 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE may ease listings
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock exchange, facing a sharp decline in listings of overseas
companies, is considering measures to revive trading on its stagnant foreign
section.
Exchange officials are planning to ease the TSE's asset guidelines which
limit listings of overseas corporations on its foreign section to large blue
chip companies. They hope to increase listings of more south-east Asian and
Chinese companies, with growth potential, which are looking for funding
options in overseas capital markets.
The exchange plans to scrap the Y100bn net asset requirement for companies
wishing to list, and the guideline where companies must report annual
profits of at least Y20bn during the three years before the listing.
The move comes as TSE has seen an exodus of US and European companies over
the past few years due to the rise in costs stemming from the yen's
appreciation and the sharp fall in trading volumes of foreign stocks.
The number of companies listed on the TSE's foreign section has fallen to 97
from 125 in the peak in 1991.
Companies including Eastman Kodak and Chase Manhattan are among those which
have delisted, shunning the costs of Y20m to Y30m a year to maintain its
status on the TSE.

FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: QVC accepts Dollars 1.4bn
Comcast/Liberty bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation about the immediate future of Mr Barry Diller, the US
entertainment industry executive, intensified yesterday after the board of
QVC Network, the cable television home-shopping group Mr Diller has run for
the past two years, accepted a Dollars 1.4bn takeover offer from its two
largest shareholders.
The two shareholders, the cable television groups Comcast Communications and
Liberty Media, offered Dollars 46 a share for the 65 per cent of QVC they
did not already own. That was Dollars 2 more than originally put on the
table when they first bid for QVC three weeks ago. After a long meeting, the
QVC board accepted the all-cash offer late on Thursday night.
Although Mr Diller eventually supported the decision to accept the takeover,
he is expected to step down as chairman of QVC. When he joined the company
in 1992, he planned to use the fledgling cable company as a launch-pad for
expanding into the entertainment and multi-media business. But his first two
attempts at expansion - an offer to buy the entertainment group Paramount
Communications, and a bid to merge with the CBS television network - both
ended in failure.
Now that QVC is being taken over by Comcast and Liberty Media, Mr Diller is
likely to move elsewhere to pursue his ambition of building an entertainment
powerhouse.
Recent speculation on Wall Street has suggested that he might make another
attempt to gain control of CBS, but this time with the financial backing of
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable TV operator whose chairman, Mr
Jack Malone, is keen to break into the broadcast television business.

FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nextel in Dollars 1.68bn
Motorola assets deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nextel Communications has advanced its bid to create a North American
network for advanced mobile voice and data communications services with
agreements to acquire Dial Page, a mobile radio services company , and the
specialised mobile radio (SMR) assets of Motorola.
The stock swap transactions are together valued at about Dollars 2.4bn.
Nextel said it agreed in principle a tax-free merger with Dial Page for 28m
Nextel shares which, at yesterday's price, were worth about Dollars 760m.
In a separate transaction, Nextel will buy all of Motorola's special mobile
radio licences and businesses in the US for 62m Nextel shares, worth about
Dollars 1.68bn.
Nextel said it is also committed to a 'substantial purchase' of equipment
from Motorola over the next five years. Together with previous orders for
equipment, this will enable Nextel to build over 4,000 transmission sites in
the US covering about 85 per cent of the country, Nextel said. Nextel's goal
is to create an advanced digital mobile communications service that will
compete with existing cellular communications systems.
Over the past 18 months, the company has acquired mobile radio spectrum
rights from Motorola and several operators of SMR operators that provide
radio dispatch services for taxis, delivery vans and the like.
Nextel plans to use new digital technology from Motorola to convert these
dispatch systems into integrated mobile telephone, messaging, dispatch and
paging services.
'Combined with our recent agreements with leading SMR operators in Canada
and Mexico, Nextel will be the first company to offer advanced integrated
wireless voice and data communications, featuring digital clarity and
reliability, a single telephone number that will work anywhere and
availability across North America,' said Mr Morgan O'Brien, Nextel chairman.
MCI Communications, which in March agreed to acquire a 17 per cent stake in
Nextel for Dollars 1.3m, expressed its support for Nextel's expansion.
'Nextel's nationwide spectrum and coverage after these transactions gives it
a unique position,' said Mr Richard Liebhaber, chief strategy and technology
officer of MCI.
Nextel and MCI are negotiating definitive agreements for MCI's planned
purchase of Nextel shares , he said, and are also forming an alliance to
jointly market wireless services nationwide under the MCI brand name.

<TEXT>
The French government yesterday appointed adviser banks for the
privatisation of Renault and appears prepared to go ahead with at least a
partial privatisation of the state-owned automobile group by the end of the
year.
The Renault sale, valued at more than FFr40bn (Dollars 7.46bn), is one of
the most important and most sensitive operations in the privatisation
programme of the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur. The
programme, launched last year, involves the sale of 21 public sector groups.
Government officials said no decision had yet been taken concerning the
timing or the scale of the operation. They said if the operation goes ahead,
the government would either retain a majority stake, through a partial
privatisation, or reduce its 80 per cent stake to a blocking minority
holding of 34 per cent.
Industry observers claimed, however, that the government could opt for the
more ambitious proposal, which would involve a public offering for some of
the shares, an increase in Renault's capital, and the formation of a group
of long-term stable investors. Volvo, the Swedish automobile group which
retains a 20 per cent stake in Renault following the collapse of the two
companies' merger plans last year, could also reduce its holding as part of
the operation.
According to one government official, the strategy concerning the
privatisation will now be discussed between the two adviser banks - Credit
Agricole and Rothschild et Cie - and the privatisation commission, an
independent body which advises the government on the sale of public sector
assets. Renault has already appointed Banque Nationale de Paris and Lazard
Freres as its adviser banks.
The privatisation of Renault, a union stronghold in the post-war period is
politically sensitive. But the government is keen to press ahead with a sale
to demonstrate its commitment to its privatisation programme and to raise
funds to ease pressure on the budget deficit, targetted at FFr300bn this
year.
Until recently, the government has indicated that Assurances Generales de
France, the insurance group, would be next on the privatisation list.
Renault, however, one of the few automobile groups to remain in profit
during the recession in the sector, may represent a more attractive
operation. Government officials said yesterday that the preparation of a
possible Renault sale reflects its strategy of having 'two irons in the
fire'.
The government has already started discussions concerning the formation of a
so-called 'noyau dur' of stable long term investors. Possible candidates
include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, which co-operates with Renault in
formula one racing and in other areas, the Lagardere Group, which
co-operates with Renault in the production of its Espace vehicles and the
Suez financial and industrial group.

FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: USAir turns down pilots'
proposals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAir, the struggling US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority
stake, yesterday rejected a proposal from the pilots' union that employees
should swap Dollars 2.5bn worth of wage cuts for 25 per cent of the
company's shares.
It said the savings flowing from the plan were 'illusory' and several
serious flaws would have to be corrected before 'meaningful' negotiations
over cost reductions could take place.
However, USAir said some aspects of the pilots' proposal were encouraging,
and it was prepared to accept the principle of an equity-for-concessions
swap.
'It's a starting point,' the company said.
USAir, which faces tough competition from low-cost carriers making in-roads
into its markets, has not made a profit since 1988.
In June it put forward a plan to slash operating costs by Dollars 1bn a
year, with half of the savings coming from the wage bill.
Last week the Air Line Pilots Association proposed that employees should
yield Dollars 2.5bn worth of wage cuts over the next five years in exchange
for partial employee ownership and representation on the company's board.

FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: A wider base is more stable - Why Asprey
has been making acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asprey, the exclusive jewellery retailer which also owns Garrard, the crown
jewellers, has learnt it is dangerous to depend on a small group of
super-rich customers, particularly during a recession.
That is the view of Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, who has been behind
the group's aggressive acquisition strategy designed to take Asprey into
more areas of the luxury goods business.
'Our customer base had to be widened so that the effect of future recessions
would not be so severe,' says Mr Attallah. 'We have to live with the fact
that margins are under pressure and that circumstances have changed. Money
does not disappear, it just changes hands and we have to follow it.'
Through acquisitions the group has sought to reduce its dependence on the
sort of customers traditionally attracted to its Bond Street shop where a
set of jewellery made from diamonds and Burma rubies retails for Pounds 2m
and a pair of life-sized panthers made from oxidised silver cost Pounds
450,000.
'There are only so many people who can spend that kind of money. We had to
build a bigger base so that we were not so vulnerable,' says Mr Attallah.
Helped by the recession, Asprey has picked off a number of prestigious
outlets starting with Mappin &amp; Webb and Garrard in 1990, Watches of
Switzerland in 1992 and Les Ambassadeurs, the watch and jewellery retail
chain, in 1993. In July last year Sears, the retail group, sold its 25 per
cent stake in Asprey and it moved from the USM to the Official List.
The additions have already made their presence felt. Acquisitions made
during the past two years contributed Pounds 18.6m to turnover in the year
to March 31, helping to push the total up by almost 30 per cent, from Pounds
144.7m to Pounds 187.6m.
Despite this, the group's reliance on the Asprey business remains large.
Asprey continued to contribute more than 75 per cent of profits and 55 per
cent of sales.
Mr Attallah's goal is to cut Asprey's contribution to profits to 35 per
cent. 'At that point I will feel we have reached an optimum position. We
will be less vulnerable and have a wider customer base,' he says.
Asprey's management still has a long way to go to improve the performance of
the acquisitions. Many of the businesses were in bad shape and it has had to
develop a corporate structure more compatible with a diversified group.
Some notable improvements have already been achieved. Garrard has emulated
Asprey, organising large exhibitions and pursuing overseas markets. During
the year exhibitions were held in Hong Kong, Vienna, Maastricht and New
York. The strategy helped boost turnover by 35 per cent to Pounds 30m at the
year end.
At Mappin &amp; Webb an expansion of outlets lifted sales by 17 per cent and
profits have been enhanced by maintaining gross margins.
Watches of Switzerland, in its first full year of trading under Asprey
ownership, saw its outlets grow from 26 to 33. The subsidiary is also set to
benefit from the launch last year of Zeus, aimed at younger shoppers where
watches cost hundreds rather than thousands of pounds.
The Les Ambassadeurs chain, with outlets in Zurich, Geneva, St Moritz,
Lugano and Lucerne, has performed well ahead of expectations.
The Asprey group is also seeking to expand its overseas operations and has
set about building a bigger export team. A Mappin &amp; Webb outlet will be
opened in Prague in October while an Asprey office has been established in
Hong Kong.
Although Asprey has shelved plans to open in Shanghai, Mr Attallah believes
China will offer the 'biggest boom ever' in 10 years time. 'Our biggest
spending customers used to be from the Middle East but there has been a
shift to the Far East as a new entrepreneurial class has developed.'
Mr Attallah concedes the group will not achieve maximum growth through
expansion alone. Of equal importance will be its ability to drive down
costs.
Although the group's jewellery and gift manufacturing capacity has been
enhanced through the acquisitions, Mr Attallah believes little headway has
been made in rationalising and integrating production facilities.
Asprey produces only 12 per cent of what it it sells, far too little in Mr
Attallah's view. He has set the group a target of 35 per cent by the end of
the decade.
This shift could also boost commissioned sales which accounted for only 10
per cent of turnover last year. He would like to see this rise to 15 per
cent.
In its dash for growth Asprey is not yet reaching for the mass market. It
remains to be seen whether the group can manage to hold on to its
exclusivity and simultaneously achieve significant increases in sales
volumes with better margins.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced losses of Pounds 116,000, compared with Pounds 131,000, were
announced by London Securities, the property investment and development
group, for the six months to March 31.
The result comprises rents, interest and dividend income of Pounds 4,000
(Pounds 7,000) less administrative expenses of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds
138,000). Losses per share were unchanged at 0.2p.
The results only reflect income and expenditure deriving from and related to
assets acquired on or after approval of the voluntary arrangement in October
1992. No surpluses for unsecured creditors arose in the period.
The new board of directors, appointed last month, said it expected next
month to announce proposals for the acquisition of certain properties from
the Nu-Swift group.

<TEXT>
Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance broking group, is likely to
incur a Pounds 2.2m charge in goodwill costs linked to the disposal of its
Lloyd's Names business, writes Andrew Jack.
Its Horace Holman subsidiary was transferring future work on Estate
Protection Plan, a scheme to close off liabilities on open years for Names
who have died, to Centrewrite, a Lloyd's-controlled vehicle. Clarkson has
also handed over administration of personal stop loss policies arranged by
Holman Wade and Carritt &amp; Partners to IRISC London without any payment.
Goodwill which had previously been written off against reserves was likely
to be reinstated as a charge in the P&amp;L account for the current year.
'This is part of the nationalisation of the relationship with Names. It is
natural and evolutionary,' said Mr Robert Ward, finance director.

Shares in Tottenham Hotspur yesterday hit a new high for the year after the
quoted north London football club said it would finance its recent
acquisition spree out of existing cashflow and banking facilities.
The share price - which rose 2p to 110p - has increased 21 per cent in the
past week following the club's decision to buy German striker Jurgen
Klinsmann and Ilie Dumitrescu of Romania.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, said: 'We will be using cash resources and working
with our banks to finance these deals.'
The club is paying Pounds 2.31m for Klinsmann and Pounds 3.01m for
Dumitrescu, including a 5 per cent levy to the Football League.
Speaking on Thursday, Mr Sugar - who is also chairman of Amstrad, the
electronics group - said Tottenham was trying to resolve a row with the
Football Association over the club's exclusion from the FA Cup competition.
'The FA has made it tough for us, and it is my kind of spirit to hit back
and try to solve the problems.'
In June the club was fined Pounds 600,000, banned from the FA Cup
competition and docked 12 league points over irregular payments to players.
Although the FA subsequently decided to increase the fine to Pounds 1.5m and
reduce the league penalty to six points, the share price has risen by 38 per
cent since its June low of 80p.
City analysts said the increase reflected expectations of higher ticket and
merchandise sales, and the prospect of on-field success from the new
players.

Heublein, a US subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, yesterday announced it had
completed the Dollars 185m (Pounds 119.3m) transaction under which
Canandaigua Wine of New York will acquire a number of its wine brands along
with several wineries in California.
The consideration for the deal comprises a cash purchase price of about
Dollars 130.5m and the assumption by Canandaigua of some Dollars 4.8m of
operating liabilities. In addition, Heublein has been granted options to buy
400,000 shares of Canandaigua's class A common stock at Dollars 35 a share
and 200,000 class A shares at Dollars 30 apiece.
Heublein has also retained accounts receivable related to the businesses
being sold, totalling some Dollars 50m.
In the year ended September 30 1993, net sales (excluding federal excise
taxes) related to the assets and business to be sold by Heublein amounted to
about Dollars 235m.
Under the terms of the deal Canandaigua will acquire Almaden, Inglenook,
Belaire Creek Cellars, Chateau La Salle and Charles Le Franc table wines, Le
Domaine Champagne and Almaden, Hartley and Jacques Bonet Brandy from
Heublein.
The transaction also includes wineries in Madera and Escalon, California, as
well as the grape juice concentrate business at the Madera winery.
Heublein will retain its wineries in Paicines and Reedley, California, and
its interests in the Madera Glass Company.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bullough, the diversified engineering and office products group, yesterday
said it was expanding its core heating business with the Pounds 9.89m
acquisition of Trianco Group, the privately-owned boiler manufacturer.
It is the first acquisition since Mr Gordon Bond took over as chief
executive in January and refocused the company on four key areas:
refrigeration, engineering, office products and heating.
'Trianco fits in with our strategy of building competitive advantage and
market share in our core business-es.'
Bullough is issuing Pounds 9.74m of six year loan notes and paying Pounds
150,000 cash for the Sheffield-based company. Mr Bond said the group also
planned to redeem Pounds 1.9m of Trianco cumulative preference shares and
would assume its Pounds 2.2m net borrowings.
Trianco, which manufactures and sells oil and gas boilers, reported pre-tax
losses of Pounds 1.08m after exceptional provisions of Pounds 1.8m for the
year to December 31. At the operating level, profits were Pounds 778,000 on
turnover of Pounds 12.6m.
Bullough's heating division made operating profits of Pounds 4.1m on sales
of Pounds 35.1m in the 12 months to October 31.

Ruberoid, the waterproofing systems specialist which was spun off from
Tarmac last November, yesterday announced two purchases in the polymeric
sheeting field for use in the construction industry for a total of about
Pounds 6.5m.
It has acquired the half interest, not already owned, in Hyload UK, from
Coal Products for Pounds 4.6m and Hyload in the US from Coal Products and
Tarmac for payments totalling Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m).
Mr David Kendall, chairman, said prospects in the UK construction industry
were now more encouraging although the recovery had been slow to
materialise. The Belgian and Dutch businesses were performing well.
However, he warned that as a result of wet weather earlier this year the
level of group activity for the first half of 1994 had been slightly below
expectations.
Margins were generally firm with overheads under control and Mr Kendall
expected 'a satisfactory outcome' for the first half. In 1993 the group beat
its flotation forecast with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.1m.

FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: South Crofty tin mine wins its fight for
life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's last operating tin mine has won its fight for life.
Mr Kevin Ross, managing director of the South Crofty mine near Cambourne,
Cornwall, announced yesterday morning that applications for an offer of
shares in the company had reached Pounds 1.15m, beating the minimum
requirement under a survival package agreed with the government by Pounds
150,000 and the Thursday midnight deadline by a few hours.
As soon as the company's auditors and solicitors have confirmed that the
issue has met all requirements, which Mr Ross said would take three or four
days, the government will write off loans totalling Pounds 23.4m.
Also, RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which sold South Crofty and
its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, will forgive
loans of Pounds 7.7m.
The survival of the 400 year-old mine and the jobs of its 260 employees are
now assured for a year to 18 months. But Mr Ross believed the company's
position was now actually stronger than that.
He was encouraged by the fact that Pounds 650,000 of the share applications
were on behalf of two corporate investors involved in the mining and
minerals sector - the rest being from small private investors. 'These
companies (which cannot be named until the issue has been verified and the
loans written off) have taken a view that tin does have a future in the
medium to longer term,' he said, 'and that puts us in a more secure
position'.
Mr Ross was also confident that the issue could now get close to the full
offer of Pounds 1.8m. That, he said, would enable the company to bring
forward some projects and possibly expand the workforce, which has already
grown by more than 40 per cent over the past three years.
At about Pounds 3,300 a tonne, the world tin price remains nearly Pounds 700
below the level that South Crofty needs to make a decent profit. But Mr Ross
said the outlook was improving, with emergence from recession likely to lead
to good demand growth, particularly from Pacific Rim countries.
The development of new uses for tin was also encouraging, he said, and there
were good prospects that improvements in tin can technology could help to
win back market share from aluminium containers.
Last year the mine, which produces about 2,200 tonnes annually of tin in
concentrate (an intermediate material), reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds
42,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.5m.

bid

Loewen Group, a Vancouver-based funeral home and cemetery operator,
disclosed yesterday that it had been approached by Great Southern Group to
help fend off an unwelcome takeover bid from Service Corporation
International of the US.
Loewen is SCI's main rival in North America. It operates more than 600
funeral homes and 95 cemeteries across the US, Canada, Puerto Rico and
Mexico.
SCI has made a Pounds 99.1m tender offer for Great Southern, but has so far
been rebuffed by members of the Field family who control the UK funerals
company.
Loewen said yesterday that it 'has been invited and is meeting with' Great
Southern and JD Field &amp; Sons, the trust which holds the family's shares.
A team from Loewen is presently in the UK for talks with the UK group.
'We'll decide whether or not to make an offer when we've finished the
discussions,' Loewen said.
Great Southern, which is the UK's biggest crematorium operator, has
indicated that an offer from Loewen or any other white knight will be at a
higher price than SCI's latest bid of 680p per share. SCI is also offering
271p for Great Southern's convertible stock.
The Houston-based company earlier this week boosted its stake in Great
Southern from 3 per cent to 29 per cent, making it Great Southern's
second-biggest shareholder. Its latest offer expires on Aug 30. But the UK
Takeover Panel yesterday ruled that SCI would be allowed to extend the
closing date for its offer to match the timetable of any competing bid.
Loewen has mushroomed since its formation in the early 1980s, mainly by
buying funeral homes in the US. It spent Dollars 666m on US acquisitions in
the five years to 1993.

FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: British Alcan back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better prices helped British Alcan Aluminium, the subsidiary of Alcan
Aluminium of Montreal, return to the black for the first time in four years
with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m, against losses of Pounds 5.2m
last time.
Operating profits jumped from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 13.8m in the six months
to June 30, after exceptional costs of Pounds 4.1m, against Pounds 6m.
Better prices in the primary sector and record fabricated tonnage pushed
turnover up from Pounds 381.1m to Pounds 394.6m.
Mr John Bridgeman, managing director, said the figures showed that cost
reduction measures taken over the past few years were beginning to pay off.
The increase in fabricated tonnage had been achieved with half the number of
employees of 1982, the year the group was formed.
He said, however, that margins for fabricated products were still under
pressure.
Improved economic activity in UK and continental European markets also
helped the return to profitability. The bulk of British Alcan's rolled
products are exported to Germany and Italy.
Mr Bridgeman said the company continued to cut capital expenditure which
stood at Pounds 4m for the period. For the full 1993 financial year capital
expenditure was Pounds 18.3m.
Cash generation was almost Pounds 10m ahead of the same period of last year.
The cut in capital expenditure helped the company reduce total debt by
Pounds 19m. Short-term borrowings were reduced from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds
16.6m while long term loans were cut to Pounds 131.3m (Pounds 145.2m).
Gearing fell from 38 per cent to 35 per cent. Interest charges were down
from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Bridgeman was appointed managing director last September to succeed Mr
Doug Ritchie, British Alcan's chairman and chief executive, who died in
August.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Sour taste of beef stew: With beef farmers and fishermen up
in arms, are EU rules turning the continent animal crackers?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's beef farmers are in disarray. Prices for cows at livestock
auctions have plummeted, producers face hefty falls in their profits,
abattoirs are running out of supplies. Radical change may be the only way
for the industry to survive.
The cause of the upheaval is the decision by European agriculture ministers
to impose new restrictions on UK exports of carcass beef - the bulk of beef
exports to continental Europe - in order to crack down on 'mad cow disease'.
The rules ban the export of carcasses of any animal over six months' old
unless they come from herds certified free of the disease, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), for six years. Until last week, animals had come from
herds that had been free of the disease for only two years.
The tightening of export rules has hit most dairy farmers hard as, in
effect, it halts the export of cull cows - old dairy cows that have finished
their productive life and are slaughtered, mainly for processing into meat
pies, sausages and ready-made meals.
Last year, exports of carcasses from old dairy cows accounted for some
75,000 tonnes of Britain's 128,000 tonnes of beef exports to the European
Union, with France taking about 70 per cent of the beef for deboning in its
own plants. Total British beef production last year was 877,000 tonnes.
The government reckons that more than half of Britain's dairy herds have
been affected by BSE. As a consequence, the change in regulations has closed
off export outlets and forced down prices at livestock markets by 30 per
cent or more. Mr John Glanvill, a dairy farmer near Exeter, says that is
equivalent to a drop in price of about Pounds 150 a cow.
Mr Hugh Black, a dairy farmer near Leominster, Herefordshire, who has lost
25 cows from his herd of 140 to BSE in the past few years, believes cows he
sells this year will be worth Pounds 12,000 less as a result of the price
drop. 'This will come right off the bottom line,' he said. 'It could knock
20 per cent off our profits.'
The financial effect across the industry is likely to be significant, but
the National Farmers' Union says it is too soon to quantify.
'There is a great deal of uncertainty and concern throughout the industry
and the only way to get around that is an administrative hassle,' said Sir
David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union.
Sir David is referring to the problem faced by farmers if they want to
provide a certificate stating their cow has not been in a herd affected by
BSE over the past six years. Only with this certificate can farmers send
carcasses for export.
The ministry of agriculture record herds which are affected by BSE but
because of data protection rules cannot release the names and addresses of
farmers. That means a considerable bureaucratic effort is required to trace
every home of each animal. 'It's an unbelievable administrative burden. All
you have is an ear tag with the cow's number on it, but nowhere to start to
find out where it's been,' said Mr Martin Burtt, a livestock farmer in North
Yorkshire.
Sir David will meet Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, on
Monday to press him to release more information from the register of BSE
herds. Mr Waldegrave has had cases of BSE on his own Somerset dairy farm and
appreciates farmers' feelings. But he warns the trade is in for 'an
uncomfortable transition'.
That shift is likely to see British cows selling at reduced prices while the
industry struggles to bring on stream capacity for deboning beef in the UK.
This would enable it to redirect its marketing effort towards selling
boneless beef abroad. Deboned beef has tissues such as the brain, spinal
cord and spleen removed - the organs which could pose a risk, however
remote, to human health, according to the agriculture ministry.
Some abattoirs do not have deboning facilities and others say they have
little spare capacity. But Anglo Dutch Meats at Eastbourne, one of the UK's
largest beef deboning plants, believes the change to exports of deboned beef
could be achieved reasonably quickly.
Mr Nik Askaroff, managing director, said the company, which processes 15,000
tonnes of beef a year, has had more than 15 inquiries from continental
European traders willing to buy UK carcasses and have them deboned before
they leave the country. 'At the moment we run only one shift,' he said. 'We
could double our capacity in a fairly short time and nearly treble it within
a year.'
The farmers' union wants the government to apply for EU aid for farmers to
store beef carcasses over the next couple of months while UK boning capacity
is increased. But the union agrees that the farmers have to launch a
marketing drive to increase sales of boneless beef abroad - otherwise they
risk a glut in the UK.
Farmers, meanwhile, are worried that any glut of boned beef - or carcasses -
will be exacerbated by the effect of the tighter export restrictions on
consumer confidence in the UK, just when they believed they were winning the
war of words against BSE. The incidence of BSE peaked at the start of 1993,
but declined by 23 per cent in the first six months of this year.
The Meat and Livestock Commission, the marketing organisation, says some
reports from butchers have indicated a drop in beef purchases, but it is not
yet clear if this is in response to renewed fears over BSE or the hot
weather encouraging people to eat salads.
Mr Ken Cork, a butcher in Fernhead, Cheshire, said: 'It's definitely
affected us: we've had lots of inquiries about whether the beef is safe or
not and although you try to reassure people, it's difficult to convince them
100 per cent.'
So far, retail prices have been affected little by the slump in cattle
prices at auction, but Mr Cork expects to pay less for his wholesale
supplies next week. That might feed through into lower prices for the
consumer.
If the British beef industry fails to develop overseas markets for boneless
beef, it could be the domestic shopper who benefits by seeing prices fall.
Farmers may not like it, but carnivores will not beef.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Drifting into a tangled net: With beef farmers and fishermen
up in arms, are EU rules turning the continent animal crackers?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of Cornish trawlermen nursing their broken drift nets and their
injured pride after being attacked by Spanish tuna fishermen this week, has
incensed British fishing organisations. But the escalating 'tuna war' is not
an isolated outburst: its causes strike at the heart of the European Union's
common fishing and conservation policies.
The reason for the clash lies in the distinctive fishing methods employed by
Spain and other EU fleets. Spanish fishermen use baited lines to land their
tuna, as they have been doing for generations. In the late 1980s, the UK,
France, Ireland and other EU countries began to invest in large trawlers
with nets stretching towards the horizon.
Spain's Galician and Basque country fishermen whom the British trawlermen
have described as a 'wolf pack', are threatening to go on the attack again
if they spot EU vessels using long drifts nets in the Bay of Biscay.
'Of course we don't condone violent action,' said Mr Rafael Conde,
director-general of fishing resources at Madrid's agriculture and fisheries
ministry yesterday. 'But the attacks are not the problem, they are the
symptoms of the problem.'
The Spanish government alleges that the real irritant is the systematic
abuse by the UK, French and Irish fleets of the 2.5km limit imposed by the
EU on the length of drift nets. Their suspicions appeared to be confirmed
yesterday when a Royal Navy ship seized fishing gear from a Cornish trawler
suspected of flouting the rules on net size.
The Spanish authorities, which use satellite equipment to measure the length
from the bow of a trawler to the bouys marking the end of the drift net,
insist there is persistent flouting of the EU's rules.
The European Commission agrees with the Spanish that the rules are often
broken and, in April, called on governments whose fishermen use drift nets
to step up their monitoring procedures. The Commission says it drew
particular attention to the tuna area which is such a long way from shore it
is harder to police.
'Happily no one has been killed so far and that is what we feared would
happen,' said a Commission official of the latest dispute. 'But at least
this incident has forced member states to take the issue of policing more
seriously.'
Four EU inspectors have gone to the Bay of Biscay to monitor the measuring
of drift nets by patrol boats from countries fishing in the area. A fifth is
on his way to the site of the current dispute in Spain.
Madrid wants the EU to ban drift nets altogether, but in the meantime is
urging Brussels to ensure that each member country strictly enforces the
limitation on the lengths of the drift nets used by their fleets.
The Commission is sympathetic to Spain's plea for a ban on the nets, and has
asked EU fishing ministers to consider phasing them out on environmental
grounds. Last year 1,000 dolphins were caught in the nets as well as
thousands of other smaller fish.
EU ministers have so far failed to reach a consensus on banning the nets,
which allow fishermen to increase their catch. A trawler using such nets can
land about 105 tonnes of tuna in the June-August season in the Bay of Biscay
against the average 35 tonnes that the smaller Spanish vessels catch using
lines. The 700 ships that make up Spain's tuna fleet caught 25,000 tonnes of
fish last year, while the 60 trawlers of the French fleet, the next largest
in the EU, caught 6,300 tonnes.
The emotional argument over drift nets and policing masks the real concern
in Europe over dwindling fishing stocks and common access by all fishermen
to each country's waters. 'As long as you have fishermen, you will have
disputes of this nature, not because they are genetically different, but
because you don't have clearly defined property rights in the sea,' said one
Commission official.
British fishermen are angry because they feel they have been pushed out of
UK waters by quotas imposed on their catch of white fish such as cod, and
competition from other nations' fishing boats.
Mr David Pessel, chairman of the Plymouth Trawler Owners' Association, says
his fleet used to catch 66 per cent of its fish in British territorial
waters, up to 200km from shore, 20 years ago - that figure has fallen to 12
per cent. 'The boats from Newlyn and Mevagissey in Cornwall have been
targeting the tuna for the past year because it's very lucrative for them
and there's not much left for them to fish here,' he said.
The EU so far imposes no quotas on the tuna catch of any member state, but
this may change if recent scientific evidence of a drop in tuna numbers is
corroborated.
Last year the scientific committee for the ICCAT, an international committee
based in Madrid that monitors the conservation of Atlantic tuna, warned that
the use of drift nets had, for the first time, clearly begun to deplete the
tuna population.
The scientists also noted what the fishermen know only to well: the tuna,
which migrate from south of the Azores towards the Bay of Biscay in early
summer, were staying further and further away from the coast. Some of the
main banks of fish are now to be found up to 800km offshore. 'The tuna isn't
tonto (stupid),' says Mr Conde. 'We're dealing with a smart fish who every
year will try and avoid the drift nets.'
The Spanish tuna catchers say their method of fishing with lines is more
environmentally sound as they do not hook dolphins, an argument supported by
Greenpeace, the environmental organisation. Its Rainbow Warrior vessel was
also on the look-out this week in the Bay of Biscay for illegal drift nets.
The British have tried to get round the problem by opening up 'dolphin
doors' in their nets to enable the larger creatures to escape. 'There is a
lot of scaremongering going on, but we are genuinely and seriously
interested in conservation,' said Mr Pessel.
While this week's row may be solved by stepping up monitoring procedures, it
is nevertheless a further step in the disillusionment of UK fishermen with
the EU's common fishing policy. Some are backing a campaign to abandon the
policy and regain control of the UK's own territorial waters.
'I'm a good European, but the management of fishing policy has been
appalling. Fishermen in this country face going the same way as the coal and
steel industries,' said Mr Pessel. But, he says, ignoring EU fishing policy
is a solution unlikely to find favour with the UK government. More fish wars
could be imminent.

<TEXT>
Sir, Nigel Spivey's defence of terrorist activities by animal rights
fanatics ('Such woolly ideas', July 30/31) is extraordinarily naive. He
informs us that 'one has to feel grateful for the occasional arson attack .
. . They rightly make us think'. Extreme animal rights groups do not seek to
make people think. They use bombs to maim human beings and arson attacks to
coerce organisations to follow their views. People who conduct medical
research on animals, or those who responsibly run zoos, are not thoughtless
or evil; they believe their work to be morally justified.
Unfortunately their views are rarely heard amid the deluge of fashionable
animal rights propaganda.
Should we also be grateful to the IRA for 'making us think'?

Sir, Members of the Names Defence Association are like other embattled and
worried Lloyd's Names. They are honourable people who will meet their legal

of their abilities. Material breaches of contracts can and have been made by
persons at Lloyd's other than Names. Before Lloyd's can expect to collect
its debts, it will have to prove them in court. There is considerable reason
now to believe that it will be unable to do so.
Calling in debt collectors will accomplish nothing ('Lloyd's set to hire
debt collectors to chase Names', August 5). It is a callous and shameless
act to terrify thousands of scared and innocent victims. It is a personally
demeaning gesture by Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's, and it will

FT  06 AUG 94 / Right, proper and perplexed: Japan is struggling to
reconcile conflicting views of its history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
August in Japan is the month for remembering. This morning, at 8.15 in the
Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, the nation's leaders will gather across
the river from the monument marking the spot where the A-bomb exploded, to
commemorate the precise moment 49 years ago when the 'black rain' fell.
There will be solemn speeches restating Japan's renunciation of war for
ever.
Nine days later, 500 miles away in central Tokyo, there will be a rather
different ceremony. At the Yasukuni shrine in the heart of the capital, on
the 49th anniversary of the Japanese surrender, another group of dignitaries
will pray before the Shinto deities of the nation's war dead.
But the devotees at Yasukuni will be stirring a political controversy. For
the shrine is not simply Japan's Cenotaph, or Arlington Cemetery. It is the
resting place of the souls of all those who died defending the mother
country - ordinary soldiers, but also kamikaze pilots, officers who oversaw
the construction of the Burma railroad, and Class A war criminals executed
by the Allies.
At first sight, the two ceremonies seem very different. Hiroshima is an
official event, supported by socialists, liberals, conservatives. They will
be attended by pipes of peace and the mood will be reflective. At Yasukuni,
rightwing politicians, including half the current cabinet, and war veterans
will be watched by shaven-headed youths in military regalia. Buses sporting
the Imperial Rising Sun flag will fill the air with noxious black smoke and
broadcast rightwing propaganda.
In fact, though, the two are related. Both represent the selectivity of
Japan's historical memory. Hiroshima presents Japan as the victim of the
'worst atrocity of the century', blotting out its causes; Yasukuni
commemorates the heroism of the men who died, blotting out the evil deeds of
many enshrined there. Neither acknowledges Japan's guilt.
This selective amnesia has been in evidence since the war. Japan has never
felt nor expressed the contrition of Germany. No Japanese prime minister has
ever fallen to his knees in remorse as German Chancellor Willy Brandt did in
the Warsaw ghetto in 1970. For years, this amnesia, though condemned by the
rest of the world, was largely indulged by the west. While the cold war
continued, Japan's role as the one friendly unarmed nation in the hostile
east seemed almost to expiate the historical offence.
But in the post-cold war world, Japan is edging towards a global role. In
the past year, the prospect of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council
has moved within sight. The Socialist party of Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama has, in the last month, ended its opposition to Japan having any
military capability. Japanese troops have been involved in UN peacekeeping
efforts in Cambodia. Most importantly, Japan increasingly sees itself as
providing leadership in Asia.
This last trend is forcing a gradual change in Japan's official version of
history. For many Asian countries - the principal victims of Japan's war -
Japan cannot assume a regional political role until that change is complete.
As Mr Haruki Wada, professor of history at Tokyo University, puts it: 'Japan
will never have normal relations with its Asian neighbours as long as it
continues to try to hide its past.'
A test of Japan's capacity for self analysis will come next year when the
country marks the 50th anniversaries of Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the
surrender.
But a step towards reappraising its history has already been made. Elections
last year swept away 40 years of Liberal Democratic party rule and appeared
to herald the first significant change in Japan's official attitude to its
history. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the leading architect of political reform, said at
the time: 'We cannot deny the part aggression has played in our history in
Asia.'
But Japan's leaders have failed to follow up words with actions. For
example, 'comfort women', the thousands of Korean and other women forced to
provide sex for Japanese soldiers, continue to press without success for
compensation.
Many Japanese see no need for Japan to feel remorse. They argue that their
fight was honourable, scarred by no more than the usual brutality of war.
Some go further. In a newspaper article in April, Mr Shigeto Nagano, Japan's
justice minister who is himself a 70-year-old war veteran, described
accounts of the 1937 Nanking massacre where Japanese soldiers murdered tens,
perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Chinese civilians as a 'hoax'.
After a few days' embarrassed silence from the government, Mr Nagano was
forced to resign. But he maintains his views represent those of most
Japanese. He does not see the war in terms of aggression. 'Japan fought to
liberate Asia. In some ways, it could be said we did liberate Asia - look
what happened to India and Burma after the war,' he says.
He is on far less controversial ground when he explains the problem for
Japan in dealing with its past. Unlike Germany, he says, Japan has not been
able to cut itself off from events of 50 years ago. The postwar constitution
reflected the Allies' desire to maintain continuity in Japan to avoid
complete disintegration. So the emperor was left in place.
This continuity has led, most crucially, to weaknesses in the education
system. For decades, Japanese school-books glossed over much of Japan's war
record.
But in the last few months, small victories have been won on the path to
openness. Last year, the supreme court ruled that government attempts to
censor history textbooks were illegal - a decision against which the
education ministry has not appealed. This summer, a school history
curriculum came into effect in high schools which, for the first time,
describes Japan's war as one of aggression.
The scale of the task of re-educating the Japanese is illustrated by one of
Japan's best-selling computer games, Decision of the Commanders, which
re-enacts Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour and the invasion of Asia. The
players assume the positions of imperial commanders, and use forced labour
to fortify their positions. The software caused a furore when it was
launched in 1989, but has sold more than 100,000 copies. Its author,
24-year-old Mr Ryohei Tanaka, says: 'The game was produced from the
perspective of the aggressors, and the Japanese are enjoying it.'

all that it is claimed to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Donkin, on the predictive value of references (Management,
August 3), quotes the director general of the Institute of Personnel and
Development as saying: 'The best predictor you can get of the likely success
of a candidate is how they performed in their previous jobs . . . It is
better than the interview, the psychometric test and all the other devices.'
This is highly misleading. 'How they performed' would be wonderful if you
could find out, but references can be glowing to get rid of the unwanted
(and the opposite). Research has found that references are well below
psychometric tests on average, and at about the same pathetic level as the
average interview.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bank attitude not helpful to industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER H QUINN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported the Bank of England criticising industry for seeking high
rates of return on investment ('Bank sounds warning on lack of investment',
August 1). You also reported, in splendid juxtaposition, the fear of an
early rise in interest rates ('Anxious wait for City on rates').
Those with even quite short memories will remember the official exhortations
to industry six or seven years ago to increase capacity. Building materials
suppliers were especially criticised for lack of manufacturing capacity, and
the size of the import-export trade gap. But pity building material
manufacturers which unwisely responded to those appeals. Many of the
investments were not even completed before the government imposed a slump on
the building industry and its need for building materials. Other new
capacity was closed or mothballed long before making a pay-back. As a
consequence many building materials share prices are lower today than they
were seven years ago.
Inflation is not the sole concern when making an investment decision. In the
past, inflation has masked many poor investment decisions, particularly in
property investment. It is more important to have stability of the market
place and interest rates. There must be demand to utilise the new capacity,
and there must be a margin over interest rates to service capital.
Is it beyond the intellectual capacity of the Bank of England to understand
that, when it constantly threatens to increase interest rates to prevent a
rise in inflation, it constantly reminds industry of the need to assume
higher interest rates when assessing rates of return on new investment? The
Bank's own performance hardly inspires confidence, with the confusion caused
by the new issue of Treasury bills last Friday as an example.
Can we hope that the Bank of England will cease posturing and try to provide
some constructive help to regenerate industry?

FT  06 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: CGT exemption would encourage savings
on rights issue underwriting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J R F FAIRBROTHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When companies issue new equity, the size of the discount to market
price is not important to them or their existing shareholders, provided the
equity is offered to the existing shareholders first. In effect, those
shareholders can capture the discount, either by subscribing for the new
shares or by selling their rights to do so.
Pre-emption rights are thus an important protection for all shareholders,
not just the 'big City battalions' (Lex: 'Underwriting fees', August 1).
It may well be, however, that underwriting fees are, at least on the basis
of any technical analysis, too high for an issue at a substantial discount,
where the existing shareholders effectively guarantee the company receives
its money in order to avoid dilution.
If so, it is a puzzle that, in the UK market, companies rarely issue equity
at very deep discounts and dispense entirely with underwriting costs. The
reasons for this are not totally clear and may primarily be a question of
market practice and investor perception.
There is also the difficult choice which faces small shareholders between
writing a cheque to subscribe for new equity or having to pay capital gains
tax on the sale of their rights.
Perhaps the Treasury and the Office of Fair Trading should consider the
possibility of exempting the sale of rights from CGT and encouraging some
large companies to make modest issues of non-underwritten equity at a deep
discount.
This might establish such a method of raising new equity as an acceptable
alternative and would ensure that companies only paid underwriting fees if
they felt they were obtaining good value.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Man In The News: Lawful leadership and legendary favours -
Chief Moshood Abiola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chief MKO Abiola - Anytime,' said the appointment book in the guardhouse to
the Nigerian president's compound. That was three years ago. The wheel of
fortune has since taken a dramatic turn.
Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, the man who once enjoyed instant access to
the presidency, ended up in jail, charged with treason. Last night, however,
in an attempt to defuse the country's deepening crisis, the government
offered to set Chief Abiola free on bail, aware that his fate could
determine the future of Africa's most populous nation.
The pressure had been intense: strikers demanding his release had cut vital
oil exports by a fifth since their action began four weeks ago. A national
strike had been called for Monday if the military government did not comply.
It is still far from clear, however, as to how the crisis will ultimately be
resolved, for the military government does not seem prepared to step down
and Chief Abiola is unlikely to surrender his claim to be head of state. He
won the June 1993 presidential elections only for Nigeria's military rulers
to declare the contest void.
To his supporters, the 58-year-old tribal chief, millionaire businessman,
newspaper magnate, airline owner, philanthropist and father of 63 children
is a valiant standard-bearer of democracy.
Yet to Chief Abiola's critics, he personifies the weaknesses of the nation
he wants to lead. They see him as gripped by delusions of grandeur, his
judgment distorted by a vanity that encourages him to distribute signed
copies of a hagiography entitled Legend of Our Time: the Thoughts of MKO
Abiola.
His current status owes less to democracy, they argue, than to the chief's
shrewd political timing, only entering the presidential race when other
contestants had been banned by the man he saw as his patron - General
Babangida.
When the general seized power in 1985, he promised a return to civilian rule
 -but on his terms. The 13 parties that sprang up in the late 1980s were
banned. The reason, said Gen Babangida, was that they were ethnically based,
competing for support of the Hausa Fulani of the Moslem north, the Yoruba of
the Christian south, and the Igbo of the east. In their place Gen Babangida
created the National Republican Convention and the Social Democratic party,
their manifestos written by government officials.
Chief Abiola, who had served as a senator in the last civilian
administration in the 1970s, stayed on the sidelines in the late 1980s.
Politics was a costly business in Nigeria, he explained in an interview: so
many cars to buy, offices to be established, and favours to dispense. But
there was more to his decision: it was all too risky, the process too
uncertain, he hinted.
It was a shrewd appraisal. Not long after that interview, Gen Babangida
changed the rules again. All 13 candidates seeking presidential nominations
by the two parties were banned for alleged electoral malpractices. Only then
did MKO, as he is widely known, make his move for the presidency.
He was not short of funds. His personal fortune, estimated to be
multi-millions of dollars, had been built up during a business career with
International Telephones and Telecommunications (ITT), the US communications
giant. But it had required determination to acquire the skills that brought
such wealth.
Born in 1937 in Abeokuta, an hour's drive from Lagos, he was his father's
23rd child and the first to survive. The rest died at birth or before they
reached their first birthday. A Nigerian government scholarship took him to
Glasgow University in 1961 to study accountancy. His break came in 1968,
when he joined ITT as finance controller.
Quite how the chief became so rich has been subject of much speculation. 'He
used his connections with friends in government, among them the late General
Murtala Muhammed (Nigeria's military leader in the mid 1970s), to win key
business concessions for ITT,' is how a chapter in Legend of Our Time puts
it.
These 'connections' paid off, it seems, during the 1970s, when the rapid
expansion of Nigeria's oil industry funded the country's multi-billion
telecommunications programme and ITT (Nigeria) flourished.
By the time Chief Abiola finally entered the political arena, the electoral
process initiated by Gen Babangida had been widely discredited, but with
ample funds and with the general's blessing, the chief seemed well placed to
win the presidential election set for last year.
He managed to straddle the regional, ethnic and religious divisions: as a
Yoruba, he could expect solid support from his kinsfolk in the south; as a
Moslem, he could appeal to the Hausa Fulani north.
According to leaked unofficial figures, he won the June 1993 election
comfortably, with 58 per cent of the vote, only to have it snatched away by
Gen Babangida himself.
In the weeks that followed, his relations with the military government
deteriorated to such a point that the chief felt that his life was in
danger. He fled the country for London in his private jet.
At breakfast in London's Savoy Hotel almost a year ago, Chief Abiola still
seemed stunned by the turn of events, yet confident that one day he would
win the presidency.
Of his betrayal by Gen Babangida, personal as well as political, he said
hardly a word. Gen Babangida, by then replaced by Nigeria's current military
leader, General Sani Abacha, had been more than a patron. He had mourners at
the funeral of the chief's wife. One of the chief's sons was courting one of
the general's daughters.
The reason for the betrayal remains a mystery. 'Babangida is still a family
friend', said the chief, refusing to say more.
Meanwhile at home he was criticised by supporters for deserting the
democratic cause. Perhaps stung by the attacks, he returned to Nigeria, and
in an act of defiance which set him on a collision course with the military,
announced that he was Nigeria's only lawful leader. He was arrested last
month.
Chief Abiola's views on how Nigeria may recover from its economic crisis
have been buried in the controversy that has gripped the country: his
support for privatisation, the need for an agricultural revival, the
importance of the private sector - all set out in his book.
In the 15 months since his election victory, strains have intensified in a
country gripped by an economic crisis. Ethnic and regional tensions mount by
the day, as illustrated by the recent strikes which paralysed the Yoruba
heartland around Lagos, but have been poorly supported in the north.
The conditional offer to release Chief Abiola last night suggests the
military leaders are trying to pull back from a confrontation that had
seemed inevitable. But the real test is yet to come for a country that likes
to call itself Africa's giant: since independence in 1960, Nigeria has been
led by men not equal to the responsibility. This week 90m Nigerians will be
hoping that Chief Abiola and Gen Abacha are capable of finding the
compromise necessary to break with this tradition.

FT  06 AUG 94 / A funny way to sell a railway: The UK rail strike has made
privatisation of the system more difficult to pull off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK rail strike, about to enter its ninth week, is more than a conflict
over the pay of a few thousand signalling staff. It is a struggle over the
future of the railways that could derail the government's plans to privatise
British Rail.
The likelihood that the strike would spread diminished with the announcement
on Thursday that supervisors had voted not to join the action. Their
efforts, combined with those of non-striking signalmen, have allowed British
Rail to run an increasing number of services on strike days.
But the stoppages have revealed the vulnerability of the companies that will
run trains after privatisation to action by small groups of workers. It is
not clear at present just how much compensation they will be entitled to if
the trains are brought to a standstill.
As a result the companies look much less attractive to potential bidders for
train-operating franchises and to their backers.
The strikes have been a 'death blow' to privatisation, says Mr Roger Brooke,
chairman of Candover, the venture capital group which had expressed interest
in backing bids. 'I think they have killed it stone dead,' he says.
And an adviser to the government involved in the privatisation process
admits that the dispute will have deterred a lot of bidders. 'The general
effect of the action must be to make what is a difficult privatisation even
more difficult to pull off,' he says.
This will be music to the ears of Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the
RMT, who laid out the union's battle-plans on privatisation in a briefing on
March 24, just days before the process began. He warned that the railways
faced a summer of disruption, with five issues which could provoke strikes,
overtime bans and work-to-rules. 'Trouble is going to break out if British
Rail do not come to terms with us,' he said. 'There is a genuine fear of the
future among my members.'
The first issue was over the terms for transferring BR staff to Railtrack,
the company set up on April 1 to run the track and signalling operations.
The union complained this would mean staff would no longer be able to move
from one job to another across the railway network. The RMT balloted the
staff over strike action but to the union's disappointment the members
rejected the call by a decisive majority.
The second potential source of trouble on Mr Knapp's list was the pay of
signalling staff - the issue behind the current dispute. The long-standing
grievances of the signalmen had come to a head with BR's rejection of the
union's interim pay claim of an 11 per cent increase as a reward for
productivity improvements. The union ballotted the staff, securing a
four-to-one majority in favour of action on an 80 per cent turn-out.
In pursuing its demands, the union has been helped by the behaviour of
Railtrack and the government. Railtrack's board - led by the abrasive Mr Bob
Horton, former chairman of BP - is largely new to the rail industry. It has
failed to win the hearts and minds of the signalling staff or, if opinion
polls are to be believed, the public.
Railtrack's shortcomings have been compounded by the transport department's
intervention to veto a 5.7 per cent interim pay deal linked to past
productivity improvements. The offer was not a breach of the government's
public sector pay freeze but an attempt to prepare the ground for
restructuring the often archaic working practices of signalling staff.
By intervening, the government not only prolonged a dispute that might
otherwise have stopped short of strike action. It has helped draw attention
to weaknesses in its privatisation plans that could yet derail the sell-off.
The government's plans involve breaking British Rail into some 40
independent businesses and selling them off. The infrastructure of track and
signals has been separated from the operation of trains, and passenger
services split into 25 companies to be franchised out to private operators.
The structure is designed to allow for the possibility of running
competitive services over the same tracks. However, a consequence of the
separation of track and trains is that train-operating companies will have
to pay track charges to Railtrack under the watchful eye of a regulator.
This will leave them with direct control of only half their running costs.
Being able to control just part of the cost-base is one reason why
Badgerline, a bus company that was one of the first companies to declare an
interest in running trains, has now cooled towards the idea. The dispute,
leading to losses for the train operators which cannot run their services,
has highlighted the dangers, according to Mr Philip Snowden, a director of
the company.
'If we were to make a bid for a franchise, we would want suitable protection
against the sort of losses that the train operators are currently
incurring,' he says.
Candover's Mr Brooke says that the strike has shown how disputes in one part
of the rail system can affect the finances of the train-operating companies.
'It's not just Railtrack,' he says. 'What happens if ScotRail goes on
strike? The English train-operating companies would lose revenue from
passengers travelling to and from Scotland.
'With the rail unions still in an antediluvian age, they can pick off one or
two companies and damage all the others.
'Unless the train operators can send everyone home on no pay when they can't
run trains in such circumstances, it will seriously diminish interest in
investing.'
Mr Chris Green, director of Scotrail, one of the first six passenger
franchises to be auctioned, says that the strike has been a 'chastening
experience'. He is running the company as a 'shadow' franchise in
preparation for privatisation and hopes to lead a management buy-out.
'The point of shadow franchises is to get experience of running trains under
the new arrangements,' he says. 'This has been an unexpected experience in
cash-flow management. We are currently haemorrhaging cash at a rate of
Pounds 300,000 for each strike day. We can recover costs from Railtrack for
the trains we don't run. But we get no compensation for losses on lines that
do run, or for loss of business long-term.'
His solution would be for some sort of collective insurance policy, under
which train operators would be compensated from a central fund for losses
incurred because of disruption to one part of the network.
Potential investors in Railtrack - which Mr Horton would like to see as an
early candidate for privatisation - will be equally nervous about the
consequences of strikes.
'If I were considering investing in Railtrack, I'd be terribly interested in
seeing what sort of compensation the train operators will get from the
company,' says a venture capitalist who is considering getting involved.
'The balance of risk looks pretty one-sided in Railtrack's favour at the
moment, but that may not last.'
One businessman who says that he is not fazed by the current dispute is Lord
Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, the shipping company, who is keen to acquire BR's
Freightliner business.
'I think we'll look back on this as a blip in the process of change,' he
told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week. 'Both the workforce and
management have got to be much more flexible in the years to come.
'Frankly, nothing in my view is going to stop the revitalisation of the
railway system in this country. I think the rail strike has heightened
people's interest as to what the railway system can really produce for this
country.'
But most people in the industry - or thinking of entering it - will agree
with Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, when he warned that continuing conflict on
the railways would 'devastate the industry and the livelihoods of those who
work in it'.
For the RMT, the stakes are equally high. Other unions in recent years -
most notably the mineworkers - have been all but wrecked by resistance to
change. Mr Knapp and his colleagues recognise the risks involved in a fight
to the finish for the signalling staff.
Over the years, the union has been able to block efforts to modernise
working practices on the railways. Avoiding trouble was often the preferred
BR option in dealing with archaic working practices.
But privatisation looks set to change this, with a more entrepreurial
attitude to the management of the railways already apparent. Railtrack, for
example, will buy in engineering services from the private sector rather
than employ thousands of staff to maintain track and signalling. The
train-operating companies are expected to root out inefficiencies and look
for more flexibility in working practices.
Changes such as these threaten RMT's membership base at a time when the
union is in deep financial trouble. After a previous dispute, BR ended the
check-off arrangement which collected union dues direct from the pay packets
of rail workers. Its membership has fallen sharply in the past two years
from more than 100,000 to about 60,000. The union is running a Pounds 2m
deficit on its current account for the second successive year and is having
to make painful cuts in its operations.
One option would be for the union to show greater willingness to come to
terms with privatisation. Unions in other privatised industries such as gas,
water and electricity have reached agreements with the new employers to
reform working practices in return for better terms and conditions.
But the RMT appears to have chosen the alternative of trying to block
change. It has already secured a promise from Labour that the railway
network will be returned to state ownership if the party wins the next
general election. 'Our commitment to take the network back into public
ownership is absolute,' said the party's transport spokesman Mr Frank Dobson
yesterday.
It may be that the failure of the supervisors' ballot to produce a strike
vote heralds a realisation among rail staff that opposition to privatisation
is ultimately doomed. But there remain plenty of opportunities for investors
to be reminded of the vulnerability of the railways to costly disruption
under the new arrangements.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Not the credit crunch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are times when the banking system appears to operate on a set of rules
of its own. The present reporting season, in which the leading British
clearing banks reveal their half-yearly results, provides a good example.
Here is a case of an industry rejoicing in the party after the hangover - an
inversion of the normal sequence that may well surprise those who witnessed
the credit binge of the 1980s, and the subsequent debt-induced recession.
Profits are soaring when the economic recovery has yet to impress itself on
many of the banks' own customers. What, it might be asked, is afoot?
The simple answer is that, in a highly cyclical business where the
accountancy profession captures only very imprecisely the trend of real
profitability, the upsurge in profit is heavily driven by a fall in the
provisions for bad debts. The more striking feature of the figures from both
Lloyds and National Westminster was, in fact, the weakness of loans and
advances, more than three years after the trough of the recession. They tell
us that the financing of this recovery is different.
In effect, the corporate sector has been giving the banks an unprecedentedly
wide berth. While companies normally reduce their debts during a recession,
the rigour and duration of the process has been quite exceptional this time.
As Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research recently pointed out, companies have now
paid down debt in 10 of the last 12 quarters. Yet there has never been more
than a couple of quarters of debt repayment in previous cyclical downturns.
Exceptionally strong
Notwithstanding the repayment of debt, which amounted to a net Pounds 11.4bn
to the banks in 1993 alone, industry's external funding requirement has been
rising. It has been met by the financial markets. The result is that the
corporate sector's balance sheet is not only looking very healthy; cash flow
and profits are exceptionally strong. As the latest Bank of England Bulletin
indicates, the pre-tax return on capital, excluding the North Sea sector,
recovered to 8.3 per cent in 1993 - almost twice as high as at the
comparable stage of the last recovery in the early 1980s.
Both banks and industry are thus awash with cash. The question is how they
will deploy it. And in both cases there are difficulties in arriving at a
satisfactory answer. Where industry is concerned, the obvious outlet is
fixed capital investment. So far, investment has contributed less to the
growth of gross domestic product in the present recovery than in the two
previous ones. Last year it grew by only 1.7 per cent compared with 2.4 per
cent in the comparable year of 1982.
The Bank of England Bulletin speculates that companies have been paying down
debt because they do not expect it to be eroded by inflation as in previous
economic cycles. Yet this sits oddly with the fashionable concern that
investment is inhibited by excessive target rates of return, which are said
to reflect the authorities' failure to convince industrialists that their
anti-inflationary credentials are trustworthy. Why is it that the
industrialists have been so slow to climb off the fence?
Financial housekeeping
Part of the explanation is that where balance sheets have been
overstretched, good financial housekeeping has to precede big investment
outlays. Another reason is that investment has anyway remained higher this
time, as a percentage of GDP, than in the recession of the early 1980s. In
practice investment tends to follow changes in profitability and to respond
to capacity constraints. More recent figures suggest that investment in the
first quarter, like consumption, has in fact been rising at an annualised
rate of more than 3 per cent; and the recent CBI Industrials Trends Survey
pointed to increasing capacity utilisation. Industry may be coming up with
the investment goods already.
In the banks' case, the clearers that have reported to date have provided
clues as to where the cash will go. Abbey National has cut its overdraft
lending rates. Past experience suggests that if others follow this could
reduce the overall profitability of retail banking to the benefit of the
consumer. Lloyds is still expecting to see a reduction in capital and cash
flow if its plans to acquire the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society go
ahead. National Westminster, meantime, has declared that it will respond to
price cutting by its rivals to maintain market share.
There is no more effective way to reduce profits and cash flow than to
engage in all-out competition in a mature industry. Yet the precise form of
the competition is not easy to predict when the corporate sector appears to
have little use for short-term variable rate bank money. It might just be
that the banks' personal customers, who have been so heavily squeezed while
the banks were restoring the hole in their balance sheets after the last
binge, are due for a pleasant surprise: a modest but enjoyable party without
a hangover. Stranger things have happened.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Storing nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The deep store route would involve gouging out caverns in the rock half a
mile below the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria.
This store would be for intermediate-level waste. There are no current plans
for a repository for high-level waste because it will be several decades
before this waste is cool enough to store.
Nirex, the industry-owned agency charged with the task, has just lodged an
application with the local council to build a 'rock lab' - an experimental
underground laboratory which, if successful, would enable construction of
the repository itself to start in 1998-99, for completion in 2010.
Yesterday's paper says, however, that money could be saved by delaying the
store for 25 to 50 years until enough waste has been generated to fill it.
The Pounds 1bn Nirex project would consist of a row of parallel chambers
connected to the surface by a five-mile spiral access tunnel with a railway.
The waste would be stored in special canisters and as the chambers were
filled, they would be packed with cement and sealed for good.
The store has been designed with a capacity of 400,000 cu m - enough for 50
years of waste materials. Its lifetime operating costs would be about Pounds
1bn.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Cost vies with safety in waste disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main issue behind the government's consultation document about nuclear
waste disposal is the need for balance between safety and cost.
The document makes clear that the government prefers using the technique
known as vitrification to transform the most dangerous forms of waste into a
type of glass which can be stored virtually indefinitely. Less dangerous
waste would be stored in special canisters.
The question is, where? Since consignment to the seabed or outer space have
been ruled out for legal and practical reasons, the choice is between deep
burial and special long-term stores on the surface. No large volumes are
involved. The amount of high-level waste awaiting disposal is the equivalent
of a four-bedroom semi-detached house, and the less radioactive intermediate
level waste about 10 houses.
Surface storage has the advantage of keeping the waste where it can be seen.
But it is more vulnerable to terrorists and accidents - and even the onset
of a new ice age. It is also more expensive because it needs guarding for
centuries, and the government feels that future generations should not have
to look after our mess.
Deep storage has the advantage of providing the closest thing to a permanent
solution - hence the government's preference for it. More attractive still,
it is cheaper.
There was a time when much of the environmental movement also favoured deep
storage, but yesterday the reaction from that quarter was largely hostile.
The idea of a nuclear 'dump' is repellent if not terrifying to many people.
But among the less emotional criticism of deep storage was the Friends of
the Earth appeal for a more flexible approach.
FoE said that the permanence of deep storage deprived future generations of
the option of using a better solution if one was found. It advocates surface
storage with adequate financing to fund research into better methods.
The nuclear industry welcomed the document. It has always favoured deep
storage because of its permanence and relative cheapness. But the nuclear
companies were also pleased to see that the government is keeping its
options open on other key issues.
Chief among these is the period required to allow nuclear stations to 'cool
down' when their operating lives are over. Under current policy companies
are required to remove the most dangerous materials as soon as possible and
leave the stations for 100 years before final dismantling.
Yesterday's document, however, acknowledges the nuclear industry's case that
it may be better to leave the power stations to cool down for longer because
they are then less dangerous and cheaper to take to bits. Although the
document does not propose this as policy, it leaves the option open.
In another significant statement the document says that nuclear companies
may hold spent fuel in a dry store for its 50-year cooling-off period if
they wish, rather than send it to Sellafield for vitrification. This will
delight Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, which have complained about
the cost of reprocessing, with the Scottish company saying that it could
save Pounds 45m a year by using dry store.
But the implication that it may make more commercial sense for nuclear
companies to use dry store rather than reprocessing raises questions about
the government's approval last year of the controversial Pounds 2bn Thorp
reprocessing plant.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
                   PLANNING FOR THE HALF LIFE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORIES OF NUCLEAR WASTER
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
High level:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Mainly spent fuel rods from reactors.  Highly radioactive and
needs long-term treatment.  Can either be vitrified (see below)
or held in dry store for 50 years before final disposal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Intermediate level:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Fuel rod cladding, contaminated water-filters and sludge.  This
waster is encapsulated in concrete or placed in on-site vaults
and stored for a period before final disposal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Low level:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Clothing and other lightly contaminated equipment.  After
treatment or a short period of storage much of this can be
disposed of normally, or buried in a low level disposal site.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
THE OPTIONS FOR DISPOSAL
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Vitrification:                Grinding high level wasters into
                              powder and mixing it with glass-
                              making materials to form a liquid
                              which hardens inside stainless
                              steel containers.  Then left in a
                              surface store to cool for 50 years
                              before final disposal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Dry store:                    A cheaper alternative to
                              vitrification.  Spent fuel rods are
                              placed intact in a special surface
                              store and allowed to cook naturally
                              for 50 years.  After that they may
                              be  vitrified or place in a deep
                              repository.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Deep repository:              Burial in specially constructed
                              vaults half a mile underground.
                              Nirex, the agency owned by the UK
                              nuclear industry, is seeking
                              permission to build an experimental
                              site near the Sellafield reprocessing
                              plant in Cumbria.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Burial at sea:                Ruled out earlier this year when the
                              UK signed an international agreement
                              banning disposal of radioactive waste
                              at sea.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Ejection into outer space:    An option much favoured by science
                              fiction writers, but ruled out on
                              practical grounds

FT  06 AUG 94 / DTI pulls another company into pyramid selling probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is scrutinising another 'pyramid'
company as part of its clamp-down on organisations supposedly structured in
a way to offer investors money for nothing.
Officials are investigating Powertag, a company linked to Quillpunch, which
was placed in provisional liquidation on Thursday following a High Court
petition from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The DTI said yesterday: 'We are looking at Powertag urgently over the
weekend to see what action we can take. We expect to have news next week.'
The probe follows the closure in the past few weeks of four companies
involved in promoting schemes which offer the chance for subscribers to
receive back from others many times the payments they make.
The most recent was the appointment on Thursday on 'public interest' grounds
of provisional liquidators to Quillpunch, into which the assets of Alchemy
Marketing and Alchemy (UK) had been transferred.
Filings at Companies House show that Powertag was incorporated less than
three weeks ago with a registered office in Sunderland.
Its directors include Mr John Asquith and Mr Stephen Darwin, who give
addresses in Doncaster, and who were both directors of Alchemy Marketing.
The DTI said its officials were investigating a possible recent transfer of
assets or customer information from Quillpunch to Powertag.
Last month the DTI wound up a different company called 3T Publications,
which operated a series of similar schemes and which traded at times as FPW
or Frequency Programming World.
Members were asked to pay monthly contributions of Pounds 38 or Pounds 70
and received commission payments for each additional person they recruited
to the network.
There are believed to have been at least 8,000 subscribers to both the FPW
schemes and those operated by Alchemy, which was briefly renamed the Alchemy
Foundation.
Meanwhile, some members of the schemes offered by the companies yesterday
maintained their loyalty and belief in the schemes and expressed frustration
and concern at the DTI's actions.
One said: 'The DTI has stopped my income which I survived on this year.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Clash of the soap war rivals set to accelerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National newspapers are being blitzed again this weekend with full-page
'soap wars' advertisements, as Unilever defends its new-generation
detergent, Persil Power, against last weekend's onslaught by arch-rival
Procter &amp; Gamble.
The advertisement in today's papers from Lever Brothers, UK subsidiary of
the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, is headlined 'Why this aerial bombardment?'
in a clear reference to Procter's competing soap powder, Ariel.
Last weekend Procter took advertising space to proclaim that 'only Ariel
washes so clean yet so safe'. Persil Power was not named in the
advertisements, but there was reference to the manganese-based 'accelerator'
which is at the centre of the row.
Unilever is promoting the accelerator as the ingredient which allows
superior stain removal at lower washing temperatures. Procter says the
accelerator could damage garments, causing fading and holes, and claimed in
its advertisements last week that the residues left in clothes could
continue to cause damage even if consumers switched to another brand of
detergent.
Those advertisements led to a complaint to the Advertising Standards
Authority, the advertising watchdog, by Lever Brothers on Monday. Lever
Brothers is challenging the test results quoted by Procter and disputes the
claims of product superiority made for Ariel.
This weekend's Lever Brothers advertisements reiterate the results of tests
com-missioned from independent institutes which are said to have found
Persil Power causes no damage to fabrics.
At the same time, says Lever Brothers, some of the tests showed
'significantly superior cleaning performance' by Persil Power when compared
with 'another leading concentrated powder'.
Mr Tim Hammond, Lever Brothers' detergents marketing director, said that the
new product launch had taken Persil to the number one slot in the UK
detergent market.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Oil and chemicals shore up output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production in the electronics and chemicals industries rose strongly in the
three months to June while the output of the clothing, paper and publishing
sectors dipped slightly, figures from the Central Statistical Office
yesterday showed, Gillian Tett writes.
Manufacturing showed a steady growth, in spite of slowing slightly in June.
Manufacturing output in the three months to June was a seasonally adjusted
1.3 per cent higher than in the three months to March, and 3.5 per cent
higher than in the same period a year ago.
About a third of this quarter-on-quarter growth was accounted for by the
coke, petrol and nuclear fuels sector, where production surged in the latest
quarter after a strong rise in the output of North Sea oil and gas. Output
rose 14.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year, compared with the
three months to March, when production in this sector was been relatively
slow.
The chemicals and man-made fibres sector also showed strong improvement  -
rising 1.8 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter -
fuelled by a strong performance from organic chemicals and pharmaceutical
companies.
Engineering companies performed well, with production rising 1.1 per cent in
the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter, and 4.1 per
cent compared with the same period a year ago.
The CSO said the fastest growth in the engineering sector occured in
information technology, with computer, electronic component and
telecommunications companies all reporting strong activity. Consequently
output in the electrical and optical sectors rose 3.1 per cent quarter on
quarter and 9.9 per cent year on year.
Economists welcomed the figures as indicating that the recovery in
manufacturing was becoming increasingly broad based and export driven.

FT  06 AUG 94 / An early start to next summer: The growing battle for record
sales of holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food poisoning in Minorca. Mould in the showers in Majorca. The tabloid
press this week had no difficulty filling its front pages with holiday
horrors, in spite of the lull in air traffic controllers' strikes.
But whatever the inconvenience, travel agents are expected this year to have
sold a record 9m summer holidays. This week they broke another record by
announcing discounts for next summer - the earliest price war anyone in the
industry can remember.
Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain, started last Tuesday with
discounts of 11 per cent on summer 1995 holidays. By yesterday it was
offering 15 per cent discounts. Going Places and Thomas Cook, the second and
third largest chains, also increased their top discounts to 15 per cent.
In spite of Lunn Poly's boast that it was 'giving away' over Pounds 25m in
discounts, the price cuts are not the undiluted boon to consumers that they
seem. Buyers still have to purchase the travel agent's own holiday
insurance.
Nevertheless, they do represent a considerable financial sacrifice by the
travel agents, which is why they will probably not continue for long.
Travel agents earn commissions of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on
each holiday. Offering a 15 per cent discount means losing the commission,
with the sale of travel insurance the only means of making any money.
Many argue there is little point in doing so this early. The traditional
time for launching a price war is late August or early September. Few people
are likely to book before they have taken this summer's holiday and more
than 3m of those people expected to take a summer holiday this year have not
yet left.
The reason for the early reductions lies not with the travel agents but with
the groups which own them. Lunn Poly is owned by Thomson, the largest tour
operator. Going Places is owned by Airtours, the second largest operator.
Tour operator profit margins are small. The top 30 tour operators' aggregate
pre-tax profits last year represented just 2.6 per cent of their turnover,
according to Civil Aviation Authority figures. This was lower than 1992 when
the margin was 2.8 per cent and 1991 when it was 3.8 per cent. But it was a
considerable improvement on 1989 when the profit margin was nought and 1987
when it was a 0.9 per cent loss.
Holiday prices this year have fallen again. The average price of a summer
holiday booked through Lunn Poly by the end of June was Pounds 353, compared
with Pounds 356 last year.
With profit margins so small, generating sales is crucial. There is evidence
that being first in the market can give tour operators a flying start,
increasing their market share. On the evidence of last year, however, that
increase is not easy to maintain.
Last year Thomson sent its summer 1994 brochures to travel agents in the
middle of August - before Airtours and Owners Abroad. By Christmas last year
Thomson's market share was 41 per cent, compared with 29.1 per cent at the
same time in 1992. Airtours' market share was down to 18.3 per cent at
Christmas from 20.6 per cent the year before. Owners Abroad fell to 9.5 per
cent from 15.8 per cent in 1992.
But by April and May this year Thomson fell to 27 per cent, Airtours fell to
16.3 per cent and Owners Abroad had risen to 11.6 per cent.
This week Thomson was out first again, but with a single family holiday
brochure rather than its full summer 1995 programme. Airtours responded with
its full programme.
Lunn Poly is offering discounts on all operators' holidays. Going Places and
Thomas Cook are, however, offering smaller discounts on Thomson holidays
than on packages from Airtours and Owners Abroad. Thomas Cook says this is
because Thomson will not pay a commission of more than 10 per cent. Going
Places says it offers top discounts only to those operators prepared to help
bear the cost.
Few will relish doing so for long. Travellers who want to be sure of
discounts should book soon.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Company insolvencies fall by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten per cent fewer companies in England and Wales failed in the second
quarter of the year than in the first three months in a further indication
of economic recovery, according to official figures released yesterday.
The seasonally adjusted number of company insolvencies for April to June was
4,077, compared with 4,513 in the first quarter.
This represents a decline of 12 per cent from the figure of 5,198 in the
second quarter of last year.
The figures are compiled by the Department of Trade and Industry's
Insolvency Service and published by the British Chambers of Commerce.
They show that 2 per cent of active companies became insolvent in the 12
months to June this year, down from 2.2 per cent when measured at the end of
the first quarter.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the chambers, said: 'This fall
is welcome news and because business order books are filling up and capacity
utilisation is rising, we have every reason to believe that the trend will
continue.'
He stressed, however, that one in 50 companies still failed every year and
that certain sectors such as retailing remained particularly badly affected.
The DTI figures show that the seasonally adjusted number of personal
insolvencies also fell slightly - by 1 per cent to 7,961 in the second
quarter of the year, compared with 8,096 in the first quarter. This
represents a decline of 10 per cent from 8,799 in the second quarter last
year.
Without seasonal adjust-ment there were 4,078 company insolvencies and 7,984
personal bankruptcies and individual voluntary arrangements in the second
quarter.
Separate figures released yesterday by the Lord Chancellor's department
echoed the trend of declining insol-vencies, with the number of company
winding-up petitions down 11 per cent to 3,504 in the second quarter
compared with the same period last year.
The number of creditors' petitions for winding up companies declined by 12
per cent to 6,447 over the same period while debtors' petitions for personal
bankruptcy fell 5 per cent to 3,418.
The figures are based on petitions lodged in the courts, not all of which
are ultimately granted. There may also be a considerable delay between the
petition and the resulting insolvency being recorded in official records.

FT  06 AUG 94 / R-R may buy Mercedes engines for new models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers engineering group subsidiary, is
discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from
Mercedes-Benz of Germany for use in future model programmes.
Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive and Vickers managing
director, operations, refused to confirm the specific talks with the German
carmaker, but said: 'We are in a number of discussions.'
Mercedes-Benz said that Rolls-Royce had approached it a year ago for talks
about engine supply for a new generation of products and said that
discussions were continuing.
Mr Ward said that Rolls-Royce was 'looking at a number of possibilities and
partners, but we are not yet close to reaching a conclusion'.
An eventual move by Rolls-Royce to purchase engines from Mercedes-Benz would
represent a significant departure for the company, which assembles its own
6.75 litre V8 engines at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire.
The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from an
original 6.25 litre V8 engine launched by the company in 1958, although the
engines have since been substantially updated.
Rolls-Royce says that its latest engine range meets worldwide emissions
standards to the year 2000.
The Mercedes-Benz 6 litre V12 was launched in 1991 in its S-Class model. It
produces about 8,500 V12 engines a year. Rolls-Royce and Bentley production
was 1,263 last year.
Rolls-Royce is seeking collaboration agreements with other carmakers to help
to finance the development of future model generations.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said earlier this year that
Rolls-Royce did not have the financial resources to develop a new model
generation alone. It planned to evolve the present models but would need
some form of partnership in the second half of the 1990s.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Rail union to consider return to negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting of the RMT transport union's executive on Monday is expected to
welcome Railtrack's willingness to improve its pay offer to signalling staff
by allowing up to half of a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement to be
included in the staff's basic rates.
This improvement would enable the signal workers, who have been in dispute
for the past eight weeks, to secure immediate basic pay rises of 4.7 per
cent. The union said last night that while this would not end the conflict
it would enable the union to return to the negotiating table.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, appealed yesterday to Mr Jimmy Knapp, the
union's general secretary, for five days of secret talks. If Mr Knapp was
not prepared to negotiate a final deal in these talks, Mr Horton said, he
should ballot his signalling staff again on the company's latest pay offer.
Mr Horton was in a more buoyant mood after this week's rejection of strike
action by supervisors. He wrote in a letter to Mr Knapp yesterday: 'Your
union has received a clear message that the time has come to end this
damaging and unnecessary dispute.'
The RMT leadership lost no time in rejecting his appeal for secret talks on
restructuring. Mr Knapp said the dispute was not about restructuring but
about a claim for a rise for past productivity.
He said: 'If Railtrack cannot grasp this eight weeks into the dispute, it is
little wonder no progress has been made towards a solution.' He added that
the union had proposed a joint working party to deal with restructuring and
agreed to ballot the signalling staff on the final deal. But the union
executive is also anxious to clarify Railtrack's willingness to improve its
interim offer.
In another letter, sent by Mr Horton to the union on Thursday, he explained
that Railtrack had told the conciliation service Acas that it was ready to
reshape its last pay offer so some of the proposed 6 per cent unconsolidated
supplement could be put into basic rates.
Railtrack managers have made it clear that they are 'prepared to go half
way' to meet the union and this means consolidating half the 6 per cent
supplement. But that suggestion has not been put in writing and this is what
the RMT executive will be seeking to clarify next week, before the 72 hours
of stoppages planned around next weekend.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Man bites midge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A pharmaceutical company is to launch a natural insect repellent for midges
after a retired Scottish professor of pathology noticed that the troublesome
insects avoided bog myrtle.
Professor Angus Stuart found that oil from the leaves of bog myrtle - one of
the least productive features of the Scottish highlands, and detailed on the
right in our picture - repelled the midges - magnified left - which can
drive people to distraction along the west coast of Scotland.
Bog myrtle grows all over northern Scotland in bogs and other places
unsuitable for grazing.
Prof Stuart, who lived on Skye after his retirement, took his idea to
Efamol, which makes drugs and dietary supplements based mainly on evening
primrose oil. After 3 1/2 years of research Efamol has applied for patents
on the oil extract, and is installing a pilot extraction plant on Skye. It
has just received a Pounds 25,000 grant from Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise.
It hopes to launch its product within about three years.
Efamol obtains bog myrtle oil from leaves collected in Skye bogs by crofters
but believes bog myrtle could eventually be grown in plantations and cropped
like tea.
Mr Iain Cloughley of Efamol says bog myrtle oil has shown itself effective
against several insects, including mosquitoes in Belize. Older people on
Skye recall using it against bed bugs, and laboratory work shows it kills
house mites and aphids.
He believes products based on bog myrtle, sold in roll-on form or in sprays,
should be more long-lasting and effective than synthetic repellents. 'The
oil contains so many different elements that midges may never get used to
it.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Database 'key to mad cow rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computerised data about cattle auctions could provide the key to farmers
trying to trace the history of their cows before they can export them,
according to Mr David Jones of Newline Systems, in Newton Abbot, Devon.
Rules introduced by European Union agriculture ministers two weeks ago mean
that before farmers can export carcasses to the Continent they must certify
that their cattle over six months old have never been in a herd with BSE.
The difficulties involved in providing this information mean that the export
market for carcass beef has in effect been closed to most farmers. This has
pushed livestock prices at cattle auctions around the country down by at
least 30 per cent.
Mr Jones, whose company provides a computerised system for cattle auctions,
said it would not be difficult to gather information from his database on
cattle transactions and merge it with other electronic auction data. This
would provide a record of the bulk of cattle sales across the country.
When cattle are traded their ear-tag number is recorded. Part of this number
relates to the farm selling the beast. Mr Jones said it would be a fairly
straightforward process to trace the homes of cattle going back 10 years:
'We have data from over 100 auctions in the country so we can create a fully
comprehensive record of animals' movements. It would be a godsend for many
farmers at the moment.'
Some farmers may face bankruptcy if they are unable to export beef carcasses
as a result of the change in the rules. Other producers, such as dairy
farmers, expect a sharp fall in their profits as they are unable to export
carcasses of old dairy or cull cows.
Mr Jones has offered access to his database to the government so that it
could be combined with the information held on BSE and offer it as a service
to farmers. He said: 'We were told that our system is two years in advance
of the Ministry of Agriculture and that there was nothing they could do
about it.' The agriculture ministry holds a record of BSE-affected farms but
cannot release names and addresses of farmers for fear of infringing data
protection laws. In addition, the ministry's computers for England, Scotland
and Wales are separate, making it difficult to trace cattle that have moved
between regions.
The ministry said yesterday that it was close to finding its own solution
for providing more information and was preparing an announcement. It is
looking into the legal implications of releasing more information from its
database.
Farmers are anxious to trace their animals' histories. Mr Martin Burtt, a
livestock farmer in north Yorkshire, said: 'It means lots of cattle can't be
certified by default because we can't get the tangible evidence that they
have not been in contact with BSE.'
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, will meet Mr
William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, on Monday to press for more
information and outline farmers' concerns about the new rules.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Mothers give backing to nurseries over playgroups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost half of mothers placing their children in playgroups would have
preferred them to attend a nursery school or a day nursery, according to a
government survey published yesterday.
The findings of the survey by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys
will add weight to demands for greater provision of nursery education.
There has been cross-party support for calls from educationalists to extend
nursery provision - with Labour committed to providing education for all 3-
and 4-year-olds.
The survey on the use of child day-care services in England was conducted
for the Department of Health in 1990. The aim was to find out what services
were used and how satisfied parents were with them. The highest level of
satisfaction was expressed by mothers of children attending nursery schools
and classes.
About four out of five of all pre-school children were looked after for some
part of the day by somebody other than their mother or father.
Of these about half mainly used services such as playgroups - which provide
structured part-time play - nursery schools, day nurseries and childminders.
The rest used informal care provided by relatives, friends or neighbours -
with grandparents re-garded as the most satisfac-tory carers in this
category.
Of all pre-school children, 15 per cent attended nursery school or a day
nursery and 21 per cent attended playgroups.
A greater proportion of children of lone parents were looked after by
relatives, friends, neighbours and childminders than children in two-parent
families.
The survey also covered schoolchildren aged under eight. Two-thirds of
schoolchildren went straight home after school. The proportion decreased
with age, from 73 per cent of four-year-olds to 58 per cent of 7-year-olds.
Many of these children went to somebody else's home after school.

Lord Palumbo, the former Arts Council chairman, yesterday failed in an
attempt to block the legal action brought against him by two of his children
in a dispute over the family's Pounds 70m trust fund.
His two eldest children - Mr James Palumbo and Mrs Annabella Adams - are
suing him to recover some of the fund's assets which they claim were wrongly
paid out. They are also seeking the removal of Lord and Lady Palumbo as
trustees of the fund.
Lord Palumbo earlier this week sought a High Court order for the action to
be struck out. However, following a five day hearing, Mr Justice Rattee
ruled there was a case to go to a full hearing and dismissed his
application.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will announce the
results of his review of electricity price controls on Thursday, his office
said yesterday.
The review is expected to result in electricity price cuts in 1995-96, and
tighter controls on price increases thereafter. The year-long review affects
the price of distributing electricity. This accounts for the main part of
household bills.
Although electricity costs have stabilised and even started to fall in some
areas, high prices, profits and salaries have attracted much criticism.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Broker admits error over sacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The solicitor for a City broker accused of unfairly dismissing a woman
broker who is also claiming sexual discrimination, yesterday admitted that
the company was wrong not to give her a written explanation of the
allegations made against her.
Mr Philip Parish, representing Willis Corroon, told an industrial tribunal
in Croydon, south London, that the company should have told Miss Samantha
Phillips, an aviation broker, that the meeting at which she was suspended
was a disciplinary hearing. The company should also have given her a right
of appeal.
Miss Phillips has claimed she was dismissed because she rebuffed the
advances of Mr Giles Wilkinson, head of production at Willis Corroon. He
allegedly interrupted a business trip in 1992 to join her in Denmark.
Mr Jeremy Flaxman, a senior manager at Willis Corroon, said Miss Phillips
was 'prone to sensitivity on a number of issues'. He said he did not believe
that Miss Phillips' complaints about Mr Wilkinson amounted to sexual
harassment. Mr Wilkinson has denied her allegations.
The company sacked Miss Phillips in 1992 for gross misconduct. Mr Flaxman
said Miss Phillips was fired because she allegedly lied to LA Hudson, the
underwriter, about insurance cover that her company was seeking to set up
for another client.
Mr Flaxman said: 'I felt her refusal to admit that she had lied meant we
were losing total confidence in her integrity.'
Mr Paul Rogers, former Willis Corroon divisional director, said Miss
Phillips 'had a number of problems in so far as time keeping, attitude to
work, and unwillingness to carry out instructions in the fashion I would
have like her to'.
He added: 'I've never heard any suggestive remark made by Giles Wilkinson.'
Miss Phillips has claimed that Mr Wilkinson persecuted her and referred to
her as a 'bimbo' in front of colleagues at a high-level meeting.
The hearing continues on Wednesday.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Independent lifts circulation 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent newspaper said yesterday that its circulation had increased
by up to 45,000 copies, or 18 per cent, in the first three days after it cut
its cover price from 50p to 30p.
The Independent imposed the temporary cut on Monday, in response to the
Daily Telegraph's week-day price reduction from 48p to 30p in June -
followed immediately by The Times' reduction from 30p to 20p. The move could
cost The Independent the equivalent of Pounds 14m a year in revenue.
Mr Ian Jack, editor of the Independent on Sunday and acting editor of the
daily paper, said sales had increased from slightly above 240,000 copies a
day in late July to well above 280,000 this week. Mr Jack said: 'We were
ahead by between 16 per cent and 18 per cent on Monday and Tuesday, although
we were down slightly on Wednesday because of the rail strike.'
His claims were backed by WH Smith, the UK's largest newspaper distributor,
which said sales of The Independent were up about 16 per cent or 17 per
cent. Another distributor reported increases of between 16 per cent and 19
per cent from Monday to Wednesday.
The distributors said that no single paper had been particularly badly
affected by The Independent's circulation increase, with sales of all other
national broadsheets down by between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent. WH Smith
said: 'The price cuts have probably caused some quality newspaper buyers to
start buying more than one paper a day.'
The Independent's increase puts it only slightly above the circulation of
277,000 it was achieving in June before its rivals cut their prices, and is
below its 346,000 daily sales in the six months to June 1993.
The Times would not give figures for this week but Mr Alasdair MacLeod,
marketing manager, said there was 'absolutely no evidence that The
Independent has taken readers from The Times'.
Mr Jeremy Deedes, editorial director of the Daily Telegraph, said he did not
have circulation figures for this week. He said any rise at The Independent
was more likely to affect The Guardian and The Times than the Daily
Telegraph.
Mr Deedes added that The Times and The Independent could not trade
profitably at their new prices, although the Daily Telegraph could make a
profit at 30p. 'But we have no wish to continue at this level,' he added.
'It was Mr Murdoch who began the price-cutting.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Hopes improve for IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments have not ruled out the prospect of an
imminent IRA ceasefire in spite of Sinn Fein's rejection of the Downing
Street declaration and a subsequent upsurge in sectarian killings.
Officials think a ceasefire declaration might be made in the period between
the 25th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in Ulster on August
14 and the first post-summer meeting of the British cabinet in September.
Such a move would increase pressure on the government to admit Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, into talks on the province's future while falling
short of London's demands for a permanent cessation of violence.
The Irish cabinet is due to hold its first meeting after the holidays on
August 31.
It is thought that even if the ceasefire was not time-limited, the IRA would
reserve the right to retaliation for attacks on its members.
Loyalist paramilitaries are said to be in no mood to call a halt to their
armed campaign after the recent IRA killings of two men identified as
leaders of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an outlawed Loyalist group.
Loyalist violence in the province continued yesterday when police found a
body which the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force said it had dumped on the
outskirts of Belfast. The UVF said the man had been shot for passing
information to the IRA.
Although Whitehall officials remain guarded about the chances of a
breakthrough, their assessment of the situation is less gloomy than two
weeks ago, when Sinn Fein's dismissal of the joint declaration as inadequate
was greeted with anger.
Senior Irish officials are understood to have contacted London in the
aftermath of the Sinn Fein conference at which its response was decided to
advise that the position was not as bleak as portrayed and to urge
restraint.
Recent days have brought a series of cautious but generally upbeat comments
by Sinn Fein leaders, culminating in Mr Gerry Adams's disclosure that he had
discussed a ceasefire with the IRA before the Letterkenny meeting. Mr Adams,
the Sinn Fein president, said the peace process remained 'firmly on the
tracks' and would not be derailed.
London has used the period since the Sinn Fein conference to try to press
ahead with the search for a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Talks offer few clues to Pyongyang stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
High-level talks between the US and North Korea resumed yesterday in a fresh
attempt to persuade Pyongyang to put its suspected nuclear programme under
full international safeguards. The talks, suspended a month ago after the
death of North Korea's president, Kim Il-sung, are expected to last a week
or more.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state, and Mr Kang Sok-ju,
North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, said their initial eight hours
of talks at the US mission in Geneva had been 'businesslike and intensive'.
The talks have been adjourned until Monday to allow the delegations to
consult their respective capitals.
Yesterday's encounter was seen as offering the first pointer towards any
shift in North Korean foreign policy following the assumption to power of Mr
Kim Jong-il, the late president's son. However, speaking to journalists
after the meeting, Mr Gallucci refused to be drawn on whether Mr Kang had
indicated any change in Pyongyang's stance.
The US is said to be offering diplomatic recognition and economic aid in
return for North Korea's agreement to reveal details of its nuclear
activities and to comply with international inspections under the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Before leaving Washington for Geneva, Mr Gallucci said he expected the talks
to be 'broad', 'thorough' and aimed at reaching 'an overall settlement' of
outstanding issues. Apart from the nuclear issue, the talks would cover
political, economic and trade relations, he said.
Mr Gallucci's first priority, though, is to find a solution to the problem
of the 8,000-odd spent fuel rods from North Korea's only operational nuclear
reactor which are now decaying in a holding pond at the Yongbyon nuclear
complex north of Pyongyang.
The rods were removed from the reactor in May without international
supervision, sparking fears that North Korea intends to reprocess the fuel
to make nuclear bombs. In June, after mediation by Mr Jimmy Carter, the
former US president, Pyongyang agreed to 'freeze' its nuclear activities in
return for new US talks.
However, North Korea says it will have to start reprocessing the spent fuel
at the end of this month, when the rods could begin to pose a radiation
hazard. Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna
confirmed yesterday that the rod casings are of a type susceptible to
corrosion which would allow radioactive material to leak into the pond.
They said the casing housing the uranium was made of a magnesium metal alloy
prone to corrosion under water. The rapidity of the corrosion depended on
the temperature and the state of the water.
The only solutions were either to remove the rods into dry storage, thereby
halting any further damage, or to reprocess the fuel as soon as possible.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Stronger yen helps boost Japan surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's current account surplus widened in June to Dollars 11.1bn (Pounds
7.1bn), up 4.7 per cent on a year earlier, according to preliminary figures
released yesterday by the Finance Ministry. In the first six months of the
year the surplus was up 2.2 per cent at Dollars 68.8bn, the highest figure
on record.
But the increase was smaller than financial markets had been expecting and
the longer term trend suggests the surplus might have peaked. In the three
months to the end of June the seasonally adjusted surplus rose by just 1.2
per cent against the previous three months.
A sharp increase in the merchandise trade surplus was offset by a deficit on
the services balance. Ministry of Finance officials said special factors,
such as intensive shipping exports, had helped push the trade surplus
higher. Exports increased by 9.4 per cent in June against a year earlier
while imports rose by 6.5 per cent.
But the balance on services slipped into the red to the tune of Dollars
1.6bn, the largest deficit in a year, largely because of a fall in
investment income caused by the repatriation of overseas assets by Japanese
companies.
The overall increase in the current account surplus owed much to the
strengthening yen, as prices of exports rose with the value of the Japanese
currency and import prices fell.
Measured in yen terms, the increase in June's current account surplus was
just 0.2 per cent. In the first six months of the year, exports decreased by
0.9 per cent in volume while imports grew by 10.4 per cent.
Analysts pointed to the yen figures as evidence that the huge surplus, the
cause of much trade friction between the US and Japan, is finally peaking.
'We seem to be at or near the peak of the current account surplus,' said Mr
Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. 'The
strong currency might produce another month or two of increases, but in the
longer term the surplus is headed downwards.'

FT  06 AUG 94 / Mahathir opens high-risk crusade against Islamic sect: The
Al Arqam dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Entering the Kuala Lumpur headquarters of Al Arqam, an Islamic sect founded
in Malaysia in the late 1960s and which claims more than 100,000 followers
at home and abroad, is like walking into another century.
Men are dressed in flowing khaki robes and turbans, in imitation of a style
said to have been favoured during the time of the prophet Mohammed. Women
are draped in the black hijab, a familiar sight in many parts of the Middle
East but rare in Malaysia, a country which prides itself on its religious
and racial diversity. The sound of children chanting verses from the Koran
comes from the Al Arqam school in the sprawling, five-acre compound.
According to the Malaysian authorities, this tranquil scene hides an
altogether darker reality. Yesterday, most of Al Arqam's activities were
labelled as 'deviationist' by Malaysia's National Fatwa council, the body
that rules on Islamic orthodoxy, and the government pledged to use a battery
of laws to stop Al Arqam's proselytising activities. More than 200 schools
run by the sect throughout Malaysia will be closed down and Al Arqam members
could be liable to imprisonment without trial under the terms of Malaysia's
wide-ranging internal security act.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has described Al Arqam as 'a
threat to national security'. Yesterday the group filed a defamation suit
against the government for accusing it of raising a private army.
The government seems intent on doing battle with the sect. 'They are the
biggest threat faced by the government since the communists,' a senior
government official said yesterday. Malaysia has lobbied other countries in
the region to take action against the group.
Quite why Dr Mahathir's government has taken such a sudden dislike to Al
Arqam is far from clear.
Over the years it has been tolerated and at times encouraged by the
authorities. Al Arqam (the name is derived from the house from which
Mohammed is said to have spread his teachings) promotes a mystical path to
Islam, in which a movement will rise in the East to hail the return of a
messiah who will lead an Islamic revival. Members live relatively
unobtrusively, mostly in a series of communes spread throughout Malaysia.
The sect believes in strict adherence to Islamic principles in which, among
other things, polygamy is encouraged. Al Arqam's founder and leader, Ashaari
Muhammad, exercises influence over every aspect of the sect's activities;
all members wear badges bearing his portrait.
An Al Arqam media centre gives out lavishly produced books of Mr Ashaari's
teachings. Video cassettes promote his views while Al Arqam musical groups
have produced record albums on similar themes. Mr Ashaari has lived in
self-imposed exile in Thailand since 1988 but is now believed to have gone
with a large number of his followers to Jordan.
The catalyst of official concern could have have been the arrest of 19
Malaysian Al Arqam members at a Moslem fundamentalist demonstration in Cairo
in April. About 55 per cent of Malaysia's 19m people are Moslem Malays.
For several years the government has been worried over Malays going abroad
to study coming under the influence of militant Islamic groups, most of them
on government scholarships. Serious tensions could arise in multicultural
Malaysia if such fiery brands of Islam took hold.
Some feel that Dr Mahathir sees Al Arqam as a potential political threat. Mr
Ashaari ruffled official feathers recently when he is reported to have said
that he was a more popular figure in Malaysia than Dr Mahathir.
General elections will probably be held in Malaysia later this year or early
next. Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (Umno) is unlikely
to lose its tight grip on power but some Malays feel that, in the rush to
modernise, the government has not paid enough attention to things spiritual.
There is concern within Umno that some members, once party stalwarts, have
recently decided to join the ranks of Al Arqam.
The fundamentalist Parti Islam (PAS), based in the northern state of
Kelantan, appeals to the poorer, rural voters. Of more concern is a movement
like Al Arqam whose followers come mainly from the urban-based
intelligentsia, many of who hold senior positions in the civil service, the
police and the armed forces.
Dr Mahathir will have to tread carefully in acting against the sect: any
rigorous action could send shockwaves through the Malay community. A
relatively tranquil political atmosphere has been one of the key elements in
attracting foreign investment to Malaysia, a central part of the country's
economic success.
Al Arqam has considerable economic clout. It has not allowed its brand of
Islam to stand in the way of building a business empire which includes
livestock, food processing, retail outlets, restaurants and clothing
businesses both in Malaysia and the region. Mr Hashim Jaafar, an Al Arqam
spokesman, says the sect has commercial assets of Dollars 100m (Pounds
64.5m). The sect denies having political ambitions.
Mr Hashim claims Dr Mahathir fears the influence of his group which he says
has established schools, hospitals and shops distributing services to 'the
masses'. He adds that Dr Mahathir is also creating a climate of fear in
advance of the elections. 'He is trying to create a monster in order to win
the support of non-Moslems', he says.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of five reformist opposition groups in the Japanese parliament
yesterday agreed in principle to form a single party aimed at regaining
power from the old-guard coalition which won office last month.
They plan to choose a name and resolve policy issues before the Diet meets
again in September.
The five include three former prime ministers - Mr Morihiro Hosokawa of the
Japan New party, who headed a seven-member coalition formed a year ago, his
successor Mr Tsutomu Hata of the Japan Renewal party, and Mr Toshiki Kaifu.
Mr Kaifu, the most recent of the three to have defected from the right-wing
Liberal Democratic party, which ran Japan for 47 years until last summer,
served as LDP premier in 1989-91.
For the past month Mr Kaifu has sat as an independent but has formed a
parliamentary grouping called Koshi Kai. His former party is back in
government in alliance with the Social Democratic party, the LDP's
traditional rival, and the New Harbinger party, which had been a member of
the previous two ruling coalitions. The other two members of the nascent
political force are Mr Koshiro Ishida's Buddhist-backed Komeito, the clean
government party, and Mr Takashi Yonezawa's Democratic Socialist party.
Mr Yonezawa said last night it would take time to build consensus on policy
issues and form a solid organisation. His party has at various times been
close both to the SDP and the LDP.
Together the five would have some 188 seats in the present 511-seat Diet.
However, the next general election is likely to be fought on redrawn
boundaries and with greater use of proportional representation. A government
advisory panel is due next week to present proposals to Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, the SDP prime minister, on a new electoral map for the country.
Mr Hata said last night the new party 'needs to be strong in order to rival
the LDP'. But one main motive for a formal merger is that under the new
system big parties will qualify for an exponentially larger amount of state
funds for campaigning than would be accorded to smaller groups.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Samsung to launch Ricoh countersuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung Electronics said yesterday it plans to file a countersuit soon
against Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment maker, in an escalating legal
battle over patent rights on facsimile machines that could affect the
companies' sales in the US.
The announcement by Samsung, South Korea's largest electronics company,
follows a patent infringement suit filed with the US International Trade
Commission against it by Ricoh on Monday.
The Samsung suit, which will be filed with the ITC or in a US district
court, will claim that Ricoh has infringed at least two of the Korean
company's patents on circuit systems that control the operation of facsimile
machines.
Samsung dismissed charges by Ricoh that it violated two patent rights. 'The
technology claimed by Ricoh was developed by other facsimile equipment
makers earlier than its use by Ricoh,' a Samsung official said.
'The patent infringement claimed by Ricoh concerns only a minor part of fax
machine technology, while we claim that Ricoh has infringed on patents that
represent a major part of the technology,' he said.
Some analysts believe Ricoh filed the suit, which would prevent Samsung
selling facsimile machines with the disputed technology in the US, in an
attempt to protect its market share.
Samsung will seek an injunction against all Ricoh's facsimile machines sold
in the US and will seek monetary damages for patent infringement, which
mirror the penalties being sought by Ricoh.
The Korean company claimed that independent examinations conducted in the US
confirmed Ricoh had used Samsung technology in its facsimile machines.
The former president of Korea Electric Power (Kepco), South Korea's
state-owned electricity monopoly, has been arrested on charges of accepting
bribes involving an order for Canadian nuclear reactors.
Mr Ahn Byong-wha, who is also a former trade and industry minister, is
accused of accepting Won200m (Pounds 161,000) from the Korean agent for
Atomic Energy of Canada, which supplied three nuclear reactors to Kepco.
Mr Ahn allegedly demanded the money in an attempt to bribe other government
officials to extend his term as Kepco president, which lasted from 1989 to
March 1993.
He fled to the US last year when prosecutors began investigating bribes
charges but later returned to Korea.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Minister apologises over Bombay scandal report: Singh seeks
to lure opposition back to parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, yesterday apologised for
words used to describe a parliamentary report on the 1992 Bombay securities
scandal, in a bid to end the opposition's boycott of parliament.
Mr Singh withdrew the words 'unwarranted' and 'unfair' that he said his
ministry had used inadvertently to describe parliament's criticism of the
government over the Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 820m) scandal.
Opposition leaders said the report was a cover-up of the government's role
in the scandal, and has boycotted parliament for the remainder of the
session, until August 26, after the demand that the report be withdrawn was
not met.
Apologising for the 'lapse' which he said was 'entirely unintentional,' the
finance minister said it was never his government's intention to reject the
committee's report or to show any disrespect to the committee.
It was not immediately clear whether Mr Singh's apology will be enough to
tempt the opposition back to parliament. It accused Prime Minister P V
Narasimha Rao of reneging on his promise to punish all those responsible for
the scandal.
Bankers and brokers were accused of colluding to siphon money illegally from
the inter-bank market in government securities to invest on the booming
Bombay stock exchange.
The government's enforcement directorate, perhaps to prove that action is
being taken, yesterday filed a criminal complaint for violations under the
Foreign Exchange Regulations Act against Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker
at the heart of the scandal. The complaint could lead to Mr Mehta's
rearrest; he is already facing charges of fraud, and of breaking bank and
stock market regulations.
Complaints were also filed against his brother Mr Sudhir Mehta, Mr R
Sitaraman, assistant manager of the State Bank of India in charge of
treasury operations at the time of the scandal, and his wife Mrs Meera
Sitaraman.
India's Home Minister Shankarrao Chavan yesterday accused Pakistan of
conspiring with Moslem militants blamed for bomb blasts that killed 260
people in Bombay last year and said there was evidence the extremists passed
through Dubai and Thailand, Reuter adds from Bombay.

FT  06 AUG 94 / IG Metall leader calls for pay rise above inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leader of Germany's powerful IG Metall trade union opened the 1995 pay
round yesterday with a demand for a fair share of the benefits from an
economic recovery 'built on the backs of the workers'.
Mr Klaus Zwickel said the engineering and metalworkers' union would be
seeking a settlement above the rate of inflation which also took into
account significant increases in productivity.
The past three years of real pay cuts were enough, he said in an interview
with the mass-circulation daily, Bild. 'We must put an end to this now,' he
said.
Making his first public contribution to the federal election campaign, Mr
Zwickel added that well-off individuals and companies should pay a 'justice
levy' to fund social and environmental work projects which would help close
the gap between rich and poor.
'We need a government which is ready to squeeze the rich to fight poverty,'
he said.
Although engineering pay negotiations are not due to start until the end of
the year, the interview prodded the political and industrial opposition into
instant rejection.
Mr Klaus Bregger, a Christian Democrat lobbyist for independent businesses,
said the proposal was completely wrong for the current circumstances. Mr
Tyll Necker, president of the federation of German industry, said companies
already faced extra payroll tax charges, higher health insurance premiums
and insurance taxes in 1995. Further charges would endanger jobs, he said.
Yesterday's brief skirmish marked the start of an annual position-taking
ritual preceding formal negotiations.
Mr Zwickel's demands suggest that while last year's campaign foundered in
the recession, the union had been emboldened by mounting indications that
economic recovery was under way.
Earlier this week unexpectedly high manufacturing orders and a sharp fall in
July unemployment prompted economists to start revising their economic
growth forecasts for this year and next.
Despite the moderation of Mr Zwickel's tone, the interview will put
government, companies and the Bundesbank on the alert for a potentially
testing time over the winter.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Milosevic blocks traffic to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lines of lorries sat on the Bosnian-Serbian border yesterday, in the first
sign that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic may be serious about cutting
political and economic links with the Bosnian Serbs.
The northernmost crossing at Sremska Raca, usually busy with traffic from
Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia, had all but seized up yesterday
morning.
Truck drivers on the Serbian side complained of long delays and a lack of
information about the new rules. One man, fuming after 18 hours at the
border, was carrying a cargo of used school textbooks donated by the Serbian
Red Cross. The books were destined for refugees in Serb-held north-western
Bosnia. 'The west's goal is to pit Serb against Serb,' he said of the
announcement that Belgrade intended to impose its own sanctions against the
Bosnian Serbs. 'And Milosevic fell for it.'
The Serbian police refused to give details of the new orders and an air of
confusion hung over the hot, dusty crossing. Drivers said loaded trucks were
being let out of Bosnia but only empty ones were being let back in.
Many of the private cars leaving Bosnia had German and Austrian licence
plates, suggesting that those Serbs who had other places to go to were
leaving while they could.
Further south, at Zvornik, Bosnian Serb police reported less traffic
crossing the river but expressed some of the same defiance that has typified
the recent proceedings of the Bosnian Serb assembly in Pale.
The Yugoslav Serbs 'were never our friends anyway,' said one officer. 'But
we have our state and we don't need them.'
There were other signs of the clampdown yesterday but officials avoided
being drawn on the details. In Belgrade, radio and television reports rarely
mentioned the border closing or the cut telephone lines. Mr Milosevic seems
more eager to convince the west - and less keen to risk his domestic
standing by openly isolating Serbs in Bosnia.
The Serbian president made similar threats last year, when the Bosnian Serb
self-declared parliament flouted the Vance-Owen peace plan. But the UN was
not permitted to monitor the 48 border crossings, and aid continued to flow
across the historic River Drina.
This time, the test will be whether monitors will be allowed on the ground
and whether arms and, as important, oil does not get across. 'The key thing
is to see how serious Milosevic is in cutting links,' said Dr Mats Berdal of
the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
But the Serbs, under intense economic pressure, have less room for manoeuvre
than last year and, Belgrade analysts note, Mr Milosevic may be eager to
force out the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and bring in the
so-far conspicuously quiet army leader, Mr Ratko Mladic.

Cambodia's national assembly has passed a long awaited investment law, but
businessmen and others said yesterday it was unlikely to bring a rush of
investment even though it was a boost for the economic climate. The assembly
approved the law after months of wrangling between competing interests in
the administration and extensive redrafting of the bill. Profits are
tax-exempt for eight years. Imported construction materials, equipment, raw
materials and half-finished goods are all duty-free for various categories
of ventures, including those which export 80 per cent of output. Investments
in tourism, in labour-intensive industries, infrastructure and energy are
also eligible for tax incentives.

The Ecuadorian government announced the sale of a 75 per cent share in the
state airline, Ecuatoriana, following nearly a year of indecision that left
the financially troubled airline grounded. The government has now pledged to
assume the airline's debt portfolio, which exceeds Dollars 100m. The
transformation into a stock company will take place in weeks. Ecuatoriana's
routes to destinations throughout North and South America may attract
investors. The only remaining company-owned aircraft was confiscated by
creditors nearly eight months ago and since then has been stranded in
Panama. Nearly all the airline's staff had been sacked, leaving only some 50
employees.

A military transport aircraft crashed yesterday morning in Siberia, killing
all 47 passengers, in Russia's third aviation disaster this year. The crash,
which brings the death toll in Russian skies this year to 270, offered a
bleak rebuttal to assertions by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday
that Russian aircraft are as safe as western ones. The Antonov-12
transporter crashed while coming to land at the Boda military airport near
the Chinese border. This year's other two big crashes were of civilian
aircraft, but yesterday's accident suggests that safety and maintenance
standards have also plummeted in the traditionally more elite world of
military aviation.

car components industry, and TRW is seeking to increase rapidly its
production capacity in Europe. The US group has invested more than Dollars
750m to develop its airbag operations in North America and Europe with its
main European airbag engineering and manufacturing operations at Altdorf,
Germany. It has also established a facility for sewing airbags at

France yesterday detained nine Algerian Moslem fundamentalists in a
demonstration of its tough stance following this week's attack on an embassy
building in Algiers in which five French police and consular officials died.
The radical Armed Islamic Group claimed responsibility for the attack, the
latest in a campaign against foreigners, which is aimed at destabilising the
military-led Algerian government. Yesterday's detentions, ordered by Mr
Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, came as France sought to pressure
western partners, including the US, Germany and Britain, into taking
stronger action against Algerian Moslem militants on their soil. The nine
fundamentalists, arrested in a dawn roundup, were interned at a disused army
barracks and six were served with expulsion orders. Seven other suspected
fundamentalists had previously been detained. Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, condemned religious fundamentalism at a ceremony for
the five French victims. 'An ideology cannot be built on hatred. One does
not serve religion by mixing it with terrorism,' he said.

<TEXT>
The Russian government prepared yesterday to tackle the mounting
inter-enterprise debt which threatens to jeopardise the nation's fragile
economic stabilisation. Officials announced yesterday that the president and
cabinet were preparing five decrees to deal with the issue and a special
commission, chaired by Mr Oleg Soskovets, a deputy prime minister, and
including two other deputy prime ministers and the chairman of the central
bank, was formed to address the problem. Mr Soskovets, who is to report
weekly on the work of the committee to the president and prime minister,
said the issue of inter-enterprise debt was so serious that 'it must be
resolved without a single minute of delay'. Mounting inter-enterprise debt,
which has appeared in many of the countries moving from communism to the
market, has emerged in Russia because the government's relatively tight
fiscal and monetary policies have not been matched by restructuring of large
enterprises. Unable to obtain the soft state credits upon which they have
traditionally relied, Russian factories have simply lent one another money,
or shipped goods without being paid. By doing so, they have created a
byzantine web of inter-enterprise debt which now threatens to paralyse the
economy.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Fishing wars highlight EU policy strains

</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Fish wars raged across European waters yesterday as the dispute between
Spanish and British tuna fishermen continued in the Bay of Biscay and Norway
accused the crew of an Icelandic trawler of shooting at Norwegian
coastguards.
The disputes centre on access to jealously-guarded fish stocks and highlight
the problems faced by the European Union in running a common fishing policy.
Spanish fishermen have been attacking British boats which they claim are
using drift nets longer than the EU limit of 2.5km to catch tuna. Yesterday
the Royal Navy boarded a Cornish trawler which was suspected of breaking the
rules and confiscated its nets.
Spain will call for an outright ban on drift nets by trawlers when EU
agriculture and fisheries ministers meet in council on September 28.
'We will ask for an immediate and total prohibition,' Mr Rafael Conde,
director general for fishing resources, said yesterday. 'This is something
we have always pressed for and we are backed by a Commission report which
says drift nets should be phased out over the next four years.'
In Norway, officials said the shooting incident occurred in a long-running
row over cod-fishing rights in arctic waters, when coastguards attempted to
cut the nets of the Icelandic trawler Havganur 2 from Svalbard.
Icelandic fishermen, forced to seek new fishing grounds by diminishing
stocks in home waters, want cod quotas in areas around the
Norwegian-controlled Svalbard islands and in the so-called 'loophole', a
62,400 sq km protected zone managed by Norway and Russia where arctic cod
spawn.
Norway believes tight control over cod stocks in the Barents sea is
necessary to protect stocks in waters further south.
The European Commission says emotional disputes over fishing rights are
inevitable because fish respect no borders and the need to conserve stocks
means that quotas must be imposed.
The Spanish fishermen who use traditional rods and lines to land their tuna
are angry that the British, French and Irish trawlers are able to scoop up
much bigger catches with drift nets.
Spanish fishing authorities say that drift nets of any size constitute an
ecological disaster as they are beginning to pose a serious threat to the
tuna population. But British fishermen suspect their motives.
'This is not a dispute over net size, but about access to those waters,'
said Mr Richard Banks, chief executive of the National Federation of
Fishermens' Organisations.
The atmosphere in the Bay of Biscay was tense yesterday with at least five
British and Irish trawlers opting to return to their home ports to escape
the skirmishes. Last month the Spanish fleet clashed with French trawlers
and blocked Spain's northern ports to force Madrid to take firm action
against drift nets.
Fishing disputes are likely to increase as Spain is fully integrated into EU
fishing policy at the end of next year and Norway joins the EU, which aims
to guarantee access for all member countries to all waters subject to
conservation measures.
Since drift nets came into use at the end of the 1980s the volume of tuna
caught in the Bay of Biscay has doubled.

FT  06 AUG 94 / EU set for clash on Gatt ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's smaller member states look set for a clash with the
bigger ones over the basis on which the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade's Uruguay Round trade liberalisation accord is ratified.
The row centres on whether the European Commission should persist with its
request to the European Court of Justice for an opinion on where legal
competences lie in matters covered by Gatt.
The court has been asked to clarify those areas where competence lies with
the Commission and those where it rests with the member states, and to
identify any grey areas. It is expected to give its views towards the end of
the year, which would not leave much time for ratification of the accord
before the deadline of January 1 for establishment of the World Trade
Organisation, Gatt's successor.
The Commission has said it is willing to consider a code of conduct for
member states, which might act as an alternative to the opinion of the
court, in order to meet this deadline.
'There is a possibility that the US will ratify on time and that the
Japanese will do so too. It would be unfortunate if they got there on time
and the Community didn't,' said a senior Commission official yesterday.
However, smaller countries are insisting it would be foolish to proceed with
ratification, even under the aegis of a code of conduct, without a proper
legal basis provided by the European court.
The Belgian government has said that if the Commission withdraws its request
for advice from the court, it would itself seek an opinion.
The split between the countries is reflected in an apparent division within
the Commission over what the position of Europe's executive body should be.
Some commission sources suspect the Union's more powerful members - notably
France, Germany and the UK - are trying to persuade the Commission to
withdraw its proceedings in the court, as they fear the judges will
attribute trade competences to the Commission rather than to the member
states. This would come at a time when all three countries are becoming wary
of integrationist tendencies.
Other Commission sources say Brussels is waiting until September to see what
the German presidency produces as a proposed code of conduct.
'The reality is that unless they produce something worthwhile, we will not
consider dropping the court case,' said a Commission official. 'If on the
other hand they come up with something that is acceptable to the Commission,
then we will withdraw.'
The other problem is that the Council of Ministers has not yet responded to
the European Parliament's request for the text of the Gatt agreement so that
it may begin work on ratification.
The Commission has proposed proceeding under Article 228 of the Maastricht

ratification. The council is unhappy with this proposal, but has yet to
decide on which legal basis to proceed with the parliament.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Ozone alarms bring autobahn miracle: For German drivers
hurtling towards the next jam, times are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be merely midsummer madness, a by-product of the heatwave sweltering
over the European continent, but something seems to have snapped in the
German soul.
That ultimate symbol of German success, the motorway maniac with his halogen
headlights scorching down the autobahn at 220kph, appears to have slowed
down - voluntarily.
In the state of Hesse, home of the Bundesbank and the Frankfurt financiers,
a few fluttering banners strung yesterday across the six-lane highways
leading to the hills said: 'Ozone alarm: 80 kph'. To universal amazement,
four out of five drivers obeyed.
Environmentalists have seized on this extraordinary success to demand the
ultimate heresy: a universal speed limit on the German roads.
The opposition Social Democrats have U-turned party policy, overruling fears
of a backlash from the voters, and calling for a maximum 130kph.
The country is torn. For two of the touchstones of the German identity have
been thrown into open conflict: panic about the environment, and the
absolute determination to drive down the autobahn as fast as one physically
can.
The irony is that half the time one physically can't. For the wonderful
German autobahn system is grinding to a halt in interminable traffic jams
every weekend, as the population indulges in the national religion of
heading for the hills, the sea, or the woods - anywhere but home.
'That's part of the problem,' says Paul Schumacher, political editor of RTL
television, who drives a large Mercedes to work and a convertible Rolls
Royce for pleasure. 'If the German motorist has to spend half his life in a
jam, he demands the right to spend the rest of his time driving flat out.'
He admits to speeding up the unregulated autobahn from Bonn to Cologne at
around 200 kph and being regularly overtaken by five or six drivers going
faster. 'At 180, you had better drive in the slow lane,' he says.
That was before this summer's ozone alarms. Parents are refusing to let
their children play in the playgrounds. The city of Cologne has banned its
schools from organising outdoor sports. Hesse is only the first of a string
of states expected to impose autobahn speed limits whenever ozone levels
rise over 180 micrograms per cubic metre of air.
Predictably, the motoring lobby is up in arms. 'Short- term speed limits
have no, or very marginal, effects on ozone levels,' says the ADAC
motorists' club.
Yet even the ADAC admits that its own members are split 50:50 for and
against a national speed limit. So why do half of them want to drive so
fast?
'I think you will have to ask a traffic psychologist,' says Mr Maximilian
Maurer, a spokesman for the ADAC in Munich. 'If people have a car that goes
at 200, and the open autobahn in front of them, they can't see why they
shouldn't drive that fast. But the real reason is more deep-seated. It is
something emotional for us.'
But German motorists don't only love speeding. They appear to love their
traffic jams, too. And they last not just for hours but, at peak holiday
periods, for days.
The ADAC has a team of so-called 'traffic jam consultants' touring the
autobahns on motorcycles, bringing succour to the benighted motorist.
'Most motorists are much better equipped for jams these days than when I
started,' one of the old hands said on TV yesterday. 'They bring enough
bottles of water, and cool-bags of food, too. They bring games for their
children to play.
'There's also a problem if you need to go to the lavatory. We advise every
motorist to carry a folding spade, for emergencies.'
It is all an admirable example of Germany's extraordinary thoroughness. And
that, says the ADAC, is also why Germany doesn't need any universal speed
limit.
'They have them in other countries, like Italy,' says Mr Maurer, 'but they
simply don't obey them. We would be very law abiding.'
There is something called a 'recommended maximum speed' on German autobahns
of 130 kph, but it has no penal provisions. A recent court ruling said it
should be taken into account when assessing liability in accidents.
Has it had any effect on the speed merchants? 'Absolutely none, as far as we
can tell,' says Mr Maurer. Only the ozone alarm can do that.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Nato jets strike at Bosnian Serbs: More attacks threatened
over seizure of weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato jets launched an attack in Bosnia yesterday and threatened more strikes
after Serb troops seized a tank and other weapons under United Nations
control, violating the Sarajevo security zone.
The Nato attack by 14 jets was the first since April and highlights the
increasing pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, who have been left isolated this
week by their refusal to endorse an international peace plan for the region.
Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, called for the strike
after Bosnian Serb forces ignored threats that they faced an attack if they
violated a heavy weapon exclusionary zone around the capital. He said the
only target hit was a Serb armoured vehicle fitted with a heavy 76mm gun,
known as a tank buster. He warned that if the Serbs did not return the heavy
weapons as they had promised, more air attacks would be launched against
them.
'At 18:32 (16:32 GMT) Nato aircraft engaged a target of the Bosnian Serb
army that was in violation of the total exclusion zone around Sarajevo. The
target was a tank buster that was engaged by cannon and we think destroyed,'
Gen Rose said.
British, American, Dutch and French aircraft, based at Gioia Colle in
southern Italy, took part in the raid on four targets, but all bar two US
jets failed to engage their targets due to 'weather and other difficulties'.
The raid comes a day after Serbia itself cut links with the self-declared
Bosnian Serb state. Telephone links and border traffic between the two Serb
neighbours were closed yesterday, further isolating the Bosnian Serb
leadership in Pale.
In April, allied planes bombed Serb targets in the UN-designated safe area
around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. Since then, Bosnian Serbs have fired on UN
troops and ignored warnings to stay away from exclusionary zones.
The UN hesitated to retaliate in the hope of fashioning a peace agreement,
but Bosnian Serb leaders on Wednesday rejected a western-brokered peace deal
that would partition Bosnia-Hercegovina almost equally between Serbs and the
Croat-Moslem coalition.
Early yesterday, a T-55 tank, anti-aircraft gun and two armoured personnel
carriers were taken in a raid on a UN weapons collections point in Ilidza, a
suburb of Sarajevo.
Mr Fred Eckart, UN spokesman in New York, said the attack was justified by
the weapons seizure and the subsequent shooting at a French helicopter sent
to retrieve the equipment.
After the attack, UN officials said Bosnian Serbs had indicated they would
return all weapons taken from the UN store. The Serb officials were said to
have regretted taking the equipment.
Nato has more than 100 aircraft based in Italy, from where past strikes have
been launched. The planes enforce an international ban on military flights
over Bosnia and offer support to UN peacekeepers on the ground.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Oil and gas push industrial output in UK to record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance by the North Sea oil and gas sector boosted UK
industrial production to record levels in the second quarter, indicating
that the growth in output is gathering pace.
Manufacturing output slowed slightly in June, providing further evidence
that the pick-up in the manufacturing sector is steady rather than
spectacular.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that total industrial
production grew by a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent in the three months to
June, compared with the three months to March, and by 5.7 per cent compared
with the same period a year ago.
The rise led the CSO to revise up its projections for annual industrial
growth to 5.5 per cent.
This is considerably higher than the 3.3 per cent annual growth rate for
overall gross domestic product in the second quarter of this year, and
underlines the significance of the industrial sector in the overall
recovery. The index of production rose to 102.6 in the second quarter - its
highest level in the series which takes 1990's production level as a base of
100.
Oil and gas production rose by 6.8 per cent in the second quarter, compared
with the first quarter of the year, and was 37.3 per cent higher than the
same period a year ago. The rises were recorded in spite of the fact that
May and June are two of the main months in which North Sea platforms are
shut down for annual maintenance.
The surge in output, which earlier this year took the international industry
by surprise, reflects the large number of new fields which were brought on
stream earlier this year, and which are now building up to peak production.
Growth in the manufacturing sector, by contrast, was more patchy,
Manufacturing output fell in June by 0.2 per cent, compared with the
previous month. But though this fall surprised the City, analysts yesterday
pointed out that measured on a three monthly basis - considered a better
guide to the trend than volatile monthly figures - manufacturing rose by 1.3
per cent in the second quarter of the year, compared with the first quarter.
This leaves manufacturing output some 5 per cent higher than during the low
point of the recession two years ago, albeit 2.6 per cent below the peaks
reached during the last recovery in 1990.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday welcomed
the figure as evidence that the country was now seeing 'broadly based
growth', and this upbeat verdict was echoed by City analysts.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Abiola rejects terms of release
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's detained opposition leader Chief Moshood Abiola last night
rejected the terms of the military government's offer to release him.
In a move designed to ease the country's acute political and economic
crisis, the authorities had sanctioned the intervention of a high court
judge. The judge, in an emergency session in the capital, Abuja, granted
bail to Chief Abiola on condition that he agreed not to address political
rallies, kept the peace and did not travel out of the country without
authority.
Chief Abiola, held in Abuja on a treason charge, was the undeclared winner
of last year's annulled presidential election. He was not present at the
hearing, but a spokesman for him said he had refused to accept the terms.
The government action followed a month of mounting pressure which saw Lagos,
the biggest city, paralysed, and vital oil exports severely hit by a
continuing industry strike. Unofficial estimates put the loss of crude oil
production at over a quarter of the normal 2m barrels a day. Anglo-Dutch
Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's oil, has cut its production by at
least 400,000 barrels per day.
On Friday it suspended supplies of its Bonny medium crude oil, produced in
the Niger delta at onshore fields exposed to vio-lence and sabotage which
have been either threatened or carried out against strike-breaking.
Oil prices fell sharply on news of the release offer. The key September
Brent futures contract on the International Petroleum Exchange fell to
Dollars 17.85 in late afternoon trading in London, down 57 cents a barrel
from the previous day's close.
A national strike, which began last week but was called off on Thursday to
allow behind the scenes negotiations on Chief Abiola's release, was due to
resume on Monday. This now seems likely to go ahead, with Chief Abiola and
his supporters pressing his claim to the presidency, adding to the country's
economic difficulties and raising tensions.
Although Chief Abiola enjoys considerable support in and around Lagos,
heartland of the Yoruba tribe, there is powerful opposition to him from the
Hausa Fulani north and within the army itself.
Mr Adams Oshimole, deputy national president of the umbrella Nigeria Labour
Congress, had told Reuters news agency he understood that by the next
sitting of the high court, set for August 16, the government would drop the
treason charges, but military officials made no further comment last night.

FT  06 AUG 94 / Jobs growth braces US markets for rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US financial markets are bracing themselves for the Federal Reserve to raise
short term interest rates after the government's July employment report
showed that job creation was much stronger than expected.
The headline unemployment rate rose in July to 6.1 per cent, compared with
6.0 per cent in June, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported yesterday.
But the number of non-farm jobs, which is based on a different survey and is
watched more closely by investors and money market dealers, grew by 259,000
to 113.6m.
Job creation was slower than in June, when 356,000 new jobs were added to
non-farm payrolls, but economists had predicted an even sharper slowdown.
Wall Street economists said the employment figures, which indicate a
stronger economic outlook and the possibility of future inflationary
pressures, increased the likelihood that the Fed, the central bank, would
soon raise interest rates. Anticipating an increase, the US bond market
dropped sharply yesterday, while share prices and the dollar weakened.
Fed officials have in recent days seemed to be preparing the ground for an
increase at or shortly after the August 16 meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy. Fed governors told the
New York Times earlier this week they were not convinced by possible signals
that the economy might now be slowing down, such as the large increase in
business inventories in the second quarter.
Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said yesterday in a
speech in Tacoma that he would not be unhappy if growth slowed in the second
half of this year, and warned that the unemployment rate could not be
expected to fall further without provoking an acceleration of inflation.
However President Bill Clinton and his administration are anxious not to
choke off the recovery by an increase in interest rates.
Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, said yesterday the July employment
figures were 'further proof that job growth is continuing its solid, steady
course,' but he insisted that they 'exhibited no sign of inflation'.
Private sector economists say the Fed could act very quickly in response to
July's strong job creation data.
'We had thought that they would raise rates by 25 basis points at the August
16 meeting. We now think they might move before that,' said Mr Robert
Mellman, an economist with New York's J. P. Morgan bank.
The Bureau of Labour Statistics said its survey of households, on which the
unemployment rate is based, showed a slight increase in the number of
unemployed people to 8m.
Many of the new non-farm jobs came in temporary employment programmes,
restaurants and food stores, while higher wage jobs in the manufacturing
sector remained steady at around 18m.

FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Full diary at Letts for Alan Mills, new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Letts, one of the UK's leading diary publishers, has for the first
time in its 198-year history moved outside the Letts family to find a new
chairman.
Alan Mills, 61, who started his working life in 1949 with the English
Electric Light Company, has become the new (non-executive) chairman.
Mills has a long track record in a variety of electrical companies,
including most recently the chairman and chief executive roles of GEC,
Canada (between 1988-89) and managing director at Osram (between 1989-1993).
He also has overseas experience, from time spent in Qatar, India and Hong
Kong.
Mills joined the board of Letts in 1993, along with Bill Gore, its chief
executive. Mills takes over from Anthony Letts, who remains a non-executive
director.
In its first results since being the subject of a management buy-in last
December, Letts reported a loss of Pounds 785,000 in May this year,
for the year ending January 1994. The company reckons to have some 25 per
cent of the UK diary market, worth about Pounds 70m annually.

FT  05 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) Lloyd's set to hire debt collectors to chase
Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 6th August 1994) appended to this article.
Lloyd's of London is poised to hire commercial debt collectors as part of a
tough new campaign to collect money from loss-making members of the
insurance market.
The move would represent a substantial stepping up of its efforts to close a
shortfall of nearly Pounds 662m owed by thousands of Names, the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said yesterday that Lloyd's did not
have the resources internally to collect all its debts.
He said the initiative was partly in response to complaints from Names'
organisations that some members of the insurance market were unfairly
concealing their assets to avoid making payments. At present Names either
enter 'hardship', a Lloyd's alternative to bankruptcy, or are pursued for
payment - ultimately through legal action.
A committee of the ruling council of Lloyd's has been created under the
chairmanship of Mr Bernard Bradford, who recently retired as head of
corporate recovery. Mr Philip Holden, a partner with Dibb Lupton Broomhead,
a law firm with two specialist debt collection offices, will be working with
the committee to produce recommendations for the next council meeting on
September 14.
Mr Holden said last night: 'This is not a normal debt collection situation.
I think there are things that can be done on a constructive basis that can
make life better for everybody.'
The aim is to develop ideas as well as quantifying the size of the problem,
which may cover as many as 14,000 Names.
Mr Robert Miller of the Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names
group, welcomed the initiative but Mr Michael Freeman, a partner with
lawyers Epstein Grower Michael Freeman which is acting for many loss-making
Names, has complained about the idea. He said it looked as if Lloyd's was
trying to by-pass the legal system.

CORRECTION
The Association of Lloyd's Names welcomes efforts by the insurance market to
ensure that all Names with outstanding debts are treated equally, but does
not support the use of debt collectors, contrary to suggestions in
yesterday's FT.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Air Liquide acquires Italian
energy producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air Liquide, the French industrial gases group, yesterday announced that it
has acquired Energheia, the Italian electrical energy company.
The French group did not state the value of the transaction, but it is
estimated at about FFr300m (Dollars 55.6m).
Energheia, which is based near Milan, has annual sales of more than FFr100m.
The company produces 270GW of electrical energy a year and 570,000 tonnes of
vapour. Such dual production, known as cogeneration, is a growing business
area for Air Liquide, which has similar operations in the US, and one in the
Netherlands which is due to start production soon.
Air Liquide said the acquisition, done through its Italian subsidiary, would
make it an important partner of CESA, the Italian electricity group which
supplies ENEL, the national electricity distri-butor.
Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank, yesterday announced it is to
sell its Belgian leasing operation to Locabel, a subsidiary of Banque
Bruxelles Lambert.
The size of the transaction was not disclosed, but BNP Lease, the company
being sold, has assets estimated at BFr1.2bn (Dollars 36.9m).
BNP said the operation will allow it to consolidate its Belgian activities
while providing its clients with expanded leasing services.
Under the terms of the agreement, Locabel will supply BNP's Belgian clients
with leasing and rental services.

The executive board of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second
largest bank, has formally rejected a public offer by Banco Comercial
Portugues, a smaller competitor, for a controlling stake of BPA.
In a letter to Portugal's stock exchange commission (CMVM), the board said
the bid was not in the best interests of BPA shareholders. BCP is offering
Es132bn for 40 per cent of BPA.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Restructuring hits Rhone-Poulenc: French group plans Dollars
1bn asset sales and promises an advance in full-year profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, should
achieve a significant increase in net profits this year, despite a 69 per
cent fall in results for the first six months, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou,
chairman, said yesterday.
Announcing a decline in net profits, from FFr1.08bn (Dollars 200m) in the
first half of 1993 to FFr337m for the first six months of this year, Mr
Fourtou said that a strong improvement in the group's operating result and
capital gains from asset sales would push full-year results above the
FFr962m recorded in 1993.
Shares in the company, which have climbed over the past few weeks, rose by
FFr2.7 to FFr141.5. This compares with a price of FFr135 per share for the
public offer through which the privatisation of the company was completed
last autumn.
Mr Fourtou said that Rhone-Poulenc planned to sell more than Dollars 1bn of
assets. Capital gains from these disposals should offset exceptional charges
this year.
He declined to give details of the possible sales. Industry observers
believe the bulk of disposals will come from the company's basic chemicals
operations.
The main first-half hit came from restructuring charges. Rhone-Poulenc took
about FFr900m of provisions for rationalisation, mainly at Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, its US pharmaceuticals subsidiary.
Reduced gains from asset sales were another factor in the decline in
first-half profits. Income from this source fell from FFr204m in the first
half of 1993 to FFr57m this time.
At the trading level, however, Mr Fourtou outlined an encouraging
performance in the first six months. Sales rose across the company's
principal divisions, prompting a 5.9 per cent rise in turnover to
FFr42.38bn.
At the operating level, profits before provisions and non-recurring items
increased by 14.6 per cent to FFr4.04bn.
The group's organic and inorganic chemicals division benefited from a rise
in volume, although prices remained below the 1993 level, increasing
turnover from FFr7.15bn to FFr7.43bn. The fibres and polymers division and
the healthcare operations also saw a strong advance.
A stronger than expected second-quarter performance lifted operating results
in the agricultural division from FFr629m to FFr916m.
Mr Fourtou said the group would continue its restructuring effort to
concentrate on its core businesses and reduce debts, which rose from FFr24bn
at the end of last year to FFr25.5bn at the end of June.

Airlines at France's Nice airport, angered by disruption caused by a handful
of flight controllers, called on authorities yesterday to intervene to end
the 11-day-old dispute. Strikes and go-slows by the 11 flight controllers in
the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence have disrupted heavy holiday
traffic in western Europe. About 30 of the 43 French and foreign airlines
serving the Riviera airport wrote jointly urging the Civil Aviation Board to
resolve the dispute over working conditions. Airline officials said some
companies might have to alter flight plans until the end of the holiday
season if the disruption continued. Aix-en-Provence, one of France's five
air control centres, normally handles 2,400 flights a day in peak periods.
Flight delays at Nice airport were down to one hour yesterday from three
hours on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky pledged yesterday to bring in, after
general elections on October 9, a law allowing private television channels
to operate in the country. The Social Democrats and their junior partner in
the governing coalition, the conservative People's party, are expected to
win the elections, handing Mr Vranitzky a third term as chancellor. Austria
is one of the few countries in east or western Europe not to permit private
television stations to operate on its territory, although cable television
is allowed; its two state television channels, ORF1 and ORF2, are often
criticised for being staid. Mr Vranitzky did not say how many commercial
stations would be permitted or whether foreign-owned companies would be
allowed to bid for licences.

<TEXT>
A top Russian general who supports military dictatorship and backs a
muscular role for the Russian army in the former Soviet republics is set to
lose his job, military officials said yesterday. The predicted removal of
Gen Alexander Lebed, commander of Russian forces in the break-away
Transdnestr region of Moldova, suggests the Kremlin is seeking to remove
hardliners from the military. Col Mikhail Bergman, a close ally of Gen
Lebed, said yesterday that the 14th army which the general commands is to be
disbanded, a move which would automatically deprive Gen Lebed of his job.
However, other Russian military officers denied that Gen Lebed was being
forced out and said that although some reorganisation of the 14th army was
planned it would not to be disbanded entirely. Relations between Gen Lebed,
who has said he will not stay in the military if he is removed from his
post, and the Kremlin reached a nadir last month after the general told
Izvestia, the Russian daily newspaper, that Russia invited attack through
its military weakness and described all Russian politicians, including
President Boris Yeltsin, as 'minuses'.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Italian statesman who broke political mould: Obituary,
Giovanni Spadolini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican politician and intellectual who was
one of the leading figures in post-war Italy, died in a Rome hospital
yesterday aged 69.
Politicians from all parties paid tribute to his career as Republican
politician, contemporary historian, newspaper editor and latterly as bon
vivant elder statesman.
His body was brought to lie in state in the Senate, where he was a life
senator and speaker from 1987 until this year.
Mr Spadolini was the first prime minister from outside the Christian
Democrat party in the post-war republic. He was appointed in 1981 to head a
five-party coalition after Italy's political establishment was shaken by the
scandal of the P2 secret masonic lodge, a parallel power structure
controlled by the shadowy figure of Mr Licio Gelli. His strong personality
held the coalition together for 405 days before being reshuffled. It then
lasted another 82 days.
Three times a minister in different governments, he latterly played an
important role as speaker of the Senate, enlivening debate with his
erudition and crusty humour. After the March general elections he challenged
the new Berlusconi government to retain the speaker's post, losing by a
single vote.
Mr Spadolini was born in Florence and began his public life as an academic
teaching contemporary history, subsequently producing more than 60 books,
mostly on this subject. He switched to journalism and at 30 became the
editor of Il Resto di Carlino. After 13 years on the central Italian daily
newspaper he moved to edit the prestigious Corriere della Sera.
He always regarded himself as an intellectual on loan to the world of
politics and entered politics comparatively late, in 1972, being elected as
an independent senator in the Republican lists. Mr Spadolini took on the
leadership of the Republican party in 1979 on the death of Mr Ugo La Malfa
and held the post for eight years.
His death will be a great loss to the Republicans who are struggling to find
a role in Italy's fast-evolving political landscape.

FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low shares busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fallout from the Tesco bid for William Low reverberated throughout the
food retail sector, inspiring fresh acquisition speculation and reports of
some inspired stockbroking operations.
According to traders, Salomon International, the US investment bank, had
been busy throughout Wednesday buying in Low stock and selling Tesco in
order to arbitrage between the two stocks. In particular, it is thought
Salomon was aiming to benefit from the all-share alternative to Tesco's cash
bid for Wm Low. Sources close to Salomon said the broker bought a hefty 10
per cent of the Scottish supermarket group during its buying spree.
Meanwhile, it was the turn of Kwik Save to attract speculators yesterday as
the shares forged ahead 28 to 602p, although turnover was only moderate. The
talk was dismissed by analysts, who pointed to the large minority stake held
by Dairy Farm, of Hong Kong, in Kwik Save.
J. Sainsbury, which lost out on the bid for Low, was at the centre of
renewed speculation that it is about to make a large US purchase. The shares
defied these suggestions, gaining 6 at 425p. Tesco put on 3 at 240 1/2 p,
while Low steadied at 359p.
Reports that Sainsbury had reported a sharp rise in its soft drinks sales
during the recent hot weather in the UK contributed to a strong advance in
Cadbury Schweppes, which added 12 at 453p.
Wellcome was driven forward a further 20 on bid speculation but slipped back
to close only 9 1/2 up at 685 1/2 p. Glaxo received some support from news
that Serevent, its anti-asthma treatment, had received approval in France.
The shares had been 5 off and closed unchanged at 603p.
British Petroleum drifted 6 1/2 easier to 404p with 8.5m shares traded as UK
investors cut long positions following the recent rally. Shell Transport was
dragged down by the performance of its Royal Dutch arm and dipped 5 to 735p.
Engineering group TI closed 7 ahead at 412p after cheering the market with
an 11 per cent increase in interim profits. Market watchers were
particularly pleased by the improvement in the balance sheet. Analysts
expect full-year profits of around Pounds 145m.
Glynwed International was another engineering company to please the market
as it reported half-time figures ahead of expectations. The shares put on 5
at 390p after brokers upgraded full-year estimates. The market range is now
between Pounds 65m and Pounds 69m.
Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries eased a penny to 203p on
reports that rivals Bosch, of Germany, and Fiat, of Italy, are setting up a
joint venture in diesel engine fuel injection systems.
Speculation that Tiphook will announce a rights issue next week continued in
the market and the shares relinquished 4 to 30p.
Speciality chemicals group BTP put on 7 at 324p, with dealers talking of a
big buy order going through the market as the company held its annual
meeting and announced a Pounds 12.6m acquisition for its German unit.
Analysts said the ICI pension fund had been reducing its holding in the
company over the past few weeks via BZW, but yesterday the investment bank
received a sizeable order for stock. ICI rose 2 to 858p.
Building materials group RMC gained 7 at 994p after a positive note from
UBS.
UBS issued a negative note on Courtaulds, sending the share price down 8 to
536p.
Insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT Industries fell 14 to 446p on worries
over a ruling by the US Food and Drug Administration that tobacco is
addictive.
Magazine group Reed International rose 14 to 812p ahead of first-half
results due next Thursday.
Paper group David S. Smith added 10 at 558p after Panmure Gordon recommended
the stock at the morning meeting.
News of the early break-out of a price war in the holiday market saw a
predictable retreat for tour operator Airtours, off 10 to 449p with turnover
a high 1.7m. Smith New Court said the stock still represented good value.
Owners Abroad rallied from an initial fall to close steady at 100p.
Estate agent Herring Baker jumped 13 to 51p as it was announced that
property agency Conrad Ritblat, down 2 at 36p, had taken a 9.4 per cent
stake.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market optimism ahead of the regulatory pricing review due next week
continued unabated, further sharp gains being recorded by the regional
electricity companies (recs). Offer, the industry regulator, is due to
report on the new price structures for the recs and there are market rumours
that the review will be favourable to the companies.
Investment bank Strauss Turnbull added its weight by launching a call
warrant on a basket of five recs. The cost of the warrant - which allows
investors to exercise an option to buy the shares at the price on the day of
purchase - is Pounds 5.08 based on a basket price of Pounds 31.95. Investors
then have until February 1996 to exercise their warrants, which are, in the
meantime, tradeable in the market.
Among the most prominent rises, Northern added 20 at 725p, Norweb 25 at
728p, South Wales 18 at 702p and Eastern 18 at 688p. PowerGen continued to
benefit from the bullish mood and the start of its planned share buy-backs
on Tuesday, climbing 6 1/2 to 552p.

FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market focus on Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Well received first-half figures from Zeneca combined with previous hints in
the market that the former pharmaceuticals arm of ICI could be a bid
candidate, giving a healthy boost to the Zeneca share price.
The company announced profits of Pounds 351m after a Pounds 100m exceptional
charge. They were below the previous year's numbers but above the range of
analysts' forecasts.
Mr Andrew Porter of UBS said he remained a strong buyer but the 10.75p
dividend was slightly disappointing. The market had forecast 11p. Mr Paul
Krikler of Goldman Sachs said: 'The results were clearly above expectations
and driven forward by very strong margins in pharmaceuticals and
agrochemicals.' Analysts upgraded full-year forecasts by between Pounds 10m
and Pounds 20m to a range of Pounds 760 to Pounds 790m.
There was some debate over how much of the exceptional charge had been
anticipated in the market. The shares reflected concern at the initial
announcement, opening 8 lower. However, there was also debate over how much
the final net rise for the stock of 24 to 795p was attributable to the
profit figures. Traders said heavy London buying in the sector had been
driven largely by speculative interest following the recent Dollars 8.5bn
bid for American Cyanamid in the US.

FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries over interest rates and the weakness in the fixed income markets
prompted selling in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 3,184, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 briefly
moved ahead and touched 3,188 before the worries on inflation and interest
rates took hold. The contract then went into decline, with the retreat in
the fixed income markets leading to further pressure on September.
Continuous selling saw it fall to 3,157, just shy of the 3,155 support
level, and the premium to cash was significantly reduced in the process.
Dealers reported active arbitrage activity as the premium between the cash
and futures narrowed, with traders busily buying September and selling
equities.
The contract ended at 3,158, down 17 from the previous day's close and
around two points above the fair value premium to cash of about 6 points.
Volume was 9,477 contracts.
In traded options, turnover returned to more modest levels. Some 24,227
contracts were dealt, against 36,649 lots on Wednesday. Just over 7,300
contracts were transacted in the FT-SE 100 option, and British Steel was the
most active among the stock options with a total of 2,615 lots. It was
followed by HSBC at 1,841 contracts and National Power at 1,467.

FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed interest rate doubts depress
shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in government bond prices, reflecting underlying worries over
interest rate prospects, wore down the UK equity market towards the close of
yesterday's trading session. After moving erratically at first, the FT-SE
100-share Index closed 9.9 off at 3,150.5, only just above the low for the
day.
The fall would have been greater but for gains in several pharmaceutical
stocks as European investors pondered the implications of the Dollars 8.5bn
bid for American Cyanamid from American Home Products, which has put a new -
and higher - price tag on drug company assets.
The attention placed on the blue chip pharmaceuticals kept market turnover
at a satisfactory level, from the point of view of the market participants.
But the general tone of the market was uninspiring, with August holiday
factors taking effect among fund managers already evidently unwilling to
chase stocks ahead.
At the day's low of 3,150.1, the Footsie was beginning to approach support
levels, so traders were not unhappy to see the index steady in the final
minutes. Profit-takers appeared to be less active across the broader range
of second line stocks, where the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 10.6 at 3,700.2.
Wall Street was 9 Dow points off at the London close, and the unexpected dip
in US jobless claims set the scene for data due today on US unemployment and
payrolls. Any sign that economic recovery is stronger than expected would
bring back fears that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit policy.
On the other side of the interest rate balance, yesterday's disclosure that
German industrial orders were strong in June suggested less pressure on the
Bundesbank to trim its rates any further.
In early trading, the Footsie added nearly 6 points, largely under the
influence of the stock index futures sector. Shares in Zeneca, last year's
biochemicals spin-off from ICI, rose sharply after disclosure of a gain in
underlying profits for the first half; but part of the share gain related to
the general speculation among drug stocks.
A more direct focus for speculation came in the advance in Wellcome, which
had been previously identified as a possible target by a US securities
house.
Uncertainty in the US dollar restrained other blue chip share sectors, the
oil issues slipping back in modest turnover. The banking stocks, still
responding to trading statements from the leading names, were mostly firmer.
Elsewhere, the modest improvements in the early part of the session served
to bring out the profit-takers later. Investors now take the view that,
while UK interest rates are unlikely to rise for at least a month, the
prospect of higher base rates may counterbalance the benefits of the flow of
higher earnings and dividend announcements from British companies.
Interest rate-related issues closed with mixed changes, the dull spots being
those building and construction stocks with a German focus. The excitement
on the food retailing side died down, and shares in William Low traded at an
acceptable discount to the 360p a share cash bid with which Tesco scooped
the victory from J. Sainsbury, the rival bidder which drew the line firmly
at 305p.
Stock Exchange statistics for Wednesday's session showed that retail, or
customer, business in equities remained high, returning an overall worth of
Pounds 1.61bn. Trading volume, as measured by the Seaq electronic network,
was again buoyant yesterday, with 670.6m shares traded compared with 711m on
the previous day. But non-Footsie stocks made up around 62 per cent of
yesterday's total, an increase on recent sessions and an indication of
increased activity among the capital goods stocks represented in the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops awaiting jobs
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday ahead of economic data which may influence the
timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to tighten credit conditions,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 26.87 down at 3,765.79, its lowest
level of the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.05 at 458.40. Trading
volume on the Big Board amounted to 294m shares. The Nasdaq composite
receded 3.51 to 720.18.
The session opened on a sour note. Investors were greeted by a piece of
economic data which did not bode well for this morning's crucial July
employment data. The Labor Department said that initial claims for
unemployment benefit had declined by 10,000 last week, suggesting that the
economy was moving along at a steady pace.
The market was counting on seeing the opposite trend in today's report.
Non-farm payrolls in July were expected to show a moderate increase of
200,000 after a sharp rise in June. If the figure came in line with
expectations, the Fed might have sufficient cause to delay its next move to
lift short-term interest rates.
Investors held their jitters in check for most of the session, but the
erosion in share prices grew more pronounced near the end of the day.
Early on, motor vehicle shares were marked down in reaction to weak July
sales data released the previous session. General Motors dropped Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 , Ford Dollars 2 to Dollars 29 1/2 and Chrysler
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 , with Merrill Lynch lowering its ratings on
the group.
The securities house also downgraded several of their component suppliers.
As a consequence, Eaton lost Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 49 3/4 and Dana
Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 27.
Outside the motor vehicle sector, investors were initially reluctant to make
any big moves, but several large cyclical stocks fell sharply in the final
hour. International Paper gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 75, General
Electric Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/2 and Caterpillar Dollars 1 to Dollars
107 5/8 .
The release of July sales data by leading retailers failed to generate much
enthusiasm or concern, even though most stores showed continued sales
improvement. Sears Roebuck slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 and Gap
Stores declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 .
But two electronics retailers were rewarded for their strong sales
performances. Best Buy jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 and Circuit
City gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 22 1/2 .
Conrail shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 55 and Norfolk Southern receded
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 63 1/8 after a report that the two railways were
discussing a merger.
In their initial day of trading, Shandong Hueneng Power Development ADRs
finished unchanged at Dollars 14 1/4 on heavy volume of nearly 14m shares.
The company is the first Chinese enterprise with a primary listing on the
NYSE.
Canada
Toronto closed on a mixed note after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index
lost 3.96 points at 4,202.09, but advances outscored declines by 380 to 345.
Volume was 53.7m shares.
Seven of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by real estate, up 1.5 per cent. The
conglomerates group gained 1.2 per cent as Canadian Pacific put on C 3/8 at
CDollars 22 1/2 in the wake of impressive second-quarter financial results
announced earlier in the week. Financial services fell 1.3 per cent.
Mexico
Profit-taking after four straight days of gains brought the market down
initially, but demand from foreign investors left a slightly higher finish
on balance. The IPC index of 37 leading shares was finally 6.50, or 0.25 per
cent, up at 2,573.81. Turnover was a moderate 1.33bn new pesos on 109.3m
shares traded.
Supporting the market was news that Mexico's industrial production grew 3.1
per cent in May, the second highest monthly increase of the year.
The index has gained 362 points, or 16.4 per cent, since July 20, helped by
better than expected second-quarter company reports and investor confidence
in a victory by the ruling party in the August 21 presidential elections.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris bourse falls back
through the 2,100 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday gave investors the opportunity for second thoughts after
Wednesday's consolidation, writes Our Markets Staff.
At Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the European equity strategy team led by Mr
Andrew Bell upgraded Spain, and downgraded Germany.
Spain, said Mr Bell, looked reasonable to cheap in p/e terms, and cheap
against bonds which, in turn, were pricing in too much relative risk
considering the improvement in inflation and wages.
'While investors may be inclined towards Germany, given stronger than
expected growth,' the team added, 'the trend in our earnings estimates is
disturbingly weak for a market with so much priced in. If this does not
reverse, the market will have to give up relative ground.'
PARIS eased towards the end of the session on a combination of factors both
external and internal - a softer dollar and bond markets and a recurrence of
profit-taking.
The CAC-40 index fell back through the 2,100 barrier, closing off 18.62 at
2,096.45. Turnover continued to express the seasonal tone, at about
FFr3.5bn, below even the average of FFr3.8bn seen in July.
Rhone-Poulenc's first-half results came in line with most analysts'
expectations and the shares improved FFr2.70 to FFr141.50, off the session's
high of FFr143.
However, Goldman Sachs commented that underlying trends were better than had
been expected and the outlook for the group was positive. Goldman considered
that, since the bad news was now out of the way, the shares should see a
period of moderate outperformance, forecasting that they could trade up to
FFr160.
Euro Disney was another stock to find support yesterday following the news,
which came after the market had closed on Wednesday, that its FFr6bn rights
issue had been 80 per cent subscribed. The consortium of banks which
underwrote the issue is now likely to sell remaining shares to Prince
Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi investor, who agreed to purchase whatever
shares remained at the issue price of FFr10. The market price rose 75
centimes to FFr10.75.
FRANKFURT fell into the doldrums after its attack on the 2,200 level, the
Dax index losing 15.56 at 2,183.36 on the session and subsiding further to
close the afternoon at an Ibis-indicated 2,176.66, as turnover eased from
DM8.8bn to DM7.7bn.
The Bavarian banks stayed weak after the disappointing Bayernverein report
on Wednesday, chemicals saw more profit-taking and, at the pharmaceutical
end of that industry, the impact of dollar weakness on Schering's
profitability left the shares DM21 lower at DM938.
There was selective buying interest in engineering and metals, where
Deutsche Babcock rose DM4.40 to DM263.20, Klockner-Werke by DM6 to DM163 and
Preussag another DM2.20 to DM478.20. Dealers in Frankfurt attributed this to
sector rotation after the earlier enthusiam for the automotive and chemical
industries.
ZURICH finished easier, but above its lows in moderately active trade. The
SMI index eased 5.4 to 2,615.3.
UBS bearers gave up SFr3 to SFr1,184 ahead of the bank's six-month figures
today. Credit Suisse forecast that the UBS first-half net profits would fall
by 35 per cent. Baer Holding bearers were SFr45 lower at SFr1,295 in
response to Wednesday's news of a 24 per cent first-half profits decline.
Sulzer rose SFr8 to SFr968 after Credit Suisse issued a strong buy
recommendation and predicted that the engineering and technology group could
double its earnings in 1996.
Jelmoli, the retailer, rose SFr20 to SFr930 ahead of an announcement that it
was to hold an extraordinary news conference today. The company declined to
give further details or to comment on recent market rumours that its
majority shareholders were seeking to sell the company.
AMSTERDAM bided its time ahead of the heavy results programme which begins
in earnest next week, and as investors continued to take profits following
the good results from Akzo Nobel and DSM earlier this week.
The two chemicals groups lost Fl 1.30 and Fl 2.80 respectively to Fl 218.20
and Fl 142.90 as the AEX index softened 1.09 to 419.79.
MILAN lacked direction as political worries receded with parliament heading
into the summer recess. The Mibtel index eased 24 to 11,328 in very thin
trade.
News that the net inflow into Italian mutual funds slipped sharply to L184bn
in July from L1,120bn in June added to the downbeat mood.
Benetton fell L742 to L23,038, with the very low level of business tending
to distort the price movement.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index fell just 2.90 to 1,497.20. But
after the market close Astra said that the German health authority had
suspended its licence for the intravenous injection of its anti-ulcer drug
Losec for one year. The 'A' shares were unchanged at SKr173, but were quoted
SKr3 lower at SKr170 in London later.
ATHENS saw international investors back in the market, pushing the general
share index up 10.36, or 1.2 per cent, to 906.58 after a midsession high of
912.03.
Carnegie International saw no fundamental reasons for this, or the
cumulative gain of over 60 points this week, but it said that new issues
were performing well, and expected the improvement to be sustained.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds tumble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares took a sharp tumble as the bullion price fell to Dollars 375 an
ounce, but prices had stabilised by the close of trading.
The overall index lost 9 at 5,687, industrials rose 26 to 6,474 and golds
weakened 41 to 2,086.
Gold issues had drifted lower for most of the day on increasingly bearish
forecasts about the state of the gold market, but accelerated downwards as
the metal suddenly dropped in mid-afternoon trade, before picking up off the
lows.
Some industrials continued to do well on offshore demand and lack of scrip.
But a weakening in the financial rand indicated net foreign selling.
News that the Congress of Trade Unions of South Africa had called off next
week's regional stay away had no immediate impact on the JSE but was
expected to improve sentiment, which had been dampened by the threat of
labour action.
Demand continued for De Beers, which ended R1 higher at R117.50 after
hitting a new peak in dollar terms of Dollars 26 in New York overnight.
Anglos, dragged down by gold, shed R2 to R250.
Pick 'n Pay bounced a further 50 cents, or 4 per cent, to R13 in continued
positive reaction to the resolution of a bitter 24-day strike.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Kuala
Lumpur posts five-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors bought large- capital stocks, while individuals targeted
speculative favourites, and the Nikkei 225 average made a marginal
improve-ment after fluctuating within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index gained 44.11 at 20,676.84 after a day's low of 20,565.21 and high
of 20,700.94. A fall in bond prices, reflecting the rise in the dollar above
the Y100 level, caused jitters among some investors.
Volume totalled 270m shares, against 304m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks firmed 3.21 to 1,656.52 and the Nikkei 300 was up 0.39 at
300.74. Rises led falls by 544 to 418, with 207 issues unchanged. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.86 at 1,341.21.
While investors have been cautious of the stronger yen and the negative
effects on the economy, traders said implications for profit margins - due
to lower costs - had yet to be discounted in share prices.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said: 'The pass-through effects of the stronger
yen have significantly lowered input costs and improved terms of trade for
many industries.' The effects were likely to continue in coming quarters,
putting downward pressure on costs, it added.
But yesterday's activity did not centre on fundamentals. Instead, overseas
investors bought low-priced laggards, including chemicals and shipping
lines, while individuals dabbled in speculative shares.
Steels were higher on foreign buying: Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y361. Navix
Line, a shipping company, gained Y20 at Y384 and Kawasaki Kisen rose Y19 to
Y381. Showa Denko, a chemicals manufacturer, climbed Y20 to Y360.
Takasago International, an aromatic chemicals maker, advanced Y13 to Y825.
The company, which also makes fragrance chemicals for cigarettes and
tobacco, was sought by investors looking for beneficiaries of Japan
Tobacco's listing this autumn.
East Japan Railway, which fell on profit-taking on Wednesday, appreciated
Y2,000 to Y527,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 18.08 at 23,011.26 in volume of 132.5m
shares. Trading volume rose on selling and buying back of shares by
companies looking to realise profits on their holdings without changing
their portfolios.
Roundup
A positive tone was evident throughout much of the region.
KUALA LUMPUR posted its highest close for more than five months as early
profit-taking gave way to blue-chip buying by foreign funds. The composite
index added 7.74 at 1,086.80.
The market's rise has come against a background of robust earnings reports
by financial institutions, signs of lower inflation and reduced fears about
overseas bourses.
Foreign demand for Hicom Holdings pushed the conglomerate up 35 cents to
MDollars 7.10.
SHANGHAI A shares rose a further 8.1 per cent in record daily turnover as
investors withdrew funds from the bond market and switched cash holdings
into stocks.
The index of shares available for local investors gained 42.99 at 572.78 as
the market was given additional encouragement by a report in the China
Securities newspaper saying thatthe authorities were examining plans to
supply loans to brokerages in their efforts to boost investment.
Turnover was Yn10.5bn compared with a previous all-time high of Yn5.32bn in
March this year.
Shanghai's B shares ended down on profit-taking after five successive
trading days of gains. The index lost 1.22, or 1.7 per cent, at 72.61. In
Shenzhen, the A index climbed 3.72, or 2.5 per cent, to 150.13; the B index
rose 3.18 points, or 3.1 per cent, to 104.49.
HONG KONG was pulled higher by finance and property issues after a cautious
session which saw both profit-taking and bargain hunting. The Hang Seng
index rose 56.96 to 9,642.85 in HKDollars 4.5bn turnover.
Japanese institutions sold blue chips early in the day and foreign funds and
some local investors picked up bargains in their wake.
HSBC put on 75 cents at HKDollars 95.75 ahead of results on August 15, while
Wing Lung Bank led the gains, rising HKDollars 1.25, or 2.2 per cent, to
HKDollars 59. Swire Pacific 'A' added HKDollars 1, or 1.55 per cent, at
HKDollars 65.50.
SEOUL saw renewed demand for some blue chips and shares with low
price/earnings ratios but trading remained thin. The composite index firmed
4.02 to 927.49, with selling pressure by investment trusts continuing to
restrain the market.
Posco advanced Won800 to Won75,300 and Sasmung Electronics added Won1,500 at
Won90,500. But Hyundai Motor lost Won200 at Won44,900 on selling by
investment trusts, which have been heavy sellers because they are due to pay
back a total of Won850bn of soft loans from the central bank by August 12.
SINGAPORE rebounded late in the session after earlier profit-taking, and
brokers were divided on whether the market was still on track for a
full-scale rally. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 4.04 up at
2,271.17.
Creative Technology continued to fall sharply, closing SDollars 2.70 lower
at SDollars 31.20: a number of brokers have issued sell recommendations.
Keppel jumped 40 cents to SDollars 10.90 ahead of results.
SYDNEY recovered from a dull start as foreign buying picked up during the
afternoon. News Corp advanced 17 cents to a seven-week high of ADollars
8.98, but Advance Bank shed 67 cents to a three-week low of ADollars 9.27.
The All Ordinaries index closed 11.2 up at 2,083.5, after an early low of
2,064.3.
MANILA continued to attract foreign demand, which pushed prices higher
before some profits were taken late in the session. Good corporate
second-quarter results added to the market's momentum.
The composite index rose 13.34 to 2,897.62 in turnover of 1.7bn pesos.
TAIPEI was driven by late buying in electronics which took the weighted
index up 66.01 to 6,789.57. However, turnover dropped to TDollars 85.3bn
from Wednesday's TDollars 129.7bn.
Electronics led the market, with ASE and United Microelectronics both up by
the daily 7 per cent limit, to TDollars 107 and TDollars 146 respectively.
Financial and cement stocks eased.
WELLINGTON featured Telecom, which shrugged off an indifferent opening to
close solidly ahead after reporting first-quarter profits at the higher end
of expectations. Telecom gained 9 cents at NZDollars 4.99, having initially
slipped to NZDollars 4.86, and the NZSE-40 capital index rose 19.68 to
2,101.88 in turnover of NZDollars 71m.
BOMBAY recovered its composure after the finance minister's denial of
rumours that he planned to resign prompted renewed domestic buying. However,
further selling by foreign investors restrained the advance and the BSE
30-share index ended 19.35 ahead at 4,300.99 after reaching 4,331.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar awaits job news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar spent much of the day trading in a narrow range against the
yen and the D-Mark, as the markets awaited what are seen as crucial non-farm
payroll figures today, writes Philip Coggan.
Analysts said the employment data will give the markets a crucial indication
as to whether the Federal Open Market Committee is likely to increase
interest rates at its next meeting on August 16.
Meanwhile, the Italian lira consolidated its recent gains against the
D-Mark. The Italian Senate formally approved the government's financial
programme for the next three years, and the lira gained from the perception
that, with the holiday period about to start, political worries would
subside for another month.
The Bank of Portugal followed up the Bank of Spain's 15 basis-point cut in
its key money market rates on Wednesday.
The Portuguese lowered the regular money market rate for draining funds from
10.5 per cent to 9.75 per cent, and the emergency lending rate from 13 per
cent to 12.5 per cent. The escudo firmed slightly against the D-Mark to
Es101.9 from Wednesday's Es102.1.
The dollar spent much of the day hovering around the Y100 mark, closing in
London at Y100.2 from Y100.175 on Wednesday night. Against the D-Mark, the
dollar edged up to DM1.581, from the previous London close of DM1.5792. In
New York it finished at Y100.475 and DM1.5872.
Trading was thin, with markets showing evidence of having entered a holiday
lull. The US currency did receive a brief boost during the day, on rumours,
later denied, that the superpower had invaded Haiti.
Figures for jobless claims, which fell to 319,000, from 329,000 in the
previous week, were largely ignored, as these numbers are seen as more
erratic than today's non-farm payroll statistics.
According to Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan Bank:
'Some in the market are beginning to question whether the Fed will tighten
after August 16, or will wait for the following meeting in September.'
The outlook for the dollar is complicated by its recent close relationship
with the Treasury bond markets. Strong payroll numbers, while making a Fed
tightening more likely, will hit the T-bond market. Conversely, weak payroll
numbers will make the Fed's recent slowness to raise rates more credible,
and will boost T-bonds.
Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a rise in the non-farm payroll
of 200,000 in July, well down from the 379,000 increase seen in June, a
figure boosted by the World Cup football tournament.
Meanwhile, evidence of the strength of the German economy emerged yesterday
with buoyant manufacturing orders and a fall in seasonally adjusted
unemployment to 2.575m in July from 2.593m in June.
After the Senate's passing of the finance package, the lira finished the day
in London at L997.9/DM, having closed at L998.8/DM on Wednesday. Mr Jeremy
Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said: 'There will be a
quiet period on the political front with parliament going into recess. Some
of the potential negatives have been laid to rest for the time being.'
According to Mr Robert Thomas, director and head of research at NatWest
Capital Markets, events of the last few days mean that Mr Silvio Berlusconi
(Italy's prime minister) is now going to be under less pressure. Mr Ian
Gunner of Chase Manhattan thinks the lira is now likely to trade in the
L990-L1,008 range for the near future.
But Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in Europe, said: 'There
are still question marks over the shelf life of the Berlusconi
administration. The lira is by no means out of the woods.'
Having traded in a narrow range around DM2.4250 during the morning, sterling
regained a little more of its June losses against the D-Mark, closing at
DM2.4333, up from DM2.4317.
Against the dollar, the pound weakened slightly to Dollars 1.5391, from
Wednesday's close of Dollars 1.5399. Sterling's effective index ended at
79.3, unchanged from Wednesday's finish, but up from the opening of 79.1.
However, Mr MacKinnon said he had the impression that 'most international
investors still consider sterling to be in a long term downtrend'.
In the money markets, the Bank of England gave an initial Pounds 900m of
assistance, adding further tranches of Pounds 250m, Pounds 62m and Pounds
165m later in the day to alleviate a shortage which was gradually revised up
from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.35bn. Overnight rates traded in the range of
5 1/4 to 4 1/4 per cent.
Although expectations of an imminent base rate rise have receded this week
with the publication of the Bank's quarterly inflation report, short
sterling edged down a further 5 basis points yesterday, and still implies an
increase to 5.75 per cent before September 21.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe, said:
'Market expectations are extremely fragile.' Last week's base rate
speculation was started by a Treasury bill auction and another auction is
due today.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Last tin mine in Pounds 1m
battle for survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five hours before the midnight deadline last night, Britain's last operating
tin mine, South Crofty near Redruth in Cornwall, was still fighting to raise
the Pounds 1m it needed under the terms of a survival package agreed with
the government.
By yesterday afternoon Pounds 475,000 had been promised by local people and
private investors and Mr Kevin Ross, managing director, was said to have
spent all day on the telephone in final negotiations with unnamed parties
for the other Pounds 525,000.
'We remain confident,' said a South Crofty official.
Mr Ross on June 29 made an emotional appeal to investors to provide up to
Pounds 1.8m for South Crofty, which can trace its roots back for 400 of the
2,500 years tin has been mined in Cornwall.
He revealed that, if the mine could raise the minimum Pounds 1m to ensure
its survival for another 18 months, the government would write off loans
totalling Pounds 23.4m. Also the RTZ Corporation, which sold South Crofty
and its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, would
forgive loans of Pounds 7.7m.
These loans are interest-free but their presence on the balance sheet make
it very difficult for South Crofty to raise more money.
South Crofty employs 260 people - most have taken regular cuts in pay to
help the mine survive so far - and produces about 2,200 tonnes of tin a year
in concentrate (an intermediate material), which is all sent for refining to
the DKS smelter in Malaysia. The mine needs a tin price of about Pounds
4,000 a tonne to make a decent profit. The price peaked at Pounds 10,021 in
February 1985 and fell to a 20-year low of Pounds 2,946 in September 1993.
At present the price is about Pounds 3,400 a tonne.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil demand growth forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Energy Agency yesterday predicted that world demand for
oil will grow steadily over the next nine months as the pace of economic
activity quickens in Europe and Japan.
In its monthly oil market report the IEA estimated that world demand for oil
next year would rise to 69.3m barrels a day, from an expected average of
68.1m b/d this year.
The Paris-based agency said oil demand by members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development would rise by 500,000 b/d in the first
quarter of 1995, with Europe accounting for the largest increase. It
predicted that Asian demand in the period would grow by a similar amount and
that the decline in demand in the former Soviet Union would slow.
Global demand in the first quarter would therefore be 900,000 b/d higher
than in the same period last year.
But the agency suggested that oil supplies from outside the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would be 700,000 b/d higher in the first
quarter, mainly reflecting rising production in the North Sea as new fields
which were brought onstream last year moved towards peak production.
The report noted that Nigeria had replaced Yemen as a source of
international concern about supply disruptions. But it said that the
Nigerian supply disruptions in July, which have unsettled international oil
markets, were offset by increased out-put by several other Opec producers.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices up again as frost
returns to Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices surged ahead yesterday after reports of a light frost in
Brazil, but although the market ended Dollars 59 a tonne higher, it failed
to hold on to earlier gains.
The November coffee futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange soared
to hit Dollars 3,675 a tonne in morning trading - a rise of Dollars 119 - on
news of the frost. But later confirmation that a light frost had touched
only a limited coffee-growing area pushed the market down to close at
Dollars 3,615 a tonne.
'The market's very sensitive, but prices would go higher if we hadn't
already had a lot of frost damage,' said one trader. Frosts in late June and
early July have already caused widespread damage to the Brazilian crop that
will be harvested next year pushing world market prices up by more than 50
per cent.
The Pocos de Caldas region in Minas Gerais, the main coffee-growing state,
was affected by yesterday's frost. Brazil's National Institute of
Meteorology has forecast more light frost in main coffee-growing regions for
this morning.
The prospects of further damage to the Brazilian crop are likely to keep the
market jittery for some days.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Imports cut into Dutch flower
power - One out of every eight roses sold in the European market is now
grown in Africa, Latin America or Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRIFFIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Holland celebrates the 400th anniversary of the tulip this summer, the
horticultural industry to which it gave birth is being forced to adjust to a
most curious of commercial phenomenon - undercutting from a new crop of
African producers.
Cut flower growing has become a sunrise industry in the dark continent, with
Kenya and Zimbabwe leading an expanding herd of commercial farmers eager to
trade their dependance on cereals or tobacco for the greener fields of
disposable floriculture. Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest of seven Dutch
flower markets, reported a 82.5 per cent increase in rose imports last year,
while at the BVH auction a flood of foreign stems knocked 40 per cent off
rose prices during the recent winter season.
Low wages, zero heating costs and lack of regulation of pesticide and
fertiliser run-offs are all contributing to the movement abroad of this most
typical of Dutch industries. But the trend is also market-led in that the
selling peaks of Christmas and St Valentine's Day both occur when European
production is low and unit costs correspondingly higher.
'What will happen,' predicts Ms Margarette Worsfold, editor of the Flower
Trades Journal, 'is that the Dutch will suck in more flowers from Kenya,
Colombia and other producers. They take up all the current oversupply and
shove it through the auctions to make up for their own shortage.'
One in eight roses sold in Europe is now grown in Africa, Latin America or
Israel. Dutch wholesalers, with 59 per cent of the international flower
trade, welcome the trend as an opportunity to expand their market with more
competitive rates while preserving their margins. The auctions, which earn 6
per cent on every transaction, say imports pose no threat to Dutch hegemony,
although this is perceived less in terms of the interests of domestic
floriculture than the potential risk to the existing marketing and
distribution chain of high volume, non-Dutch suppliers.
But the 11,000 Dutch growers, who established the auctions as co-operatives,
have become increasingly resigned to losing the rose and carnation trade
altogether - the equivalent of 42 per cent by value of Aalsmeer's total
turnover. Though disdained as indicators of a market's 'floral illiteracy',
they remain the cornerstone of the wilting, but vitally important,
'occasions' sector of the retail trade. Selling the more sophisticated
products at which Dutch planters excel on the growing 'impulse' market
requires much greater strategic awareness.
'I think Dutch growers will always find varieties and niches in the markets
to make the whole assortment complete,' says Mr Niek Van Rest, managing
director of the Flower Council of Holland, the industry's promotional arm.
'You will see roses and carnations, in particular, largely taken over by
other countries but new varieties will still be grown in Holland.'
Nevertheless, there is much for the Dutch to celebrate in this anniversary
year. Aalsmeer, 15km from Amsterdam, is the showcase of a Pounds 2.2bn
business that ranks among the most competitive in the world. Some 20m stems
pass beneath its digital auction clocks daily in homage to an industry that
has successfully married the further shores of plant technology with a
distribution system so smooth that it has virtually eliminated distance as
an obstacle.
Though the double-digit increases of the 1980s are long gone, Aalsmeer
reported a healthy 4.8 per cent rise in earnings for the first third of the
year, incorporating a 2.7 per cent increase in Germany, Holland's biggest
customer, and hefty growth in eastern Europe and Japan.
Full implementation of the Uruguay Round settlement in General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would further prise open the Japanese market while giving
greater access to the US. But the greatest growth potential lies in the
transformation of moribund 'occasions' markets, like the UK with its Pounds
19 a head annual flower consumption, into nations of impulse-buyers, like
the Germans who spend over Pounds 30 each on flowers each year.
The two keys to this kingdom are an educated consumer and a larger number of
retail outlets. Unlike Germany, regular flower buying has never been
promoted in the UK, but that could be about to alter as supermarket chains,
sensing the untapped demand, begin competing head-on with the traditional
high street florists.
While the multiples have the resources and sales points to grow markets like
the UK, however, they could also pose a threat to the eminence of the Dutch
auctions in international flower trading. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer store
chain, for example, sources its larger orders directly from Spanish growers,
by-passing the auctions and their commissions altogether.
Aalsmeer's managing director, Mr Andre Mulder, is convinced there will
always be a commercial need for an international clearing house for the
flower trade but is concerned at the sheer scale of transactions taking
place at his market. Ten thousand trucks a day rumble through its caverns
and, on present growth, it will become unmanageable within a decade. In a
bid to reduce congestion, Aalsmeer introduced a video-based selling system
for pot plants in January, allowing growers to send only a sample to auction
with the majority inspected electronically.
Such a system is unlikely to be viable for cut flowers and for much the same
reason roses and gerbera will always be traded on a spot and not a futures
market, however great the volumes handled.
'Flowers are perishable products', says Mr Mulder, 'and it's not only a
high-tech product, but a high-touch product. So if you really want to do
business in the right way, you have to touch and see and smell the product.'

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia has reacted angrily to Australian accusations that Malaysian
logging companies are seriously damaging the environment in countries of the
South Pacific.
'What is the business of Australia to criticise the presence of Malaysian or
other foreign logging companies in the South Pacific islands?' said Mr Lim
Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries. He suggested that
Australia was jealous of the success of Malaysian companies in winning
timber concessions in the region and was using a half truths to 'jumble up
environmental facts'.
At a recent meeting of leaders of South Pacific nations in Brisbane Mr Paul
Keating, Australia's prime minister, accused Malaysian, South Korean and
Indonesian logging companies of 'ripping off' the Solomon Islands by paying
too little for valuable timber products. 'Unless the environmental piracy of
foreign companies operating in the South Pacific region is controlled, the
future for the region will be bleak,' Mr Keating declared.
In recent years Malaysian timber companies have expanded their logging
operations to countries in the South Pacific and there have been increasing
protests about what are seen as the uncontrolled activities of these
financially powerful concerns. In Papua New Guinea, where one privately
controlled Malaysian concern is believed to control more than 60 per cent of
log exports, the government recently brought in a series of measures to curb
the activities of foreign loggers.
A senior executive of one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates recently
resigned after being accused of trying to bribe a Solomon Islands minister
in connection with a timber deal - although he denied the charge.

markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysian officials have warned of the dangers of a plywood price war and
say Malaysian and Indonesian producers, who account for more than 90 per
cent of tropical plywood output, must co-operate to ensure the long term
health of the industry.
Aggressive cutting has taken the price to Dollars 440 a cubic metre from
USDollars 550 in June and Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's primary industries
minister, says producers should consider holding back supplies to support
the market. He warns that many customers, particularly in China, are not
buying because the price is now so fluid.
'It may continue to drop, perhaps even below Dollars 400 a cu m, a price
fetched by tropical plywood way back in 1988,' says Mr Lim. 'This is the
time when producers have to pool resources and experience to weather the
ongoing storm of a price slump.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand wool prices were higher again at a sale on August 4, with China
active but Western Europe and Japan also buying strongly. It is not always
clear whether at such an early stage in the selling season there is pressure
to cover urgent outstanding requirements helping to raise prices which may
not later be maintained, or whether the wool market is set on an even more
definite upward trend than many already believe. Australian wool prices made
no all-round further advances at this weeks auctions but the market there
did close firmly after signs of limited softness on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Eastern States indicator closed at 680 cents, only one cent lower than a
week before.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: European prices slip ahead of US jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stronger-than-expected economic data in Germany and position-squaring ahead
of today's US jobs report put downward pressure on prices in most European
government bond markets yesterday.
German government bonds slipped more than  1/2 point following a
larger-than-forecast jump in June manufacturing orders and the second
consecutive drop in seasonally-adjusted jobless figures.
The data were taken to indicate that the German recovery is stronger than
widely assumed, causing some market participants to revise their projections
for short-term interest rates.
This took a particularly heavy toll on the short end of the market, where
some 1995 three-month Euromark interest rate contracts fell by up to a
quarter-point.
But the long end also suffered, with the September bund future on Liffe
falling by around 0.54 point to 93.55.
French government issues followed bunds lower, but were further pressed by
the tepid reception to the Treasury's latest auction of long-dated bonds.
This caused French bonds to underperform their German counterparts, their
10-year yield spread over bunds widening to 46 basis points from 40 basis
points on Wednesday.
The auction yielded a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.09 on FFr13.4bn of 10-year
bonds, 2.02 times on FFr2.95bn of 14-year paper 1.82 times on FFr3.6bn of
30-year bonds.
When the September notional bond future on Matif approached technical
support at 117.40, retail selling kicked in, pushing the contract even
lower, he said. It closed at 117.08, down 0.82 point on the day.
UK gilts followed continental European markets lower, pressed further by
sales ahead of today's data releases in the US and the UK.
'The market had got a bit too long on the relief that there was no rate
rise, and some people were squaring their positions ahead of the US jobs
numbers and UK industrial production and manufacturing output data,' said Mr
Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch.
Gilts underperformed bunds, with the 10-year yield spread widening by around
10 basis points to 175 basis points. The September long gilt future fell one
point to 102 3/16 .
US Treasury bonds drifted lower yesterday as dealers squared their positions
ahead of today's crucial data on July employment.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 lower
at 86 3/32 , with the yield rising to 7.412 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 5.955 per cent.
Yesterday's session brought a piece of negative news as the market prepared
for this morning's jobs report. The government announced that initial claims
for unemployment benefit had declined by 10,000 last week, suggesting the
economy was moving along at a steady pace.
The reading was unfavourable to a market looking for signs of moderating
growth, which could delay the Federal Reserve's next move to lift short-term
interest rates. Bond prices slipped on the announcement, but the declines
were modest.
Still, traders were hoping the figure was not a preview of today's data on
non-farm payrolls. An increase of more than 200,000 jobs could send bonds
prices sharply lower.
Yesterday, a neutral scenario seemed to be holding sway. Most investors
appeared confident the payroll figure would come in near expectations. But
the approach of next week's quarterly refunding operation, which would bring
a big influx of supply into the market, could stand an obstacle to any
upswing in bonds prices even if today's data proved supportive.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street listing for
Chinese group
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shandong Huaneng Power Development yesterday became the first Chinese
company with a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange following an
initial public offering of 23.3m American depositary shares at Dollars 14.25
each.
The issue represents about 27 per cent of the outstanding share capital,
with each ADS representing 50 common shares. A tranche of additional 3.5m
ADSs was allotted to the underwriters to cover over-subscriptions. In early
heavy trading the share price held steady at Dollars 14.25.
The company, which has interests in coal-fired power plants in Shandong
province, south-east of Beijing, is raising about Dollars 337m through the
offering. Proceeds will finance an expansion programme aimed at quadrupling
generating capacity by the end of the decade.
Power demand in the province, which has the second fastest growing local
economy in China, already exceeds supply by 14 per cent.
Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of CS First Boston, the global
co-ordinator of the deal, said the decision to list the stock exclusively on
the NYSE and to register it with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
was significant for the future of Chinese privatisation.
By agreeing to conform to US accounting standards and quarterly reporting
requirements, the Chinese were trying to improve investor confidence in the
long-term stability of its enterprises, he said.
The decision to list on the NYSE also underscores Shandong Huaneng's hearty
appetite for foreign capital. It is the first of four Chinese power
companies scheduled to launch international IPOs this year. One of them -
Huaneng Power International - also plans a primary listing on the NYSE after
its flotation this autumn.
Four Chinese companies have dual listings on the New York and Hong Kong
exchanges.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Derivatives seen as adding to
market volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of respondents to a survey on the use of derivatives by
institutional investors feel the instruments are causing an increase in
market volatility.
However, there was a considerable difference between the response from those
who are users and those who are not; 41.4 per cent of users thought the
effect was to increase volatility while 70.7 per cent of non-users also
thought so.
The survey, produced by Euromoney Publications, draws its conclusions from
the responses of 220 participants which consisted of investment management
companies, insurance companies, pension funds, banks and stockbrokers.
When analysed by respondent type, commodity trading advisers were all users,
as expected, but only 55 per cent of banks and 50 per cent of stockbrokers
use such instruments. While only 59.7 per cent of investment managers were
users, the figure for pension funds was 80 per cent.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Sweden and Hungary offerings draw
attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two unusual eurobond offerings by sovereign borrowers dominated dealers'
attention yesterday.
Sweden launched its Y100bn eurobond offering, after rumours of pre-marketing
in Tokyo reached London dealers earlier this week, while the National Bank
of Hungary, which borrows on behalf of the Hungarian government, launched a
Dollars 250m issue of floating-rate notes, just before announcing an 8 per
cent devaluation of the forint.
As expected, Sweden's euroyen offering maturing in December 1996, arranged
by Nomura, was aggressively priced. Nomura said it is the first euroyen bond
to be targeted at a wide range of retail investors in Japan. To market the
deal, 100,000 prospectuses are being distributed, and the denominations are
relatively small, at Y100,000 and Y1m.
Under current regulations, eurobonds can normally be placed in Japan with a
limited number of investors. However, Nomura has applied for a Securities
Registration Statement which allows unlimited placement. The deal will be
marketed through the retail network of Nomura and other securities houses,
in the same way as Samurai and domestic corporate bonds. However, the fees
for eurobonds are lower than for Samurai bonds (foreign bonds issued in the
domestic market).
Although the deal appeared very tightly priced to London-based traders,
Nomura said that retail investors would compare the rate to fixed-term
savings rates, currently around 2.1 per cent over two years.
In the dollar sector, the National Bank of Hungary's Dollars 250m issue of
floating-rate notes was considered rather aggressively priced, compared with
its outstanding fixed-rate paper. The deal offers a discounted margin of 1
7/8 point over the London interbank offered rate.
Lead manager Salomon Brothers said it still has a mandate from Hungary for a
Dollars 500m-Dollars 750m global offering of 10-year bonds, which was
shelved earlier this year, but there are no plans to bring the deal in the
near future.
Elsewhere, several retail-targeted offerings were well received. A Dollars
200m three-year deal for BNG, the Dutch bank, was the first eurobond to be
priced at a yield spread relative to the when-issued three-year Treasury.
The spread of 10 basis points over the new Treasury equates to 19 basis
points over the old three-year benchmark, dealers said.
The one reservation expressed by dealers was that BNG has been tapping the
market very frequently since it gained a triple-A rating in June, with
rumours of a large yen transaction still to come.

Mexican equities will be quoted on the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ

The exchange said the move 'recognises the maturing of the Mexican market'.
Mexican shares are already listed on SEAQ International, the Exchange's
bulletin board for dealing prices in non-UK shares, but only under a broader
Developing Markets Sector.
The total volume of SEAQ International in firm-quoted Mexican stocks last

shareholders

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of QVC Network, the US cable television shopping group, was still
locked in discussions last night over whether to accept a takeover offer
from its two largest shareholders, Comcast Communications and Liberty Media.
The cable companies are reported to have increased their original offer for
the 65 per cent of QVC that they do not already own from Dollars 44 a share
to Dollars 46 a share, an all-cash bid which values QVC at just under
Dollars 1.5bn.
Although QVC was expected to accept the revised offer yesterday, the lack of
an early announcement from the board meeting, which started at 10.30am in
New York, led some analysts to suggest that there may have been last-minute
opposition to the deal from some members - possibly from Mr Barry Diller,
QVC chairman, who is believed to have wanted the company to wait and see if
a higher bid would emerge from another source.
A QVC spokesman declined to comment on the progress of the board meeting,
but last night sources close to the company said the board was still hoping
to announce an agreement within a few hours.
Last month the QVC board was close to accepting a merger offer from the CBS
television broadcasting network, but before it could sanction the deal
Comcast stepped in with a higher bid on July 12. Ten days later, Comcast was
joined by Liberty Media.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investcorp buys US retailer for
Dollars 285m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Investcorp, the international investment bank, said yesterday it has agreed
to acquire Star Market, a leading chain of supermarkets in Boston,
Massachusetts, from American Company Stores for Dollars 285m in cash.
Investcorp will later sell a portion of the equity to its largely
Bahrain-based shareholders. Mr Henry Nasella, a former president of the
retail chain, will also be an equity partner in Star Market as well as
manager of its operations.
Mr Nasella, 47, had most recently been president of Staples, a leading US
office supply retailer where he had overseen its rapid growth from revenues
of Dollars 30m in 1987 to Dollars 1bn in 1993.
Star Market's turnover in 1993 was Dollars 840m. It operates 33 stores and
employs over 7,000 people.
Investcorp has other significant investments in North America including Saks
Fifth Avenue, Camelot Music, Color Tile and Tiffany. It has also recently
purchased the 50 per cent of Gucci it did not own.
The bank's main business is purchasing companies, overseeing their growth
and selling them profitably, typically within five years.
It has begun to appoint a post-acquisition committee to oversee the
management of each new acquisition to ensure proper growth.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Showa Shell steps up dividend
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refining and marketing affiliate of
Royal Dutch/Shell, hopes by the end of this year to eradicate burdensome
foreign exchange losses, and is increasing its dividend.
In February last year Showa Shell disclosed that its traders had run up
losses of some Y165bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in unauthorised currency dealings
which left it with a Dollars 6.44bn exposure to the dollar.
The company has since been attempting to unwind these, and said yesterday it
hoped to clear all write-offs by the end of 1994 - at least a year earlier
than expected - on a remaining exposure of just over Dollars 1bn. A charge
of Y21bn was taken in the first half, leaving Y29bn outstanding.
The writedowns brought a 42 per cent slide in pre-tax profits to Y10.6bn for
the six months to June.
Lower crude oil values triggered product price cuts which left interim
revenues 8.8 per cent lower at Y680.8bn, and higher distribution costs
weighed on profitability.
However, a better financial position allowed net earnings per share to
emerge higher at Y16.38 compared with Y15.62, and the dividend is being
increased to Y4 from Y3.
For the full year Showa Shell expects to pay Y9 per share against Y8.
The company, which has been selling shares from its portfolio holdings, did
not adjust earlier earnings forecasts.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Arena sale helps Molson improve
after earlier slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Molson, the diversified Canadian brewer, lifted quarterly profits by a third
but the advance was due to a one-time gain from the sale of a Toronto
ice-hockey arena.
Earnings before the gain slipped by 12 per cent due to fierce competition in
the Canadian discounted beer market; higher expenses at Diversey, Molson's
international cleaning-services unit; and a flat performance by the retail
hardware outlets.
Net earnings rose to CDollars 49.2m (USDollars 35.6m), or 84 cents a share,
in the three months to end-June - Molson's first quarter of fiscal 1994-95 -
from CDollars 36.8m, or 62 cents, a year earlier. The special tax-free gain
amounted to CDollars 16.9m, or 29 cents a share. Sales fell by 2.3 per cent
to CDollars 754.5m.
Molson Breweries, a joint venture between Molson, Foster's Brewing of
Australia and US-based Miller brewing, in-creased its share of the Canadian
market fractionally to 48.5 per cent. Total second-quarter beer sales in
Canada improved by 0.6 per cent to 5.5m hectolitres.
Sales volume in the US jumped by 90.6 per cent to 0.7m hectolitres. This
sharp increase was due to the launch of Molson Ice a year ago and a one-time
inventory adjustment.
Although Diversey's sales rose by 12.4 per cent, operating profit dipped by
almost 16 per cent. The decline was due mainly to efforts to reverse recent
difficulties in its US subsidiary, which suffered a CDollars 3.5m loss.
Mr Marshall Cohen, chief executive, said Diversey's profit growth will
continue to lag sales. 'We expect, in future quarters of fiscal 1995, to
continue to nourish sales and to be patient with profits,' he said.
Molson recently folded its Canadian warehouse hardware chain into a joint
venture with Home Depot, the large US do-it-yourself retailer.
Home Depot Canada, 25 per cent-owned by Molson, posted strong growth in the
latest quarter, with sales of CDollars 163.5m.

International Cosmetics, Thailand's leading quoted distributor of garments,

rise in net profits to Bt364.3m (Dollars 14.6m) in the first half of this
year from Bt287.3m in the same period of 1993, writes Victor Mallet in
Bangkok.
Second-quarter net profits, however, were up only 4.8 per cent to Bt167.1m
from Bt159.5m a year earlier. With consumer spending rising, the company
predicts profit growth of about 13 per cent for the full year.
ICC says first-quarter profits were artificially inflated by a switch to
credit sales from a consignment system.

<TEXT>
A strongly growing economy and marketing initiatives combined to give
Telecom New Zealand a 17.2 per cent increase in net earnings to NZDollars
138.5m (USDollars 83.4m) in the first quarter to end-June.
The company, which is controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, was also
helped by earnings from its Australian investments. These include its 51 per
cent owned subsidiary, Pacific Star Communications which contributed revenue
of NZDollars 29.3m.
Telecom is targeting Australia as its leading growth market for the
provision of facilities such as enhanced facsimile systems. But it does not
intend to compete directly with the network companies there such as Telecom
Australia, Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive, said yesterday.
He said the improved profits performance was largely due to strong revenue
growth; previously it had mainly stemmed from cost savings. Excluding
Australian earnings, revenue on its New Zealand operations rose by 6.2 per
cent to NZDollars 634.5m.
To cope with intense competition Telecom had cut average phone call prices
by a further 11 per cent, but the negative impact on revenue was more than
offset by a robust growth in volumes, Mr Deane said. The numbers of national
calls rose by 15.1 per cent, while international calls were up by 17.6 per
cent.
Cellular connections rose by 46.4 per cent, and revenue from mobile services
was up by 22.3 per cent.
Dr Deane said the outlook for the company was excellent. There appeared to
be considerable potential for growth when New Zealand telecommunications
usage was compared with the US, he said.

Keppel, the Singapore government-linked group mainly involved in shipping,
engineering and financial services, has announced pre-tax profits for the
six months to end-June of SDollars 178.4m (USDollars 119m), a 22 per cent
rise on the corresponding period last year.
Group turnover was SDollars 927.2m, a 27 per cent rise on the previous term.
Keppel, one of Singapore's biggest listed companies, said all divisions of
the group had higher revenues though earnings from shipyard activities were
lower due to weak market conditions, particularly in the VLCC (very large
crude carrier) segment of the market.
The group said growth had been particularly strong in the shipbuilding and
banking and financial services sectors. Earlier this week Keppel Bank
announced a 71 per cent jump in net earnings for the first six months of the
year to SDollars 26.6m.
The group said that though ship repair is likely to continue to operate
under difficult conditions in the second half of the year, it expects strong
growth from other core activities and better earnings performance.
For the past two years Keppel has been moving aggressively into a variety of
businesses overseas as it aims to become Singapore's premier multinational
company. Keppel, which is 37 per cent owned by Temasek Holdings, the
government's investment company, has shipyard interests in the Philippines,
rig building in the US, shipping and engineering units in Hong Kong and a
metal fabrication business in Australia.
The company is targeting Vietnam and also has interests in Burma. Among its
more prestigious projects is its role as leader of a Singapore consortium
which is developing a new industrial township in Suzhou, near Shanghai in
China.
It is hoped that when completed, the town will attract around USDollars 20bn
of investment.

International Business Machines announced a further realignment of its
Dollars 5bn data storage systems division which makes disk drives and other
computer storage devices.
The company will shift high-volume disk drive assembly and test operations
from the US and Germany to lower cost sites in Asia and eastern Europe. The
future of a manufacturing operation at Havant, in southern England, is also
under review.
The moves follow a broad consolidation of data storage operations last year.
IBM has been struggling to improve the profitability of its data storage
business in the face of a steep decline in revenues. The division's sales
were Dollars 5.1bn last year, down from Dollars 6.3bn in 1992 and Dollars
7.2bn in 1991. Analysts estimate that the storage division was only
marginally profitable last year.
More than 1,100 jobs will be cut in the US during the next 18 months and
additional cuts in Germany appear likely. The UK plant, formerly operated by
the storage systems division, was last year transformed into an IBM-operated
contract manufacturing operation.
IBM will establish new assembly operations in Asia, possibly in Thailand
where it has an existing disk drive plant. Similarly, in Europe the company
is looking for a site in eastern Europe.
'The decision to relocate portions of our disk drive assembly and test
manufacturing operations from San Jose (the US headquarters of the storage
products division) to overseas locations is vital to our future as a
producer of information storage products,' said Mr Ed Zschau, general
manager of the division.
IBM also announced a new technology strategy for the storage division based
on leveraging component designs across a range of products. This is in line
with similar efforts under way in IBM's computer systems operations.

mortgage bank

<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan has announced an agreement to pay Dollars 348m for American
Residential, a California-based mortgage bank, in a move that it said would
make Chase one of the top five US home loan institutions.
The deal marks a continuation of Chase's ambition to grow specialised
nationwide financial services units, for instance in home mortgages and
credit cards. It is also likely to prompt an acceleration in the takeover of
mortgage lenders, given the declared intention of some of the country's
biggest commercial banks to expand their involvement in the business.
In recent days, NationsBank had also been talked of as a possible bidder for
American Residential, helping to push up the company's share price ahead of
the Chase announcement. In May, Chemical Banking announced a Dollars 330m
purchase of Margaretten, a New Jersey-based institution.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive of BankAmerica, said
before the Chase announcement that the California-based bank was more likely
to expand through the acquisition of specialised institutions such as
mortgage banks than through purchases of full-scale commercial banks.
Although mortgage banks in the US have suffered from rising interest rates
which have brought an end to last year's record refinancing and new loan
business, they remain attractive sources of fee income for banks.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Schering, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group, yesterday yesterday
announced a 4 per cent rise in half-yearly group profits and expects a 5 per
cent improvement for the year.
Turnover for the half-year increased by 16 per cent to DM2.3bn (Dollars
1.4m) and will be 12 per cent higher for the year as a whole, totalling
DM4.6bn.
The results do not include results from the crop protection division which
was hived off last January and placed in a separate joint venture, AgrEvo,
with Hoechst, one of Germany's largest chemical and pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
The half-yearly group profits which totalled DM192m was lower than expected
because of the decline of the dollar and sterling as well as the scraping of
tax benefits and incentives offered to west German companies who were based
in Berlin before German unification.
In addition, Schering said the group had to make one-off payments for the
rights for Betaseron, a drug used for multiple sclerosis. The group said
sales of Betaseron accounted for nearly 66 per cent of its therapeutic
medicine division. The division totalled DM744m for the first half of this
year compared to DM546m over the first six months of 1993.
Domestic sales over the same period rose by 5 per cent to DM358m, and
exports rose by 18 per cent to DM1.98bn.
Schering's turnover last year totalled DM5.3bn, which included the
agro-chemical/crop protection division, and profits amounted to DM254m.

profits rise for four years
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nippondenso, the Toyota affiliate which is Japan's biggest maker of car
parts, is on course for its first profits upturn in four years as a
stringent cost-cutting programme offsets a decline in sales.
Recurring profits for the first half to June, announced yesterday, were
Y29.62bn (Dollars 286m), up 8.6 per cent from the Y27.26bn recorded in the
same period of last year and a sharp improvement on the Y20bn the company
had earlier expected to reach. Full-year profits are projected to touch
Y50bn compared with Y41.63bn in 1993 and an earlier forecast of Y44bn.
The achievement comes in the face not only of weaker demand from carmakers -
Nippondenso supplies all in Japan except Nissan - but of the squeeze on
suppliers' margins which the automotive companies have been exerting in
order to hold down their costs. According to one analyst, Toyota is seeking
5 per cent annual reductions in component prices.
Results for Toyota in its own full year to June are due later this month,
and are expected to show a continued decline. Car sales in Japan turned
upward in July for the first time in 15 months.
Officials at Nippondenso said rationalisation measures and reduced overtime
payments were worth Y15bn and formed the bulk of Y20.7bn in overall savings
it was able to make during the six months - the rest came from a lower
depreciation bill and cheaper raw materials.
These were more than enough to offset the estimated Y18.3bn negative effect
on profitability of factors such as a Y7bn impact from unfavourable currency
movements. For its full-year projections Nippondenso, which exports about a
sixth of its output, is assuming a yen-dollar exchange rate of Y102.
Sales fell 4.8 per cent to Y622.6bn and are expected to total Y1,220bn for
the year, against Y1,269.5bn.
Interim net earnings emerged at Y16.14 per share compared with Y15.70, and
the forecast for all of 1994 is Y27.45 against Y23.55.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc sees strong gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, should
achieve a large increase in net profits this year, in spite of a 69 per cent
fall in results for the first six months, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman,
said yesterday.
Announcing a decline in net profits, to FFr337m (Dollars 60.2m) for the
first six months of this year from FFr1.08bn in the first half of 1993, Mr
Fourtou said a strong improvement in the group's operating result and
capital gains from asset sales would push full-year results above the
FFr962m recorded in 1993.
Shares in the company, which have climbed over the past few weeks, rose
FFr2.7 to FFr141.5. This compares with a price of FFr135 per share for the
public offer through which the privatisation of the company was completed
last autumn.
Mr Fourtou said the company planned to sell more than Dollars 1bn of assets
and capital gains from disposals should offset exceptional charges this
year. The chairman declined to give details of the possible sales.
Reduced capital gains from asset sales were one factor in the decline in
first-half profits. Income from this source fell to FFr57m in the first six
months of this year from FFr204m in the first half of 1993.
A bigger hit came from restructuring charges. Rhone-Poulenc took about
FFr900m of provisions for restructuring costs, mainly at Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, its US pharmaceuticals subsidiary.
At the trading level, Mr Fourtou outlined an encouraging performance in the
first six months.
Sales rose across the company's principal divisions, prompting a 5.9 per
cent rise in turnover to FFr42.38bn.
At the operating level, profits before restructuring provisions and
non-recurring items increased by 14.6 per cent to FFr4.04bn.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares lifted by
result of rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Euro Disney, the theme park operator, jumped by 7.5 per cent to
FFr10.75 yesterday, following the announcement that its FFr5.95bn (Dollars
1.1bn) rights issue had been 80 per cent subscribed.
The smooth completion of the rights issue will come as welcome news to Euro
Disney, which was forced to implement a rescue package after losses of
FFr5.3bn last year. The rights issue, which will be used to reduce debts of
about FFr16bn, excluding convertible bonds, is a central element of the
FFr13bn recovery package.
The result prompted a satisfied reaction from Euro Disney. 'Given the
current market conditions and the timing of the rights issue, we are pleased
with the level of subscription and the confidence expressed by its
shareholders,' the company said.
An analyst described the result as 'respectable, rather than spectacular'.
After accounting for the 49 per cent of the issue which was taken up by Walt
Disney, the US entertainment group and parent company, the result meant that
about 40 per cent of individual investors did not subscribe to the issue.
The consortium of about 60 banks which underwrote the balance of the issue
have been left with about FFr1.2bn of Euro Disney shares. They can sell
their share of the issue to Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi investor,
who will buy shares that are left over at the FFr10 issue price.
According to Banque Nationale de Paris, which lead the issue with Banque
Indosuez, the underwriting banks will have until the end of next week to
decide what to do with their shares. 'Most are likely to seek a clean exit
and to sell their holdings to the prince,' said one analyst.
The relatively high subscription rate suggests Prince Al-Waleed will not
reach the limit of 24 per cent of Euro Disney's capital - set as his maximum
holding.

Caixa Geral de Depositos, Portugal's largest bank, posted a 0.7 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Es28.8bn (Dollars 170m) for the first half of
1994, compared with the same period last year. Net assets grew 14.9 per cent
to Es4,644.7bn.
Banco Espirito Santo, the country's fourth-ranked bank, recorded a 5 per
cent fall in net profits for the first half to Es10.6bn after a 53 per cent
increase in tax provisions. Pre-tax profits rose 8.2 per cent to Es15.6bn.
CGD, the only state-owned institution among Portugal's top five banks, said
net asset growth was largely due to the improved performance of financial
investments, particularly in foreign banks, and a 5.5 per cent rise in total
lending to Es1,840.2bn.
Espirito Santo Financial Holding, the holding company for BES and other
financial institutions in the group, last week raised its capital to Dollars
221.9m, from Dollars 110.9m, by incorporating reserves in a bonus issue.
Shareholders received one free ordinary share for each ordinary share.
Banco Portugues de Investimento reported a consolidated net profit of
Es4.06bn for the first half, compared with Es4.1bn for the same period last
year. BPI controls Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay.
The executive board of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second
largest bank, has formally rejected a public offer by Banco Comercial
Portugues, a smaller competitor, for a controlling stake of BPA.
BCP's offer must be authorised by the CMVM, the finance ministry and the
central bank.

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Caught in the middle of a
shake-up - The chemicals group is sticking to core sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou had his way, he may have preferred not to publish
yesterday's mid-year results for Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and
drugs group.
However, the Rhone-Poulenc chairman does not concede that his group has been
blown off course. 'Our operating, industrial results are globally in
progression, and this will continue,' he said. But the mid-year statement
catches Rhone-Poulenc, privatised last year, awkwardly in the middle of a
strategic re-orientation of its chemical division that will only start to
bear fruit, and profit, by the end of this year.
Rhone-Poulenc wants to sell Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn of assets over the 18
months, mostly in basic commodity chemicals, to reinforce its presence in
specialised 'performance' products, requiring a higher rate of market
innovation but with a better return. 'By November or December, we should
have two or three good sales,' Mr Fourtou said.
For the first half of the year, the group is stuck with a perfectly
respectable 14.6 per cent rise in pre-tax operating results that could not
offset a FFr900m restructuring provision and the impact of some wrong
guesses by its treasury department.
By incorporating the profitable vaccine-making Merieux Institute fully into
the group, by selling off its Roussel-Uclaf stake to Hoechst, and by a
slightly lower rate of investment, Rhone-Poulenc has pushed the ratio of its
debt to own funds down to 48 per cent and the planned asset sales should
push this ratio lower still.
Industrially, Mr Fourtou is adamant that his group will stick to its core
sectors:
Human and animal health. Rhone-Poulenc is 'heavily involved here, and will
develop these activities' through the Merieux Institute and through
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Rhone-Poulenc has notified the US Securities and
Exchange Commission that it would like some flexibility in its 1990
standstill agreement that limits its stake in Rorer to 68 per cent for seven
years, during which period it cannot make any more acquisitions. This caused
a flutter on Wall Street in June. But Mr Fourtou says he had no particular
scheme in mind, except for a desire to integrate Cooper, a French
pharmaceutical business that Rhone-Poulenc recently bought, into Rorer. Nor,
he emphasises, can any change be made without the agreement of a majority of
Rorer's independent American directors.
Agro-chemicals. Sales of these products did drop 25 per cent to 30 per cent
in 1992-93, but recovered well particularly in North America and Japan.
Synthetic fibres. The group has been reorganising its activities and selling
off chunks. But 'we want to say in nylon in Europe and polyester in Brazil',
affirms Mr Fourtou.
Chemicals. 'The fact that we are planning sales does not mean that we are no
longer interested in chemicals. We will stay in intermediate products where
we have a dominant position and where we have a downstream use for them. But
we are less interested in those intermediate products, unrelated to any
downstream activity. These commodity chemicals are very cyclical, require
heavy investment to get into important new markets such as Asia, and are
best left to companies such as BASF and Dow, or in the case of Asia to
indigenous oil companies in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.'
Far better, says Mr Fourtou, to get into what he calls special performance
products where brainpower is as important as money and where 'innovation and
understanding of markets is key'. He cites as example the increasing
requirement of cosmetics companies for bio-degradable chemical inputs.
In the first half of the year, chemical prices remained below their average
at the start of 1993, but rose above their average in the second half of
last year. 'The market is turning around and will be better at the end of
1994,' says Mr Fourtou.
The Rhone-Poulenc chief concedes there is 'a slight risk' that his planned
chemical asset sales will not come through on time, to balance out an
estimated FFr1bn in restructuring costs over the course of 1994.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Eyes on horizon after the clouds - The
hopes pinned on the revamped Dowty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dowty Aerospace will today deliver another of its flagship products - a set
of landing gear capable of setting an aircraft gently on to a runway at 140
mph.
Another so-called 'ship set' will leave its Gloucester plant on Monday and
further deliveries to manufacturers such as Airbus Industrie and McDonnell
Douglas are expected every working day for the next 12 months.
TI Group, the specialist engineering company which paid Pounds 500m for
Dowty in June 1992, hopes that the order backlog will finally lay to rest
the suspicion that it paid too much for the aerospace business.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, yesterday pointed to increased
half-year operating profits from Dowty and predicted that the division would
emerge as the group's third pillar, making a similar contribution to the
John Crane seals business and the Bundy tubing division.
Dowty, however, is some way from achieving parity with its engineering
siblings. Operating profits of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 8.5m) in the six months
to June 30 represented just 17 per cent of the group total and turnover fell
from Pounds 158.4m to Pounds 149.8m amid flat demand for most aviation
components.
City analysts, meanwhile, warned yesterday that the aerospace market could
decline further before new orders fed through.
'Airlines are trying to get better utilisation of short-haul aircraft, which
could mean fewer new orders,' said one analyst. 'Although that could boost
the spares business.'
Another analyst predicted that recovery from current levels would be
difficult. 'Apart from Airbus, there are not many new aircraft programmes
they can rely on.'
Sir Christopher is undaunted. 'Dowty hurt us in the first two years, but
it's picking up and I'm quite proud of the margins.'
He has charged Mr Tony Edwards, the division's chief executive, with
developing Dowty into a world leader in aerospace components.
For Mr Edwards, recruited in November 1992 from Lucas Industries, success
depends on one equation coming good: that aircraft orders follow past trends
by increasing in line with airline operating profits.
'We believe airline profitability will be healthy enough by 1996 to
kickstart large-scale orders,' he says.
By that stage, he expects to have fully reorganised Dowty, creating a lean
supplier focused on four main areas: landing gear, engine rings, propellers
and hydraulics.
That strategy has so far seen the workforce cut by 25 per cent to 4,200, the
removal of several management layers and the transfer of its Polymer
Engineering business to John Crane.
The central plank of the restructuring, however, has only just been
completed. Encouraged by TI, Dowty has joined with Messier-Bugatti - the
subsidiary of Snecma, the French aero-engine manufacturer - to form the
world's biggest landing gear manufacturer.
Together, the Messier-Dowty joint venture has annual sales of Pounds 250m
and 2,300 employees.
More importantly, it is the sole landing gear supplier to Airbus and serves
a further 20 international manufacturers.
'This will be the driving force behind Dowty,' says Mr Edwards. 'It will
enable us to grow even in a flat market.'
Profits at the Anglo-French venture could also be enhanced by its ability,
unlike its US rivals, to adapt its technology for new customers.
Menasco and Cleveland Pneumatic, the largest US landing gear companies,
manufacture to patterns owned by customers such as Boeing, whereas
Messier-Dowty retains its intellectual property rights.
This should allow the joint venture to exploit expertise gained in serving
manufacturers such as Airbus, while retaining sole supplier status for
spares and repairs.
That expertise has enabled Dowty to win new contracts on civil and defence
programmes, including the Canadair Global Express business jet and the F-18
US Navy fighter-attack aircraft.
Sir Christopher claims such orders, worth more than Pounds 250m in the past
18 months, show how far Dowty has come in embracing the TI culture.
'The challenge has been to bring a marketing culture into an engineering
company,' he says. 'I've been at TI for eight years and I'm only just
getting the message across.'
For Dowty, that has meant cutting jobs; winning new civil customers to
offset reduced spending on military aircraft and persuading airlines that
they can no longer afford to defer new orders.
City analysts, however, warn that TI may find it more difficult to extract
cost reductions and introduce a new culture at Messier. As part of the
Snecma group it has been used to state subsidies and a government pay
formula.
Sir Christopher predicted that such problems would be ironed out by Mr
Edwards, who has formerly worked with a number of current Messier executives
at GE Aerospace.
'We have been through the worst,' he says. 'Passenger traffic is growing and
aircraft are getting older; the airlines will have to start ordering soon.'
His hopes depend on carriers investing operating profits in new aircraft.
Although such investment is by no means certain, the TI chairman is
confident that it will make Dowty an equal partner in the engineering group.
'It has every prospect of being a world class business with a global network
and customer base. The prospects for growth and improved financial results
are very exciting.'

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life changes investment structures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A change to Standard Life's in-house investment structures will transfer
Pounds 4.16bn of unit trust funds into equities, in the latest of a series
of such shifts by institutional funds.
Standard Life's decision to wind up the UK's largest unit trust, the
Standard Life UK Larger Companies Trust, was triggered by the Inland
Revenue's move to close a capital gains tax loophole which, until recently,
encouraged insurance companies to use a unit trust wrapper for insurance
funds.
Mr Alan Burton, unit trusts manager, said that since the company was acting
within the official transition period it would not incur a CGT bill on the
transfer of assets from the trust back into its insurance funds but that
policyholders in future would pay more CGT on their investments.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rotork increases by 11% to Pounds 6.89m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rotork, the valve control manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits by 11 per
cent from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 6.89m in the six months to June 30, helped
by the group's global coverage.
Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said this was 'our salvation always', adding
that not less than 70 per cent of Rotork's output was exported.
Turnover rose 21 per cent to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 34m), though Mr Eassie
explained that some Pounds 5m was derived from new activities, in particular
Exeeco, bought in the second half of last year.
Group operating profits expanded almost 16 per cent to Pounds 6.63m (Pounds
5.74m), while interest and similar income contributed less at Pounds 260,000
(Pounds 460,000).
Sales and profits in the actuation division, which accounts for some 80 per
cent of turnover, both rose over last time, though Mr Eassie said that the
domestic UK market - and especially the water companies - had been
disappointing.
He suggested that, although the utilities had freely spent in the past
couple of years, they had 'been sitting on their hands' in the period under
review. With the K factor issue now settled, he expected expenditure to
rise.
Of the buoyant markets, the most 'exciting' had been east Asia, South
America and Canada, he said.
The IQ range was continuing to sell well 'in a tightening market', leaving
the group room to move more into the system controls side.
Markets for the instruments division, whose products feed into the actuation
side, were 'not promising', though the final quarter looked brighter.
Turnover here was between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m.
The analysis, or pollution monitoring, division was trading at break-even.
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 5p (4.5p) and the interim dividend is
increased by 8.6 per cent to 1.9p (1.75p).
The shares closed down 2p at 164p.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Glynwed ahead 59% and sees fresh growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glynwed International, the diversified engineering group, lifted first half
pre-tax profits by 59 per cent as five of its six main operating divisions
showed an increase at the operating level.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 25 were Pounds 29.1m, compared
with Pounds 18.3m. Group turnover was 2.8 per cent higher at Pounds 489.6m,
but operating profits climbed 37 per cent to Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 23.9m).
'There is a lot of growth still to come. The economic background is good,'
said Mr Gareth Davies, chairman. 'There is no reason why economic growth and
Glynwed's growth should not continue.'
Promises of further growth helped to boost the shares by a further 5p to
390p yesterday, after gains each day this week.
Mr Bruce Ralph, chief executive, attributed the fact that profits grew
faster than sales to some increase in product volumes but as much to
cost-cutting and product introductions.
Earnings per share rose from 5.73p to 9.16p, but the interim dividend is
held at 4.15p. 'We will leave it to the final to make an appropriate
increase,' said Mr Davies. Payments for 1993 totalled 11.65p for the fifth
consecutive year.
Sales per employee were running at a higher level than the previous peak in
1989. The return on capital for the group rose during the first half to 24.6
per cent, against 15.5 per cent in 1993.
The problem division for Glynwed, however, is tubes and fittings where
operating losses rose from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 1.9m. The group has been
commissioning a new copper tube mill but margins have been tiny and the
divisional management is seeking cost reductions. The division will not make
a profit this year, Mr Ralph said.
The consumer products business, including Leisure sinks, Aga-Rayburn stoves
and Flavel-Leisure cookers, lifted profits by 27 per cent, while the foundry
products, metals, steel and plastics businesses were able to respond to
stronger demand.
There was a reduction of Pounds 15.6m in net borrowings to Pounds 54.2m;
gearing has fallen from 45.2 per cent to 25 per cent.
COMMENT
Glynwed is more cheerful than at any time since recession started to knock
its figures in 1989. It now has that happy combination of reduced costs,
following the rationalisation programmes of recent years, and rising
markets, especially in the UK and US, but with Europe starting to climb.
Demand for its industrial products has already risen, that for consumer
products has to follow. So it should be able to ride the economic cycle with
some panache as pre-tax profits for this year rise to about Pounds 63m,
providing earnings per share of over 20p. This puts the shares on a
prospective multiple of just over 19, and shareholders should now be able to
enjoy the ride as a recovery stock recovers.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Williamson Tea shows advance to Pounds
8.95m Williamson Tea Holdings, which produces tea in India, Kenya and
Tanzania, reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 6.22m to Pounds 8.95m
on turnover up by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 39.4m in the year to end-March.
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The improvement, the directors said, could be attributed mainly to increased
profits of the Indian subsidiary, which had settled its dispute with the
government of Assam on the quantum of cess on green leaf.
In addition, firmer tea prices in the last quarter of the period had led to
higher than anticipated profits from the group's overseas subsidiaries.
The directors had forecast at the interim stage that full year profits would
be no higher than those achieved in 1993.
Earnings per share came out at 143.8p (109.74p) and the proposed final
dividend of 15p (12.5p) raises the total payment for the year from 22.5p to
25p.
The company is ultimately owned by George Williamson Holdings.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Whinney Mackay-Lewis cuts losses to Pounds
195,000

<TEXT>
A stronger second half helped Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architect
and interior and urban designer, cut losses from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds
195,000 for the year to April 30.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 3.45m) but operating losses were
cut to Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 477,000). The pre-tax result last time was
after a Pounds 1.55m loss on the disposal of freehold property, restated in
accordance with FRS 3.
Mr Jeremy Mackay-Lewis, chairman, said that after three years of recession,
turnover was increasing again. The current level of fees represented
construction costs of about Pounds 80m a year and there were signs that
steady growth would continue. He said an encouraging number of instructions
had been received in recent months from new clients.
Losses per share were 2.8p (34.6p restated).

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible sells Holt Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials group, will raise up to Pounds
63.5m from the long-awaited sale of its Holt Lloyd car care business to a
management buy-out.
Dr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the disposal would bring Morgan
Crucible's gearing down from about 66 per cent to 'the low thirties', but
the company plans to invest some Pounds 40m in the second half on bolt-on
acquisitions.
The car care business, which includes Turtle Wax polish and other consumer
products, was acquired in 1987, when Morgan Crucible bought Holt Lloyd
International for Pounds 85m.
Holt Lloyd's LPs and Kert industrial chemical businesses were subsequently
absorbed into Morgan Crucible, and are expected to make profits of about
Pounds 6.5m this year.
Dr Farmer said that 'if we'd been according to plan, (the car business)
would have been sold in 1990', but profits slumped during the recession.
However, profits doubled last year to Pounds 8.2m.
The buy-out was led by Electra, which provided Pounds 37m of equity. The
Bank of Scotland put together Pounds 26m of debt and a further Pounds 9m of
working capital facilities. The management will retain a 'significant'
stake.
Morgan Crucible will receive Pounds 60m cash, and a further Pounds 3.5m if
certain performance criteria are met. This compares with Holt Lloyd's asset
value of Pounds 18.1m. In addition, Morgan Crucible will receive Pounds 9.4m
through the repayment of Holt Lloyd's outstanding debt. Of this sum, Pounds
6m will be paid through a loan note.
Dr Farmer said Morgan Crucible had examined trade sales and flotations for
the company, but the MBO had offered the best return to shareholders.
The deal will result in an exceptional profit of approximately Pounds 3m,
under FRS 3 accounting policy.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Decline to Pounds 4.8m at Crest Packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crest Packaging, which came to the market last October, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m for the year to April 30.
The comparison with 1993 was complicated by an exceptional gain of Pounds
12.7m on the sale of property, which produced a pre-tax figure of Pounds
17.6m. Profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds
4.6m.
The flexible packaging division was affected by site reorganisation, while
the installation of a new production line affected the carton division.
Turnover rose by 3 per cent, from Pounds 41.8m to Pounds 43m, helped by the
flexible packaging division. This produced profits of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds
3.3m) on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 25.5m).
Pressure on margins reduced profits in the carton division from Pounds 1.37m
to Pounds 1.11m on lower sales of Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 16.3m).
Mr Rodney Webb, managing director, said raw material prices, which account
for 50 per cent of overall costs, were rising. The increase 'would be passed
on to customers'.
Earnings per share before exceptional items increased from 8p to 9.2p. Basic
earnings fell from 30.7p to 9.1p.
A final dividend of 2.75p is recommended, compared with a notional 2.43p.

<TEXT>
GM Firth (Holdings), the Wakefield-based engineering company, yesterday
announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m for the year to March 31,
down from Pounds 5.99m previously.
This year's result was after charging exceptional items and provisions
totalling Pounds 872,000. The largest item was Pounds 530,000 for potential
costs in respect of a leased property formerly occupied by a discontinued
activity.
During the year the company concentrated on shedding lossmaking activities
in order to prepare for a capital injection. This fol-lowed earlier this
year in the form of a Pounds 4m rights issue.
Sales in the 12 months from continuing activities came to Pounds 13.2m
(Pounds 21.2m).
Net interest payable declined to Pounds 272,000 (Pounds 880,000). Losses per
share fell to 3.97p (11.43p).

FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Allied Irish interested in
buying UK building society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Irish Banks yesterday signalled its interest in either buying a UK
building society or adding to its US retail bank, as it disclosed a 13.6 per
cent rise in half-year pre-tax profits to from IPounds 142.3m to IPounds
161.7m (Pounds 159.6m).
It said it wanted to buy an institution with between Dollars 2bn and Dollars
3bn of assets in the UK or US. 'Our pool of capital would allow us to move
quickly without upsetting our shareholders,' said Mr Neil Dean, chief
financial officer.
Mr Hugh Feeley, general manager for Britain, said that the purchase of a
building society would give AIB a stronger UK brand name, and would allow it
to use IPounds 1bn surplus retail deposits from Northern Ireland and the
Isle of Man.
The bank raised its interim dividend by 12 per cent to 4.6p (4.1p). Earnings
per share rose by only 5.3 per cent to 14p (13.3p) due to dilution from US
preference share issues by it and First Maryland Bancorp, the US subsidiary.
Income was flat at IPounds 599.7m (IPounds 600m), falling 1.9 per cent at
constant exchange rates, and expenses rose by 6.4 per cent to IPounds 393.5m
(IPounds 370m). But provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 43 per
cent to IPounds 43.3m (IPounds 75.7m).
The recovery in Ireland started to produce higher loan demand, with total
loans and advances to customers rising by 1.7 per cent to IPounds 11.8bn.
But this was offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin to 4.12 per
cent (4.49 per cent).
Mr Dean said Irish loans were now growing at an annualised rate of 10 per
cent, a trend it expected to be sustained. 'It augurs very well for growth
in Ireland, while the UK is not yet at the starting gates of loan growth,'
he said.
Income from sources other than lending fell to IPounds 185.3m (IPounds
191.1m), with growth in fees partly offsetting a IPounds 15m loss (IPounds
26m profit) on securities and foreign exchange dealing when it wrongly
anticipated falls in European interest rates.
Capital ratios strengthened to a 5.1 ratio of equity to assets (4.6 per
cent), and a tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.1 per
cent (7.1 per cent). Mr Dean said the bank did not consider itself
over-capitalised.
COMMENT
AIB's home market has solid loan growth and low inflation, a position UK
clearing banks might envy. It is pinning its hopes on income growth -
perhaps augmented by acquisition - rather than cost control. Having solved
UK problems, it has potential in all its main markets. But the net income
fall in the first half shows how margin pressures can offset volume growth.
The risk of a poor acquisition is also to be borne in mind. The shares
closed at 261p, giving a prospective multiple of about 8. That is not
expensive for a bank with growth prospects, even if it is verging on the
over-ambitious.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Monarch makes Argentinian gold investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monarch Resources, the UK-listed company with gold mining and exploration
operations in Venezuela, has signed its first deal outside that country.
It will pay Dollars 275,000 (Pounds 177,000) to earn 51 per cent of the
Gualilan gold properties in the San Juan province of Argentina. Subject to
due diligence, Monarch must complete Dollars 2m of work on the properties
over four years to earn its interest.
It will also take over a purchase option agreement amounting to Dollars
420,000 which lasts until October 1996, but this may be credited against
Monarch's annual work commitment obligations.
It is also entering into a Dollars 1m purchase option agreement, over
mineral rights at the Tuna 1 concession in the El Dorado district of Bolivar
State, Venezuela, near Monarch's La Comorra mine.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort European raises Pounds 234m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust has raised more than
Pounds 234m in the second call on its shares despite widespread fears that
private investors, who have incurred losses since the launch, might not
subscribe.
The figure is about 94 per cent of the amount payable through the final
instalment on the trust's ordinary shares.
The second 50p instalment was due on August 1 but Kleinwort will continue to
accept late payment for 'a limited period,' the length of which it has not
yet stipulated. Reminders will be sent out on Tuesday to those of its the
85,000 investors who have not responded.
The trust, which raised Pounds 500m when it was launched in February, was
oversubscribed by a record Pounds 380m. The shares closed at 81 1/2 p
yesterday, up 1 3/4 p, compared with a net asset value of 94.1p. The
warrants closed at 30.5p.
Taken together, those who hold the package of shares and warrants have seen
a fall of about 12.4 per cent from the original price. The trust has
underperformed the FT-A Europe Index by 15 per cent.
The trust, which had traded at a premium, is now trading at a small
discount. Mr Simon White, director, attributed this to weak markets since
launch and to the trust's 'less stable' shareholder base, in a reference to
those who bought shares in the hope of making a quick gain. 'You only need a
small number of sellers wanting to stag profits for the discount to widen,'
he said.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson up at Pounds 46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the UK-based merchant bank, reported pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 45.8m in the half year to June 30 despite
turbulent trading conditions which cut dealing profits by nearly 60 per
cent.
The drop in dealing profits was more than offset by a 42 per cent rise in
net fee and commission income which rose from Pounds 104.2m to Pounds
147.7m.
Lord Rockley, chairman, said 'Earnings were very resilient considering
conditions in the first half.'
He said that the growth in fee and commission income was a reflection of a
management reorganisation which emphasised the development of both equity
distribution capacity and corporate broking strengths in key industry
segments. As a result, KB was winning far more of the mandates for corporate
advisory, underwriting and merger and acquisition business than it had been
previously.
Mr Simon Robertson, deputy chairman, said: 'We are very pleased with the
high proportion of the mandates we are winning against the competition and
this was not the case one or two years ago.' He estimated that KB had won
about 80 per cent of the mandates it had presented for this year although he
warned that many of those had not yet materialised and that several might
never appear.
In the investment management division, profits rose from Pounds 12.1m to
Pounds 19.6m, reflecting growth in private banking and in specialist
Treasury fund management.
Also, a new US-based fixed-income team hired in the middle of last year has
built up assets under management there of Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.32bn) from
a negligible amount a year ago. Total assets under management have grown to
Pounds 19bn, with net new cash including a Pounds 500m European
Privatisation Investment Trust and Pounds 1.5bn in new institutional funds
from North American clients.
European profits, which were undermined by the sharp drop in dealing income,
fell from Pounds 376.7m to Pounds 296m.
North American profits, however, nearly doubled, reflecting the growth in
fee and commission income to Pounds 37.2m (Pounds 14.2m).
Lord Rockley said that while all businesses contributed to the rise in North
America, profits were particularly aided by the increasing appetite of US
pension funds for foreign equities and bonds. Most of KB's US business is
aimed at the distribution of the securities of non-US clients.
The interim dividend is 6.75p (6p), payable from earnings per share of 24.9p
(24.1p).

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BTP in agreed Pounds 12.6m German
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the speciality chemicals group, has conditionally agreed to acquire AGS
Industrieklebstoffe, a German adhesives business, for DM30.6m (Pounds 12.6m)
cash.
Mydrin, BTP's subsidiary, has entered into the agreement with Scheidemandel,
a subsidiary of Deutsche Gelatine.
Some DM15.5m of the purchase price is to be paid on completion, which is
expected to be on August 31.
The remainder is due in four instalments between April 1 1995 and August 31
1996.
AGS has net assets of DM24.7m and no borrowings.
In 1993 sales amounted to DM36.6m and the loss before tax and interest
totalled DM3.3m.
In the year to March 31, BTP beat City expectations with a 48 per cent jump
in annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 30.3m.
BTP's share price yesterday added 7p to 324p.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CRH buys four US businesses for Dollars 66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, the Dublin-based inter-national construction and building materials
group, announced yesterday it had made four acquisitions in the
north-eastern US for Dollars 66.4m (Pounds 42.8m) cash.
Mr Tom Hill, president of CRH's US materials group, said the acquisitions
would strengthen the market position of the division in New York and
Pennsylvania and extend its operations into Connecticut and Massachusetts.
The most significant of the acquisitions is Balf, a Connecticut-based
producer of aggregates and asphalt. Also acquired are Keating, which
operates two quarries and three asphalt plants in Massachusetts; Lebanon
Rock, which operates a dolomite quarry in Pennsylvania; and Sullivan
Lafarge, comprising two quarries and five asphalt plants in southern New
York state.
The acquisitions produced 1.4m tons of aggregates and 1.5m tons of asphalt
in 1993.
The enlarged US materials group will have some 65 operating locations in
seven north-eastern states with nearly 100 plants.
Surplus assets from the acquisitions are expected to realise Dollars 10m,
and the consideration includes assumed debt. No goodwill arises.
CRH raised IPounds 147m in a rights issue last September, substantially
improving its balance sheet. Net year-end borrowings were brought down to
IPounds 66.6m leaving it with gearing of 11 per cent, against 47 per cent a
year earlier.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: RBS buys NatWest's share registrar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland is buying the share registration business of National
Westminster Bank in a move which will make it the UK's second largest
registrar with 25 per cent of the total market.
The purchase comes as UK share registrars face requirements for significant
investments in technology in order to meet the requirements of Crest, the
Bank of England-sponsored system for paperless share settlements.
Share registrars have shouldered a large portion of the blame for the
failure of the Taurus paperless share settlement system in March 1993 and
the Bank of England is insisting on tough performance criteria for
registrars in Crest.
It has proposed fines for registrars who do not swiftly handle client
transactions.
Yesterday, NatWest insisted that the decision to sell the registrar
business, which registers the shares of 430 companies for 6.3m shareholders,
was 'not at all connected with the requirements of Crest'.
The share registration business was not earning the desired return on
capital, it said.
In a statement, Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said:
'Following an in-depth review we have concluded that while NatWest
Registrars is producing profits it does not fit with our strategic
objective.'
The value of the transaction was not disclosed but the book value of the
assets sold is Pounds 3.89m.
NatWest employs about 550 staff in its share registration business while
Royal Bank employs about 330. Royal Bank said it did not expect to make any
redundancies when the two operations were merged.

FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca proves its critics wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and KRISHNA GUHA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Mayo, Zeneca's finance director, was beaming even more than usual
yesterday. Partly it was because he had the opportunity to boast how last
year he had timed two Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) Yankee bonds at 6.4 per
cent and 7 per cent within weeks of the bottom of the market.
His cheeriness was also because he believed his much-criticised plan to
bundle Imperial Chemical Industries' agrochemicals and speciality business
with the drugs division had been justified by the group's latest figures.
Much of the 17 per cent rise in operating profits was due to the previously
unfashionable agrochemicals and seeds division. Profits rose 45 per cent
from Pounds 85m to Pounds 123m on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 893m (Pounds
825m).
'Our agrochemicals business is having a highly successful year. In 1993
nearly all that could go wrong did go wrong. The reverse is true in 1994,'
said Mr David Barnes, chief executive.
Mr Alan Pink, chief executive of agrochemicals and seeds, said: 'We've
benefited from a combination of cost-cutting and a rising sales line.' Sales
were up 11 per cent from Pounds 726m to Pounds 807m.
The business had been assisted by new product launches which had helped win
market share, particularly in the US. The North American market was also up,
driven by wet weather and an 8 per cent increase in area planted. North
American sales were up 23 per cent at Pounds 288m (Pounds 234m).
Latin America sales increased 23 per cent to Pounds 75m, as the region began
to benefit from the GATT Uruguay round. Asia-Pacific sales were up 14 per
cent to Pounds 111m.
In Europe, the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms in 1992 had
worked their way out, said Mr Pink. Sales were virtually static at Pounds
294m. Sales at the seeds business, troubled by difficulties in eastern
Europe, were down 13 per cent at Pounds 86m (Pounds 99m).
In contrast to agrochemicals, the drugs division was more mundane. Mr Barnes
said the pharmaceuticals industry was in a period of unprecedented change,
but against that demanding background the business had growing sales and
trading profit.
Operating profits from the ongoing drugs business were up 7 per cent from
Pounds 299m to Pounds 320m, boosted by a strong performance in Europe. Group
sales were up 6 per cent from Pounds 924m to Pounds 976m. Underlying growth
was 7 per cent, but prices fell 1 percentage point.
Sales of Zestril, Zeneca's top-selling product, increased 14 per cent from
Pounds 208m to Pounds 238m. However, the drug's sales growth in the US was
disappointing at only 5 per cent. Although prescription volumes were 15 per
cent, and the heart drug continues to gain market share, it suffered price
competition from Merck's Vasotec.
Tenormin, formerly Zeneca's biggest drug whose US patents have expired,
continued to suffer a deterioration in sales, down 9 per cent from Pounds
242m to Pounds 221m. Sales of Nolvadex, the cancer treatment were static at
Pounds 174m (Pounds 175m).
Newer products, such as Diprivan, the anaesthetic, and Zoladex, another
cancer treatment, continued to grow, up 25 per cent at Pounds 119m and 31
per cent at Pounds 92m respectively.
The specialities division, renowned for its low margins, reported a 'steady
recovery' with trading profits up 11 per cent from Pounds 35m to Pounds 39m
on virtually static sales at Pounds 521m (Pounds 519m). However, Mr Mayo
said the coatings business achieved good results. Sales by the Stahl
coatings operations were up 1 per cent at Pounds 86m, while the resins
operations rose 10 per cent to Pounds 86m.
Textile colour sales were static at Pounds 115m; industrial colours rose 13
per cent to Pounds 54m; other organic chemicals were up 2 per cent at Pounds
101m. Sales of biological products, such as the meat substitute Quorn, were
up 17 per cent at Pounds 14m, partly thanks to a national advertising
campaign in the UK.

Losses of Pounds 448,000 pre-tax were announced by Westport Group, the
USM-quoted exhibition, photographic services and marketing specialist, for
the year to April 30. Last time there were profits of Pounds 8,000.
There were operating losses from continuing activities of Pounds 187,000
(Pounds 21,000 profits) on turnover of Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15m).
Mr Ralph Kanter, chairman, said the group's success with T&amp;S Lightbox and
Stanco had shown what could be achieved in spite of difficult market
conditions, and he expected those companies to continue to do well in
1994-95.
However, organic growth had been held back by losses in Fox Display and
Studios, he said.
Losses per share emerged at 0.4p (0.1p earnings).

<TEXT>
Abbey, the housebuilder in Ireland and the UK, saw a substantial rise in
pre-tax profit from IPounds 2.65m to IPounds 8.14m (Pounds 8.08m) for the
year to April 30.
Turnover increased 22 per cent from IPounds 38.8m to IPounds 47.2m,
benefiting from strong market conditions in the south-east of England.
The company said sales were expected from its Monkstown development in the
first half of the current year. It has also bought about 500 plots in Co
Wicklow, and since the year end had acquired an investment property in
Dublin for IPounds 3.5m with an initial yield of 9.1 per cent.
Earnings per share were 14.52p (4.06p), and a final dividend of 3p brings
the total for the year to 5p (2p).

FT  05 AUG 94 / Three-handed poker game at the dockyards: Bidding for sales
on the waterfront
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, made much of the equipment
orders which sweetened his defence cuts last month. In the package of
goodies was a highly publicised announcement of up to five new Trafalgar
nuclear hunter-killer submarines, costing Pounds 1.5bn. On the same day,
confirmation that the Royal dockyards at Rosyth in Fife and Devonport in
Plymouth are to be sold off was slipped quietly into a separate statement.
In fact, the submarine order and the sale of Devonport are closely
connected, and a sweltering summer poker game may develop between VSEL, the
maker of submarines; DML, Devonport's operator; and GEC, which is interested
in doing both.
DML has run Devonport for the Ministry of Defence since 1987. However, while
the incumbent management will be a strong contender when the yard is fully
privatised, a dozen other companies, including GEC and BAe, have also
registered an interest. DML's bid may be the best informed, but there is no
guarantee that it will be the highest.
Pricing the yard will be difficult because its profitability is low compared
with the theoretical value of its assets. A defence-related company turning
over around Pounds 260m a year with profits of around Pounds 12m might
attract a modest bid of much less than Pounds 100m.
Then again, this is a large slice of the waterfront in the centre of the
biggest city in the south-west of the UK. And with the MoD being coy about
what the dockyard's assets are worth, potential bids could vary widely. If a
bidder could find an alternative use for half of the dockyard space - and
Plymouth council is keen to free scarce industrial land in the area -
another bidder might be able to pay substantially more.
DML has one strong card. Last year it won the competition against Rosyth to
refit all of the Navy's nuclear submarines. Submarine refits, at more than
Pounds 100m a shot, are even more extensive, and expensive, than those for
surface warships.
Indeed, refits are very much like the original construction of the
submarine, with the exception of making the pressure hull. As a result there
is a great deal of common ground, and common costs, between the makers of
nuclear submarines and the operators of Devonport dockyard.
Nuclear submarines are traditionally made by VSEL in Barrow. In a cavernous
covered yard there called, coincidentally, the Devonshire Dock Hall, the
company has made the Trident missile submarines and the previous batch of
Trafalgar hunter-killer boats. VSEL is the natural choice to build the new
Trafalgars, which will cost Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m each, but it may not
win. GEC-Marconi is also interested in the contract, and is a much bigger
company, perhaps better able to carry the heavy risks of being the prime
contractor for a Pounds 1.5bn project.
For the first time the MoD is asking bidding companies to carry the heavy
risks of fixed-price submarine construction. That puts the small but
cash-rich VSEL at a disadvantage to the large but cash-rich GEC. VSEL also
has an interest in strengthening its competitive position for the Trafalgar
bid.
Significantly, the MoD wants whoever builds the Trafalgar boats to cover
some maintenance costs - up to and including the first refit of the
submarines. It also wants whoever buys the dockyards to give guarantees over
the cost of refits for at least the first five years after sale.
Industry observers think that the conjunction of interests makes VSEL and
DML natural partners. If the two could find a way to co-operate, or even
merge, they could cut costs from many of the common operations they would
need to run, and have greater certainty about the risks and rewards of new
build and refitting submarines.
Lower costs would allow a combination of DML and VSEL to bid a higher price
for Devonport, increasing the chances of success, and mount a lower offer
for the Trafalgar build, also improving the odds of beating GEC.
But analysts say that fitting the two jigsaw pieces together would not be
easy. VSEL is a quoted company, which as a result of the Trident contract,
has built up a Pounds 320m cash pile that it wants to invest. DML, by
contrast, is a management operation with three corporate shareholders: Brown
and Root, the US engineering group, UK pump maker Weir, and BICC, the cables
company.
Perhaps the easiest way to combine the two would be for VSEL to buy out the
existing shareholders, but they may be unwilling to sell. VSEL could bid for
Devonport alone, but analysts regard that as risky. A consortium approach
may be more likely, but then it may be difficult to gain the full benefits
of integrating the two operations.
GEC, meanwhile, may have other ideas. It hopes to win the Trafalgar order to
bolster its position as a prime contractor to the MoD - a status it
jealously covets. However, GEC's Yarrow yard on the Clyde is too small to
build the boats. Yet much of the cost of a submarine is in electronics,
which is GEC's forte, and it could sub-contract some of the building work to
VSEL at Barrow. It is also looking closely at Devonport, though the
company's legendary caution and the yard's potential liabilities may be
enough to scare GEC away.
As initial bids for the yards are due by the autumn, the three-handed poker
game may develop rapidly. Any alliances must come soon if the bids are to be
prepared in time.
But even when the calculations of the defence contractors are complete, the
best-laid plans for Devonport could still be overturned if a theme-park
bidder wants to turn half of the Plymouth yard into Mr Blobby's World of
Fun.

FT  05 AUG 94 / BA pilots may seek bigger stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways pilots are considering asking the management to increase
employee share ownership in the UK carrier.
The move coincides with proposals by pilots at USAir for employees to take a
25 per cent stake in the sixth largest US carrier, in which BA holds a 24.6
per cent stake. The staff stake would be part of a restructuring programme
involving Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in wage cuts and other concessions to
return the airline to profitability.
In contrast to the USAir pilots' proposal, BA pilots are seeking to
participate more actively in the success of the UK carrier. BA, which has
kept seeking cost-cutting and efficiency improvements from staff, has just
reported an 8.1 per cent increase in July traffic figures and is expected to
announce first-quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m on Monday.
Mr Chris Darke, secretary general of the British Airlines Pilots Association
(Balpa), the UK pilots' union, confirmed yesterday that Balpa was preparing
a feasibility study on increased employee share ownership in BA. At present,
employees own about 4 per cent of BA's shares.
Balpa is also interested in sharing in the benefits of BA's alliances with
other carriers. It has held discussions with pilot representatives from
Qantas, the Australian carrier, the French TAT and Deutsche BA.
This weekend Balpa will hold talks in London with representatives from
USAir. Yesterday the US pilots outlined their restructuring proposals at a
meeting with Mr Roger Maynard, BA's director of corporate strategy. Both
USAir and BA managements have responded coolly.
One of the pilots' requests is for BA to invest a further Dollars 450m in
USAir. BA, which has already invested Dollars 400m, has made it clear it
will make no further investment until it is satisfied that USAir is on the
road to long-term recovery. It has raised the possibility of writing off its
USAir investment.
The managements of USAir and BA are now waiting for a detailed package of
proposals from all USAir unions.
However, any agreement on an employee ownership scheme at USAir is likely to
require lengthy negotiations, not just between the airline and unions, but
between the unions themselves. At issue is how much each group of workers is
prepared to sacrifice to produce the cost savings the airline needs to
survive.
The pilots' union has suggested that employees get 25 per cent of the
airline's shares and Dollars 700m in preferred stock in return for labour
concessions worth Dollars 2.5bn over five years. But it wants its own
members to contribute only Dollars 750m worth of the concessions, while
other workers contribute Dollars 1.75bn. Yesterday the Association of Flight
Attendants agreed with the concessions-for-equity concept, but disagreed
with the proposed allocation of concessions. The International Association
of Machinists has also expressed strong reservations.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Kidder Peabody investigation blames Jett for false profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody yesterday tried again to put an end to the bond trading
scandal which has dogged it since April by publishing an investigation it
commissioned into the affair.
The report pins the blame on Mr Joseph Jett, the government bond trader who
Kidder has claimed created Dollars 350m (Pounds 226m) of fictitious profits
in its government bond trading business in order to boost his own
performance bonus.
It adds that 'lax oversight, as well as poor judgments and missed
opportunities' on the part of Kidder executives meant that Mr Jett's false
profits were not identified for more than two years.
Mr Jett's lawyer, Mr Kenneth Warner, called the report 'predictably
one-sided and incomplete', and said his client would be vindicated 'when a
truly independent investigation is completed'.
Mr Jett's sacking in April prompted widespread concern on Wall Street about
Kidder's financial health, and led General Electric, its parent, to issue a
series of statements of support for the firm. The fall-out led eventually to
the departure of Mr Michael Carpenter, Kidder's chief executive.
Mr Edward Cerullo, head of Kidder's fixed income division, also left in
recent weeks. According to yesterday's report, Mr Cerullo's supervision of
Mr Jett was 'seriously deficient', though it adds: 'It is clear that he and
Jett were not co-conspirators.'
Kidder said yesterday it had also sacked Mr Melvin Mullin, who was directly
responsible for supervising Mr Jett until February 1993.
The investigation was carried out by Mr Gary Lynch, who as head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division in the 1980s
pursued Mr Michael Milken and Mr Ivan Boesky, both of whom were later
convicted.
Mr Jett has claimed that the disputed trades were carried out at the request
of his superiors, and were intended to put a gloss on Kidder's financial
position by removing securities from its balance sheet. His trades are
understood to have been the subject of investigation by a number of
authorities since April, though no charges have been brought.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Healthy core helps TI advance 11% in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing demand for car parts and industrial seals helped TI Group, the
specialist engineering and aerospace company, to achieve an 11 per cent
increase in first-half profits.
The group announced that pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 62.8m to Pounds
69.8m as all three core businesses - John Crane, Bundy and Dowty Aerospace -
got the better of mixed trading conditions to increase operating profits.
Sales on continuing operations increased 5.2 per cent to Pounds 722.7m.
Underlying operating profits - excluding last year's Pounds 5.3m gain from
the electronics and fuel systems businesses, which have since been sold -
rose 23 per cent to Pounds 76.2m.
The shares gained 7p to 412p.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman, said the figures showed the group was on
course with its strategy of developing global businesses in niche areas.
The improved performance was underpinned by a 21 per cent increase in
operating profits at Bundy, the tubes and fluid systems company, which
benefited from buoyant automotive production in North America and orders
from European manufacturers. Its operating profits rose from Pounds 23.8m to
Pounds 28.9m on increased turnover of Pounds 326.3m (Pounds 301.4m).
Profits at John Crane, the industrial seals and polymers business, rose 15
per cent to Pounds 34.6m on sales of Pounds 246.6m (Pounds 227.4m).
Last year's restructuring of Dowty Aerospace helped the aircraft components
business lift profits from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 13.6m despite reduced sales
of Pounds 149.8m (Pounds 158.4m). Sir Christopher said Dowty's lucrative
contracts with Airbus Industries and its new landing-gear joint venture with
Messier of France would enable it to exploit an upturn in demand. Improved
cash flow and gains on property disposals and exchange rates also allowed
the group to cut net borrowings from Pounds 241.1m to Pounds 136.3m,
equivalent to gearing of 41.5 per cent.
Analysts welcomed the figures and said they would have been better had it
not been for a Pounds 1.9m reduction in pension credits; Pounds 1.2m of
costs associated with operations in hyper-inflationary economies; and Pounds
2m in redundancy and reorganisation costs. Earnings per share rose to 10.1p
(9p) and an increased interim dividend of 4.05p (3.85p) is declared.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Zeneca dented by Pounds 100m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 100m restructuring charge dragged down pre-tax profits at Zeneca,
the UK bioscience group, which yesterday reported a 3 per cent fall from
Pounds 362m to Pounds 351m during the first half.
The exceptional provision was to enable Zeneca to withdraw from the troubled
eastern European seeds market, and rationalise sites and cut costs in the
agrochemicals and specialities businesses.
Mr David Barnes, chief executive, said: 'East Europe is an important
agricultural growing area. But sadly the economic infrastructure is in
turmoil. There are huge logistical problems in selling seeds, harvesting the
product and then distrib-uting it on the international market. That creates
an extended credit risk, and export credit has been withdrawn - not just for
seeds, but everything. It's just not worth the risk.'
The seeds business received most of the provisions - Pounds 51.2m, with
agrochemicals and specialities receiving Pounds 37.2m and Pounds 11.9m
respectively.
Mr John Mayo, finance director, rejected suggestions that Zeneca could be
subject to a hostile takeover. On Wednesday, the group's share price rose
13p to 771p on takeover speculation after American Home Products made a
Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.5bn) unsolicited bid for American Cyanamid.
Mr Alan Pink, chief executive of the agrochemicals and seeds division, said
the agrochemicals operations of American Cyanamid, the US group, would make
a good fit with Zeneca's. He said a joint venture might generate significant
benefits, or that Zeneca might be interested in acquiring the business at a
reasonable price.
However, he warned: 'We are not ready to enter a bidding race.'
Zeneca's turnover rose 3 per cent from Pounds 2.32bn to Pounds 2.38bn.
Excluding disposals, underlying volume was up 7 per cent. Operating profits
at ongoing businesses rose 17 per cent from Pounds 405m to Pounds 473m.
The dividend was increased 2 per cent from 10.5p to 10.75p. Earnings per
share fell 22 per cent from 32.7p to 25.4p, the result of the share issue at
the time of the demerger from Imperial Chemical Industries last year, and
the exceptional restructuring charge.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Chinese pirates fail to take Mickey out of Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With a wave of his magic wand, and the help of his friends, the lawyers,
Mickey Mouse won a landmark victory over copyright pirates in China, when a
Beijing court ruled that his image could not be used without the US Walt
Disney entertainment group's permission.
The year-long lawsuit is the first case to be brought against Chinese
publishers by a US company, according to the state-run Guangming Daily.
Disney said last night: 'We're delighted. It shows that China is responding
to the interests of the west in protecting intellectual copyrights.'
The ruling, revealed yesterday, was welcomed by other companies which are
probing the lucrative Chinese markets.
Mr Art Barron, chairman of Time Warner International, a division of the US
entertainment group, said: 'This ruling should be good for everyone in the
entertainment industry. The problem is who enforces it, but it's a good
start.'
China has vowed to crack down on piracy as part of its attempts to gain
support for its return to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which
it left more than 40 years ago. The US has claimed that piracy is costing
foreign companies billions of dollars.
The recently formed intellectual property chamber of the Beijing People's
Intermediate Court ruled on Wednesday that the Beijing Children's Publishing
Press, Beijing Publishing Press and New China Book Store Distribution Centre
had pirated Disney characters in a range of children's books.
The books, which were based on animated feature films, duplicated some of
Disney's most famous and valuable cartoon characters, including Mickey
Mouse, Cinderella, Peter Pan and Snow White.
According to Chinese newspapers, the defendants argued that they had acted
legally under a licence which they said was obtained from a company in Hong
Kong.
Mr Chuck Champlin, communications director for Disney Consumer Products,
speaking from the company's headquarters in Burbank, California, said last
night that the group had asked the court to be recompensed for lost
revenues.
Disney has about 70 boutique stalls in China's mushrooming department
stores. But it has been deterred from wider distribution of its character
goods, including their use on mugs, clothes and videos, by the extent of
piracy of Disney images, according to executives.

FT  05 AUG 94 / MPs criticise customs for VAT administration: Half of
British traders underdeclare tax payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than half of British traders are underdeclaring the amount of value
added tax they owe, the Commons public affairs committee said yesterday in a
report that strongly criticised the performance of HM Customs and Excise.
Customs, however, chose to interpret the MPs' rebuke as a compliment to its
improving efficiency. 'We would consider this as a tribute to our officers'
alertness - it means that we are finding a great deal of the
under-reporting,' it said.
The Commons committee emphasised, as a matter of 'concern', findings in a
recent National Audit Office report that the level of VAT undeclared by
companies in 1992-1993 was Pounds 2bn.
Some 55 per cent of traders were found by Customs officials to be
underdeclaring VAT. About a quarter of the shortfall stemmed from 'genuine
error or misunderstanding' and most of the rest from a 'lack of reasonable
care'. Only 20 per cent of companies contacted had a 'full' understanding of
the VAT system, although two-thirds said they had 'adequate' knowledge, the
auditors' report said.
The committee yesterday called on Customs and Excise to reduce the cost of
VAT compliance for companies and to improve business understanding of the
system. Customs said it was already seeking ways of improving its business
contacts.
The committee concluded that VAT was providing a 'heavy burden on business'.
It expressed concern 'that there are 156 main regulations affecting the
operation of VAT and that since 1985 there have been 209 regulatory
changes'.
It pointed out that the cost of complying with VAT regulations was Pounds
1.6bn for traders, nearly four times more than the cost of administering the
system.
Customs insisted that the report had been 'highly selective' in the
presentation of the figures, and said 60 per cent of the new regulations
since 1985 had been developed to reduce compliance costs.
Tax accountants said that the Pounds 2bn underdeclaration figure did not
necessarily reflect tax lost to the Exchequer.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Factory orders and jobless data lift hopes for German
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in manufacturing orders and a sharp fall in unemployment yesterday
reinforced the belief that a broad-based recovery is under way in west
Germany.
There were also signs that the erosion of jobs in the east was coming to a
halt, according to Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labour
Office.
Seasonally adjusted for the effects of the summer lull, west German
unemployment fell 18,000. This was the second successive monthly decline
after 2 1/2 years of increases, and the biggest drop since the early spring
of 1991. June data showed an adjusted fall of 4,000.
Provisional figures for manufacturing orders in west Germany were also
better than expected, showing a fully adjusted 2.2 per cent rise in volume
in June over May, and an 8.5 per cent increase against June 1993.
The latest economic statistics coincided with an upward revision in the
economic growth forecast of the Munich-based Ifo institute. Thanks to the
steady recovery in demand, it is expecting pan-German growth of 2 per cent
this year, against a former figure of 1.5 per cent, and 3 per cent in 1995.
Although the number of people out of work in the west rose an unadjusted
92,600, this partly reflects school-leavers joining the labour market.
Another hopeful sign was a 34 per cent rise in the number of vacancies in
manufacturing industry in the west.
In east Germany, the unadjusted jobless figure rose by 19,000. The
pan-German unadjusted jobless total of 3.7m pushed the unemployment rate
from 8 per cent to 8.3 per cent in the west and from 14.8 per cent to 15.1
per cent in the east.
Economic analysts agreed with Mr Jagoda that the figures indicated
stabilisation in the labour market after three years of heavy job losses.
They were also encouraged by the better than expected manufacturing orders.
Ifo stressed that although export orders had started the recovery process,
steadily improving business expectations had also contributed to a clear
recovery in investment spending.
Ifo also said real disposable incomes would continue to be squeezed in west
Germany - forecasting a real decline of 2.5 per cent this year and 3.5 next.
Even in east Germany, where wages have rapidly been approaching western
levels, a 0.5 per cent drop was expected next year, it said.

FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Airtours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours' 2 per cent fall yesterday suggests that the equity market is
unimpressed by the outbreak of price wars in the travel industry. It does
not yet have any serious reason for worry. The much-hyped price-cutting
relates to next year's summer holiday range, whereas the crucial factor for
package holiday operators is how far they have to discount late bookings in
order to soak up surplus capacity. What matters is how well the current
season is going. The indications are that 1994 could be a year in which tour
operators prove unusually adept at matching supply with demand. Though 1.5m
packages remain unsold, this is a relatively small number given the rate at
which holidays have been selling.
It looks therefore as though price-cutting is largely a publicity stunt. If
so, it is not without risks. Advance selling of next summer's holidays could
upset sales of winter holidays, or customers could end up simply too
confused to part with any money. But this is a small concern given the
broader shape of Airtours' strategy.
Having diversified into the Scandinavian market, Airtours has no real need
of a head-on confrontation with Thomson in the UK to secure its growth. Its
track record suggests it should make a success out of its move into the
cruise market, while its carefully-controlled hotel purchases protect it
against rising room rates. Given the volatility of earnings in the travel
business, Airtours inevitably trades at a discount to the market, but the
current prospective discount of around 25 per cent looks unnecessarily low.
Having cut its brochure prices, Airtours may have indirectly offered
investors a bargain.

FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: TI Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the initial disappointment with its Dowty purchase, it is gratifying
to see things coming right for TI Group. Some impact of economic recovery
was expected in yesterday's interim figures, though it is still largely
confined to the US. More fundamental is TI's focus on cash. Gearing has
halved to 42 per cent in the pace of a year, thanks partly to the kind of
working capital squeeze that might be expected from a finance director
imported from GKN.
Admittedly Dowty's Pounds 500m price tag still looks high. Recovery is late
to affect the airline industry, but margins at Dowty Aerospace have improved
to over 9 per cent and the company reports a pick-up in spare parts orders.
Once the recovery in this sector is felt, Dowty could look a solid,
diversified, cash-generative engineering company - a far cry from its rather
flashy image of the 1980s.
The trouble, as so often with cyclical stocks, is that this is already
discounted in the price. A prospective multiple of around 20 times is hardly
cheap, especially when the dividend is likely to be well under two times
covered. Having failed to cut its dividend in the recession, payout growth
will almost certainly lag earnings in the recovery. One has to hope that
desire for a bit more fizz will not eventually lead TI to squander its cash
on ill-conceived acquisitions.

FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Kleinwort Benson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the recent weakness of merchant bank shares was due solely to worries
about the prospects for dealing profits Kleinwort Benson's figures provided
little reassurance. Net dealing income was down by more than half in the
first six months after a very sticky second quarter. While the fall was
cushioned somewhat by lower bonuses to staff, it was asking a lot for the
fee earning businesses to make up the difference. But they did so with room
to spare. Fund management profits have suddenly shifted into a higher gear,
thanks partly to a quick payback from its expansion in the US, and though
they remain modest by the standards of SG Warburg or Schroders, they now
account for more than 40 per cent of group profits.
Kleinwort shows there is still good money to be made selling European stocks
into the American market and its investment in international equities in
general is being well rewarded. The mergers and acquisitions business is
also having a good run and while the gravy train of international
privatisations will not keep rolling for ever Kleinwort's experience in
Argentina shows that they can be an excellent entree into that country's
private sector. Perhaps most encouraging of all, the bank says the
proportion of new mandates it is winning has never been higher.
Given the improved quality of its earnings and abundance of capital
Kleinwort could well decide to step up the pace of dividend growth. Yet the
shares now yield over 4.8 per cent and the 30 per cent discount to Warburg
looks increasingly difficult to justify.

FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Zeneca in shape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the plan to split ICI was announced two years ago, the decision to
combine pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialty chemicals in a demerged
company raised a few eyebrows. While the synergies between the businesses
remain a matter for debate, Zeneca's portfolio is proving its worth in
financial terms. The drugs business is going through a relatively lean
patch, but agrochemicals and specialties are showing strong recoveries.
Yesterday's 31 per cent rise in pre-tax profits before exceptional items was
more than the market anticipated.
The worry is that the chemicals side of the business may have to provide the
pep to profits for some time to come. Drugs sales increased by a relatively
modest 6 per cent in the first half, and fell for the second period running
in the US. Underlying growth may be slightly better than this suggests -
destocking of Zestril, Zeneca's biggest drug, depressed the overall rate of
growth - but the competitive climate in the US is not getting easier.
Zeneca's promising selection of new drugs is still some years from making a
big impact on profits.
With a fair wind - literally, given the impact of the weather on
agrochemicals profits - Zeneca should still be able to deliver the kind of
earnings growth shareholders are expecting. By topping up its stock of
provisions the company has carefully created room for additional
cost-savings. With gearing of around 18 per cent and falling, Zeneca could
also afford to buy additional growth. If the squeeze in pharmaceuticals gets
worse, it may have to.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Pitting Serb against Serb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Yugoslav government's announcement that it is severing all ties with the
Bosnian Serbs, after their refusal to accept the international peace plan,
has an uncanny air of deja vu. In May 1993 President Slobodan Milosevic made
a similar announcement after the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the Vance-Owen
peace plan. At that time the Russian foreign minister was lobbying hard in
favour of the plan, and Lord Owen, one of its co-authors, hoped that
President Bill Clinton would persuade President Boris Yeltsin to agree to
the use of Nato air power to prevent supplies reaching the Bosnian Serbs.
In the event, the Vance-Owen plan was allowed to die, and - not surprisingly
 -Serbia's proclaimed sanctions against its Bosnian kinsmen were never
applied. Perhaps Mr Milosevic never had any serious intention of applying
them, and perhaps he has no such intention now. But this time his bluff must
be called. Even if he is completely insincere, the announcement at least
shows how anxious he is to get the international sanctions on Serbia lifted,
by disclaiming responsibility for the Bosnian Serbs' intransigence. It
suggests he is worried by the decision to tighten those sanctions taken by
the 'contact group' of foreign ministers in Geneva last weekend.
Having got so far, the contact group must insist that Serbia and Montenegro
prove beyond any doubt, before there can be any question of relaxing the
sanctions against them, that they are really co-operating in the complete
isolation of the Bosnian Serbs.
This means they must be prepared to accept the deployment of UN monitors all
along their borders with Bosnia, and must give those monitors every
assistance in verifying that no supplies other than food and medicine are
going in. If the UN identifies significant breaches of the embargo and the
Yugoslav government either denies them or claims to be unable to stop them,
it must be told that Nato air power will be used to try and interdict them.
As long as this strategy is being seriously applied and seems to have any
chance of success, it probably makes sense to hold back on lifting the
embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian government. This remains deeply
divisive within the contact group, and its short-term military effects would
be at best uncertain.
That does not mean that any further Serb encroachments on the areas of
Bosnia declared as 'safe havens' under United Nations protection should be
tolerated. Existing UN resolutions authorise the use of air power to defend
them, and the UN should not allow those resolutions to be violated with
impunity.
Moreover, it must be understood that the logic of cutting off supplies to
the Bosnian Serbs is that, if they persist in rejecting the peace plan, they
face military defeat. That means that the international community must keep
open the option of lifting the embargo and giving active assistance to the
Bosnian government if all else fails.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Rail impasse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK rail dispute has come to resemble the trench warfare of the first
world war. Both sides have seemed willing to slug it out whatever the cost.
Neither can deliver a knock-out blow.
The losers have been non-combatants: the passengers and freight customers
who have suffered disruption and delay; businesses with employees who are
unable to get to work; and the train operating companies which must
recompense their passengers and pay their staff's wages despite being unable
to run full services.
The most depressing aspect of the dispute has been the apparent paralysis at
Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs British Rail's track and
signalling operations. The mysterious withdrawal of an offer that might have
avoided the whole dispute launched the strike action. The amount that
Railtrack has been prepared to offer has crept up gradually, but the company
has failed to convey the details to the signal staff. The board, including
its chairman Mr Bob Horton, has failed to demonstrate control of events in a
way that would reassure train passengers or freight customers.
Yesterday's vote by the signalling supervisors not to join the strike,
however, offers an opportunity to bring the dispute to a conclusion.
Railtrack should seize the initiative to settle the dispute as soon as
possible. A businesslike company would be prepared, if necessary, to offer
more for a speedy settlement, moving quickly thereafter to recover the
expense by a thorough-going reorganisation of the signalling staff.
An essential element in such a package would be individual contracts of
employment for signal staff. The idea that a union such as RMT should
exercise a veto over necessary efficiency improvements is a relic of a
bygone age.
If extra money is politically impossible, then Railtrack must step up the
pressure on the signal staff and RMT to accept the current offer. One option
would be to ballot the striking staff on the offer, preferably after making
it crystal clear just what is on the table. After eight weeks of strikes -
and with the supervisors unwilling to join them - an increasing number of
signalling staff will be realising that the cost of winning an extra per
cent far outweighs the likely benefits.
A tougher option would be an ultimatum to the signal staff to accept the
offer or consider themselves to have resigned. This might produce enough
acceptances to keep the network running - especially if linked to a symbolic
concession to tempt the doubters. But it is a high-risk strategy: if it
fails, British Rail could be shut down for months while replacements are
trained.
Whatever the option chosen, Railtrack must now act. One of the hoped-for
benefits of privatising British Rail must be that both sides will in future
take a more realistic view of what it is sensible to inflict on those who
pay their wages.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Tick, tick, tick, tick them off: Should the world worry
about the spread of nuclear weapons, ask Jimmy Burns and Bronwen Maddox
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Combating the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the most pressing tasks
facing the world's diplomats. Talks due to resume in Geneva today are aimed
at reducing one area of increasing tension - the nuclear capability and
intentions of North Korea's reclusive communist regime. US officials will
again try to persuade their North Korean counterparts to permit nuclear
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog.
The episode raises a worrying question: how many other countries could be
close to developing nuclear weapons? Concern about North Korea's intentions
followed the agency's discovery after the 1990 Gulf war that Iraq had an
extensive programme to develop nuclear weapons. Last month, German police
uncovered a cache of weapons-grade plutonium in a garage, raising fears that
nuclear material from the former Soviet Union was finding its way on to the
black market.
The extent to which various countries are capable of developing nuclear
weapons will become more urgent next year when the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, which aims to curb the spread of such weapons, is due to be
reviewed. To date, 164 countries have signed the treaty, drawn up under the
auspices of the UN after the second world war. It distinguishes between five
countries that it permits to have nuclear weapons programmes - the US,
China, the UK, France and Russia (formerly the Soviet Union) - and other
signatories that have agreed not to develop such weapons.
But can the treaty constrain the military ambitions of the non-nuclear
signatories under its inspections regime? Western governments and the agency
agree on which countries are closest to nuclear weapons capability. Heading
the list of worries, along with North Korea, are India, Pakistan and Israel.
The latter three, which have refused to sign the treaty, have long been
suspected of possessing facilities to produce weapons-grade nuclear
material, and been regarded as de facto weapons states.
According to estimates by Mr Harold Feiveson, a specialist in energy and
proliferation issues at Princeton University in the US, Israel and India may
have acquired 0.3 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium by the end of 1990,
enough for 100 bombs each, and Pakistan 0.2 tonnes of weapons-grade uranium,
enough for 10-15 bombs.
It may be beyond the scope of next year's review to bring the trio into the
treaty since India and Pakistan appear to regard its discrimination between
nuclear and non-nuclear states as unacceptable. The review may, by contrast,
have a better chance of addressing a second, longer-term concern: the
technologically sophisticated Asian countries. This group, which includes
Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, is developing large civil nuclear
programmes, giving governments access to large quantities of nuclear
material which could potentially be used for weapons.
Japan's civil nuclear programme is extensive, with 46 nuclear power plants
and seven more on the way. According to Professor Richard Wilson, a
physicist at Harvard University: 'Japan can make a bomb at any time. The
only disagreement is whether it could take two weeks or two years.'
Japan is also likely to accumulate tonnes of surplus plutonium over the next
decade, by reprocessing used fuel rods from the core of civil nuclear
reactors. The government had intended to use the stocks as fuel for its new
generation 'fast-breeder' reactors, which use plutonium rather than the
traditional uranium, but has put development of the reactors on hold.
Despite protests from the Japanese government that it has no intention of
using plutonium for military purposes, other countries, particularly the US,
have been concerned that the potential weapons capability represented by
these stockpiles will lead to a dominant Japanese diplomatic influence in
the region.
Addressing Asia's military ambitions will be one of the toughest tasks
facing next year's review. That task could be complicated by the outcome of
the North Korea-US talks beginning today. If North Korea wins economic
concessions from the US in return for accepting nuclear inspections, other
countries may seek to use the same brinkmanship in the hope of gaining
similar rewards.
While concern about Asia appears to be growing as the region becomes more
prosperous, there are nevertheless some grounds for optimism in other parts
of the world:
Under a deal in January negotiated by the US, the former Soviet republics of
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have agreed to transfer the 3,100 warheads
on their territory to Russia. This will help diminish the likelihood of
trade in weapons-grade nuclear material, of the kind uncovered in Germany
last month (see accompanying article). Moreover, the three republics have
indicated that they will sign the treaty and not develop weapons.
One note of caution needs to be sounded: Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's
president, has given only a lukewarm acknowledgement of his predecessor's
promise to sign the treaty, saying that he will 'study' the question.
However, if the transfer of the weapons is completed, the chance of the
republics being technologically capable of re-arming is slim. Mr Feiveson
comments that the republics 'do not currently possess the means to produce
weapons-usable material', as the Soviet facilities to manufacture nuclear
weapons were based entirely in Russia. Argentina, Brazil and South Africa,
which had developed or begun to develop nuclear weapons, have renounced the
capability on economic and political grounds. In the Middle East, there is
little sign that countries are pursuing nuclear programmes with any vigour.
Mr David Kyd, spokesman at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Vienna
headquarters, says: 'Surprisingly, perhaps, most Middle Eastern countries do
not have a great deal of money to devote to (nuclear research).'
The agency describes Egypt, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia, all signatories to
the treaty, as having small research programmes that are essentially at the
laboratory stage, many years and hundreds of millions of dollars away from
weapons capability. Western intelligence experts are scrutinising Iran's
procurement of foreign technology for signs of a weapons programme. But
their suspicions that Iran has embarked on early stages of projects to
enrich uranium with Pakistani and Chinese help have not been confirmed.
Libya, also a signatory to the treaty, did start nuclear research in the
mid-1980s, but its interest has waned, partly through lack of money. Many of
the Russian scientists advising the country have gone home and the project
lacks spare parts, according to agency inspectors.
Algeria, alone in the Middle East, is pursuing nuclear research with
determination. It has two civil reactors, one in the University of Algiers,
and a second, larger, Chinese-built reactor near the Atlas mountains in the
north. The agency monitors these facilities under a special arrangement,
although Algeria has not signed the treaty.
This picture is far from complete: North Korea and Iraq provide warnings
that secretive regimes can keep nuclear programmes covert despite the best
efforts of western intelligence agencies. However, it is possible to draw
some conclusions. First, development of usable nuclear weapons has been
limited to a tiny handful of countries beyond the five nuclear states of the
non-proliferation treaty. Second, the technologically easiest and cheapest
route to developing nuclear weapons is that employed by North Korea - using
nuclear material from civil reactors - rather than that employed by Iraq -
constructing elaborate, separate facilities. Given that this is the case,
Asian enthusiasm for civil nuclear power may pose as much of a difficulty to
curbing proliferation as the endeavours of countries such as North Korea and
Iraq.
The challenge for next year's treaty review is to devise a further
inspection regime acceptable to nuclear and non-nuclear countries alike.
This must reflect the changes in nuclear capability since the original
treaty was drawn up, and reflect the aspirations of emerging nuclear states.
North Korea's negotiations with the US made clear that dissatisfaction with
the treaty's bargain between nuclear and non-nuclear countries is high.
Finding a new pact which will curb the spread of such weapons remains a
formidable challenge.
