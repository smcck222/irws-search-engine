FT  28 SEP 94 / Arts: Bruckner and Mahler - South Bank music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER

<TEXT>
One of those eternal pairings, like Wordsworth and Coleridge or Holmes and
Watson, Bruckner and Mahler were featured on consecutive nights at the Royal
Festival Hall, the sixth symphony of Bruckner on Sunday, the ninth of Mahler
on Monday. The first was played by the London Philharmonic under Franz
Welser-Most as the opening concert of its new season. The atmosphere - and
indeed the playing - spoke rather of a tired end to something rather than
pastures new. The hall was half-empty, the orchestra's handling of
Bruckner's difficult idiom dutiful, even tepid, rather than
forward-springing or inspirational.
How indispensable it is for a Bruckner orchestra to believe in every note it
plays - however repetitious the notes may be] Bruckner deals in great brute
primordial lumps of sound - the polar opposite of Mahler's sinuous,
chameleon irony - and the players must invest even the most naked and
obvious-seeming gestures with a sort of reverential sparkle. This never
happened on Sunday. One never had the sense that a musical universe was
being created out of nothing. One got a sense that the players were bored
and unimpressed.
True, there were a few fully achieved moments, carrying the weight of
Brucknerian mystery: for instance, that ominously cold change of harmony
(strings, low brass and low clarinet) at the end of the Adagio; or the brief
upper-sting pizzicato figures which introduce the third movement Trio. But
for all Welser-Most's Brucknerian pedigree, there was a feeling of
dispensability about this performance. His account of Messiaen's four
symphonic meditations L'Ascension, an early (1933), pre-birdsong, very
beautiful work, was, however, strong: the third movement toccata splendidly
athletic in Messiaen's uniquely exultant fashion; the final movement's
prayerful, peculiar string sonority bitingly realised. And it was a bold but
wholly appropriate idea to preface Bruckner with music, albeit very
different in character, by another composer who builds with mighty blocks of
sound and builds to the glory of God.
Mahler's ninth symphony, like his tenth, but signally unlike his eighth,
seems to mark a retreat from confidence in any such glory, the cold reality
of death now seeming all. Certainly in the reading given by the NHK Symphony
Orchestra, Tokyo - on a European tour under Jerusalem-born conductor Eliahu
Inbal - it was the stark, pained, sardonic, unillusioned aspects of the work
that were emphasised, by means of unyielding tempi and technically brilliant
unsparing clarity of texture.
This Japanese orchestra is astonishing skilful at rendering the score's fine
detail and fiercely singing out its complexly interwoven strands of
near-perpetual polyphony. In the first movement - perhaps Mahler's most
extraordinary - I found this forceful precision exhilarating, and objected
only to an all too blazingly prominent first trumpet. But increasingly I
came to miss the essential Mahlerian qualities of tonal refinement and
rubato phrasing. There was something literal-minded about the brilliant
skill. In avoiding sentimentality, Inbal sacrificed inwardness. The
Rondo-Burleske third movement's touching pre-echo of the slow finale was
indulged with but the barest lyricism; and the opening of the great Adagio,
though intoned by a mightily impressive body of strings, somehow failed to
convey genuine weight of feeling. It studiously avoided warmth.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Arts: Goodness triumphant in 'La Cenerentola' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
La bonta in trionfo was Ferretti's subtitle for La Cenerentola, Rossini's
Cinderella opera. That was a bit of lily-gilding: never has a happy ending
been so earnestly, repetitiously signalled, from the start of the opera.
(Perhaps Ferretti was a little anxious; though La Cenerentola is a comic
masterpiece, it has its cruel moments.) At Covent Garden on Monday,
nonetheless, goodness triumphed so wonderfully  - in the person of Olga
Borodina - that the subtitle seemed to tell the plain truth.
Miss Borodina's Angelina looks placid and artless, a sleepy pussy-cat. From
about the second line of her favourite song, however, as the voice swung
down into its rich low register, everyone suddenly realised that we were to
get something extraordinary. There is translucent warmth and depth in her
mezzo, but also an uncanny immediacy; one feels personally addressed. Though
it is a big voice, with power to spare, it always retains that quality of
modest, intimate confession.
She went from strength to strength. The first passages of coloratura found
her not quite focussed, but once adjusted she soared away, dazzling more
with every number. At the close, in the great 'Non piu mesta', fluid art
vied gloriously with radiant feeling. Somehow the poignant simplicity
remained intact, as if her Angelina has never expected anything, is amazed
and delighted by what happens, but takes it all in her stride.
This is a performance to treasure. Everybody else in this Cenerentola is
well up to form, and more. Michael Hampe's production, elegant, unfussy and
perfectly sympathetic, has again been revived by David Massarella; since
half the cast are new to it, one should credit him with some degree of
creative input.
The nasty step-sisters, for example - Jennifer Rhys-Davies and Christine
Botes, both new - inhabit their roles with bright comic malevolence,
excellently mimed but staying well within credible bounds (and singing very
well). The new Alcindoro, that curious Christian mystic who replaces the
fairy godmother, is Alastair Miles, who has at least three-quarters of the
appropriate gravitas and a fine, fervent uplift. Don Magnifico, the
stepfather so disgracefully awful that he can only be funny, is Simone
Alaimo, whose Sicilian extravagance is probably all his own, ebullient and
stylish.
Returning from earlier casts we have Raul Gimenez as the fairytale Prince
Don Ramiro, and Francois Le Roux as his fly valet Dandini. Gimenez is a
long-standing Rossinian stalwart; here he was in particularly affecting
voice, which in his case is like very dry sherry with a strong kick. Last
time round - with the enchanting Anne Sofie von Otter - I do not remember
such a magical rapport between him and Angelina in their first duet, each
musing raptly to himself or herself. This time it drew tears.
Le Roux is again so personable and clever that a little vocal fudging goes
unnoticed. The new conductor is Bruno Campanella, who offers a rare
combination of light, nervy touch and a rigorous way with quick tempi: quite
right in Rossini, though the singers had to scramble a bit. I wouldn't have
missed it for anything.
In repertory at the Royal Opera to October 15.

<TEXT>
Today is the 60th birthday of Brigitte Bardot, who has not made a movie for
over twenty years and who, even in this nostalgic age, is still not regarded
as much of a actress. But her name endures, perhaps because her provocative
pout pointed the puritanical 1950s towards the liberated 1960s. The fact
that she rubbishes stardom and her own beauty and devotes herself to animals
adds to her mystique. BBC 1 celebrates her anniversary at 9.30 with And God
created Bardot.
The Bardot movie that follows at 11.45, Viva Maria], is hardly typical. It
is a star vehicle for Bardot and Jeanne Moreau, directed by Louis Malle, who
has them romping through Latin America in the early 20th century.
The return of University Challenge (BBC 2 at 8.30) is a triumph for back to
basics, though one hopes that new question master Jeremy Paxman returns to
type and gets rattier with the students.
Somehow Ian Botham just escapes being a yob, and with a new biography to
promote he must be happy at the timing of the sympathetic portrait he
receives on BBC 1 at 10.55.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Arts: Adult choices made at the Prix Italia - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should grown ups really take much notice of television? Is there not
something inherently childish and third rate about a medium which lionises
Jeremy Beadle and Chris Evans? Flicking through Britain's four terrestrial
channels on the Saturday morning before I went to Italy I found American
accented rock and roll on the first, an American lecturing on the retina on
the second, American accented rock and roll on the third, and American
football on the fourth. No doubt the broadcasters would tell us that
Saturday mornings are for children and Open University students, but the
weekend is not the only time that you find this sort of four-pronged
Morton's Fork, and it is not clear why broadcasters assume the English
prefer all things American.
Happily the Prix Italia, held this year in Turin, has served, yet again, to
prove that however much pernicious rubbish is produced, however much
politicians insist that television must be dominated by the profit motive,
however depressingly popular such schlock as Gladiators and Neighbours may
become, there are still people around the world using television as a medium
for music and other arts, for grown up drama and - perhaps most impressively
of all - as a vivid and telling way of showing us what is going on in parts
of the world remote from us. What is more, according to the international
juries at this broadcasting festival - the oldest in Europe and therefore,
probably, in the world - a disproportionately large number of those people
are British.
There are three television categories: music and arts, drama and
documentary. From the 24 programmes submitted by 20 countries in music and
arts the jury gave the Prix Italia to Strange Fish, an engrossing, sad and
funny ballet, choreographed by Lloyd Newson for the DV8 company and produced
by the BBC. Co-producer was Reiner Moritz, a sort of late 20th century
renaissance prince of television who has spent his whole life putting his
money (and anybody else's that he can acquire) where his mouth is, in
furtherance of the arts on television. There is no one else in Europe quite
like Moritz, and it is gratifying to see his name associated with yet
another prize winner.
From 26 programmes submitted by companies in 20 countries, the drama jury
selected The Snapper as its winner. Another BBC production, this was written
by Roddy Doyle, is set in Dublin, and tells the awful but hilarious story of
Sharon Curley's unplanned, unwanted, and yet triumphant pregnancy. From 27
programmes originating in 21 countries the documentary jury chose Les
Lapirov Passent A L'Ouest from La Sept in France as their winner. But the
'Special' prize in this category went, yet again, to the BBC, this time for
Black Daisies For The Bride, a programme which combines Tony Harrison's
verse with documentary film from an Alzheimer's ward and moments of
dramatisation from the earlier lives of the victims, creating a mixture of
nostalgia and bleakness.
Out of six television prizes, the BBC won three and the rest of the world
three (one each for France, Germany and Sweden). Seen alongside so much
other material it should be said that the British winners did seem the right
choices, a fact which forces reconsideration of the thoughts expressed in my
opening paragraph. If Britain's 'third rate' television can look so good
alongside other people's, what on earth is it like living with theirs?. The
answer, I suspect, is much the same as with ours, because so much of the
material on the main channels, especially during peak time, is similar or
even identical. Gladiators is an American format, Neighbours an Australian
soap, Beadle's cringe television seems to have its counterpart in virtually
every other country, and everywhere television is looking to the hyperactive
jokesmith with a working class accent to carry those early morning and
evening shows which are aimed at a mass audience largely concerned with
doing something else while keeping half an eye on the box. Chris Evans is
not alone.
For the British viewer in Turin, having already seen the British winners,
the most interesting programmes were the other prize winners. A Fatal Affair
from Sweden won the Special Prize in the drama category seemingly for
reasons opposite to those required by the rules. Instead of recognising some
special quality (electronic wizardry perhaps, or an original technique) we
were told that the jury was 'particularly pleased to note that an entry of
such a standard, traditionally achieved by North American and British
producers, can be submitted by one of the smaller countries taking part in
the Prix'. In other words the Swedes have joined the ranks of soap and mini
series producers. Well whoopee. The winner of the Special prize for Music
and Arts was a good though conventional performance-and-biography programme
about a Swede - virtuoso trombonist Christian Lindberg - made by ZDF of
Germany.
For me, however, television suddenly began to seem dramatically better than
third rate and very definitely not childish on the afternoon when I saw Les
Lapirov promptly followed by the documentary De Overlevenden ('The
Survivors') made by BRTN Belgium. In the French programme Jean-Luc Leon
followed the Lapirovs, a family of Russian Jews, as they left the Soviet
Union in 1981 to emigrate to Los Angeles. Then, ten years later, with the
son grown from Russian boyhood to American manhood, Leon filmed them again
as they returned to Moscow to visit family and friends. It could not be the
whole story, of course, but this programme - which began before the fall of
the Berlin Wall and ended after - spoke volumes about the reasons for the
collapse of communism in eastern Europe.
To move from that to the Belgian programme was to move from Colditz to
Auschwitz. De Overlevenden shows Albanians returning to the camps where they
were incarcerated for 20, 30, even 45 years; where children were born and
raised (according to one almost incredible statistic in this programme, more
than half the Albanian population spent time in the camps). Most astounding
and most moving of all, those going back today find the camps still occupied
by former prisoners who can now find nowhere else to live. Most infuriating
of all, one cell, instead of being occupied by 15 or 20, contains just one
person: Nexhmije Hoxha, widow of the despot Enver Hoxha, still acting like
an arrogant aristocrat, refusing to answer the film crew's questions and
boasting of her service to her country.
Even the Prix Italia may not be able to show us anything in the way of
television material to compare with the work of Masaccio or Corelli, yet the
programmes screened at this festival cannot be dismissed as third rate or
childish. On the contrary: the 70 or so programmes on view here suggested
that there is as much serious, adult and demanding television being made
today as there has ever been. The programmes brought together in Turin
suggested that television is doing as good a job as any mass medium,
probably better, in offering the citizens of today's world the means to see,
and to a large extent understand, what is going on. Better still, the
general standard in this year's festival was as high and arguably higher
than at any time in the last 20 years.
We should thank the Italians (who, year after year, stoically take none of
the top prizes from this event) for showing yet again what television at its
best can be, and resolve to be more selective in our viewing.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: If you go down to the woods
today - Deborah Hargreaves visits Eskdalemuir forest, where wildlife thrives
alongside a valuable timber resource
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ronnie Rose stands in a forest glade pointing to the bank where roe deer can
slip down under cover of willow trees to drink at the stream. As senior
wildlife manager at Eskdalemuir forest in Scotland, Rose has designed the
woodland planting to provide clearings where deer can gather and feed.
But Rose's efforts to provide a suitable habitat for the deer are not
motivated purely by conservation. 'I am here to make sure this investment
reaches the marketplace in the best condition possible,' he says.
Around 60 per cent of Britain's forests are privately-owned as a long-term
investment for individuals and pension funds. Conifers take at least 30
years to mature and if the trees are damaged by animals before felling,
their market value can be cut by up to a third.
Eskdalemuir is Britain's largest privately-owned forest covering 11,000
hectares. Rose and his team of 10 wildlife specialists pursue a policy of
active conservation to control animal numbers on behalf of 45 separate
owners.
Commercial forests planted in the past 30 years tend to be dominated by the
sitka spruce, a species of North American conifer which adapts well to the
UK climate, grows fast and straight and is much in demand from industrial
timber users.
But as Len Yull, marketing director at Tilhill Economic Forestry, part of
the Booker agribusiness group, which manages the Eskdalemuir forest,
explains: 'When we introduced these North American trees we did not bring
the wildlife with them, so we have to build routes for British birds and
animals into the American forest.'
The routes involve planting deciduous trees such as oak, alder, hazel and
willow in clumps to attract native birds and animals. Biodiversity not only
looks better, but also helps to protect the trees. Short-eared owls, for
example, prey on voles, which strip the bark from young trunks.
Where there are few natural predators, Rose must take their place. He has to
shoot up to 1,000 deer each year out of a population of 3,000 to keep
numbers down and prevent damage. By designing meadows and open spaces within
the conifer plantations, he can monitor the deer numbers and cull the old,
sick or wounded. Rose says that he also has to play 'referee' for three
species which, if left alone would destroy many animals that benefit the
forest. For this reason he kills mink, foxes and carrion crows which eat the
eggs of the ground-nesting, short-eared owls.
In order to monitor animal populations, Rose must be aware of their habits
and movements. For example, sika deer which strip the bark from trees only
move into a forest when the trees are 15 years old.
Rose has created meadows in the forest to help bring the sika deer into the
open. 'To manage the deer population, you have to see them,' he explains.
The trade-off is a 7 per cent loss of space for conifer planting, but it
helps ensure that the trees survive until maturity. It means 'your
investment gets to market in year 30'.
Red deer must be watched when the trees are mature because they can damage
the timber just days before it is chopped down, while roe deer prefer eating
trees younger than two years.
In spite of the damage that some animals can do, Rose resists the idea of a
'dead' forest where trees are planted so tightly that there is little room
for other vegetation or animals - the type of forestry sharply criticised by
environmentalists. He has also established ponds and lakes that act as fire
barriers, and which support fish, dragonflies and other insects as well as
reeds and wild flowers. The tops of the mountains, unsuitable for planting
trees, are kept as grouse moors.
Eskdale is a showpiece forest for Tilhill, which manages 12 per cent of
Britain's private woodlands. 'It is a unique forest because it is on a scale
to allow for this sort of wildlife management,' said Martin Wilkinson,
forestry operations director.
'It really brings the benefits of crop protection, good land use and
wildlife diversity at a pretty modest cost,' Wilkinson says. He reckons that
the extra cost of Rose's active conservation policy is not more than Pounds
5 per hectare and often Pounds 2 to Pounds 3 out of an annual running cost
of up to Pounds 30 per hectare.
Britain's forestry industry has been criticised by many environmental groups
for its lack of sensitivity to wildlife and the landscape. But Wilkinson
says the days of planting unbroken ranks of conifers across miles of
hillside are gone - new forests must meet a stringent set of environmental
guidelines to qualify for grants. Today, conifer forests generally include
20 per cent of open space, 10 per cent broad-leaved trees along streams and
boundaries, with 10 per cent of conifers other than sitka spruce.
Wilkinson says: 'Fifteen years ago we were encouraged to make maximum
productive use of the land, but today people want more visual diversity.'
The government still has plans to encourage more forestry planting in the UK
where production meets only 12 per cent of current need. It has just
introduced a new direct grant scheme to encourage private landowners to
plant more trees.
The grants of Pounds 700 per hectare for planting conifers cover 70 per cent
of the costs of starting a forest, but Wilkinson reckons it is not enough to
encourage the level of start-up the government wants to see. Government
targets for new plantings of 33,000ha a year have never been met since they
were set in 1987. New tree planting is currently running at about 18,000ha a
year.
Foresters say trees cannot compete with the high price of agricultural land
which is supported by European Union subsidies. The UK government introduced
a farm woodland grant scheme to try to persuade farmers to plant more trees,
but this has so far attracted only 4,000 to 5,000ha a year of new planting.
Wilkinson maintains that forestry provides many ecological benefits and
supports a greater diversity of species than the upland sheep farms it often
replaces. Tilhill reports that 127 different breeds of bird and 17 species
of animal can be found in the Eskdalemuir forest. 'We are providing a
different micro-climate for wildlife and also a valuable resource which is
much in demand.'

Eco-sponsorship, the increasingly popular form of promotion, has hit the
hiking trails of Switzerland.
The Swiss League for the Protection of Nature* was looking for financing to
restore a spectacular trail in a nature reserve high in the Bernese
Oberland, when Timberland, the US hiking shoe company, agreed to put up
funding for the project.
Timberland had heard about it through Alp Action, a Geneva-based
organisation set up by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan four years ago to mobilise
funds for preservation projects in the Alps. The company will spend Dollars
120,000 (Pounds 76,000) for the initial restoration plus an ongoing
commitment to maintenance.
In return, the path, which rises more than 1,000m from Stechelberg at the
head of the Lauterbrunnen valley to Oberhorn just beneath the tumbling
Breithorn glacier, has been named the Timberland Trail. The company's name
or logo appears on explanatory billboards and signposts all along the 7km
route.
Louis Ferran, Timberland's international vice-president, says the company's
investment was not simply aimed at selling more outdoor shoes and clothing.
'Certainly, our products make no sense if the environment is not maintained.
But many companies use the environment in their marketing.'
Timberland has a policy of trying to involve other people in its activities.
It has participated in City Year, a youth service corps in the US, and it
provides its employees with time off for community service projects. But it
had done little in Europe, where sales have been growing rapidly. This year,
it expects Dollars 140m of its Dollars 700m sales to come from Europe. In
the SLPN, it found a partner with 100,000 members involved in preserving the
environment.

Jean-Paul Parayre, former vice president of Groupe Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez,
the large French water and construction group, has been appointed a

FT  28 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Turning green at the thought -
Why banks focus on lender liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention the word 'environment' to your average commercial banker and watch
him flinch. Never mind the booming market for environmental services, the
investment opportunities, the growing demand by consumers for 'green'
products.
His first thoughts are as likely to turn to the mounting bill for cleaning
up toxic waste sites or fears of customers pushed into default by unforeseen
environmental costs and regulations.
A global survey of 60 banks conducted for the United Nations Environment
Programme (Unep) found that the banks' environmental policies focused
predominantly on credit risk management. The environment was a negligible
factor in equity financing; banks have yet to promote 'green' business with
enthusiasm.
When senior officials from 45 of the world's biggest commercial banks met in
Geneva this week to discuss environmental issues, the main topic was lender
liability for environmental risk and how to avoid it. Quantifying risk came
next, followed by 'greening' the banks' own internal operations. Investing
in sustainable development came a long way down the list for most of the
banks at the gathering, which included Britain's National Westminster,
Citibank of the US, the Bank of Tokyo, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holding of Hong
Kong, the three major Swiss banks and Bank Dagang Negara of Indonesia.
According to Unep, which sponsored the two-day round table, the banking
sector's anxiety over lender liability overshadows all other environmental
concerns. The problem arises because almost everywhere lenders can be held
responsible for some kind of environmental malpractice or simple misfortune
of their clients. Even if banks are not legally liable they may lose their
money if the customer defaults.
The size of the risk is enormous. The cost of cleaning up toxic waste sites
in the US, where the lender liability problem is most acute, is put at up to
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 316bn). But even in the Asia-Pacific region, the World
Bank estimates Dollars 38bn a year will be needed for clean-up operations.
A Unep report prepared for the meeting notes that banks in industrialised
countries have gone to great lengths to protect themselves from liability,
ranging from environmental audits to mandatory bonds posted by borrowers to
cover future potential environmental costs.
Others have chosen a simpler course. In a 1990 survey of local commercial
banks by the American Bankers' Association, nearly half said they no longer
financed certain types of business, such as petrol stations, because of
liability fears. Nearly two-thirds of the banks turned down loan
applications on the same
grounds.
Defensive action by banks to limit risk exposure has seriously inhibited
funding for clean-up projects and investments in environmental protection.
'If a small percentage of the time, resources and talent that has gone into
avoiding legal liability focused instead on finding new solutions to
clean-up and environmental management issues, progress might be made,' the
report comments.
It notes, however, that a number of governments are drawing up guidelines
for lender liability to try to reduce the uncertainty. Unep favours schemes
to pool environmental risk such as collective liability funds and
public-private sector partnerships for clean-up and other environmental
projects.
The banks also swapped experience in making their own operations more
environment-friendly, in areas such as energy efficiency and paper
consumption. A study by Swiss Bank Corporation, for example, showed that a
large bank uses as much electricity as a town of 60,000 people.
Ms Hilary Thompson, head of environmental management at NatWest, says: 'It's
not going to be very easy for a member of the financial sector to turn round
to customers and ask them to do something if they haven't put their own
house in order first.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / People: Bensons Crisps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bensons Crisps announced yesterday that Tony Fiddian, its finance director
since 1985, had left the company for undisclosed reasons and his successor
would be appointed in due course.
Malcolm Jones, the chairman, said he was prevented by confidentiality
clauses from giving further details.
The Preston-based company, which completed a big capital spending programme
this year to lower manufacturing and storage costs, recently reported an
interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.69m against a loss of Pounds 386,000 a year
earlier.
Like other crisp and snack-makers, it is suffering from a vicious price war
in supermarkets caused in part by excess manufacturing capacity. And there
is no relief in sight, according to Jones.
Certain varieties of potatoes have been in short supply. Bensons has fixed
price-scale supply contracts running to next June covering about 90 to 95
per cent of its output, Jones says. But margins are so thin that other cost
increases would have to be passed on.

FT  28 SEP 94 / People: Graham quits Specialeyes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Differences of opinion on the board of Specialeyes, the loss-making
USM-traded retail optician, have led to the resignation of Robert Graham,
the retail operations director.
Although Graham's resignation does not signal a split on the board, he is
believed to have had a difference of opinion over how the company should
cope with an increasingly competitive market and lower margins.
Specialeyes has seen a number of board changes in the past two years. The
most recent was the resignation in May of George Shand, the financial
director.
Mark Raines, Specialeyes managing director, assumes Graham's
responsibilities.
Graham, formerly retail operations director of Habitat, joined Specialeyes
in September last year. Specialeyes said at the time that his appointment
'completes the restructuring of the executive team'.
Specialeyes incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 481,000 for the 12 months
ended November 27 on a turnover from continuing activities of Pounds 20.54m.
The figures compared with Pounds 2.27m and Pounds 25.94m respectively for
the 78 weeks to November 28 1992.

FT  28 SEP 94 / People: Fallon's post with mail order
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivan Fallon, the former deputy editor of the Sunday Times who specialises in
writing biographies of wealthy businessmen, is joining the board of N Brown,
Sir David Alliance's family-controlled mail order business.
Fallon, 51, stepped down as business editor of the Sunday Times a few months
ago and is about to take up a senior executive position with the Argus
Group, the South African newspaper company in which Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspaper group is the biggest investor. Fallon, who was City
editor of the Sunday Telegraph from 1979 to 1984 and deputy editor of the
Sunday Times for nearly ten years, has made a speciality of getting to know
rich and famous business folk.
His books include The Brothers: the rise and fall of Saatchi and Saatchi and
Billionaire, the life and times of Sir James Goldsmith. His biography of
Tony O'Reilly, The Player, is published tomorrow.
The second youngest of six brothers, Fallon comes from an Irish literary
family. His father was a poet and playwright and Ivan's younger brother,
Padraic, also an ex-journalist, is now chairman of Euromoney Publications
and a non-executive director of Allied Irish Banks.
Sir David Alliance, 62, who arrived in Britain in the 1950s as a poor
immigrant from Tehran, has grown into Britain's biggest textiles magnate. He
is best known as chairman of Coats Viyella but it has been the strong
performance of N Brown, a Manchester-based home shopping group, which
provides the bulk of an estimated family fortune of Pounds 200m.
Sir David does not expect Fallon's new job in South Africa to interfere with
his new duties as a non-executive director of N Brown. However, it sounds as
if Fallon will be too busy to pen Sir David's biography - even though he is
tempted. 'It's a fascinating story,' says Fallon.

FT  28 SEP 94 / People: MTM ends its lengthy search
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the chemicals company which almost collapsed two years ago, yesterday
ended more than a year of management uncertainty by naming a new chief
executive.
The group has recruited Donald Neil, managing director of Rocol - the
chemical products subsidiary of Morgan Crucible - to oversee a new
acquisition strategy aimed at establishing three or four core businesses in
sectors such as bio-technology, ceramics and instruments.
The appointment follows a six-month search for a replacement for Ken
Schofield, who stepped down in June last year after completing a rescue
restructuring.
Neil, 51, is expected to continue the reorganisation, which was dominated by
the disposal last year of most of MTM's assets to BTP, the fine chemical
company, for Pounds 100m, and the acquisition in March this year of Colin
Stewart Minchem, the Cheshire-based chemical company, for Pounds 11.8m.
'We've been described as leaderless, but that was unfair. We simply delayed
recruitment to ensure we had a new business capable of moving in the right
direction,' says David Swallow, chairman and acting chief executive, who
will now revert to being non-executive chairman.
Before moving to Rocol, Neil - a chartered chemist - was a director of
Manders, the coatings and inks business, and a divisional director at Croda
International, the chemicals group.
He was chosen from a short list of eight candidates and will receive a basic
annual salary of around Pounds 100,000 plus bonuses and share options.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Management: Break-Out: a new fashion at Sears - How a UK
retailer is encouraging its different chains to co-operate with each other
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inside a warehouse on an industrial estate near Birmingham last month stood
a high street, complete with a row of shops, fast food outlets, and an
amphitheatre at one end with a giant screen and sound equipment.
This was not a theme park, or the UK's latest new town. It was created as
the venue for a series of training days for store managers from Sears, the
UK fashion group whose chains include Dolcis, Wallis, Warehouse, Richards,
and Olympus, as well as Selfridges department store in London.
The shops were constructed within days from canvas and metal frames in
redundant warehousing space, and disappeared just as quickly, but they
served as an effective environment in which store managers could meet and
learn new skills.
Such initiatives have played an important part in the regeneration of Sears
 -further evidence of which was provided by yesterday's rise in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 53.8m.
Of the four large UK fashion groups which ran into difficulties around the
turn of this decade - Next, Storehouse, Burton and Sears - it was perhaps
Sears, with 3,500 stores under more than a dozen fascias, and about 35,000
full-time equivalent staff, that faced the most complex problems.
It may not have been losing money - even if group profits fell from a
pre-tax peak of Pounds 246m in the year to January 1988 to Pounds 81m in the
year to January 1992 - and it had fewer debt worries than some competitors.
The group, however, was sprawling and unwieldy. Communications between
stores and the centre - and between stores themselves - were poor. Functions
were sometimes duplicated, and there were few structures allowing ideas and
expertise to be passed from one chain to another.
As chains had been acquired, they had often been left to do things their own
way. Burton, another fashion retailer made up of a number of multiple
chains, faced a similar problem, with its high-street stores trading in
competition with one another rather than co-operating in certain areas and
targeting different market segments.
Another problem was that Sears would often be one of the biggest retailers
in a town centre, but its turnover was split between ten or more stores
which hardly knew one another. This denied Sears a potentially powerful
voice in the town's affairs.
Liam Strong, the former marketing director of British Airways appointed
Sears chief executive in spring 1992, realised that as well as restructuring
 -the underperforming menswear businesses were sold and the shoe business
British Shoe Corporation revamped - a culture change was needed. He hired
Rod Taylor, a former colleague at British Airways, as director of human
resources, and at a conference of the top 200 Sears executives in October
1992 launched the Sears Action Programme. The aim was to bring together
different functions, such as buying, merchandising and marketing, and to get
stores and chains to work together.
By the following February, the programme, now known as Break-Out, was
showing results. Meetings between chains had identified possible cost
savings of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m a year.
Further evidence of the culture change could be seen at a conference for the
top 300 executives in March. 'People started to stand up and say things
like, I have 'stolen' this idea from womenswear,' says Taylor.
Co-operation still did not go far enough, however. Taylor launched a
Break-Out team, putting together 17 people from Sears businesses with five
consultants from Gemini Consulting, to deepen the process. He also
introduced a management training programme at the centre and in the stores.
At head office, where staff had been extensively reshuffled by Strong, the
top 50 executives were invited to undertake a course of executive coaching,
weekly sessions of management training with consultants, at the company's
expense. They were free to choose the coach and the skills they wanted to
develop. All but two took up the offer, and Taylor is confident that the
Pounds 250,000 costs of the scheme will be more than recouped by the
benefits, in the form of better-trained directors who can pass on their
skills.
At the stores level, Sears brought managers together in a series of day-long
training events. The first ten regional Break-Out days, involving 350 store
and concession managers at a time, were held a year ago. A follow-up series
of eight 'Sears retail days' for 450 managers at a time, was held last month
in the mock-up high street in Solihull.
Events began with a 'town meeting' hosted by a jeans-wearing Liam Strong, at
which managers were able to put questions to similarly casually attired
managing directors of the retail divisions. These were frequently blunt -
'How can we get head office to listen to us?' was one question last month -
but Taylor says the process was important for both sides. 'Confronting the
managers was a big learning process for the MDs. They realised answers that
sounded like cotton wool were not going to be credible.'
After this town meeting, managers moved into the store areas to participate
in seminars on such subjects as visual merchandising and customer loyalty.
They also held meetings with colleagues from their own towns to discuss
forms of co-operation, such as cross-fascia training or joint security
meas-ures.
Strong says these events were important as a way of getting store managers
talking to one another, and making them feel personally involved in the
changes.
The feedback from the retail days has been good and there have been visible
changes in the stores.
'People can only take away very simple messages from these events,' he says.
'The two ideas we wanted them to take away is that we continue to be
committed to change, but it is tough going. The second is that there is a
lot they can do themselves.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Management: Turning lunchtime wine into water - Richard
Donkin bemoans the removal of the drinks cabinet from today's corporate
dining rooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a typical corporate dining room. Four places set for lunch, napkins,
side plates, wine glasses. Would I like an aperitif?, asked the chairman.
'Just a tomato juice, please.' His smile broadened as he revealed that he
too was on tomato juice. So too was his colleague - and his colleague's
colleague.
'So you don't drink at lunchtime?' he ventured. What should I say? There,
standing provocatively, in the middle of the table, dribbling with
condensation on its pond-green glass cooled side, was an uncorked bottle of
Sauvignon.
'Well, sometimes.' The bottle did the rounds, each host declining in turn.
It was a bottle straight from Wonderland. 'Drink me,' it said. So I did.
Just a glass or so, but it was pure sin - and I knew it.
There is no escaping the lunchtime culture change. One of the corporate
miracles of the 1990s has been the turning of wine into water. Drinking and
the company lunch is becoming a Spartan affair in our austere industrial
climate. Today's lunch is business from the first forkful.
The erosion of the chummy business lunch probably started with the 'working
lunch' some years ago and evolved into an in-house, buffet-style
get-together, no table cloth, peel-your-own fruit - more an excuse for a
meeting than an excuse for lunch. The other type of in-house lunch, the one
designed to impress your visitors, has survived after thriving during the
heady 1980s, but even this is becoming more businesslike.
In the City, at least, lunch has become the institution that sorts out the
roundhead champion of the Protestant work ethic from the cavalier lush, more
accustomed to keeping gentlemen's hours. The corporate roundheads are
winning the battle as the executives of yesteryear are routed from their
comfortable routines.
The roundhead manager is easy to spot, he - or, increasingly, she - keeps a
clean desk, works briskly and efficiently and uses lunch to stock up on
lettuce-laced fuel for the rest of the day. The knife is a tool for stabbing
home a point, the fork and plate merely utilitarian thinking accessories.
The greatest statement of all is made by the glass of water.
Whether effervescent or still, it says that you mean business, that you did
not come here to relax and enjoy yourself, that you are alert, sensible and
a fully paid-up member of workaholics anonymous.
Dianah Worman, a policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel and
Development, says: 'The latest thinking is that it is perhaps not a good
idea to expose people to lots of alcohol at work. We are talking about
something that undermines people's performance.'
Worman identifies professions such as medicine, the police force and
journalism where drinking cultures still exist, but she suggests the
practice is on the decline. Her own organisation bans drink in the workplace
except at retirement parties and the Christmas drinks party. The number of
companies with strict alcohol and drugs policies is growing markedly.
British Rail and Railtrack, which introduced policies last year, not only
insist that all their employees do not work under the influence of drink,
but that their contractors also comply with the same policy.
Ford, GEC, Nuclear Electric, Royal Bank of Scotland, Shell and Whitbread
were all listed in a recent Incomes Data Services study as companies with
alcohol policies. In 1980, Whitbread exchanged its traditional daily beer
allowance, which could be drunk on site, for a periodic take-home
arrangement. in an attempt to promote sensible drinking.
According to the IDS study, alcohol and drug misuse costs industry at least
Pounds 1bn a year. A fifth of large employers, it said, had formal alcohol
polices, still lagging behind the two-thirds that now have smoking policies.
The more stringent approach to alcohol in some companies has been influenced
by changes in the law. The 1992 Transport and Works Act made it illegal for
transport workers in safety-sensitive positions to report for duty having
taken alcohol or drugs. Their employers must also use due diligence to
prevent alcohol or drug use.
Equivalent US legislation is even more draconian, covering 7m employees with
a widespread use of random-alcohol tests.
As at British Rail, some employers are deciding that it is unacceptable to
allow drinking for some and not for others. Worman says that those company
directors who still have not consigned their office drinks cabinets to the
scrap heap might consider doing so.
There seems no disputing that the roundheads have firmly secured the legal
and moral high ground. In the new era of office prohibition, lean companies
and performance-related everything, there is nothing left for the cavaliers
to do but to clink their glasses of eau de tap and drink to the old days.

The Swedes are not known for their revolutionary zeal. The last time they
felt it was time for a change, in 1809, it was a bloodless, painless affair.
King Gustav IV was deposed and the throne given to Jean Baptiste Bernadotte,
a French general. When Bernadotte addressed the parliament in halting
Swedish he was greeted with roars of laughter and was so upset that he never
spoke Swedish again.
Geert Hofstede, professor of Organisational Anthropology and International
Management at the University of Limburg and Maastricht in the Netherlands,
attributes Bernadotte's reaction to the cultural differences between France
and Sweden. In particular he notes the differences in what he calls power
distance - the emotional distance that separates subordinates from their
bosses.
This power distance in France is much greater than in Sweden. Hofstede
created a power distance table, drawn from a survey of IBM employees in
different countries.
The high scorers are those societies in which subordinates depend to a large
extent on their bosses. The same goes for families. Those that have low
scores tend to have a more consultative relationship between managers and
subordinates. There is more interdependence between the two.
Malaysia scores the most highly, with Austria the lowest. Latin American
countries tend to have the highest scores and Western European countries,
with the exception of Belgium and France, are among the lowest scores.
Hofstede's work, following on from original research on power distance by a
Dutch social psychologist, Mauk Mulder, helps explain why some companies
have difficulty transplanting their business cultures across borders.
It may also explain why the proposed Volvo-Renault merger ended in tears
last year when Volvo managers revolted against Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's
then chairman, whose resignation followed, partly in frustration at his
managers' inability to meld with French management.
While, as in Volvo's case, corporate cultures still have the power to
disorientate managements, most managers now appear to be aware that culture
is something that must be addressed when considering organisational change.
Angela Baron and Mike Walters, of the Institute of Personnel and
Development, note in a new study of corporate cultures that 'Managers are
becoming adept at recognising the strategic importance of culture and even
at mapping existing culture within their organisation'.
The difficult part is doing anything about it. 'Success at bringing about
sustainable, positive changes in culture has been limited,' they write.
Their research covering 15 case studies in five economic sectors - retail,
financial services, information technology, consumer goods and public
utilities - includes some surprising findings.
Perhaps the most fashionable business concept to be seriously questioned in
the study is the mission statement. 'I thought that would be the first thing
to come out of the drawer when I visited these organisations but it just
didn't happen. A lot of people said mission statements were all well and
good but it was action not words that they were looking for,' said Baron.
Even in a company such as Johnson &amp; Johnson with its celebrated Credo, the
researchers found its words carried less emphasis away from the US
headquarters. Constant attention to the credo, however, ensures that it
continues to enshrine Johnson &amp; Johnson's business values, and that staff
are aware of its importance, suggesting that a mission may work best if it
is hammered in to people and frequently reviewed.
In contrast, many of the managers in the case studies were unable to quote
their mission statements and typically attached no great significance to
them.
In some cases, said the report 'it was clear that, although a great deal of
thought had gone into their mission statement, it had, as yet, failed to
engender a 'sense of mission''.
The research will disappoint managements which have laboured over precise
wordings to arrive at a statement which encapsulates what the company is
about and identifies where it is going. Some 50 per cent of companies in the
UK and the US have some form of mission statement, notes the IPD report.
Many of the companies encountered by Baron and Walters explained that they
did not feel any need to agonise over 'pretty' words, leading the authors to
concluded that 'a sense of mission could exist in organisations where no
mission, vision or value statement existed'.
The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, for example, eschewed mission or value
statements but acknowledged that it maintained a strong unwritten value
system that emphasised integrity, organisational loyalty and long service.
This was mirrored in paternalism evident in the bank's policy of maintaining
the graves of expatriate employees buried overseas.
Rubbing salt into the mission guru's wounds, Baron and Walters write:
'Mission statements would appear to many organisations to have more
relevance in the outside world as a PR exercise than they do as internal
tools for the management of culture.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Brown discards 'quick-fix' route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday unveiled a series of
proposals to flesh out Labour's commitment to long-term investment through a
partnership between the public and private sectors.
Speaking at Labour's London conference on global economic change, Mr Brown
said the overriding objective of a future Labour government would be
'sustainable growth, jobs and higher living standards'. The party would not
take risks with inflation and would reject the 'old quick-fix solutions of
tax, spend and borrow'.
Instead it would seek to solve the economy's supply-side problems by
introducing an 'active, modern industrial policy', in which government would
act as a catalyst for long-term investment.
Dismissing 'old-style corporatism', Mr Brown emphasised that Labour's brand
of economic interventionism would eschew the dirigiste instincts of the
past. Instead its aim would be to work 'in partnership with people to make
the market economy truly dynamic'.
The shadow chancellor identified four main areas in which Labour wanted to
reverse the culture of short-termism which had been the principal factor in
Britain's relative economic decline.
To promote investment in industry, the party was examining ways in which the
tax system and pension rules discouraged retained earnings. To encourage
companies and shareholders to invest for the future, Labour proposed new tax
incentives for voluntary long-term investment agreements.
The party's approach to education would be based on a training levy/rebate
system which encouraged employers to train their workforces and penalised
those which poached trained staff from other companies.
Labour would also improve access to high-quality education through the
creation of a university for industry and by linking training provision with
National Insurance contributions.
Mr Brown said a revival of investment in infrastructure would follow removal
of the Treasury rules blocking the use of private finance. Labour would also
promote a debate on the possible extension of public-private partnerships to
training, public-housing provision, defence diversification, inner-city and
regional policy, and the development of higher and further education.
Finally, Labour would move quickly to reduce unemployment, with a guarantee
of high-quality education or training for young people, temporary National
Insurance rebates for employers taking on the long-term unemployed, and new
retraining schemes for workers made redundant.
More broadly, the shadow chancellor repeated Labour's commitment to a system
of managed exchange rates, but stressed that stable currencies depended on
much closer international co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
The lesson of sterling's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism
was that an exchange rate target could not be a substitute for a credible
economic programme.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Labour faces row on quotas for women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is heading for a potentially divisive conference row over positive
discrimination in favour of women, in spite of attempts by the leadership to
defuse the issue.
The party's national executive committee will today approve a flexible
interpretation of the rules on female representation, in line with a
compromise approach adopted by Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader.
Opponents of positive discrimination said they remained hopeful that next
week's annual conference in Blackpool would overturn quota rules agreed last
year as part of a package of constitutional reforms.
Ms Nicola Kutapan, co-convenor of Labour Supporters for Real Equality, said
Mr Blair's flexible approach was a welcome sign that the party leadership no
longer believed the quota policy was workable.
She said: 'There is a considerable amount of opinion among constituency
parties about this, and I don't think people are going to be willing to let
it drop.'
Critics say that the rules discriminate against men because they require
female representation in constituency delegations and all-women short-lists
in some parliamentary seats.
Constituency parties have tabled 13 resolutions calling for the policy to be
scrapped. Delegates to the GMB general union conference earlier this year
also expressed support for a reversal of discriminatory selection
procedures.
The NEC will also formally approve an invitation from the Labour leadership
to Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, to address the conference
on Northern Ireland.
SDLP officials said Mr Hume would not attempt to intervene in the growing
Labour debate over the party's commitment to campaign for Irish
unity-by-consent.
Supporters of a more neutral approach fear that his speech will bolster
support for the party's nationalist wing, led by Mr Kevin Macnamara, shadow
Northern Ireland secretary.
Independent Labour Publications, the pressure group behind an emergency
resolution seeking a review of the unity-by-consent formula, said the
invitation to Mr Hume 'smacks of a manoeuvre to maintain support for a
discredited policy'.
Mr Calum MacDonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, urged Labour to
'separate our political sympathies for John Hume as a socialist, and our
respect for the work he has done to get the peace process going, from his
nationalism, which is a different matter altogether'.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Councils shake-up finds scant backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consultative referenda held in 10 counties by the Local Government
Commission have revealed strong opposition to government plans to
restructure local government in England.
The government wants to replace the two-tier system of counties and
districts with all-purpose unitary councils.
All households in the areas concerned were sent consultation leaflets. The
response rate ranged from 4.3 per cent to 15.5 per cent.
In eight of the 10 counties covered - Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria,
Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, and Oxfordshire - maintaining
the two tiers, at least for part of the county, was the favourite option.
Unitary options were only preferred in Bedfordshire and Berkshire, where
local politicians were in favour of change and the status quo was not an
option presented.
In Cumbria and Cambridgeshire the status quo was the most popular option,
although it was not formally proposed by the commission.
Commissioners, who meet today to finalise their recommendations for these
counties and for Buckinghamshire, say they will not be bound by the results
of the polls, which were not formal referenda.
But Sir John Banham, commission chairman, has said that no recommendations
for change would be made unless the commission has evidence of overwhelming
public demand.
The cross-party Association of District Councils said the results should not
form a serious part of the commission's decision-making in view of the low
response rate. The process had been 'corrupted' by biased county council
publicity campaigns, it said. In Chester 27 per cent of the 4,400 letters
received by the commission 'could be traced to Cheshire County Council and
its staff'.
It criticised county information campaigns in Oxfordshire, where 70 per cent
favoured the status quo, and Lancashire, where 60 per cent favoured the
status quo.
The status quo was the most popular option in Blackburn, represented in
parliament by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, who
supports unitaries.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said that district
councils had also campaigned heavily. Mr Ian Swithenbank, chairman of the
association's policy committee, said: 'The argument for change is not borne
out on the basis of these results.'
Majorities were registered for giving unitary status to the cities of
Portsmouth, Plymouth and Leicester, while keeping two tiers for the
surrounding areas.
In Bedfordshire a three-unitary system proved most popular, meaning
all-purpose authorities for Luton, Bedford and Mid-Bedfordshire, while in
Berkshire a plan to create five unitaries proved marginally more popular
than two options presented by the commission to create four.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Shelter is sought for winter homeless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading construction industry charity is struggling to find empty London
office buildings to provide temporary winter shelters for the capital's
homeless people. This is even though there are many vacant buildings in
central London.
Construction Industry Relief and Assistance for the Single Homeless (Crash),
sponsored by some of the industry's biggest companies, provides materials,
skills and finance to turn empty buildings into shelters under the
government's Rough Sleepers initiative.
Mr Tony Denison, Crash co-ordinator, said landlords who lent unlet buildings
would save on rates because the buildings would not be unoccupied. The
charity would meet heating, maintenance and security bills.
The four-year-old scheme is having particular difficulty this year in
finding suitable buildings, although estate agents estimate there is 8m sq
ft of vacant office space in the West End alone.
Mr Denison said: 'Perhaps it is a sign that the property market is starting
to improve. It has always been hard to find space but this year it is the
worst I have known.'
The trust is looking for five empty buildings in the W1, WC1, WC2, SW1, SE1,
NW1, E1, EC and EC1 postal districts to convert into temporary winter
accommodation.
In previous years Allied-Lyons, the drinks and food group, has donated half
its former headquarters building in Islington for a temporary shelter. Last
year Land Securities property group allowed Crash to take over Neville
House, an empty building close to the Department of the Environment
headquarters in Marsham Street.
Mr Denison said advertisements in national and London newspapers this autumn
had produced only one building.
Sponsors of Crash include the building materials groups Redland, RMC, Rugby
Group, BPB Industries and Caradon, as well as contractor John Laing. Other
supporters include publishers The Builder Group and Barbour Index, the
research group.
Crash can be contacted on 081-994 9195.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Scottish ferry line sell-off 'rejected'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is believed to have rejected the idea of privatising the
shipping line Caledonian MacBrayne, which operates ferries on Scotland's
west coast.
The decision, to be announced in the next few weeks, follows a study of
CalMac by KPMG Management Consulting, which examined a range of options for
private-sector participation in the running of the services, including
privatisation.
The decision to review CalMac's operations only a few years after a study in
1988 rejected privatisation produced strong protests in the Western Isles
and along the west coast, with islanders fearing that the services would be
cut or stopped. It is believed that the holding of a review was insisted on
by the Treasury.
CalMac argued strongly to be left intact and retain its structure, which
involves a small number of profitable routes helping to subsidise the larger
number of loss-making ones, and requiring a Scottish Office grant which last
year was Pounds 6m.
KPMG is widely believed to have recommended against privatisation and the
government is thought to have accepted that. It may make some
recommendations on improved efficiency.
The Scottish Office refused to comment on suggestions that CalMac was not to
be privatised. Mr Colin Paterson, CalMac managing director, said: 'I haven't
had any official confirmation, but if the leak is true I'm absolutely
delighted for the company, staff and islanders.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / MEPs back more funds for Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European parliament yesterday voted for increased aid to help cement the
peace process in Northern Ireland while giving a rare standing ovation to Mr
John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party.
The move came as unionists - responding to a warning by Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein president, that the IRA might in time return to violence under a
new leadership - urged the government to make the IRA hand in its guns.
Mr Adams, visiting the US, tried to qualify his remarks, made in an
interview with the Boston Herald newspaper. He said he had been speaking
hypothetically and did not believe that the peace process would fail.
Mr Hume said last night that he was 'absolutely certain that the Provisional
IRA has totally ended its campaign. I have no doubt that the campaign has
totally finished'.
His reception was for his part in bringing about the IRA ceasefire. It also
emerged that the dominant socialist group at the Strasbourg assembly intends
to get the parliament to nominate the SDLP's lone MEP for the Nobel Peace
Prize.
The parliament voted overwhelmingly for more aid and a cessation of violence
by all paramilitaries in the province in order to reach a settlement which
'must earn the allegiance and agreement of all traditions' in Ulster.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party and
also an MEP, was the sole dissenting voice in the debate.
He reminded the parliament that the IRA had still not agreed to a
'permanent' ceasefire, and that Mr Adams had warned of a return to violence
in three years if the IRA 'does not obtain satisfaction'.
The vote was carried by 380 votes to five but Mr Paisley's four apparent
supporters later contacted the parliament authorities to say that they had
inadvertently pressed the wrong voting button.
Mr Peter Schmidhuber, European Union commissioner in charge of the budget,
welcomed the parliament's backing for increased funding. He said the
commission proposed raising the EU's contribution to the International Fund
for Ireland from the Ecu15m (Pounds 11.8m) a year it has contributed since
1989 to Ecu20m.
The EU has already allocated Ecu1.23bn in structural aid to Northern Ireland
for 1994-99 - up from Ecu1.07bn in 1989-93 - to develop infrastructure,
research and development, training and small businesses.
The emphasis of yesterday's debate was less on numbers than on
reconciliation.
Mrs Glenys Kinnock, the prominent Labour Euro-MP, was behind the effort to
nominate Mr Hume for a Nobel Prize, never previous-ly attempted by the
parliament.
She was firmly against any attempt to include Mr Adams in the nomination and
said it 'would not be appropriate now' for the Sinn Fein leader to address
the parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, urged the
government to insist on the dismantling of the IRA's military machine and
the surrendering of its weapons before Sinn Fein was allowed into the peace
process.
Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said Mr Adams' comments were entirely
predictable. 'It was always envisaged that they would eventually . . . drop
dark hints on resuming violence,' he said.

FT  28 SEP 94 / CBI calls for Pounds 1bn support in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual round of business pre-Budget lobbying was stepped up yesterday as
the Confederation of British Industry called for modest tax measures in the
November budget to boost investment and support smaller companies.
The demands, in the CBI's submissions to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
ahead of the November budget, would cost about Pounds 1bn a year.
But the CBI said it recognised the scope for further tax cuts was limited,
and broadly supported the chancellor's tight fiscal policy.
The CBI said the top priority for business was measures that promoted
balanced economic growth and staved off further interest rate rises.
In particular, public spending should be reduced below the levels projected
in the government's present plans to cut the public sector borrowing
requirement.
The CBI said that the healthy state of the economy meant further savings
could be made by using money currently set aside in a contingency reserve.
Next year this reserve could be cut by Pounds 5bn, with a Pounds 12bn
reduction by the end of the 1997 fiscal year.
Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said:
'The reduction of Pounds 5bn should be directed mainly towards a reduction
of the PSBR rather than lower taxation.'
Nevertheless, the CBI yesterday called for a few small measures to boost
investment, including:
Relief from capital gains tax for long-term holdings of company shares.
A 100 per cent depreciation allowance for the first Pounds 200,000 invested
in plant and machinery.
Extension of tax relief for employer-provided childcare.
A further package of measures to assist smaller companies should be
considered in the longer term, not least because they were potentially the
greatest provider of jobs, the CBI said.
It said the profit limit applied to the 25 per cent corporation tax rate
should be raised and the VAT registration threshold increased. There should
be changes in inheritance tax.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Purchasing index issuing system is reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial system for distributing the Purchasing Managers Index has
been reformed in an attempt to prevent market leaks of price-sensitive
information.
The move comes after mounting accusations from City analysts that the system
for releasing the index was fuelling market instability because it provided
information on an unequal basis.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said yesterday that it
would distribute the report, which is modelled on the US National
Association of Purchasing Managers index, at 7am - two hours before the
market opens - to all subscribers who pay a premium subscription fee.
Market agencies will receive the information half an hour later, giving the
City equal access to the information before trading starts on the London
markets.
Under the previous system of distributing the index some subscribers were
receiving the information up to two days before the rest of the market.
This gap caused little controversy when the index was launched three years
ago. But in recent months the index has become more price-sensitive.
The staggered release of purchasing managers' expectations about price
increases has had a particular impact on the gilts markets in recent months.
The organisers of the index said yesterday that they hoped the new system
would prevent further leaks.

series of three new cars planned for launch in the next four years, and
aimed at transforming the fortunes of the chronically loss-making UK luxury
carmaker.
Jaguar has suffered total pre-tax losses of Pounds 776m since it was taken
over for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989 by Ford, the world's second-biggest
vehicle producer. The US carmaker is doubling its stakes rather than
quitting, however, and expects to have invested another Pounds 1bn by the
end of 1996.
An important part of this spending has been devoted to the XJ series,
code-named X300 during its development, which has cost more than Pounds 200m
to bring to production. Mr Nick Scheele, Jaguar chairman and chief
executive, said the new car would help to bring the company back to profit
next year.
The XJ series is the first important product programme delivered by Jaguar
since the Ford acquisition. The cars go on sale in the UK this week, priced
between Pounds 28,950 and Pounds 59,950, and should be launched in the
company's 50 export markets before the end of the year.
The new model, which replaces the saloon range launched in 1986, must prove
to sceptical luxury car buyers that the Coventry-based carmaker has learned
the quality and efficiency lessons expensively and painfully imparted by
Ford since the takeover.
Jaguar's classic styling and design have often been the envy of its rivals,
but its quality and reliability have left much to be desired.
In spite of improvements in the last couple of years the XJ6 range still
failed to make it into the top 50 cars in this year's new-car initial
quality study by JD Power, the leading US automotive consumer research
group. The US is Jaguar's most important market, accounting last year for
46.4 per cent of total worldwide sales of 27,338.
The current XJ6 is conspicuously missing from a list of cars that includes
all its main rivals, the Lexus LS400, the BMW 5 and 7 series, the Infiniti
Q45 and the Mercedes-Benz E and S-Class, which all scored fewer than 100
problems per 100 cars. The XJ6 scored 128, significantly worse than the
industry average of 110. But it is closing the gap - its score was 233 in
1989, against an industry average of 148.
Mr Jim Padilla, the tough Detroit-born engineer appointed two years ago as
executive director of manufacturing and engineering - with the task of
ensuring that new product programmes are delivered to target - said that the
investment and restructuring of the last couple of years had yielded big
gains in quality and efficiency.
Jaguar had cut the number of problems per 100 cars, measured at the end of
the assembly line, from 1,432 at the end of 1990 to 281 by February this
year. A 15 per cent improvement had been achieved on its 1994 model year
cars, he said.
Labour hours per unit have been cut by 54 per cent between 1991 and 1994.
The hourly-paid workforce has been cut by 54 per cent, the salaried
workforce by 37 per cent and inventories by 35 per cent. The workforce fell
from 12,100 in 1990 to 6,750 last year.
Jaguar has invested about Pounds 110m at its three manufacturing plants in
Birmingham and Coventry to prepare for the launch of the XJ series. It has
installed a new final assembly line at the Browns Lane, Coventry plant,
ripping out equipment bought in 1953 from the Standard Motor Co.
According to Mr Scheele the new XJ series is 'the most significant new
Jaguar in a generation', but it is only the first step.
A substantial part of Jaguar spending in the next two years is being devoted
to developing a grand tourer sports coupe and roadster, code-named X100, to
replace the XJS range in the autumn of 1996.
It is also developing a range of V8 engines for use initially in the sports
car, and by the late 1990s as the main Jaguar engine family.
Most important for the future growth of Jaguar is the project to develop a
range of smaller sports saloons to compete with cars such as the BMW 5
series. Code-named X200, this car is due for launch in 1998. It would be an
addition to the range and would more than double Jaguar output to more than
100,000 a year by 1998/99.
The snag for Jaguar's UK workforce is that no decision has yet been made on
a production site. The X200 could become the first Jaguar to be built in
North America. It is being designed as a derivative of a Ford world-car
programme code-named DEW 98, being developed in the US.
Mr Padilla said: 'The important thing for car-buying motivation is the
product, not the manufacturing location. The feedback from our customer
studies is less than compelling in favour of the UK.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Tube chiefs confident of short ride for militants: RMT
members voting for Friday's strike are a small minority in the union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is little sign that Friday's planned 24-hour disruption on London
Underground by members of the RMT transport union will lead to the kind of
prolonged and solid action carried out by signal workers in the past four
months.
It is possible the RMT's national executive council could call further days
of action on the Underground in coming weeks. But yesterday London
Underground management was confident that the militancy would be
short-lived, with many of its 7,700 staff in the RMT coming to work
normally.
Union officials were also sounding less than confident that there was much
mood for conflict among their Underground members.
However Mr Pat Sikorski, one of the most leftwing members of its executive,
comes from London Underground and he is leading the charge.
London Underground hopes half its services will be running normally, but 40
per cent of its drivers belong to the RMT, which also has members among
signal workers, and station and maintenance staff. If they heed the strike
call large parts of the network could be paralysed.
Only 37 per cent of RMT members voted to support strike action and reject a
2.5 per cent pay offer when they were balloted earlier this month. While
2,072 supported disruption, 809 did not.
Only slightly more than one in four RMT members supported the union strike
call. A senior London Transport official said: 'The union lacks a democratic
mandate.'
The other five unions working on the London Underground, with 7,000 members
between them, agreed to the improved 2.5 per cent offer after negotiations
at Acas, the conciliation service, and called off their strike threats.
London Transport said yesterday: 'We have told the RMT there is no question
of re-opening negotiations on this year's pay claim.'
The RMT's behaviour has baffled London Transport senior managers. On Monday
this week they met RMT negotiators at the union's request, expecting that
this meant they would accept the 2.5 per cent pay offer. Union officials had
intimated at the end of last week that they wished to discuss the position
with London Underground 'in order to resolve the issue'.
But Monday's meeting lasted less than an hour. The RMT demanded at least a 4
per cent pay rise for its members. Ms Ann Burfutt, London Underground's
human resources director, said she was 'mystified'.
She said the RMT had already accepted a 2.5 per cent wage improvement for
its members employed at British Rail, and had said at a meeting with London
Underground in June that a 2.5 per cent rise 'could be justified'.
Certainly the union will find it hard to explain to its members why they
should go on strike.
Management estimates that station assistants stand to lose Pounds 60 in pay
for striking on Friday, train operators Pounds 91 and senior signal workers
Pounds 94.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Electronics plant to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC Plessey Semiconductors, the UK's biggest semiconductor manufacturer,
yesterday announced a Pounds 100m expansion of its plant in Plymouth, which
could double the group's turnover within three years.
The investment is the biggest made by the group since 1990, reflecting
fast-growing international demand for semiconductors for use in
communications devices such as mobile phones and multimedia products.
More than 70 per cent of GPS's output is exported.
The move follows last week's announcement of a Pounds 530m semiconductor
investment in Scotland by NEC, the Japanese electronics company. Scotland
won the decision over NEC's biggest semiconductor plant in Roseville,
California.
GPS's plant at Roborough, Plymouth, is a state-of-the-art CMOS semiconductor
plant, one of the company's four facilities in the UK.
The expansion will quadruple its capacity and create a further 150 jobs.
GPS's turnover is expected to reach about Dollars 320m this year, and could
rise to more than Dollars 600m in three years as a result of the latest
expansion.
Mr Ernie Pusey, sales and marketing director, said: 'As we continue to grow
there will need to be further investments.' He said the new investment would
make the Plymouth plant 'one of the most advanced semiconductor facilities
in the world'.
GPT, the Coventry-based telecommunications equipment joint venture between
GEC and Siemens of Germany, has won orders worth about Pounds 18m for
'telepoint' mobile communications equipment for all big towns and cities in
Taiwan.
The order, which GPT says is the world's biggest yet for telepoint
equipment, is for more than 12,000 base stations and associated network
management systems.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Cancer charity's donations down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Imperial Cancer Research Fund yesterday announced job losses and cuts in
cancer research, after a fall in donations.
To meet a 1995-96 spending limit of about Pounds 54m - Pounds 6.5m less than
originally planned - it is closing research centres in Bristol and London
and cutting back significantly in Dundee and Oxford. About 30 of the fund's
1,600 staff could be made redundant.
The charity relies on donations to carry on its work and legacies make up
about 71 per cent of its voluntary income. In recent years legacy income has
gone up by on average 15 per cent a year, but last year saw a slowing in
growth and this year there has been a fall of nearly Pounds 2m.
Sir Walter Bodmer, director-general, said: 'There is now more competition
among charities than in the past for this type of income.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Switch on student admission totals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures for university admissions produced yesterday contradict earlier
estimates that several thousand places would remain unfilled.
Universities are likely to admit slightly more students than they did last
year in spite of a 4 per cent fall in the number of 18-year-olds, the
university admissions service said.
The latest figures, produced as the university applications process reaches
its final week, suggest that the government's well-publicised attempt to cap
admissions at the same level as for 1993 has not depressed demand for higher
education.
The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service said 270,360 university
places had been taken up by Monday - compared with a published figure for
last year of 274,000.
In addition, Ucas said almost 5,000 applicants had definite offers of places
and had not yet told universities whether they had accepted, while between
11,000 and 12,000 late applicants were still awaiting decisions from
universities.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Sharp fall in recorded crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures showing the biggest fall in recorded crime for 40 years rekindled
political disagreement over law and order policies yesterday, Alan Pike
writes.
Crime recorded by police forces in England and Wales fell 5.5 per cent in
the year to June. A total of 5,365,400 offences were recorded in the
previous 12 months, a fall of 311,500 from last year's figures.
Mr David Maclean, home office minister, said the figures showed that rising
crime was not inevitable. The figures were welcome, but the government would
maintain its fight against crime.
Mr Alun Michael, shadow Home Office minister, accused the government of an
exercise in stage management. He said excessive concentration on the overall
reduction in recorded crime was intended to disguise increases in theft from
the person, violence, robbery and sexual offences.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the figures
showed crime prevention activities which Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
failed to back were bringing results.
Results from the most recent British Crime Survey, also published yesterday,
suggest that the proportion of crimes reported is falling.
The anti-terrorism measures operated by the City of London Police achieved
the spin-off of the biggest reduction in recorded crime in the country - an
18 per cent fall, almost three times the fall in London as a whole.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Defence buying will stay British, says Rifkind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said yesterday that the reluctance of
other countries to open their defence procurement markets to competition
meant that Britain would continue to use domestic sources for the vast
majority of its equipment.
About 90 per cent of procurement spending went on British-made equipment, he
said. The government did not object to a more open procurement policy, but
other countries did not agree. UK procurement policies were therefore
unlikely to change. Mr Rifkind was answering questions after making a speech
at the Royal United Services Institute.
Britain is considering a number of big procurement deals involving
international competitors. These include transport aircraft for the Royal
Air Force, attack helicopters for the army and a conventionally armed
stand-off attack missile.
Mr Rifkind commented that much of what President Yeltsin said at the United
Nations on Monday, when he called for further nuclear arms reductions,
seemed to relate to existing agreements. But the Yeltsin text should
nevertheless be studied 'for any new nuggets'. The UK had always worked on
the basis of a minimum credible nuclear deterrent, and had not been in
competition with other countries.
Mr Rifkind said in his speech to the institute that there was a 'quiet
revolution' - assisted by the Front Line First review of costs - in the
management culture of the Ministry of Defence.
He said 17 defence agencies had been created in the past 10 years and there
was a much greater emphasis on personal responsibility and accountability. A
system of budget holders had been established which would produce efficiency
gains.
The ministry had needed to go beyond that, however, to meet the savings
required by the government. The Front Line First programme had done this
across services and departments. The Ministry of Defence yesterday sent
unions a consultative document about changes to its procurement executive.
About 500 jobs are likely to go in the wake of the Front Line First review
because of the streamlining of management, transferring some work from
contractors to staff, and the agency's move to Abbey Wood near Bristol.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Whitehall reforms may be extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, the minister for public service and science, yesterday
signalled that he would press ahead with long-term plans to reform
Whitehall, bringing in the private sector to provide public services
wherever possible, James Blitz writes.
Mr Hunt defended the need for public-sector organisations, saying the
government was determined to improve their responsibility and effectiveness.
He gave full backing to attempts by Whitehall's 100 agencies to introduce
greater commercial discipline through market testing and tendering.
Mr Hunt also gave a strong indication that the government would seek to
privatise some executive agencies before the next general election.
Addressing agency chief executives in London yesterday, Mr Hunt denied that
the Public Service Charter and the 'Next Steps' reforms were 'anti-public
service'. He said: 'We want better, more responsive public services, and the
government values public servants.'
The government has so far privatised only one agency - DVOIT, the
information technology unit of the Department of Transport.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Evidence of skills shortages hardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first authoritative evidence that serious skills shortages are
appearing, particularly in the Midlands and south-east, was published
yesterday in a survey funded by the Department of Employment.
The survey, carried out in the spring, found 11 per cent of employers saying
that they had vacancies they described as 'hard-to-fill' compared with 6 per
cent last year and 5 per cent in 1992.
The figures reinforce growing evidence that the labour market is tightening.
The hard-to-fill vacancies were in sectors such as nursing and teaching, as
well as some blue-collar jobs, particularly in textile manufacturing.
The Confederation of British Industry's last quarterly report in July found
9 per cent of its members believing that shortages of skilled labour would
be a constraint on output - up from 5 per cent in January.
Mr Tony Lloyd, a senior Labour employment spokesman, said yesterday's survey
was alarming. He said: 'It is a disgrace that millions of people remain
unemployed at the same time as employers are unable to fill thousands of
skilled job vacancies.'
In the survey 96 per cent of employers said they would be willing in
principle to employ long-term unemployed people. But the long-term jobless
are generally the least skilled, and in 82 per cent of the cases reporting
hard-to-fill vacancies employers said they were looking for people with
qualifications or experience.
Employers, particularly in manufacturing, distribution and consumer
services, described a skills gap in relation to their business objectives
and their employees - 17 per cent said such a gap existed, the same as last
year.
Employers most frequently felt that computer literacy, personal skills,
general communication, and practical and management skills were the most
needed.
Yet 37 per cent of employers surveyed did not have a training plan for
employees and just under half had no training budget. There was a slight
fall in the number of employers funding or arranging off-the-job training
for at least some employees.
The survey suggests growing penetration of initiatives such as Investors in
People, which seeks to match employees' skills to companies' business plans,
and the new national vocational qualifications.
Two-thirds of those questioned in a survey published yesterday said they
would take a pay cut if the right job came along, Richard Donkin writes.
The survey of 184 female and 75 male job applicants by Select Appointments,
a recruitment agency, found 71 per cent were willing to take a cut in salary
to work in their favourite industry. A slightly higher proportion of men
than women said they would work for less.
Two in five men said that they were willing to take a pay cut of up to 20
per cent and almost one in 10 of them said they would accept a reduction of
up to 30 per cent.
Asked to pick who they would prefer to have as an employer from a list of
eight well-known names, 61 per cent chose Mr Richard Branson, Virgin group
chairman. The least popular choice was Mr Alan Sugar - chosen by 7 per cent
of the respondents.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Former agent sues Lautro over work ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The self-regulating body for the life insurance industry is being sued by a
former sales agent who says that one of its rules contravenes the Treaty of
Rome by preventing him practising his trade.
The action has been brought against Lautro but is in effect against the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog for the private investor
which is taking over Lautro's role.
If successful, the case could open the way for similar actions brought by
some of the 100,000 former insurance agents who have lost their jobs in the
past four years.
Liability for any damages would lie with the PIA's member organisations,
which include banks, life insurers and independent financial advisers.
The action centres on a rule operated by Lautro since 1991. This says that
sales agents who owe Pounds 1,000 or more to a Lautro-registered insurer are
not allowed to work for any other Lautro member. The rule has been adopted
by the PIA.
The rule is highly controversial. It can be used by insurance companies as a
lever to force former agents to repay commission after policies have lapsed.
Behind the rule is the idea that agents with big debts are more likely to
offer consumers poor advice and mis-sell policies. Most insurance
representatives are self-employed and paid on a commission basis so they
have a motivation to maximise sales.
The writ against Lautro - on which neither it nor the PIA wanted to comment
 -has been brought by Mr Charles Bunbury. He says that Lautro's rule stopped
him gaining further work as an insurance agent after he left Oaklife
Insurance in 1991 with a debt of Pounds 17,000. He was unable to pay off
this debt, became bankrupt and is unemployed.
Mr Barry Abrahamson, Mr Bunbury's solicitor and an associate with
Silvermans, a London legal firm, said: 'It's difficult to argue that the
rule protects the public. It really protects other Lautro members by helping
them collect debts. If insurance agents are going to mis-sell they will do
it irrespective of money owed to former companies.'
The writ says the rule contravenes three articles of the Treaty of Rome
which protect individuals' general rights to conduct a business and prevent
companies from exploiting a dominant position.
The rule's operation is also being monitored by the Office of Fair Trading
on the grounds that it could impede the transfer of staff between companies
and discourage industry competition.
Mr Fraser Younson, employment partner in Baker &amp; McKenzie, a City legal
firm, said: 'Public policy is trying to increase job opportunities and the
mobility of the labour force, and this rule could be a bar to achieving
this.'
Mr Alex Bevan of Bevans, the Bristol legal firm, is an expert on legal
disputes involving the insurance industry. He said the case 'had very wide
implications' since it appeared that in many instances the rule operated
harshly.
In Mr Bunbury's case his lawyer is thought likely to argue that the PIA's
members should be liable for damages of several hundred thousand pounds to
compensate his client and restore his financial position. The case is
unlikely to come before the High Court before the end of next year.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Generator to test cleaner burning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new method of burning coal in large power stations which is expected to
reduce emissions of pollutants is to be installed in Scottish Power's main
coal-burning power station at Longannet on the Firth of Forth.
If the initial installation on one boiler is successful the technology will
be applied to the other three boilers at the 2,400MW plant.
Scottish Power says the technology will reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide
(NOx) by 70 per cent. This will allow more coal to be burned before
emissions limits are reached, extending the market for coal.
The new system of burning coal involves installing gas burners which burn
the coal with gas. It has already been installed on smaller boilers.
The technology has been developed by a consortium including Scottish Power,
Babcock Energy, the Italian electricity utility ENEL, the Italian
engineering company Ansaldo, Electricite de France and the Electricity
Supply Board of the Republic of Ireland.
The initial project will cost Pounds 15.8m and, if successful, the entire
station will be converted to gas burn by 1997.

The redesigned London Victoria Coach Station was last night declared overall
winner of the 1994 Design Effectiveness Awards. The judges said that the
Jenkins Group, which carried out the design, 'turned a dump into one of the

Transport between January 1991 and December 1992 while the station remained
open. Projects are judged for the awards on the basis of commercial

<TEXT>
American troops took over and sealed off Haiti's parliament building and the
Port-au-Prince municipal headquarters yesterday in preparation for the
return of elected officials.
The parliament was to convene today, with 10 deputies and two senators
scheduled to return to begin discussions on an amnesty law for Haitian
military leaders. The amnesty was part of the deal worked out by the
military junta and a Washington delegation to avoid a US invasion.
US officials said they expected the mayor of Port-au-Prince, Mr Evans Paul,
to return to his office tomorrow. Mr Paul, who was President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's campaign manager, has been in hiding for much of the three years
since Mr Aristide was overthrown by the army.
Meanwhile, at the UN in New York, the US said it might try to have the
Security Council pass a resolution tomorrow automatically lifting UN
sanctions on Haiti as soon as Mr Aristide returns.
Earlier yesterday, 2,000 hungry Haitians looted a European-funded food
warehouse in Port-au-Prince, fighting each other for bags of rice and beans.
The US army also suffered its first fatality of the operation when a soldier
died from gunshot wounds in an apparent suicide.

Venezuela's GDP contracted by 2.7 per cent during the first half of 1994,
compared to the same period last year, according to preliminary figures
published by the Central Bank of Venezuela. Venezuela's GDP registered
negative growth of 1 per cent in 1993, and the government is projecting a
3.3 per cent contraction for 1994. The consumer price index for the Caracas
metropolitan area rose by 29.4 per cent for the six-month period, compared
with full-year 1993 inflation of 46 per cent. The government estimates that
inflation will reach 65 per cent this year, but it may top 80 per cent. The
bank also reported that international monetary reserves stood at Dollars
8.86bn at the end of June 1994, down from Dollars 12.7bn at the close of
1993, and an overall balance of payments deficit of around Dollars 2.7bn for

Mr Jacques Parizeau made another strong pitch for a separate Quebec, after
being sworn in as the province's 26th premier. The separatist Parti
Quebecois won the September 12 election with 77 National Assembly seats,
against 47 for the federalist Quebec Liberals. But the vote was almost
evenly split. Mr Parizeau, 64, said he would now prepare for a referendum on
sovereignty by the end of 1995 as he announced his 19-member cabinet in
Quebec city. Mr Parizeau appointed an old friend, Mr Jean Campeau, 63, a
former president of the Caisse de Depot, the public pension plan manager, as
finance minister, and Mr Bernard Landry, 57, a key minister in the 1976-84
PQ government, as deputy premier and minister for international affairs. Mr
Paul Begin, PQ vice president and a strong separatist, was named as justice
minister, Mrs Louise Beaudoin as inter-governmental affairs minister and Mr
Daniel Paille, a former vice president of the Quebecor international

requests improved access to information 'to monitor adequately mutual fund
investments, including investments in derivatives'. It is recommended that
funds use a 'quantitative risk measure' of derivatives in fund filings and
that the SEC re-examine leverage restrictions put on funds by mutual fund
oversight laws. The agency also requests that mutual funds keep additional
records to 'enable the inspection staff, among other things, to analyse a

FT  28 SEP 94 / Haiti gun scheme backfires: The market upsets US plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US military opened for business in Port-au-Prince yesterday with a
programme to buy back weapons from civilians. This appeared to be founded
more on wishful thinking than respect for market forces.
Haitians are being asked to hand in their guns as part of the US effort to
secure a stable environment for the retirement of the existing military
leadership and the restoration of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Goodwill may be as much of a factor as the profit incentive.
The price for handguns is USDollars 50, for semi-automatic rifles Dollars
100, for automatic rifles Dollars 200 and for machine guns, mortars and
artillery Dollars 300.
On the black market, however, firearms can fetch more than five times the
amounts offered by the US army. A .45 revolver, for example, could expect to
find a buyer willing to pay as much as USDollars 500.
A further disincentive is that although the US is quoting prices in US
dollars, it intends to pay out in Haitian currency at the official exchange
rate. Considering one can get 18 gourdes for a dollar on the streets as
opposed to 12.5 at official exchange outlets, guns for gourdes is a far less
attractive proposition than handing in weapons for hard currency.
At the Bowen Military Airfield in downtown Port-au-Prince, where the first
buyback facility was opened yesterday, officers acknowledged business had
been 'very, very slow'.
A high-walled truck had been parked on the disused runway to act as a
receptacle for the hand-ins. Lost at the far end of the truck was a sorry
collection of an old M1 carbine rifle, a Saturday Night Special .32 calibre
pistol, and two .38 revolvers. The infantryman on guard described their
operational quality as 'shoddy at best'.
The Haitian offering looked all the more paltry beside the guided missiles,
hand grenades, 20mm cartridges, detonators, M855 magazines and 84mm Five
Launchers piled on palettes on the tarmac.
But US officers were putting on a brave face: 'The first day is going to be
a bit bumpy,' said one 'but when the news gets out and about people will
start rolling in here.' And if they don't, the US was promising to be
flexible on price.

FT  28 SEP 94 / US consumer confidence falls for third month
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer confidence fell this month for the third month in a row, but the
drop has been slight, and consumers remain optimistic enough about the
future to keep the economy growing at a steady pace.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business group whose monthly survey
is one of the most widely watched gauges of consumer sentiment in the US,
said its confidence index fell to 88.4 in September from 90.4 in August, but
has still only dropped a little over 4 points from its peak in June.
'Most of the decrease is caused by lower consumer expectations for the
immediate months ahead. Still, the current level of consumer confidence has
been associated, in the almost 30 year history of this survey, with a
reasonably lively economy,' said Mr Fabian Linden, who heads the Conference
Board's consumer research centre.
This signal of a slightly steadier pace of economic activity, whose largest
determinant is the strength of consumer demand, came as the Federal
Reserve's policy-setting open markets committee met to discuss whether its
policy of raising interest rates had yet done enough to calm the economy and
head off potential inflationary pressures.
According to the Conference Board, slightly more people said business
conditions were bad in September, and more people said jobs are still hard
to get than those who said jobs are plentiful.
Fewer respondents showed interest in buying a new car or a new home in the
months ahead, but plans for appliance purchases remained about the same.
Although slightly more families said they expected conditions to improve in
the near future, the number who feared the economy would worsen rose
significantly.
On balance, the Conference Board said, optimists continue to outnumber
pessimists, but on the outlook for jobs pessimists still outnumber
optimists.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Resurgent Republicans eye the polls
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia yesterday paraded over 300 Republican
candidates for Congress on the steps of the Capitol to sign the party's
'contract with America.'
The publicity stunt, though in the works for several weeks, stood in sharp
contrast with the sense of depression settling on the Democratic Party in
the wake of the death sentence on healthcare reform legislation pronounced
by Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, on Monday afternoon.
Mr Gingrich, currently the Republican whip in the House, is virtually
certain to succeed Mr Bob Michel, who is retiring, as minority leader after
the November 8 elections. Were the Republicans, as he harbours hopes, to win
control of the House he would stand in line to become Speaker.
His 'contract,' designed to galvanise the party in the upcoming campaign by
offering clear policy alternatives, commits the party to bring to the floor
of Congress within 100 days of the start of the next session in January a
fistful of measures long on the Republican wishlist but never enacted by
Congress.
They include a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget, the
line item veto empowering a president to eliminate any specific item of
spending of which he disapproves, lower taxes, term limits for members of
congress, and more spending on defence. It will be accompanied by a large
advertising campaign.
The Democratic response has been sharp in advance. Congressman Vic Fazio of
California dismissed it as 'a blood oath for the rich.' Mr David Wilhelm,
national committee chairman, called it 'voodoo part two, the son of
Reagonomics.'
The White House has also questioned the contract's economics. Mr Leon
Panetta, the chief of staff, called it 'a fraud' that would require Dollars
1,000bn in budget cuts. Ms Alice Rivlin, director of the budget office,
could not see how the budget could be balanced under the contract.
But Mr Panetta did not rule out middle class income tax cuts next year. He
said that while continuing to reduce the budget deficit was an overriding
concern there might be room for some reductions in taxes.
Mr Gingrich's counter was delivered in a weekend TV interview. 'What the
White House is telling the American people is that they have no intention of
getting a balanced budget. What we're saying is that over the next eight
years we're prepared to change the federal government as much as necessary
to get a balanced budget.'

</HEADLINE>

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skoda Automobilova, the Czech car maker which is part of the Volkswagen
group, is hopeful that the launch of its new Felicia model, due to roll off
assembly lines in November, will help revive the company's flagging
fortunes.
Volkswagen, which is due to increase its stake from 31 per cent to 70 per
cent next year, hopes so too.
The company expects to produce 11,000 Felicias by the end of the year and
new assembly lines are currently being installed at its main manufacturing
plant at Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague.
The company's production of the Favorit model, introduced in 1988, ended
earlier this month.
A management and labour dispute over Skoda's plans to lay off 800 workers
could still threaten the timetable for the launch of the Felicia.
The unions remain on strike alert while negotiations continue to try to
resolve the issue.
Skoda made a loss of Kc4.26bn (Dollars 152m) last year on revenues of
Kc35bn, and further losses are expected this year as a result of the fall in
production due to the change of model. After producing 220,000 cars last
year production is expected to fall to 180,000 this year before rising next
year to 1993 levels.
The company is trying to reduce its dependency on the domestic market, where
customers have increasingly preferred to purchase western car models in the
last two years as incomes and spending power among Czechs has risen. Skoda
is targeting new markets in Latin America and South-East Asia. Outside the
Czech Republic, Skoda's main markets are Germany, Poland, Greece, the UK and
Israel.
The company has signed up new distributors in China, North Korea and the
countries of the former Soviet Union in an effort to expand sales in those
markets.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BMW forecasts surge in Japanese sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing popularity of imported cars in Japan will almost triple sales of
BMW cars by the year 2000, according to forecasts by the German car maker.
Mr Siegfried Richter, president of BMW Japan, said that the company expected
to boost annual sales in Japan to 80,000 units in 2000, compared with last
year. Mr Richter was encouraged in his optimistic outlook by the greater
cost-competitiveness of imported cars and a growing acceptance of
foreign-made vehicles by Japanese consumers.
The trend was likely to take the foreign share of Japan's car market to more
than 15 per cent by the turn of the decade, compared with about 6 per cent
now, he said. Efforts by foreign vehicle manufacturers to penetrate the
Japanese market are also being stepped up. BMW, for example, plans to
increase the number of dealers handling its cars to more than 200 from 153
at present. Foreign car makers have also been introducing attractive
low-interest loans.
The German car maker expects sales this year to rise 16 per cent to 30,000
units. In the period from January to August sales have risen more than 12
per cent to 18,689.
Imported cars saw a 40 per cent rise in the first six months of this year to
137,000 units, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. In
August alone, imported cars surged 70 per cent, marking the 10th consecutive
monthly rise.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia launches 'people's car' - The
'Mousedeer' will provide a small alternative to the Proton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia has launched its second national car a decade after it began
manufacturing the Proton. Now the small 660cc Kancil, manufactured 30km
north of Kuala Lumpur, is appearing in the country's showrooms.
The debut of the Kancil - named after the country's 'Mousedeer', a pygmy
deer which lives in the Malaysian jungle - is being hailed by Malaysia's
leaders as an important step in the country's ambitious plans to be fully
industrialised by the year 2020. They are confident that the Kancil will
follow Proton's example and capture a substantial slice of the domestic
market. Exports of the new car are already being discussed.
But the Kancil's success is by no means assured. Analysts forecast a rough
ride before the second car project becomes profitable. The Kancil is
manufactured by Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua, or Perodua, a consortium of local
companies with strong government interests, together with Daihatsu and
Mitsui of Japan. The four-seat sub-compact Kancil is modelled on the
Daihatsu Mira and the Japanese company has a 25 per cent stake in the
project.
Described as the 'people's car', the Kancil is aimed at the lower end of the
market and at those more affluent Malaysians who feel the need for a second
car. At present the cheapest car in Malaysia is the 1300cc Proton Saga,
which sells for around MDollars 32,000 (Dollars 12,500). The basic Kancil
model will sell for about MDollars 24,000, while a deluxe version will be
MDollars 26,000.
Mr Mohar Badiozaman, Perodua's chairman, says that response to the Kancil
has been very encouraging and the company plans to increase monthly
production from 2,000 to 3,000 units to meet demand. 'We are very optimistic
 -the car has only just been launched and already we have bookings for
12,000 units.' says Mr Mohar.
Annual production is expected to reach 45,000 within two years, though
Perodua has capacity to produce 60,000 units. The Kancil, like the Proton,
will benefit from high duties placed on rival, imported cars. A Proton costs
between MDollars 15,000 and MDollars 20,000 less than an equivalent imported
make. Proton has now captured more than 70 per cent of the domestic market.
But the Kancil faces several problems. At least 50 per cent of the content
of the car will initially be sourced from Daihatsu. Since the Kancil project
was given the official go-ahead early last year the yen has increased more
than 30 per cent against the Malaysian currency. Perodua says it compensated
for cost increases by cutting back on capital expenditure. It says the
manufacturing start-up costs have been reduced from MDollars 500m to
MDollars 330m.
The Proton is produced in partnership with Mitsubishi of Japan. Proton says
that after nearly 10 years' production, local content is more than 70 per
cent. But the higher cost items, such as transmission systems, are still
imported from Japan. Proton has not disguised its frustration at what it
perceives as Japanese delays in transferring technology and is looking at
alternative suppliers in France and the US.
Daihatsu has pledged to transfer technology as fast as possible. Perodua
says that the level of local content in the Kancil will rise to 75 per cent
within three years.
Perodua, like all producers of mass market cars, needs to achieve economies
of scale if it is to achieve profitability. This is a tough proposition.
Malaysia has a population of only 19m. While the market for a small car
might be buoyant in the short term, Perodua will have to export to stay
alive.
The Kancil will be hoping to follow the example set by Proton. Mr Nadzmi
Mohamed Salleh, the head of Proton, says that exports have been crucial to
maintaining profitability. 'The domestic market for our existing models is
at near saturation point. To achieve economies of scale we have had to
increase production - that means we have no alternative but to increase
exports.'
Last year Proton produced a record 116,611 cars. Of those more than 17,000
were exported, the bulk of them to Britain where it has been among the
fastest selling cars at the lower end of the market. But sales in Britain
appear to have peaked.
Industry analysts say Proton sales were affected by the recent Malaysian ban
on giving government contracts to British companies. Proton advertising in
Britain now emphasises Japanese technology rather than the Malaysian origin
of the car. Proton has benefited from its exemption from import duties under
the EC's generalised scheme of preferences and sells in Britain for less
than it does in Malaysia.
Proton is now seeking to diversify into other export markets. It is selling
2,000 cars to Indonesia next year under a complicated barter arrangement. It
is also introducing left-hand drive models for export to Latin America and
to the European continent.
But Proton's partner, Mitsubishi, is unhappy that the Malaysian car is
intruding into its own export markets. Daihatsu is likely to raise similar
objections if the Kancil starts eating into its export sales.
Though Malaysia's leaders view the formation of a national car industry as
one of the country's great achievements, it has been a costly exercise with
hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds poured into Proton. Despite
a 35 per cent increase in turnover last year Proton's pre-tax profits
dropped 9.3 per cent to MDollars 282m.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, was the driving force behind
the establishment of Proton. He has also played a leading role in bringing
the Kancil to life. Critics accuse Dr Mahathir of being overly keen on
prestige projects: a third national car project, in which Proton will be
teamed up with Peugeot-Citroen, is already in the pipeline. 'The Kancil will
sell well in the short term,' says a Kuala Lumpur based industry analyst.
'But I doubt that it will match the success of the Proton.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Mazda ends Ford sales agreement -
Marketing cutback in US

Mazda, the Japanese car maker, is to cease selling recreational vehicles
manufactured by Ford in the US market.
Mazda said yesterday that it will not be receiving the 1995 model of Ford's
two-door recreational vehicle which Mazda has been marketing in the US as
the Navajo.
Mazda's sales of the two-door Navajo has slumped to 560 units a month this
year, down from about 850 units a month in 1990 when it began marketing
Ford's off-road vehicle. The move highlights the difficulties vehicle
manufacturers face when forming partnerships with competitors.
The Japanese company, however, was continuing negotiations with Ford to
receive and sell the more popular four-door version of the Navajo, but
agreement was not expected.
Ford holds a 24.5 per cent stake in the Japanese group and in June this year
it strengthened its ties by increasing its representation on the Mazda board
with the appointment of three Ford executives.
The appointments at Mazda underlined the problems at the Japanese car maker
due to the economic slowdown in Japan and overcapacity in other world
markets. The Ford appointments were announced together with a major revamp
of top management at Mazda, with five board members retiring.
The end of the Mazda-Ford sales venture in the US is another bump in the
road towards closer co-operation between the two vehicle producers.
Negotiations between the two companies on the European market, where Mazda
would like to use Ford's facilities as a manufacturing base, have so far
yielded no results after collapsing at one point early last year.
Mazda is one of the last main Japanese car companies with no manufacturing
base in Europe and last year the company blamed a 23 per cent fall in
overall exports in large part on slow demand in Europe. Seven of the eight
Japanese manufacturers in the west European market saw the volume of sales
fall in the first six months of this year.
Mazda did not comment on its proposed venture with Ford to manufacture
pick-up trucks in Thailand.
The companies started feasibility studies, to be completed next spring, of
the South-East Asian pick-up truck market, after which details of the
venture will be decided.
Production was set to start in 1998. Mazda has a joint venture production
line with Japanese and Thai companies in Bangkok.
Mazda said the Ford venture would run separately from the existing plant,
now working at full capacity.
Mazda holds 4 per cent of the Thai pick-up truck market, trailing Japanese
car makers Isuzu, which holds 31 per cent, and Toyota, at 27 per cent. Ford
only has a 0.2 per cent share.
Pick-up trucks account for 90 per cent of Thailand's commercial vehicle
market.
Among Japanese car makers Mazda is particularly in need of an alliance which
could help raise efficiency by making better use of its facilities and goes
some way towards furthering its global ambitions.
The company is suffering under the twin burdens of its under-utilised
state-of-the-art plant in which it invested heavily, and a large
distribution network for which it needs to supply a wide range of models.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday said it had applied for approval to start
flights to Madras and hoped to launch services from next spring as part of
its attempt to open up a southern India gateway and expand services to
existing destinations. At present KLM flies four times a week to Delhi,
three times to Bombay and once to Calcutta. KLM needs extra capacity as load
factors have been at 95 per cent for nine months of the year on Indian
routes. In the cargo market, KLM is seeking to build up freighter flights
from Dubai to Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore and Madras.

Pakistan is next month expected to seek investments of up to Dollars 5bn for
new transmission lines and oil storage facilities following this week's
success in attracting investment in the country's energy sector. Despite the
aggressive push, it is not entirely clear if the financing required for
these proposed projects can be put together. Sponsors of new projects would
be required to accept an 80:20 or 70:30 debt-equity ratio. Some investors
hope that the Pakistani government will expedite its first Dollars 200m
sovereign bond offer, on hold since the summer due to recent turbulence on
international bond markets.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese trade minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, flew into Washington
yesterday in a last-ditch effort to avert a sanctions showdown with the US.
President Bill Clinton has given Tokyo until Friday to open some of its
markets or risk punitive action on items such as car parts and glass.
Commenting on the sanctions threat, Mr Hashimoto said: 'We will try to keep
that from happening. That's why I'm here. We'll make efforts. We don't know
how it will turn out.' A US official said every option was on the table.
'These kinds of deals are often struck at the last minute, so who can say
until you've seen your opponent's last hand,' the US official said. Some
aides are forecasting that the outcome of the talks may be a partial deal
and partial sanctions, but that could well shift as the deadline nears.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US fears delay of Uruguay Round law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton Administration yesterday sent the long awaited legislation to
implement the Uruguay Round to Congress in the hope of getting passage
before the end of the Congressional term.
The most immediate obstacle to passage may be Senator Ernest Hollings, a
South Carolina Democrat. The Senator, who represents textile producers, is
not expected to support the pact.
As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he has the power to hold the
legislation up for 45 days of hearings. This would make passage this year
impossible.
Business lobbyists are conducting a frantic campaign to convince Republicans
not to deny the president a victory on trade for partisan reasons.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, said yesterday Senator
Hollings was 'very happy with major parts' of the bill but 'not happy with
other parts.' 'No deals have been offered and no deals have been cut
 ..(but) Senator Hollings is a friend of this Administration,' he said.
Mr Kantor said the legislation would include a one year extension of the
generalised system of preferences, which offers duty-free tariffs to
developing country industries and extension of a modified 'Super 301' under
which the Administration lists country's trade barriers and tries to
negotiate them out of existence.
Confusion surrounds the intentions of the Republican leadership, which has
traditionally supported international trade initiatives.
Having successfully killed off health insurance reform, they are now
considering denying President Clinton a trade victory.
Mr Kantor insisted the legislation would pass this year with bipartisan
support.
There is a high degree of nervousness in the business community because it
is unclear if legislation submitted this year could be taken up in the new
Congress under 'fast track rules' which forbid amendments. The implementing
legislation might have to be re-introduced and then move to Congress like
other bills, where it would be subject to amendment and filibuster in the
Senate.
It all boils down to a high-risk strategy for one of the Administration's
most important initiatives.
Business lobbyists are expressing bitterness. They believe trade officials
tarried over the legislation, wasting valuable time in its efforts to get
new fast track authority. Because the Administration sought to include
environment and labour initiatives opposed by business and Republicans, it
ultimately was forced to jettison the fast track.
The Administration has had to work in an environment of intense political
warfare which now has some Republicans threatening to destroy their own

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Nigeria selects consortium to build gas
plant

<TEXT>
The Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company has selected a consortium led by
Kellogg of the US as the preferred contractor for a turnkey contract to
build a proposed natural gas liquefaction plant near Bonny in eastern
Nigeria. The contract is due to be awarded in the first quarter of 1995,
provided that NLNG has completed the financing for the project, estimated to
cost Dollars 4.6bn.
The Kellogg consortium includes Technip of France, Snamprogetti of Italy,
and the Japanese Gas Company (JGC). The rival consortium is led by Bechtel
of the US. Kellogg and Bechtel, which have built most of the world's LNG
plants, were both invited to re-bid using the Air Products liquefaction
process after the Nigerian government overturned the decision by technical
advisers Shell to award the contract to Kellogg using a process designed by
Technip.
That was the last of several false starts for the controversial project
since its conception more than 20 years ago. Last year the project was
relaunched with Shell taking the lead and the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) reducing its stake to 49 per cent. Shell, Elf Aquitaine
and Agip hold another 49 per cent and the International Finance Corporation
has agreed in principle to take the remaining 2 per cent.
The crucial issue now is financing. The second stage of funding for the
Nigeria LNG company is in place after the Nigerian government and its
foreign partners, Shell, Elf and Agip, recently increased the total
shareholders' capital in two escrow accounts to about Dollars 1bn, a large
part of the equity which it expects to need for the project. About 40 per
cent will be equity and the rest loans. Schroders merchant bank is helping
the company to raise finance from export credit agencies and other official
creditors, while the International Finance Corporation will lead the
commercial bank funding.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Eastern Europe varies widely on incentives
 -Foreign investors are offered fewer perks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Most of the countries of central and eastern Europe have ceased to grant
automatic tax or subsidy incentives to foreign investors and are
increasingly treating domestic and foreign investment on equal terms, a
United Nations study shows.
In a comparison of foreign investment legislation*, the UN Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE) says governments in the region continue to adopt
a largely liberal approach to foreign investment, though a 'surprising
variety' of treatment exists.
Foreign investors in Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and, with a few
exceptions, Poland and Slovakia, do not have to seek special approval. In
other countries they do. Tax rates also vary widely.
Despite these differences, the ECE notes a general trend towards
even-handedness between foreign and domestic investment. Thus there are now
no discriminatory tax or subsidy benefits for foreign investments in the
Czech and Slovak republics, and 'for all practical purposes' Belarus,
Poland, Slovenia and Bulgaria (though selected investment projects may
receive help).
Hungary, which has attracted far and away the largest amount of overseas
investment in the region since 1989, ceased offering incentives to new
foreign investors from the beginning of this year. Not surprisingly, those
countries with the most difficulties in attracting foreign funds - Ukraine,
Romania and most central Asian republics - are most likely to have generous
incentives such as five-to-10-year tax holidays and reductions in profit
tax.
Russia too, despite its recent success in pulling in overseas investment,
which has been largely due to privatisation, announced in June a
wide-ranging incentive package, including a five-year profit tax holiday and
exemption of customs duties on imports of raw materials and components. The
ECE says the number of foreign investment registrations in Russia more than
doubled last year to nearly 8,000 and in March totalled 8,300. However, this
compares with 22,510 in Hungary (whose 10m population is one-fifteenth of
Russia's) and 30,458 in Romania, though Romanian joint ventures are mostly
very small.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Fujinami cleared of Recruit bribe charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Takao Fujinami, a former chief cabinet secretary and the most prominent
figure to be charged in Japan's Recruit shares-for-favours scandal, was
yesterday cleared of bribery charges.
The Tokyo District Court declared him not guilty of accepting Y20m (Pounds
129,000) and 10,000 shares during the mid-1980s from Recruit Cosmos, a
property developer, in return for political favours.
The affair, in which politicians received shares in Recruit before it was
listed on the stock exchange and the price rose, damaged public trust in the
political establishment.
It became a popular morality tale of the rapid economic growth and rise in
asset prices of the late 1980s.
Mr Fujinami, 61, a close aide to the former Liberal Democratic party prime
minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, was the first politician to be charged over
the Recruit scandal, in 1989.
The court accepted Mr Fujinami's claim that he had received legitimate
political donations, not bribes, from Recruit.
The public prosecutor, who had argued for a 3 1/2 -year prison term and a
fine of Y42.7m, has said he will appeal against the court's verdict.
Once tipped as a potential prime minister, Mr Fujinami was seen as the
scapegoat chosen to take the blame on behalf of the LDP, his former party.
Mr Fujinami's political career was severely damaged, but this will perhaps
prove to have been only a temporary setback, if his acquittal by the court
sticks.
The scandal led to the resignation of an LDP prime minister, Mr Noboru
Takeshita, in 1989, tarnished Mr Nakasone's reputation, and contributed to
the LDP's defeat in last year's general election.
It also fuelled popular demand for political reforms, which are due to
complete their final legislative stage in the parliamentary session starting
at the end of this week.
Senior LDP officials, including Mr Nakasone, said they looked forward to
welcoming Mr Fujinami back to the party. Opposition figures condemned the
acquittal.
Mr Fujinami, who left the LDP to stand as an independent after his
indictment, paid the price for his links with Recruit in last year's
election, when he lost his seat to a strong LDP candidate.
He had maintained that re-election would be proof of voters' trust in his
innocence, a claim vindicated more than a year too late by yesterday's court
decision.
There is one other politician yet to be sentenced among the other 11
defendants in the Recruit scandal. He is Mr Katsuya Ikeda, a former lower
house member of Komeito, the Clean Government party and largest opposition
group. He faces sentencing on December 21. Four others have already received
suspended prison terms.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Japan lays its cards on UN table: A look at a new approach
that may win friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan, until yesterday a timid aspirant to the top table of world powers,
has at last brought its international diplomatic ambitions into the open.
Foreign minister Yohei Kono's address to the United Nations, unprecedented
in its directness, leaves no doubt that Japan, like Germany, believes the
Security Council needs enlarging to reflect the growing importance of
pacifist, non-nuclear powers in a post-cold war world.
If Japan's hitherto tentative bid to become a permanent member of the
council comes off, it promises to offer a different model of leadership to
the present six members.
Japan's dovish new government sees itself as no international policeman, but
rather the champion of a global welfare state, in which rich countries
concentrate on refugee relief, overpopulation, arms control, the environment
and fighting Aids.
This contrasts with the more assertive international presence favoured by Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, the political opposition's main strategic thinker. Mr Ozawa
believes Japan's pacifist constitution should be changed to enable it to
take part in UN military peacekeeping activities like a 'normal country'.
The government and foreign ministry lean towards interpreting the existing
constitution flexibly, to make the maximum non-military contribution to the
UN's growing activities. Either way - the government's gentle line or Mr
Ozawa's assertive one - both lead Japan to assume international duties more
commensurate with its economic weight.
Japan's new straightforwardness is partly a consequence of the growing
chorus of international support for its desire to join the UN club. They
include, over the past month, a visit from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, who helpfully underlined that he saw no problem in Japan
assuming non-military permanent membership of the Security Council; and
visits from senior ministers from 40 countries including the US, Britain,
Australia, the Philippines and Malaysia.
Mr Kono's speech is a success for the foreign ministry, which has been
waging a patient behind-the-scenes campaign for UN membership since the end
of the cold war and through three changes of Japanese government over the
past year.
As a symbol of its resolve, the ministry appointed its most senior diplomat,
Mr Hisashi Owada, an avid advocate of membership, as its UN ambassador early
this year.
The arrival of the current government at the end of June, under a socialist
prime minister, at first looked like a setback for the ministry's UN
ambitions. But the Social Democratic party's subsequent abandonment of its
traditional rigid anti-UN pacifism meant that for the first time in post-war
history the full political spectrum supported membership.
The ministry's main argument is that Japan deserves more influence in
international affairs, as the world's largest aid donor, with a budget of
Y1,063bn (Pounds 6.8bn) this year, and the UN's second largest contributor,
paying just over 12 per cent of its budget.
Moreover, Japan increasingly has something - even if it is delicately shaded
 -to say, contrary to its reputation for having no foreign policy, argue
officials. It was Japanese influence, for example, that ensured that the
Khmer Rouge was involved in Cambodian peace talks in 1991, they maintain.
Today, Japan has clear feelings on the importance of exerting more gradual
pressure on North Korea, over its nuclear ambitions, than does the US. As a
non-permanent member, it has to rely on other means to influence UN policy
on this potentially explosive problem on its doorstep.
Stung by the criticism it attracted for making a merely financial
contribution to the 1991 gulf war, Japan has since stepped up its human
contribution to helping the world's trouble spots.
Two prominent Japanese, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees,
and Mr Yasushi Akasahi, UN special envoy to former Yugoslavia, have played
leading parts in Bosnia. Japanese troops have helped keep the peace in
Mozambique and Cambodia, and recently embarked on a new mission, to help
Rwandan refugees in Zaire, where a lightly armed Japanese contingent is now
trying not to flinch at nearby gunfire.
All this, Tokyo hopes, will be sufficient to persuade the requisite
two-thirds of the UN general assembly and all five permanent council members
that Japan has the credentials to join the top table.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Taiwan beats Beijing over Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday won a marginal victory over Beijing in a fracas over
whether a Taiwanese official would be permitted to attend the Asian Games,
starting in Hiroshima on Sunday.
Beijing yesterday withdrew its threat to boycott the games, signalling an
end to the two-month row.
It had earlier warned of 'grave consequences' if Tokyo were to grant Mr Hsu
Li-teh, Taiwan's deputy premier, a visa to Japan.
The matter was apparently settled at a meeting between Japan's foreign
minister Yohei Kono and his Chinese counterpart, Mr Qian Qichen, in New York
on Monday.
Japan was put into an awkward position in late July when the Olympic Council
of Asia, organiser of the games, invited Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to
attend the opening ceremonies, apparently by dint of Taiwanese lobbying
efforts. Japan pressed the OCA into rescinding its invitation. Mr Hsu is to
take his place.
Observers said that while Taiwan's strategy was effective in eliciting
attention and sympathy among Japanese politicians and the general public, it
could backfire. Japan would henceforth be ultra-conservative in dealing with
Taiwan and other countries with substantial legislative and popular support
for Taiwan.
'Hsu Li-teh will go to Japan, but his activities will be severely restricted
to those relating to the Asian Games,' said Mr Lu Ya-li, a politics
professor at National Taiwan University. 'Japanese bureaucrats do not
appreciate having their hands forced by foreign governments'.
In recent weeks Taipei appears to have embarked on a marked departure from
its long-standing discreet approach to gaining international recognition,
observers said.
The new, more aggressive posture demonstrated in the Asian Games incident
has emanated directly from the Presidential Palace rather than from the
foreign ministry, and appears to be driven almost exclusively by domestic
politics, they added. Fearing the rising strength of the pro-independence
opposition, the ruling Kuomintang is desperate for a foreign relations
breakthrough ahead of key elections in early December.

Commonwealth finance ministers are likely to welcome the UK's initiative on
debt relief when they issue a communique at the end of their meeting in
Malta today.
UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke has proposed that the debt burden of poor
countries be relieved by extending the Trinidad terms, which cover bilateral
debt, to debt owed to financial institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund.
The debt relief programme would be financed by sales of up to 10 per cent of
the IMF's Dollars 40bn of gold reserves.
While the support of the Commonwealth countries will be welcomed by the UK,
it is likely to face serious opposition at the IMF meeting in Madrid next
week.
Some nations will be cautious about the gold sales, since this will be
perceived as weakening the creditworthiness of the IMF.

<TEXT>
Japan's index of leading economic indicators stood at 60.0 in July, the
seventh straight month it was above the so-called 'boom-or-bust' threshold
of 50.0, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) announced yesterday, AP-DJ
reports from Tokyo
The EPA considers a reading above 50 as auguring economic expansion over the
short term but a level below 50 as heralding contraction.
The June leading index was revised by the agency from the preliminary 54.5
and May revised from the preliminary 58.3.
An agency official briefing reporters on the data said there was no change
in the agency's assessment that 'there is an increasing chance that the
economy is entering a new phase'.
He also suggested that the coincident indicator, a key component in the
index measuring the present state of the economy, stands a strong chance of
exceeding 50 in August, as the forecast by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry for a 1.6 per cent jump in industrial output would push
that component of the index from negative to positive territory.
Among components of the leading index, the counter-cyclical final
demand-to-inventories index changed from negative to positive in July, the
only part of the index that shifted direction from a month earlier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Crucial talks between the US and North Korea on Pyongyang's suspect nuclear
programme appeared to have run into trouble yesterday as the US reported 'no
progress' and North Korea stepped up threats to pull out of the talks.
The two delegations met yesterday after consulting their respective capitals
on terms of a settlement which would give North Korea safer nuclear
technology in return for a freeze on its existing plutonium-generating
reactors and a pledge to open nuclear sites to international inspection.
However, a US statement after the talks said there had been no progress. Mr
Robert Gallucci, US chief negotiator, and Mr Kang Sok-ju, his North Korean
opposite number, will meet again today.
Earlier, Pyongyang repeated its threat to break off negotiations in response
to the deployment of US warships in the Sea of Japan. The move was
unhelpfully described last week by the commander of the US Pacific Fleet as
a means of putting pressure on North Korea at the Geneva talks.
'Now that the United States is seeking a military showdown, we cannot stick
to talks indefinitely,' a spokesman for the People's Armed Forces ministry
said yesterday.
'Our People's Army pins no hope on any dialogue accompanied by pressure,'
the spokesman said.
Although the two sides may be talking down the negotiations to gain
bargaining advantage, it is hard to discern any tangible signs of progress
on issues Washington says are vital to fleshing out the outline accord
reached last month.
Yesterday's statement from Pyongyang, carried by the official Korean Central
News Agency, said North Korea would 'never' allow special inspections of
military sites.
The US has insisted all along that at some point Pyongyang will have to open
to international inspection two nuclear waste dumps which could provide
clues on whether North Korea diverted plutonium for atomic weapons.
North Korea has also argued with US proposals for organising and financing
the provision of two light-water nuclear reactors, costing some Dollars 4bn,
demanded extra cash as compensation for abandoning its graphite-moderated
reactor programme, and refused a US offer to help ship to a third country
8,000 spent fuel rods which are mouldering in a storage pond.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Keating party backs sale of airports
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HOBART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government will go ahead with the sale of 22 airports owned
by the Federal Airports Corporation after the ruling Labor party backed a
compromise sell-off proposal at its party conference in Hobart yesterday.
But the government has been forced to make concessions over the shape of the
sale and place significant constraints on bidders, to secure support from
left-wing factions.
These could affect the proceeds received from the sell-off. Estimated sale
revenue had previously been put at about ADollars 2bn (Pounds 938m).
The deal approved by the ALP conference requires that the airports are sold
on leases of 50 years, rather than as freehold.
A controlling interest must remain in Australian hands. Airlines, or their
associated interests, will be unable to acquire more than a 5 per cent
equity interest.
Measures will also be taken to prevent ownership concentration in the key
east coast area.
'Bundling' of airports for sale, especially across state lines, will be
minimised and, where possible, the airports will be sold individually.
Existing 'award' employment conditions for staff of the Federal Airports
Corporation must also be maintained.
Finally, control of airport pricing and supervision to ensure competition
between the properties will rest with the Prices Surveillance Authority and
the Trade Practices Commission respectively.
The ALP's hope is that local institutional investors will step forward as
bidders, although the motion passed by the conference yesterday stated that
state and local government bodies would also be encouraged to become
involved.
But to date the most heavily publicised interest in the airports has come
from international operators, such as BAA, the British airports group.
The federal government will also refinance some smaller regional airports,
at present loss-making, to make them attractive sale candidates.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Slums and fear fuel plague: A look at India's public health
service concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flight of 100 plague-stricken patients from hospital in the city of
Surat is a disturbing comment on public confidence in the Indian health
service.
After the patients ran away at the weekend because they felt they would be
better off with their families, the authorities surrounded the hospital with
paramilitary troops to prevent more escapes.
The outbreak of pneumonic plague, which has claimed at least 43 lives since
it broke out in Surat last week, has highlighted strengths and weaknesses in
India's health service. On the one hand, the authorities seemed by yesterday
to have brought the disease under control with no deaths reported since
Monday. The rapid distribution of a simple remedy  - the antibiotic
tetracycline - has ensured that few victims have died once under medical
care.
On the other hand, the sick in Surat ran away from hospital. Moreover,
between 300,000-500,000 residents, some of them doctors and nurses, fled the
city altogether rather than trust the health authorities to protect them.
Ignorance about plague is at the root of these fears. The last serious
outbreaks of plague in India 30 years ago are within living memory of many
Indians. They remember only the speed with which it strikes down victims,
not the effectiveness of tetracycline which was not then as freely available
as it is today.
Dr K. K. Aggarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association, says: 'There
is absolutely no reason to panic. But people do panic because they are
afraid they cannot get medicine and because they consult fellow laymen and
quacks. Even some doctors do not know how to treat plague because it is so
rare.'
But many doctors believe that inadequate public health services, which are
responsible for monitoring community health and preventive medicine,
contribute to popular ignorance and fear. Dr D. Banerji, professor emeritus
at the centre of social health and community medicine at Jawaharlal Nehru
University, says it took the health authorities too long to respond to the
Surat outbreak, so allowing panic to spread. 'The government was not alert
enough.'
Dr L. M. Nath, dean of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and head
of its public health department, believes that the authorities should not be
criticised for their handling of the Surat outbreak. Their actions were
prompt, he says.
But he believes that India has under-invested in public health and points
out that the country has only one college of public health compared with 146
medical colleges. He hopes the Surat outbreak will prompt a review. 'Perhaps
this cloud will have a silver lining.'
But shortages of money will limit the scope for improvements in public
health. There is a severe squeeze on public finances, particularly of
India's states, which control healthcare. The proportion of gross domestic
product spent by the states on social services, including health, has fallen
from 5.3 per cent in 1990-91 to 4.8 per cent in the year to March 1994,
according to the World Bank.
These concerns need to be put in context. While India's population has risen
146 per cent since 1951, the number of doctors has soared 550 per cent and
the number of hospitals 300 per cent. Life expectancy at birth has almost
doubled from 32 years to 60.3 years. Smallpox has been eradicated and
leprosy and other killer diseases greatly reduced.
But the economic and social development which has made these gains possible
has created ever-higher expectations of improvements in healthcare. It has
also magnified problems, notably the spread of slums in large cities,
including Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi. Because slums are often developed
illegally by squatting on empty land, the authorities are unable to provide
sanitation or other civil services, even where they could afford to.
Dr K. K. Dutta, the director of the government's National Institute of
Communicable Diseases says: 'It's no secret that that the low levels of
health in slums are a threat to the overall gain India has made in health
standards.'
Since the population of the slums is still growing and is forecast to grow
further as the economy develops, the dangers to health will also multiply.
Dr Nath says there is no answer except to increase spending not just on
public health but also on services such as water and sanitation. But the
cost will be enormous. 'In India spending even one rupee a head is a a lot
of rupees.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Travellers face extra checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<TEXT>
Germany and France have become the first European countries to introduce
extra health checks on travellers from India, where an outbreak of pneumonic
plague has killed at least 43 people.
Other European countries, including Britain and the Netherlands, said they
saw no reason for tighter controls yet. In London, the Immigration
Department at the Home Office said: 'The Department of Health has decided
that current procedures at Heathrow Airport are adequate and no extra checks
are necessary for the moment.'
The decision by Germany and France follows new measures by Hong Kong,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, some Gulf states and South Korea. Many Asian
countries have a large number of Indian expatriate workers.
A Frankfurt airport spokesman said last night that doctors had boarded early
morning flights from India and checked passengers for symptoms of fever. All
other flights from India would be monitored.
France began conducting special medical examinations at the main Paris
airports over the weekend. The French health ministry said disinfectant
measures on flights from plague-affected areas had been stepped up.
The six Gulf states - UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar -
have decided to screen all passengers arriving from India.
The US yesterday warned arriving travellers to see a doctor if they develop
symptoms. 'Plague alert notices' are being handed to airline passengers
arriving directly from India.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Abacha moves military men into power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Sani Abacha yesterday tightened control over Nigeria by bringing key
members of the armed forces into an expanded Provisional Ruling Council
(PRC), and removing the remaining civilian members.
The new line-up reflects the uncompromising stance of Gen Abacha since
mid-August towards anti-government strikes and protests in support of the
presidential claims of the jailed opposition leader Mr Moshood Abiola.
A challenge to Gen Abacha's authority from within the regime during the
two-month oil workers strikes led to the dismissal of Major-General Chris
Alli as head of the army last month, and a number of changes in key posts in
the armed forces.
Gen Abacha has said he is preparing to hand over to a dem-ocratically
elected government, but he has banned political parties, closed newspapers,
arrested civilian critics and detained and charged Mr Abiola with treason.
Mr Abiola declared himself president on the anniversary of his unofficial
victory in last year's general election.
The evolution from a military junta with democratic sympathies into an
authoritarian regime in nine months became clear earlier this month with a
series of decrees which strengthened its unconstitutional powers and
declared it had come to power in a 'military revolution'. Last November the
military claimed that it was invited to rescue the country from anarchy.
Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya, like Mr Abiola a member of the Yoruba tribe
from the south-west, survives the reshuffle as number two in the regime, but
has lost influence since the Abacha regime took control in November 1993.
The 25-man PRC is dominated by officers from the Hausa speaking north which
has held power for more than a decade. The PRC has never functioned as a
policy-making body, and decisions have usually been taken by Gen Abacha with
small groups of advisers.
Although this is likely to continue, the new body includes officers who are
seen as either loyal or indispensible to the survival of the regime.
The chief of defence staff and chiefs of the the army, navy and air force
and police are joined in the PRC by the commanders of the four main infantry
divisions which form the backbone of the army.
Other new members are commander of the Lagos garrison, the heads of the
military intelligence services which have been vital to Gen Abacha's tenure
of power, and the commanders of the leading staff organisations - the
military academy, the staff college and the war college.

FT  28 SEP 94 / African trade union rights abuse 'acute'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade union rights violations in Africa remain 'widespread and acute',
according to a report produced by the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions. The document is to be discussed at the Pan-African conference
on organised labour, opening today in Cotonou, Benin.
Structural adjustment policies imposed by bodies like the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund as well as January's devaluation of the CFA
franc in the former French colonies in Africa are blamed for creating
economic conditions where the exercise of trade union rights has become a
'virtual impossibility'.
'The most widespread problem is in situations in which pressures to reduce
public expenditure have brought unilateral reductions in the collectively
agreed wages of public employees or quite simply have led to the non-payment
of wages for periods of several months,' says the report.
It points to pay cuts and detention of union leaders in Cameroon, Niger,
Gabon, Benin and Chad.
Both in Zimbabwe and Malawi, trade unions have been bypassed by the creation
of parallel workplace bodies subject to employer or government control, it
points out. However,only Sudan, Libya and Equatorial Guinea among African
states actually outlaw independent trade union activity.
It suggests trade unions have to operate 'frequently in the context of
serious denials of basic civil liberties'. In Lesotho, it argues there has
been 'extreme and arbitrary brutality' against trade unions, while in
Morocco, union leaders have been jailed for exercising their right to free
expression.
The survey says as many as 16 African countries make it 'almost impossible'
for unions to use legal strikes as an effective means of advancing
employees' interests.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Inkatha intends to sue Mandela over killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party said yesterday it intends to sue
President Nelson Mandela, his African National Congress party and the South
African police for R8m (Pounds 2.2m) damages, following the killing of eight
IFP supporters outside the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg last March.
Announcing the lawsuits, Mr Themba Khoza, IFP political director, said
summonses had been served on Mr Mandela and Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC
secretary-general, for allegedly obstructing a police investigation into the
incident.
Summonses had also been served on Mr Sydney Mufamadi, safety and security
minister, and General Koos Calitz, regional commissioner of police, for
alleged inadequate protection of the marchers.
The decision marks a new deterioration in relations between the ANC and
Inkatha, partners with the National Party in the ruling National Unity
government.
Before the April election, ANC and Inkatha supporters were frequently
involved in clashes; in recent months they have been embroiled in disputes
within the KwaZulu/Natal provincial government.
Inkatha has for several months been demanding a full investigation into the
killings, which occurred when a crowd of its supporters were apparently
fired on by ANC security guards during a political demonstration.
The timing of the announcement seems designed to deflect attention from the
controversy surrounding Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha party leader and
home affairs minister.
On Sunday night, the chief and a group of bodyguards interrupted a live
broadcast by Prince Sifiso Zulu, a political rival instrumental in
persuading the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to break off relations with
Chief Buthelezi last week.
Chief Buthelezi has since apologised for the incident, saying he was not
aware the television programme was still on the air, but his actions have
been widely condemned, and Prince Sifiso Zulu has said he will press charges
against the chief.
The ANC has released a statement critical of Chief Buthelezi. President
Mandela will not make a statement until he has discussed the issue with the
cabinet today.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Wide relief over arms embargo: Bosnian Moslems accept delay
in ending ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were sighs of relief in a bizarre mixture of places - from Downing
Street and the Elysee to the embattled enclaves of eastern Bosnia - as it
became clear yesterday that Bosnia's Moslem leaders would not press their
friends in the US administration for an early end to the arms embargo.
Foreign ministries in at least three European capitals - London, Paris, and
Bonn - were taking quiet pleasure in the fact that the one of the bitterest
transatlantic disputes since the second world war has for now been averted.
Senior European officials had been warning that the standoff over arms
supplies to Bosnia had the potential to create the biggest diplomatic row
between the US and its closest European allies since the Suez crisis of
1956, when Washington opposed the Anglo-French intervention in Egypt.
They have stressed the devastating blow which such a crisis would deal to
Nato's credibility, far exceeding any damage which the alliance may already
have suffered from the relative mildness of its air activity over Bosnia.
In their worst nightmares, the European states which contribute ground
forces to the UN in Bosnia had imagined a heavily contested withdrawal -
with the risk of heavy casualties - as the Serbs took revenge on the
international community for arming their Moslem and Croat enemies.
Nato contingency plans for a withdrawal in hostile conditions have yet to be
finalised, and it has never been made clear how much help the Americans
would offer.
European governments have said such an operation would require the
involvement of US ground troops; but the US might be reluctant to commit
soldiers to an operation in which many could be killed.
In Washington, US officials said the Bosnian government's willingness to
wait six months more for the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo
gives further opportunities to press the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace
settlement.
'That five or six months could be very important in trying to persuade the
Bosnian Serbs that they should accept the peace plan put forward by the
contact group,' said Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
The contact group, which includes the US, Russia, the UK and France,
proposed a settlement that would give the Moslems and Croats 51 per cent of
the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina and require the Bosnian Serbs to reduce
the portion they now control to 49 per cent.
But the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject the plan, and pressure has been
steadily mounting in the US Congress to compel President Bill Clinton to
break the UN-imposed arms embargo by supplying weapons to the Bosnian
Moslems.
Mr Christopher insisted that the idea of delaying the lifting of the arms
embargo came from Bosnia, not the US.
Nevertheless, the move offers a welcome relief to the US administration,
which has been backed by Congress into a corner where it might be forced to
break a UN embargo against the opposition not only of Russia but also of
France and the UK, which have peacekeeping troops at risk in Bosnia.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, first broached the idea to
Mr Christopher last week and Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president,
discussed it with Mr Clinton on Monday.
Mr Christopher said Bosnia's reasoning was affected by the onset of winter
and the military situation.
'They have indicated they thought in their own self-interest it was better
not to have the lifting at this time,' Mr Christopher said.
Some observers have warned that the immediate effect of lifting the arms
embargo might be to harm the Bosnian Moslems more than the Serbs. It might
be particularly disastrous for the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica, which is
surrounded by Serb forces in eastern Bosnia.
Mr Clinton, meanwhile, warned in his speech to the UN on Monday that the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo 'once again faces the prospect of
strangulation'.
This is a term which can trigger air strikes under the existing policy of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
Mr Clinton called for 'a new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its
resolutions', a call which administration officials said reflected
frustration at the unwillingness of UN forces in Bosnia to respond to Serb
aggression.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Rome tax inspectors in corruption inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rome magistrates are investigating for alleged abuse of office the entire
eight-man directorate at the Finance Ministry responsible for tax inspection
and evasion.
The investigation relates to the tax treatment accorded the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group during the transfer in 1989 of chemical assets to
form Enimont, the joint venture with Eni, the state oil concern.
The senior ministry officials are alleged to have ignored potential tax
liabilities totalling some L900bn (Pounds 367m) on the added value of
Montedison's assets in the joint venture.
They are also alleged to have ignored a report from within the Finance
Ministry objecting to such favourable treatment of the group, then run by Mr
Raul Gardini. They have denied the allegations.
This is the most serious investigation affecting any single group of
officials in the past 2 1/2 years of corruption scandals. The special
directorate - headed by Mr Luigi Mazzillo, who has held the post since
February 1990 - includes the directors-general of personnel and of
information technology at the Finance Ministry, as well as three
magistrates, one of whom is seconded from the court of public accounts.
The move by Rome magistrates comes at a time when Mr Giulio Tremonti, the
finance minister, has promised to fight tax evasion. It is unrelated to
another investigation by Milan magistrates into bribes paid to officials of
the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to make favourable tax
assessments of businesses.
Already most of the top politicians and business figures involved in setting
up Enimont, and then the 1990 purchase of Montedison's 40 per cent stake by
Eni for an inflated price, have been charged with corruption.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Longuet hints he may quit Paris government
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Longuet yesterday indicated he would resign as French trade and
industry minister, if an investigation in the next month into the funding of
his holiday villa and of his Republican party resulted in formal charges
against him.
The embattled minister had previously said he would not resign, even if
charged. But he changed his mind after the justice minister decided to ask
the Paris prosecutor's office to widen its 'preliminary investigation' to
the minister's villa.
Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, said he expected the
'preliminary investigation' to be complete by the end of October, and
promised to make its conclusions public. Mr Mehaignerie said he was widening
the scope of the existing low-level inquiry - rather than immediately
putting on the case an independent magistrate empowered to bring charges -
'out of a concern to comprehend, globally and in all serenity, a complex
dossier'.
Mr Longuet has denied the allegation that he let a contractor from his home
region of Lorraine substantially subsidise the building of his St Tropez
villa. But he said yesterday that, once assured of 'an in-depth, balanced
and confidential' examination of the matter, 'I naturally accept the laws of
my country and the rule which the government has set itself.'
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has said that ministers should resign if
charged.
The Paris prosecutor's office is already inquiring into whether Mr Longuet
personally received money in 1989-90 from companies which were also
substantial donors to his Republican party (of which Mr Longuet had also
been the treasurer), and into the extent to which he earned this money by
providing genuine consultancy services.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government and the Treuhand privatisation agency will provide a
capital injection for Deutsche Waggonbau, the east German rail carriage
maker and one of the last big enterprises to be privatised, writes Judy
Dempsey in Berlin.
The subsidies, which will run into 'triple figures', will finance
restructuring and compensate for losses incurred following the virtual
collapse of DWA's markets in Russia, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal
economics minister, said yesterday.
The government's pledge to grant more financial support to DWA, estimated to
total DM390m (Pounds 160m) for this year alone, coincides with the last
weeks of the federal election campaign. The pledge is also another attempt
to make DWA more attractive for private investors.
Before German unification, the giant complex, spread over three east German
states, employed more than 25,000. That figure has since been reduced to
7,000 and more redundancies are forecast if the Treuhand presses ahead with
'strategy DWA 2000', a plan for producing a new generaton of passenger
trains. Job losses will however be resisted by both the state governments
and IG Metall, the engineering trade union.

FT  28 SEP 94 / German Elections, October 16: Ex-communists sure of seats in
Bundestag - East Germany's former rulers expect to win in east Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty years of accepting the ideological certainty of Marxism-Leninism may
be one reason why the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to
east Germany's former communist party, is not plagued by doubt. The PDS is
certain it will enter the Bundestag, or lower house of Germany's federal
parliament, but not through winning 5 per cent of the federal vote, the
minimum required by any party for parliamentary representation.
Instead, it is concentrating all its efforts on winning outright three
constituencies. This would mean the party would automatically qualify for
representation according to whatever proportion of the national vote it won.
If it wins three constituencies, the PDS would then gain about 18 seats in
the Bundestag. It could be in a position to play an important role in
shaping the composition of the next government.
'We are very optimistic about winning three seats in east Berlin. We might
even pick up one in Potsdam and (the island of) Rugen,' says Mr Hanno
Harnisch, the PDS's ebullient spokesman. The lastest Allensbach opinion poll
gives the PDS 4 per cent of the national vote and 19.5 per cent of the east
German vote.
But what makes the PDS so sure of victory in east Berlin? 'We've got a good
membership, the right candidates, and we are helped by a stupid campaign by
the political establishment,' says Mr Harnisch.
There is no disputing the membership. The PDS boasts a membership of 23,000
in east Berlin, compared to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats'
3,000, the Social Democrats' 2,600 and the Free Democrats' mere 1,078. Many
PDS members - over 90 per cent belonged to the former Communist party - are
active at the grassroots level.
'I know these local PDS people,' says 83-year-old Mrs Herta Plache. 'They
visit me and visit the pensioners' club. The other political parties don't
seem to care about our problems. I don't care if the PDS are former
communists.'
The party has also capitalised on the city's unemployment rate, in some
regions as high as 40 per cent. About 80 per cent of scientists no longer
have jobs, either because the jobs no longer exist, or because the
scientists have been sacked for their previous political activities. 'This
last group forms one of the main planks of the party's support,' says Mr
Harnisch.
But the choice of candidates - all known locally - has also played a big
role in boosting the party's chances. Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS's charismatic
anchorman, is standing in Marzahn-Hellersdorf, a sprawling high-rise suburb
in the east of the city, where unemployment is running at 40 per cent. 'I'm
voting for Gysi because I know him. He speaks our language. He stands up to
the Wessis (west Germans), who are always accusing us of being fascists
painted red,' said Ms Birgit Kuhne, a 36-year-old unemployed engineer.
Mr Stefan Heym, whose novels written under the former communist system tried
to expose the regime's corruption of the socialist ideal, is standing in
Berlin Mitte/Prenzlauer Berg, home to east Berlin's intellectuals and youth
culture. The PDS is certain he will win, but the SPD is fielding a strong
candidate - Mr Wolfgang Thierse, a member of the party's executive board.
To counter the PDS's support, some CDU officials fear that voters might
switch from the CDU to the SPD in order to keep out the PDS. But Mr Harnisch
discounts this idea, as indeed do CDU supporters in the capital. 'Can a
voter really swing that much just to keep us out? No]' he says.

<TEXT>
The European market for goods that depend directly on the application of
biotechnology is worth Pounds 30bn a year in sectors ranging from
pharmaceuticals and animal health to chemicals and food, according to a
survey undertaken by Ernst &amp; Young and funded by the biotech industry. It
estimates that 184,000 jobs depend on biotechnology. However, the study
found that companies plan to move future investment away from Europe. The US
is the favoured location for the future, while Japan and other Asian
countries are becoming popular. Companies' reasons for preferring the US
include greater public support for biotech investment, a more predictable
science-based regulatory structure and better access to skilled staff than
in Europe.

Hungary intends to fine Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer and products
group, Ft30m (Pounds 176,300) for what it considers 'misleading advertising'
in a toothpaste TV commercial. The decision follows a complaint by Procter &amp;
Gamble of the US, one of the company's main rivals, to the economic
competition office in Budapest. The office said a commercial by
Colgate-Palmolive which claims calcium helps prevent tooth decay had not
been scientifically proved.

Germany's banks came under fire from the country's main political parties
yesterday, and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) pledged to clip their
wings if it wins the general election on October 16. Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said he took seriously the complaints of small companies that big banks were
too powerful, and his liberal Free Democrat (FDP) coalition partners said
bank representation on company boards should be limited. The comments were
made in written replies to questions submitted by the Federation of Small
and Medium-Sized Businesses, a lobby group representing 29,000 companies.

The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have written to Hungary's new
government to express concern at the country's poor financial and economic
situation, prime minister Gyula Horn told parliament yesterday. They warned
that the state's high deficit could not be sustained and deep structural
changes were needed in public spending, he said. They believed the slowdown
in reform in the past two years had cost Hungary its advantage as pioneer of
market-led reforms in the 1980s. Mr Horn, who heads a Socialist-dominated
cabinet, said the government would draw up a three-year economic programme,
with the help of the two institutions and the European Union, which would be
presented to parliament by April 1995. He promised to accelerate
privatisation and to limit spending. He urged trade unions and employers to
accept pay constraint.

<TEXT>
Italy's populist Northern League has been promised control of the third
channel of the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, in a deal struck
between the main partners in the right-wing coalition government. This
represents a big concession to the League, which has long been campaigning
for greater regionalisation of the RAI and in particular for the right to
run a station out of Milan. The compromise follows a threat by the League to
undo the government's appointments to the board and editorial management of
the RAI. The editorial appointments were announced last week and involve a
complete change in the existing controllers in favour of people considered
sympathetic to the Berlusconi government. However, the League complained the
choice was too narrow.

<TEXT>
The Russian Central Bank spent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in the past two
months on intervention to support the rouble, reducing its foreign exchange
reserves to below Dollars 5bn, a senior bank official said yesterday. 'It's
good for the central bank to raise its currency reserves but it means
pumping roubles into the market, fuelling inflation,' deputy central bank
chairman Alexander Khandruyev told a news conference. 'By cutting our
reserves by Dollars 2.5bn we have introduced a stabilising element into the
economy.' The rouble fell to a record low of 2,476 to the dollar on the
Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange earlier, with the central bank refraining
from intervention. Last week it dropped 5 per cent to the previous record
low of 2,460 as the central bank stayed on the sidelines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen yesterday presented a new three-party minority
coalition government of his own Social Democratic party, the Centre
Democrats and the Radical Liberals to Queen Margrethe following last week's
election to Denmarks' Folketing. The main posts in the new 20-member cabinet
are unchanged, with Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Radical, continuing as foreign
minister, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, SDP, as finance minister, and Mrs Mimi
Jakobsen, Centre Democrat, as minister for industry. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen also
named Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, a Social Democrat and former welfare minister, as
Denmark's next EU commissioner in succession to Mr Henning Christophersen,
who has held the post since 1984.
The government, which controls only 76 of 179 seats in the Folketing, will
depend on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's party and the more
extreme leftist Unity List in a parliamentary crunch. But in a 16-page
policy document the coalition calls for co-operation from both sides of the
Folketing, promising a tough fiscal policy to reduce the budget deficit.
Among the few specific proposals in the policy document, the coalition says
it will require environmental audits from all industrial companies, will
prepare 'green' national accounts, and will give wide powers to co-ordinate
government policy to the Environment Department.

<TEXT>
Producer prices in Sweden rose 0.8 per cent during July, contributing to a
year-on-year rise of 5.2 per cent, reported the Swedish Bureau of
Statistics. Import prices rose 0.9 per cent during the month and were up 5.4
per cent during the past 12 months. The monthly increase of import prices
was bolstered by higher coffee prices, which contributed 0.2 points to the
total rise, and higher prices on paper pulp, said SCB. Export prices,
meanwhile, rose 0.8 per cent in the month and were up 5.0 per cent from 12
months ago. The monthly increase was attributed mainly to paper products,
refined petroleum products and chemical products.
Hungary's central budget deficit for the first eight months of 1994 amounted
to Ft195.22bn (Pounds 1.2bn), or 59.2 per cent of the year's target of
Ft329.561bn, the MTI-Econews agency reported. Consumer prices in the western
German state of Bavaria rose 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-September and
were up 2.9 per cent from a year earlier.

FT  28 SEP 94 / State may aid Credit Lyonnais if first-half Pounds 540m loss
deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the embattled French banking group, yesterday announced a
FFr4.5bn (Pounds 540m) loss for the first half of 1994, and said the state
had agreed to help if its losses worsened further this year.
The bank set aside further provisions against bad debts of FFr10.1bn, which
wiped out its operating profits of FFr5bn. A French state capital injection
of FFr4.9bn this summer brought the bank's ratio of own funds to assets to
8.1 per cent - only a shade above the internationally agreed minimum of 8
per cent.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais chairman, acknowledged he had
overestimated the degree to which the bank could recover from past bad loans
and investments on its own and out of current banking income.
Credit Lyonnais was announcing results unexpectedly delayed from last
Thursday, following emergency consultations between the bank, its auditors
and the government. Mr Peyrelevade denied some suggestions by the government
that the state-controlled bank misled it, saying that 'we told them
(ministers) everything we knew when we knew it'.
He said the bank would try to contain this year's loss to last year's level
of FFr6.9bn, but conceded that even before that level was reached 'we would
need a recapitalisation to avoid our solvency ratio falling below the
minimum'. In addition to the government and other public sector shareholders
in the bank providing the FFr4.9bn capital increase, the government has also
guaranteed FFr40bn worth of its doubtful property loans.
For the first time, Mr Peyrelevade raised the prospect that Credit Lyonnais
might sell some of its international banking network, in addition to the
already announced programme to sell some FFr20bn worth of the group's
industrial and financial holdings. He resisted suggestions that the
government had made bank asset sales a condition of further help, but said
Credit Lyonnais 'might rectify the frontiers' of its banking business by,
for instance, abandoning retail banking in 'some distant countries'.
This month Credit Lyonnais said it would reduce its retail banking operation
in the UK in favour of focusing on corporate banking and market trading.
Some FFr3.4bn of the FFr4.8bn 'exceptional' provisions in the first half
were related to Credit Lyonnais's banking subsidiaries of Altus, an
investment bank whose high-risk operations had turned wrong; SDBO, which is
the main banker to Mr Bernard Tapie; and of CLBN, the Dutch subsidiary whose
loans to the American film business required further provisions.
Mr Peyrelevade described a new and tougher regulatory climate in which the
bank's new auditors insisted that the bank must start taking precautions
against the 'latent risks' inherent in the bank's past activities.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Blair shuns high taxes and backs market economy: Ideological
baggage discarded as Labour stakes out ground for next election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership yesterday cast itself in the role of ally to a vibrant
market economy as it staked out the ground on which it will fight the next
general election.
In a speech designed to mark a break with postwar interventionism and
1970s-style corporatism, Mr Tony Blair said Labour's prescription for
sustained economic growth was neither anti-market nor anti-business.
The last remnants of the party's ideological baggage were discarded as the
opposition leader rejected the 'laisser-faire dogma' of the Conservatives
and Labour's past reliance on demand management in favour of a new
left-of-centre economic agenda.
Mr Blair, speaking at a London conference with Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, dismissed the idea that a future Labour government could solve
the country's economic problems through higher spending and higher taxes.
Instead, its central objective would be to build a new partnership between
the public and private sectors which would reinforce rather than restrict
the role of the market in promoting faster growth with low inflation.
In a co-ordinated operation ahead of next week's Labour party conference -
the first since Mr Blair's election as leader in July - the two men warned
that the party's social ambitions could be met only if it delivered a
successful economy. Economic growth rather than increased public spending
would provide the route to a more cohesive, fairer society.
Their speeches were dismissed by senior Conservatives as a publicity
exercise. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, accused them of
offering 'slogans and buzzwords'.
Mr Blair told the conference of academics and businessmen that a radical
shift in Labour thinking to meet the realities of the 1990s would redefine
the dividing lines between its strategy and that of the Tories.
The central dividing line was not between a rightwing government that
believed in the market and a leftwing opposition that did not. It was
between the right's dogmatic reliance on market forces alone and a left
approach that equipped business to prosper by promoting investment in
education and industry.
On spending, the line was between increased Tory spending on 'unemployment,
welfare and social decay' and Labour's desire to devote resources to
economically and socially productive projects. On taxes, the difference was
not between high and low taxation but between fair and unfair taxes.
Mr Brown, who sketched out a series of initiatives to encourage long-term
investment, underlined the break with the past by setting as the party's
central goal a dynamic market economy with long-term horizons.
He said crude 'free-market dogma' had failed to deliver this because it
provided no incentive for long-term investment.
But Mr Brown added: 'It is equally clear that the old Labour language - tax,
spend and borrow, nationalisation, state planning, isolationism, full-time
jobs for life for men while women stay at home - is equally inappropriate to
the demands of the future as it was to the needs of the past.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Brussels urged to adopt radical farm reform: Controversial
study disputes step-by-step change to Common Agricultural Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will shortly release a controversial report
recommending wholesale reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, including
scrapping farm production quotas and set-aside payments to farmers.
The report's recommendations challenge the view that favours step-by-step
reform of the CAP and are certain to provoke a stormy reaction among the
farm lobby in Europe, particularly in France.
But the authors of the study argue that radical reform of the CAP would
lighten the burden on taxpayers, reduce consumer prices, and ease the
integration of farm-intensive economies of central and eastern Europe into
the European Union.
'The objective should be a level of market protection no higher than that
enjoyed by other sectors in the EU economy,' the report concludes.
The discussion document was drawn up by a group of independent agriculture
experts under contract by the Commission's economic and financial affairs
directorate.
It is one of several internal Commission papers being prepared ahead of the
1996 intergovernmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty.
Its chief recommendations for reform of the CAP - which consumes more than
half of the EU's annual Ecu 70bn (Pounds 65.2bn) budget - are:
EU farm prices should be cut to near world price levels in all sectors. All
remaining import levies and quotas should be transformed into flat-rate
tariffs.
The phasing of farm subsidies into national budgets over 7-10 years. This
would allow member states to decide how to share out the freed-up funds.
Member states liable to suffer heavy penalties through loss of EU financial
support could be compensated through increased contributions from the
regional, social and 'cohesion' funds.
In a foreword to the discussion paper, the Commission makes clear that it
does not support the 'far-reaching' recommendation written by the report's
authors who include a group of agriculture experts headed by Mr Arne Larsen,
chief of staff to Mr Finn Gundelach, a former Danish vice-president of the
European Commission in the 1970s.
'This is a really hot potato,' said a senior Commission official who
referred to a 'very painful debate' before the decision to publish the
report. The consensus had been in favour of publication in the interests of
stimulating discussion and debate, the official explained.
The most recent CAP reform was agreed in 1992 and is still being digested.
By 1997, it aims to virtually eliminate export subsidies which EU producers
use to dump food on world markets, thereby reducing overproduction.
The report repeats the oft-cited criticism of the CAP for being
over-bureaucratic, as well as causing environmental damage and trade
tensions. It claims the proposed changes would allow member states to lower
their EU budget contributions and reduce consumer prices.
They would also increase the EU's 'flexibility towards trading partners and
new entrant states', says the report, referring to pressure to admit Poland,
Hungary, the Czech republic and Slovakia into the Union.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Italian metal group breaks even
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europa Metalli-LMI, the Italian metals group with interests in France, Spain
and Germany, broke even at an operating level in the first half of 1994.
This follows two years of restructuring and heavy losses and provided
further evidence of improved demand for industrial goods.
Europa Metalli, which specialises in the production of semi-finished goods
and copper alloys, yesterday reported a small first-half net consolidated
loss of L6.6bn (Dollars 4.24m) against a loss of L50.3bn in the equivalent
period last year, and L131.6bn in the whole of 1993. The company said the
result had been affected by a poor performance at its Spanish operation,
which was being restructured, and a small loss in defence products. Group
turnover increased 5 per cent to L1,813bn.
Europa Metalli is the main operating component of the group of companies
headed by Mr Luigi Orlando, one of Italy's best-known businessmen. It is
controlled by Societa Metallurgica Italiana, another quoted Italian company,
47 per cent of which is in turn owned by the quoted holding company Generale
Industrie Metallurgiche. The Florence-based company confirmed it was
continuing to study ways of improving the group's structure, and reinforcing
its financial position.
The company added if the economic recovery continued, Europa Metalli would
be able to repeat its small first-half profit on industrial activities in
the full year.
KM-kabelmetal, the company's quoted German subsidiary, made a profit of
DM10.7m (Dollars 6.9m) in the first half, against a loss of DM4.4m in the
equivalent 1993 period.
Trefimetaux, the French operation, also returned to break even, having lost
FFr39.5m (Dollars 7.48m) in the first half of 1993.

<TEXT>
The Economic Co-ordination Committee of the Pakistani cabinet has approved a
plan to import natural gas from Qatar, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
A government statement issued yesterday said the scheme provides for a
Dollars 3.2bn gas pipeline from Qatar to Pakistan.
Pakistani president Farooq Leghari said earlier this month after a visit to
Iran that Tehran had agreed to join the project. The first phase would
comprise a 1,600km pipeline and transmission facilities from a southern gas
field in Qatar to Pakistan.
The pipeline is planned to carry 1.6bn cubic feet of gas per day and later
to be extended to India. The gas pipeline project is being sponsored by
Sharjah-based Crescent Petroleum International, Canada's TransCanada
PipeLines, the leading gas transmission company, and Brown and Root, the US
engineering group.
The pipeline will carry gas offshore from Qatar across the lower Gulf to the
United Arab Emirates' west coast and overland across northern UAE to the
Gulf of Oman.
From there the pipeline will run along the coast of Iran to Pakistan,
terminating near Karachi.
The project will be financed by regional governments and the World Bank.
Earlier this month Iran and Pakistan agreed to build an oil refinery in
Pakistan and to export Iranian natural gas and refined oil products to
Pakistan.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Two groups plan Nigeria divestment: Unilever, UK bank
reshape holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK-Dutch consumer group Unilever and Britain's Standard Chartered Bank
are divesting from their Nigerian affiliates over the next month with two of
the largest ever share issues coming to the country's flagging stock
exchange.
Both companies emphasise their decisions are dictated by worldwide strategy,
not by the recent political instability and economic downturn in Nigeria.
But sales of their assets in UAC Nigeria and First Bank of Nigeria
respectively coincide with low investor confidence in Nigeria's economy.
Both cases underline the problems created by the 40 per cent statutory limit
on foreign shareholdings in manufacturing, energy and banking companies in
Nigeria.
UAC evolved from a pioneer trading company in west Africa into Nigeria's
largest manufacturing and distribution conglomerate, with the 60 per cent
Nigerian-owned shares held by individual and institutional investors.
Unilever will keep its 40 per cent share in UAC's Tractor &amp; Equipment
division (the Caterpillar dealership), which is to be a separate joint
venture, and acquire all the shares in the consumer goods division.
These and the cash from the sale of the rest of its shares will be
re-invested in the newly formed Unilever Nigeria. Unilever's UAC holding was
valued last December at about Dollars 46m at the official exchange rate of
N22 to the dollar. Since then, the naira's parallel market rate has weakened
from around N48 to N75. After tax, profits in 1993 came to N432.3m (Dollars
19.6m), an increase in naira terms from 1992 of 29 per cent, below the rates
of inflation and devaluation. Inflation is running at nearly 70 per cent and
the naira's sharp devaluation has eroded domestic demand and put pressure on
profits.
Standard Chartered agreed yesterday to reduce from 38 to 9.9 per cent its
stake in First Bank of Nigeria, which last year was one of two quoted
companies in Nigeria to make pre-tax profits over N1bn.
The shares will be sold via a public offer beginning next month. Last year's
privatisation of the Nigerian government's majority stake made Standard
Chartered the biggest shareholder, but did not allow it to acquire a
controlling interest. Under UK law this made the group responsible to the
Bank of England for the management of the bank although it lacked a
controlling interest, unless it cut its stake to less than 10 per cent.
The sale of the government's majority holding in Nigeria's other leading
commercial bank, United Bank for Africa, to Nigerian private investors has
made another foreign bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, the largest
shareholder without a controlling stake.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (13): Compromise is
inevitable - The company's moving. . . Michael Cassell discusses factors
which count
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality of life may be close to the top of the list of priorities for
employees, when asked to nominate their ideal business location, but it
barely merits a mention when management draws up its own league table of
location requirements.
The corporate decision on where to make an investment, whether in
manufacturing plant, distribution facilities or headquarters operations,
involves a great deal more than a search for fresh air or an active artistic
community.
The primary factors involving location decisions inevitably centre on
hard-nosed business considerations. Research among US companies, which at
times have to appraise locations within their own, vast domestic marketplace
in much the same way they do those overseas, suggests availability of
skilled labour, 'pro-business' government, low corporate taxes and good
communications are among the most critical issues.
After talking to nearly 130 of America's largest companies, with sales of
over Dollars 800bn and 4m employees, the Bureau of Business Research at the
American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts, concluded:
'Rational, rather than emotional factors carry most weight.'
All of which may seem rather obvious. But the commercial facts of life
dictate that, whatever the list of ideals, the 'perfect' commercial location
hardly ever exists; the final decision involves reconciling a long list of
requirements in which compromise plays a big part.
Other issues taken into account by companies of all nationalities include:
proximity to markets and suppliers, efficient infrastructure, personal
income taxes, a flexible regulatory environment and relaxed employment laws.
But with the volume of greenfield development activity declining, given the
finite number of new operations required by international companies, the
plethora of development agencies now spread across the EU is changing
strategy.
Following widespread criticism from companies that they were wined and dined
and then left to their own devices once their investment had been made, more
attention is being paid to after-care help, to help ensure that new
businesses successfully integrate into the community.
The availability of incentives, though rarely among the most important
factors, can still prove decisive if competing locations are, in most other
respects, broadly comparable. But there is some concern that the intense
competition to win investors is pushing EU rules and regulations to the
limits and possibly beyond.
Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location International, the
Brussels-Based consultancy, alleges that the rules governing the
disbursement of aid designed to encourage new investment are being
increasingly abused. 'The danger is that companies who take advantage of
what should not be on offer could end up having to pay back the very funds
which were decisive in reaching their decision.'
Mr Nick Cowley, of Cowley Research and Publications, harbours doubts about
the use of subsidies to influence location. 'The Commission's strategy of
persuading people with the use of public money to locate to the fringes does
not provide long-term solutions. If you continue to subsidise, you do not
overcome the problems but disguise them and fail to address the real
structural issues.'
However, the majority of companies starting up new operations around Europe
do so without the aid of locally provided incentives. Headquarters location
decisions, while possibly influenced by the availability of generous
personal tax regimes, are based primarily on a logistical assessment of the
subsidiaries to be served and by ease of communications.
Inevitably, many companies reach the same location decisions. The result is
that more than 330 of Europe's 500 largest companies have headquarters in
just 10 cities.
Belgium and Holland continue to attract a significant share of European
headquarters operations, given that both offer special tax deals for
expatriates and a business community well used to conversing in English.
London also remains a preferred location, accounting for 108 of the
headquarters operated by the top 500 European companies. According to
independent research conducted by the Harris Research Centre, the UK capital
is still the most favoured business location of all within Europe; fears
that well-publicised terrorist attacks in the Square Mile might have led to
an evacuation of companies, or at least prevented new ones from arriving,
does not appear to have been borne out by events.
A Harris survey involving more than 500 companies, based in nine EU
countries, put London top in eight out of 11 key categories when measured
against 29 other European cities.
London's attractions include the English language, value for money in office
space, cost and availability of staff and access to markers. The completion
of the Channel tunnel is being seen as another valuable asset which London
can exploit to further advance its claims to good communications.
The UK capital's competitiveness has arguably been further boosted by
provisions in the 1993 Finance Act, which introduced a privileged tax regime
for international headquarters, enabling them to pay dividends on income
received from abroad without liability for advance corporation tax.
The Harris Research survey carried some warnings, however. It suggested
that, while London is expected to retain its position as the most important
financial centre in Europe over the next five years, it is being challenged
more strongly by Frankfurt.
Mr David Rees, head of Ernst &amp; Young's location and advisory service,
believes that Britain's political relationship with its EU partners has not
helped the UK's proven ability to attract headquarters operations:
'There is a perception of the UK which is not always helpful in portraying
it as the most suitable location from which to control European operations.
We sometimes appear too Anglo-Saxon and not European enough.'
In a trend widely expected to accelerate over the medium term, the survey
also identified former eastern European centres such as Prague, Budapest and
Warsaw as centres enjoying increasing levels of inward corporate
representation. It also cited those three cities, together with Moscow and
Berlin, as the centres earmarked for the most vigorous expansion over the
next five years.
According to Mr Rees: 'Some of the former eastern bloc countries still
involve significant risks, but they also offer worthwhile cost advantages
and the opportunity for investment strategically placed in an increasingly
central, rather than peripheral, location.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (15): Retrieving past
glories - City profile: Prague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many towns like to promote themselves as lying at the heart - or, even
better, at the crossroads - of Europe. But Prague, the restored and
liberated capital of a Czech republic more or less co-terminous with the
territories of ancient Bohemia, really does deserve that description.
Prague is at the very centre of Mitteleuropa. It lies 200 kilometres west of
Vienna, half-way between the Baltic and the Adriatic seas; or between the
Atlantic and Russia on the east-west projection, which for so long has been
dominant in its fate.
Now that the cold war is over, however, Prague's greatest advantage is that
it is the beautiful capital of a politically stable country full of
hardworking, educated and skilled people able to produce high-quality items
at wage rates roughly 10 per cent of those ruling in neighbouring Germany
and Austria.
As such, it is the natural location for the local head offices of foreign
companies that are busy setting up manufacturing operations in the republic;
and also for the armies of accountants, consultants and professional
advisers, who flocked to help get the pioneering mass privatisation
programme off the ground and to re-train Czechs in the lost arts of
accounting and business administration.
In the interwar period, Czechoslovakia was the most economically successful
and politically stable of the successor states which emerged from the
disintegration of the the old Hapsburg empire. Technically, Czech industry,
situated mainly in Bohemia and Moravia and what used to be upper Silesia,
was on a par with that of Germany. Incomes and the general cultural level
were claimed to be higher than in Switzerland.
The Nazi invasion and disintegration of Czechoslovakia in 1938, accompanied
by the extermination of Czech and Slovak Jewry, dealt a cruel blow, both
economically and culturally. Further harsh blows were to fall in 1948, with
the communist Prague coup masterminded by Stalin and the subsequent
re-invasion by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact forces to crush the Prague
Spring 20 years later.
Miraculously, however, the gorgeous historic city of renaissance, baroque
and liberty-style architectural splendour from the early 20th century
survived these hammer blows virtually unscathed, at least to the casual eye.
A closer look reveals that, for over 50 years, when property stolen from its
legal owners was attributed to the state or local authorities, most of
historic Prague hardly received a coat of paint. Maintenance was minimal. In
far too many cases it amounted to patching up holes in roofs or building
makeshift protection against falling masonry.
Since the collapse of communism, however, the situation has been
transformed. The skyline is pierced by cranes, and the streets reverberate
to the sound of saws and hammers. After initial lengthy delays, caused by
the difficulty of establishing legal claims and restituting properties to
their rightful owners, long-neglected buildings are being gutted and
modernised inside and repainted externally.
Many fine old palaces are being converted to offices; and once-grand
buildings, which were turned into squalid communal flats by the communists,
with several families sharing rudimentary cooking and sanitary facilities,
are being restored to the former grandeur. They are being sold to property
developers or let by their restored owners to the local new rich or
foreigners, often with the ground floors converted into shops, banks or
restaurants.
The grand old hotels on or around Wenceslaw Square and along the Voltava
river are also being refurbished, and a slew of shiny new hotels, such as
the Atrium and the Diplomat, have sprung up to help cope with a flood of
tourists. The main problem to date has been a truly terrible telephone
service, but heavy investment is under way to ease the frustration of
blocked lines and broken connections.
Given the attractions of the old city and the high cost of refurbishing,
rental values initially soared. But James Woolf, of Flow East, one of the
most active private property developers, says that the sharply rising supply
of refurbished flats and offices has seen prices and rents stabilise over
the past two years.
With foreign capital now flowing into the Czech republic on an ever
increasing scale and domestic entrepreneurs busy building up their private
companies, the city is well on its way to recovering its past glory.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (14): When it's all
in the mind - The company's moving. . . David Lawson seeks to define 'the
quality of life'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One Monday morning, a US manager arrived back from holiday to a memo from
the chief executive telling him to find a European outlet. 'He had heard
that a competitor was opening a plant in Spain, and felt we ought to get
inside the Single Market boundaries, too.'
No problem, he thought. Another memo to the research department, and within
a week the manager had a neat table of local salaries, rents and transport
costs. He picked out two or three similarly attractive locations for the
board, 'just so they could feel they were making the decision.'
Northern Spain, southern Italy and Bulgaria went into the meeting. 'They all
had the cheapest all-round costs. I figured we would cover expenses within
two years,' says the manager. The board chose France.
In retrospect, the manager saw his mistake. Financial factors may come first
in location choices; but other, often more tenuous, matters run a very close
second - and sometimes elbow their way to the top. They package together as
'quality of life'. But what is 'quality', and how is it measured?
'It is different things to different people,' says Jean Crawford, who
handles international moves for UK consultant Jones Lang Wootton. A Japanese
company, for instance, would be looking for a clean, modern environment -
with the obligatory nearby golf courses. A British or US business is more
likely to want places with some character and history - plus nearby soccer
or softball pitches.
Both demand good housing and schools providing the international
baccalaureate so their children will not miss out. Other factors also go
into the pot, such as low crime rates, good parking and access to
countryside.
The US company in the above example is strongly involved in electronics and
research. It needed to take key staff across the Atlantic and attract others
from around Europe. Unlike the manager, who is a lawyer, founder members on
the board had spent time working abroad and knew technical staff would not
go to northern Spain, let alone Bulgaria.
No financial incentives would make up for another element. They chose a
'technopole', one of the high-tech growth centres in the south of France,
because staff would feel comfortable mixing with the people from similar
backgrounds, says the manager - now an ex-manager, which is why he prefers
to remain anonymous.
These centres of technical excellence are among the most successful magnets
for international business in Europe, according to Ms Crawford. 'They have
produced the right environment, the right mix of people and, of course, they
have the right climate.'
Quality of life is not always crucial to attract investment. The surge into
eastern European centres, for instance, would never take place if factors
like housing and entertainment took precedence. Here, the drive for new
markets takes precedence.
But where places offer relatively similar incentives, such as tax-breaks and
staff availability, the tenuous attractions of quality of life can make all
the difference.
One problem is that no one has come up with a definitive measure to which
centres, and investors, can refer. Professor Richard Estes, of the
University of Pennsylvania, has tried his best, having spent 20 years
assessing the relative merits of different countries. Danish newspapers
recently jumped for joy when he reported that the Scandinavian country had
held on to top place, while US journals were glum about its position towards
the bottom of countries in the developed world.
But Prof Estes feeds in factors such as the status of women and human rights
to produce his Index of Social Progress. And these factors are unlikely to
interest high-paid executives and their families.
A plethora of indices is available in the UK, but each has a slightly
different message. Reward Group simply assesses each region's cost of
living. Strathclyde University goes to the opposite extreme, feeding in
nearly 50 factors for grading centres on whether they are good places to
live. These range from health services to pollution levels, which naturally
puts areas like Scotland, Wales and south-west England top of the UK list.
Chris Boulton, of property consultants Hillier Parker, agrees that these
will be high among the priorities for more than 1,000 US companies that
expect to move to the UK in the coming year. Perhaps it is no coincidence
that Bristol, the main business centre of south-west England, also emerged
as the most desirable UK city in a poll of more than 500 British companies
by Black Horse Relocation. The study also found that quality of life was the
most important personal factor in choosing a location, gaining more than
half the votes, and compared with only 30 for cost of living.
Similar conclusions could be applied right across Europe, but Michael Kaltz,
a partner in management consultants Ernst &amp; Young, warns that preferences do
not always match actions. 'It depends on who is making the decisions,' he
says. Senior executives may not be moving to the new centre, so quality of
life may not play as big a part as finance.
They may also pick out the wrong 'attractions'. When Ms Crawford analysed
the wishes of staff in one organisation, the vast majority of those under 25
asked for access to cinemas and clubs. Senior staff had opted for the
theatre and opera.
In this maze of often contradictory factors, a few common consistencies
emerge. 'The average executive will look first to their creature comforts,'
says Anita Saunders, who has handled hundreds of international moves for
Hamptons Relocation. 'They want good housing, good schools, their
own-language TV and newspapers, good local restaurants and shopping, and an
area where they can mix with people of their own kind.' That does not mean
the same nationality, but people of similar interests and background.
Amsterdam and Utrecht seem to meet many of these demands. Madrid, the
Algarve and Paris are also high on the list. Frankfurt and Brussels 'lack
soul', while London is considered expensive and congested, she says. East
European centres are chosen because executives have to go there for new
business. Quality of life hardly comes into the equation.
Holland also comes high on Ms Crawford's list, particularly for the
Japanese, as they can do business in English without paying high British
property costs.
But at the end of the day, investors and executives have to make a trade-off
between financial factors, lifestyle and personal preferences, says Mr
Kaltz. 'Most European capitals will offer an acceptable quality of life.
Selection will often boil down to personal preferences, and no index will be
able to determine those.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (12): Move sooner
rather than later for the best deals - Property / The effects of recovery
</HEADLINE>

Companies planning to open a head office or relocate in Europe will be able
to drive a much harder bargain than this time last year. The cost of
occupying prime office space in most city centres has continued to fall, and
the European rentals index compiled by Jones Lang Wootton fell by 5 per cent
in the year to the end of June.
Indeed, since the peak in 1991 the index has now fallen by 23 per cent. The
excesses of the late 1980s have been paid for in full, so that, in real
terms, European rental costs are now back to the levels of 1987.
But the overall figures hide a wide range of performances. Rents in
Barcelona have fallen by more than 20 per cent over the past year, and in
Brussels by 16 per cent. Yet prime London office rents were stable during
that period.
This partly reflects the fact that national economies were at different
stages of the cycle. But office markets which were most overheated during
the boom years have inevitably suffered most in the downturn. Rents in
Barcelona rose six-fold between 1983 and the end of 1990, vastly outpacing
the European average, but have almost halved since then. In contrast, office
rents in Amsterdam rose much more slowly through the 1980s, and have barely
changed during recession.
Yet the latest survey evidence suggests that prime office rents have now
stabilised in most European markets as recovery has started to take hold.
Although agents do not rule out further slippage in the second half of this
year, if the pace of economic recovery disappoints, companies looking to
relocate will probably get the best deals by moving sooner rather than
later.
Despite the ravages of recession, JLW's survey of occupancy costs - which
includes net rents, service charges and local taxation - showed that London
is still Europe's most expensive office location, only a shade behind Hong
Kong and Tokyo in the world pecking order. The fashionable 8th arondisement
of Paris is not far behind, even though overall Paris rents have fallen by
12 per cent in the past year.
Perhaps surprisingly, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague are also among the most
costly tier of European office locations: at Dollars 1,000 per square meter,
the cost of prime office space in the Russian capital is not much less than
in London. Strong demand from tenants and a shortage of quality office space
is the underlying reason for soaring occupancy costs.
It remains to be seen what effect big new developments will have on rents in
such emerging office markets. For example, Warsaw's 20,000 square meter
Atrium Business Centre is now under construction, with the first phase
scheduled for completion early next year. While at least one substantial
pre-letting has already been agreed, the full development will greatly
increase the city's stock of office space.
The pace of development in established European business centres is much
slower. With little new supply coming on to the market, the office vacancy
rate in central London has fallen from 14.8 per cent to 11 per cent in the
past 12 months, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Against that background,
rents for new or well refurbished offices are already showing signs of life.
Although London is ahead of continental European cities, a similar story of
falling vacancy rates and at least stable rents is likely to emerge
elsewhere over the next year.
Still, prime office rents give a distorted view of occupancy costs.
Companies looking for industrial, as well as office, space will find some of
Europe's biggest industrial cities offer surprisingly good deals. The
average cost of industrial space in Antwerp, Rotterdam, Barcelona or Milan
is considerably less than Dollars 100 per square meter - against Dollars 219
in Paris and Dollars 169 in London.
But even property specialists concede that cost and the availability of
suitable office space are not at the top of the list of priorities when
companies are choosing a business location. A survey of 500 European
companies by Healey &amp; Baker found factors such as transport links,
telecommunications and the cost and availability of staff were given a
higher priority. Such formal surveys also miss the intangible reasons that
lie behind relocation decisions: all property agents tell tales of business
locations chosen for the proximity of a golf course.
Thus while London and Paris are among the mostly expensive cities, they also
rank among the most highly regarded in terms of transport links (although
Frankfurt came top of the list in this regard) and telecommunications - and
probably hotels and shopping, had the respondents had been asked. That helps
to explain why the companies questioned still viewed London as offering the
the best value for money, despite its high costs.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (11): Japan and US
turn away from Europe - Inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the British goverment heard last week that NEC, the large Japanese chip
maker, would build a Pounds 530m advanced semi-conductor plant in Scotland,
it had reason to feel some autumn cheer.
For after months of fierce lobbying from US and British authorities, the
news that NEC had chosen Scotland as a site provided a powerful boost to
Britain's attempts to maintain its position in the global investment game.
But as the industry digests the implications of NEC's decision, the real
question absorbing the authorities is: how many other Japanese companies can
still be persuaded to choose Europe as an investment location? For, though
recent economic indicators suggest that global investment is now starting to
pick up again, fears are growing among European governments that the wave of
foreign direct investment (FDI) that occured in the European Community
during the late 1980s may now be drying up.
The chief concerns centre on the US and Japan - hitherto the largest outside
participants in the European investment game. Between 1986 and 1991, for
example, US investment represented 25 per cent of FDI into the EU, according
to recent European Commission research. Japan was the next largest outside
investor, accounting for 13 per cent of FDI.
The lion's share of these inflows was directed at the UK - between 1986 and
1991, Britain attracted 45 per cent of total FDI in the EU, or about two
thirds of total US investment and over half of the total Japanese
investment. The resulting 68 'greenfield' US manufacturing plants and 59
Japanese plants established in this period not only created some 18,500 jobs
but turned Japanese companies into household names in parts of the UK.
France was the next biggest player, accounting for 13 per cent of total FDI
and attracting the, second largest slice of US investment. Meanwhile,
Germany, which otherwise attracted only a relatively small share of the
total FDI, was the second most favoured site for Japanese investors,
attracting 24 new manufacturing plants, primarily in the Nordrhein-Westfalen
region.
But after accelerating in the late 1980s, the investment flow appears to
have slowed in recent years. One reason has been the depth of the Japanese
recession - a recent United Nations report, for example, indicated that
outflows from Japan shrank to Dollars 12bn last year, down from Dollars 48bn
in 1990.
But another factor fuelling European fears is that the global priorities of
the Japanese and US may now be shifting. The recent North American Free
Trade agreement has left Mexico increasingly attractive as a production site
for North American firms. New opportunities in China are also encouraging
Japanese companies to switch their investment attentions there and to other
part of Asia - a recent survey by the Export-Import department in the Bank
of Japan, for example, suggested that China was now regarded as the most
favoured investment target by Japanese companies, followed by Indonesia and
the US. Ireland ranked fourth in the survey, while Germany and the UK ranked
seventh and ninth respectively.
The opening up of the eastern European countries has created potential rival
production locations that are close to west European markets at a fraction
of the labour costs.
Optimists point out that the recent drop in Japanese investment is
inevitable, since much of the 1980s boom was generated by a need to 'catch
up' in European markets. And indeed recent evidence suggests that Japanese
and US companies still have little intention of abandoning Europe, not least
because the advantages of retaining a production foothold in the single
market.
Although recent European-wide figures remain elusive, because countries have
been measuring FDI differently, the number of new FDI projects in the UK,
for example, rose to a record level of 400 last year, after falling from 350
in 1990 to around 300 in 1993, according to the department and trade
industry. Within this overall picture, Japanese investment accounted for 30
projects last year, compared with 37 in 1990. But US projects rose to 187,
well up from their levels earlier in the decade.
Nevertheless, Invest in Britain Bureau, the main UK government's main inward
investment promotion agency, suggests that, irrespective of the numbers, the
pattern of investment is likely to change. With most of the big US companies
already established in the UK, the next wave of US investment is likely to
involve smaller projects, while Japanese investors are expected to move
towards supplier and sub-contractor activities - or even joint ventures.
'There has been a change in the nature of projects. More and more projects
are now expansions of existing investment rather than new investment coming
in,' says the IBB.
Meanwhile, new players have also been emerging, particularly from far
eastern countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Korea. Regions like Northern
Ireland have been a particularly favoured target for these flows. Two Korean
companies - Carmen and Daesung - for example, have also recently announced
they are to invest in the province. Texmaco, an Indonesian-based man-made
fabrics specialist, has also announced it is to set up a plant. Meanwhile,
Hualon, a Taiwanese company recently won permission to build a new Pounds
160m textile plant outside Belfast, helped by British government aid.
Elsewhere, Sammi, a wholly owned subsidiary of Korean audio speaker
manufacturer Sammi Sound Technology Corporation, recently announced that it
was setting up a new factory in Cumbria, joining three other Korean firms -
Samsung, Goldstar and Inkel - who have also settled in North-east England.
The DTI itself points out that the overall impact of this new far eastern
investment is still small, in comparison with the big players like the US.
But the signs are that other European governments are already scrabbling for
a piece of the cake. The Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, for example,
recently indicated that it is stepping up its marketing efforts and
represention in Hong Kong and China in an effort to catch this potential new
wave.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (10): A strong stayer - Profile: Sir
Aneerood Jugnauth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Aneerood Jugnauth can boast one of the most remarkable records of any
leader of a multi-party democracy.
Prime minister since 1982, he has fought and won no less than four
elections. By 1996 he must face the voters again, and conventional wisdom in
the island is sceptical about his chances.
History, however, suggests that the 64-year-old Crown Counsel - he was
called to the bar in 1954, after reading law at Lincoln's Inn - should not
be underestimated.
'Some analysts and political commentators have already sounded the death
knell of the Jugnauth government and predict that the prime minister will
have to call an early election.' That assessment could well have been
written today; it was inm fact, written in 1989. Sir Aneerood confounded the
experts and critics, and won the 1991 poll.
Aloof on public platforms, he can be a different personality when on the
stump: but persuasive and articulate as he talks to the grass roots voters,
and as shrewd a political leader as Mauritius has known.
After a spell in the civil service and serving as a distrcit magistrate, Sir
Aneerood (he was knighted in 1988) was first elected an MP in 1963, and took
part in the constitional talks in London in 1965 that led to independence.
His first ministerial job was the development portfolio, and in 1971 he
joined the Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMN). Elected as an MMM legislative
assembly member in 1976, he led the party to an overwhelming victory in the
1982 elections.
After a split in the party he formed the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien,
which he leads to this day. In his early years as leader Sir Aneerood, a
member of the island's majority Hindu community, was in the shadow of the
country's first prime minister, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. But he
established himself as a formidable leader in his own right after successive
general election victories in 1983, 1987 and September 1991.
As the driving force behind the Mauritian economic success story, the
transformation of the island's economy will be his enduring legacy,
irrespective of the outcome of the next poll.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (11): Business guide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin beaches embraced by coral reefs, translucent sea lagoons, tumbling
streams, twisting rivers ..' All true - but the eloquent prose of the
Mauritius Tourist Office omits one new feature of life on the island:
traffic jams.
It is part of the price of success. Per capita incomes have nearly doubled
over the past decade, but so have the number of cars. Motorbikes have
trebled over the same period - and so have road accidents.
Elsewhere in the world, an extra 10 or 15 minutes on what used to be a
half-hour journey might hardly be worth comment. In Mauritius, however,
sitting trapped in a car on the outskirts of Port Louis on a hot day is
especially frustrating for, likely as not, you are within sight of some of
the world's most alluring beaches.
Stress can be relieved, however, in two ways.
Don't drive yourself. The island bus service is efficient, frequent and
cheap. Once in Port Louis, most offices are within easy walking distance.
Alternatively take a taxi - MRs200 from Grand Baie, where many of the hotels
are located. The day rate is about MRs1,200, but if staying longer, Avis
offers a competitive weekly rate for car and driver, with unlimited mileage.
Hire a mobile phone from Emtel (tel: 4545400), and put the time spent in the
traffic to good use. If you have to make international calls, you will cover
the cost by avoiding the exorbitant mark-ups on calls made from your hotel.
There is no congenial hotel in Port Louis. The business visitor wanting to
combine access to the capital with a room on the beach has a range of
excellent hotels to choose from, among them the Trou aux Biche Hotel (tel:
2616562, fax: 2616611), a 30-minute drive to the north.
On the other side of the island, but not much further, is Le Touessrok (tel:
419 2431, fax: 4192025), a luxurious hotel in a spectacular setting, with
prices to match. Most hotels, however, offer a business rate, but it can
still be expensive. The alternative, whether you are on business or holiday,
is to rent a serviced, attractive beach bungalows through Leisure Promotion
(tel: 2627971, fax: 2628812).
If the visit still seems pricey, save money by buying your next suit in
Mauritius. Vickash Gunness, director of New Bombay outfitters in Rose Hill
(tel: 4640948, fax: 4640948) will measure you for a tailor-made suit,
delivered in 72 hours, cut from a range of high quality cloth, and costing
under half what one would pay in Europe.
The airport at Plaisance, on the south-east of the island, is 50km from Port
Louis. The journey to Grande Baie, the main tourist centre, takes about an
hour. Taxi fare is about MRs600.
La Bonne Marmite (tel: 2122403), a restaurant in the city centre, has a
delicious palm heart salad. In the evening, sit on the balcony of Le
Pescatore next to Trou au Biche (tel: 2616337). It looks out on an idyllic
cove, as picturesque a setting as any restaurant could wish for, and offers
some of the best food in Mauritius.
If the traffic jams prove too much, escape to Rodrigues, the island
dependency caught in a time warp that predates mass tourism and stay at the
Cotton Bay Hotel (tel: 095-831 3000, fax: 831 3003), where you step out of
your room on to the beach. Daily flights leave at 0930, return 1315.
Although English is the official language of Mauritius, French is more
widely spoken, but the islanders are fluent in both, as well as Creole.
There is no malaria on the island, visas are not required for European Union
passport holders, and credit cards are widely accepted. Business cards are
de rigeur.
An investment conference on Mauritius, arranged by the London Chamber of
Commerce and Media, is due to take place on November 23 in London.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (9): Mainstay of growth - The island's
attractions make tourism a potential economic powerhouse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'Tiger in paradise,' proclaims a slogan promoting the international image of
Mauritius.
It is intended to bring to mind the group of newly industrialised countries
led by the Asian 'tigers' which Mauritius wishes to emulate, while evoking
the island's balmy climate and glorious beaches.
But the would-be Indian ocean tiger may be taking a breather, preparing for
what the government hopes will be its next leap forward; in the meantime,
paradise is expected to bring in even more visitors.
The record suggests that this can be done, and the potential is there. The
island's spectacular beaches and marine life, and its friendly people, are a
highly marketable combination. Mauritius also offers a sense of security and
peace of mind rarely found in any large holiday destination - violent crime
is rare and visitors go unmolested.
Nevertheless, some long running issues and concerns will have to be
addressed. If the current rate of increase in visitors - nearly 10 per cent
a year - is to be sustained, Mauritius may have to reconsider its ban on
direct charter flights, while protecting its reputation as an up-market
destination.
The island will also have to fend off competition from a post-apartheid
South Africa, raise the standards of a number of hotels whose services and
facilities do not justify their high prices, and encourage visitors to spend
more during their stay. Most important is to ensure that growth is not at
the expense of the environment, where the record has so far been mixed.
It is a tall order. But most analysts agree that if the remarkable economic
growth Mauritius has enjoyed for more than a decade is to continue, much of
the impetus may have to come from tourism.
The textile industry, backbone of the export processing zone (EPZ) that
accounted for the economy's dramatic take-off in the early 1980s, faces its
most testing time since its inception. Local labour costs have escalated and
international competition in the new GATT era is getting tougher.
Although diversification within the EPZ is under way, it is proving a slow
process, as is the development of financial services and offshore banking.
With the sugar sector expected to do little more than hold its own, tourism
will have to carry much of the burden for keeping up the 5-6 per cent annual
GDP growth to which Mauritians have become accustomed.
Tourism has already played a crucial part in the island's success, expanding
at a rate few thought possible. From 124,000 tourists in 1983, the numbers
have climbed to 335,000 in 1992, rising to 375,000 last year. With the tally
for the first quarter of this year at 101,000, the year end target of
400,000 is within reach.
Foreign exchange earnings in 1993 reached MRs5,300m - exceeded only by
textile exports and sugar receipts - while providing direct employment to
more than 11,000 people, and thousands more indirectly.
The high growth of recent years (nearly 11 per cent in 1993, 10 per cent in
1992) can be maintained, say hoteliers, without adding to the island's 85
hotels - at least in the short term. Occupancy rate in the larger hotels was
68.5 per cent last year, and 60 per cent in the smaller establishments.
There is also room for growth in the traditional markets. Last year France
and the island of Reunion each accounted for 23 per cent, Germany 10 per
cent, the United Kingdom 8 per cent and South Africa 11 per cent - while
officials single out India as a barely tapped target.
The island's national carrier, Air Mauritius, is also better equipped to
cope. Sir Harry Tirvengadum, its chairman and managing director, has been
raising the quality of the airline, which in May this year became the first
southern hemisphere airline to operate the new Airbus A340-400, with
individual video entertainment systems available throughout the whole cabin,
and telephones on board.
But if tourism is to play a greater part than its already significant role,
the overall standard of hotels will have to be raised.
The top of the range resorts - such as Le Touessrok recently remodelled at a
cost of MRs480m La Pirogue and Le Saint Gerain - can compete with the best
in the world.
The trio are owned by Sun Resorts Ltd, a public company, listed on the
Mauritian stock exchange, in which two of the major shareholders are Sol
Kersner's Sun International and the Mauritian conglomerate, Ireland Blyth
Ltd (now renamed as IBL), each with about 24 per cent.
With the international management and marketing expertise to draw on, and
locations second to none, these Mauritian hotels can claim to be among the
best resorts in the world. But many of the hotels on the island fall short
of the standards their image and room rates require, whether the food, the
furnishings or the amenities - other than the main attraction, the sea.
This issue becomes more pressing given the challenge to Mauritius posed by
South Africa. It offers game parks as well as beaches, hotels as good but
cheaper, and above all, lower air fares thanks to competition on a popular
route.
Although a charter route to Mauritius continues to operate through the back
door - via Reunion, the French dependency a hop away - the government seems
set to continue the policy which bans direct services which would cut fares
and bring the island within reach of more tourists.
Meanwhile efforts to encourage tourists to spend more on the island are
paying off, boutiques offering EPZ clothing and knitwear, as well as duty
free shopping facilities.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (10): A lift from the
Games - City profile: Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dividends from the huge investment made by Barcelona, Spain's second
largest city, to stage the 1992 summer Olympic games would appear to be
paying off.
After interviewing more than 500 senior executives of companies in nine
European countries for its 1994 survey of Europe's top cities, the UK estate
agents Healey and Baker moved Barcelona (population 1.6m) up from 10th place
last year to seventh, in its chart of the bestcities city to locate a
business today.
Barcelona scored particularly highly in the chart measuring the growth of
business over the next five years; the city already ranks fifth - behind
Paris, London, Brussels and Milan - among the centres where the companies
surveyed already have established facilities; and, among the first five, it
was top scorer, along with Brussels, in the projection of increased
representation by 1999.
The Olympics gave the city an image - Mr Lluis Bassat, a leading Barcelona
advertising executive, has valued the television coverage of the games
inauguration ceremony at Dollars 3bn - and it led to a vastly improved
infrastructure. Traffic congestion in what is a compact city boxed in
between mountains and the Mediterranean has, for example, been lightened by
more than 15 per cent, thanks to a four-lane 40km ring road that was built
for the games.
The expansion of Barcelona's airport, which was tripled in size as part of
the Olympics investment, is a yardstick for the city's confidence in its
growth potential. The airport can now handle 16m passengers a year, over
four times the population of metropolitan Barcelona and double the number of
visitors that currently fly into the city.
An airport of such a size will obviously be required if Barcelona achieves
its ambition to become a 'Mediterranean Rotterdam'. Professor Joaquin Muns,
of Barcelona University's economics faculty, is one of several city growth
strategists who argue that Barcelona is destined to become the most
important communications centre in southern Europe.
'We are talking about the motorways we have, the port we are building up and
the high-speed railway that we have been promised. The sum is a practical
and efficient intermodal nucleus, a sort of Rotterdam.'
The ease of access to markets is the most important single factor when
choosing a business location - 71 per cent of the companies surveyed by
Healey and Baker rated it 'absolutely essential' - and Barcelona has a lot
to show off in this respect.
The city is, above all, the axis of Spain's two high-growth areas; for it is
linked by motorways to Zaragoza on the Ebro valley, which meanders across
northern Spain to the Mediterranean, and to the region centred on Valencia,
Spain's third city, on the Mediterranean itself. It is no accident that two
of Spain's sturdiest export-driven companies, General Motors and Ford, are
located near Zaragoza and Valencia respectively.
But Barcelona also projects itself as the main freight distribution centre
for a southern European arc, with a 50m population that stretches from
northern Italy, through southern France to north-east Spain. This arc is
locally known as the 'Mediterranean banana', in imitation of the so-called
'hot banana', the central European business-intensive arc that extends south
from the London-Paris-Amsterdam triangle along the Rhur valley to Milan.
Marine cargo activity and facilities at Barcelona's port have already
outstripped those of Marseilles and Genoa. The number of containers passing
through the port has increased more than threefold since the 1980s, to
nearly 500,000 teu (20-foot equivalent units), and a new container terminal
will raise the harbour's handling capacity to 700,000 teu a year.
Railway connections, which include a high-speed link to Madrid and to the
European network, planned for completion by 2004, play a key part in the
intermodal distribution model. Barcelona's city hall forecasts that the
current 2.8m tonnes of railway freight traffic will rise to 4m tonnes by
2010. The city planners believe that maritime cargoes between the Pacific
Rim and Europe will save up to four days by unloading at Barcelona instead
of Rotterdam.
With such business prospects, two elements about Barcelona add up to a lot
of icing on an already rich cake. With its Mediterranean life-style, its
inner-city architectural beauty and its easy access to beaches and to ski
resorts, the city provides quality of life by the shovelful.
It also happens to cheap at present. Mr Russel Jewel, of Healey and Baker's
Barcelona office, says that prime location rents currently stand at Pta2,500
(Dollars 19) per square metre a month, down from Pta5,500 in 1991.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (9): Much rhetoric,
no consensus - Working conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe has a long way to go before it achieves free movement of workers
across national borders, let alone a flexible and deregulated labour market
stretching from Ireland to the Urals.
Inside the expanding European Union, enormous disparities persist in
employment cost levels, worker skills and employee flexibility, both between
and within member states.
There has been a good deal of rhetoric about the emergence of a single
European social market model, especially since the passage of the 'social
protocol' into the EU's Maastricht treaty in December 1991.
A flood of EU social affairs directives, covering working time, equal pay
and job opportunities, collective redundancies, health and safety at work,
business transfers and transnational works councils, might suggest that
Brussels wants to establish at least a minimalist framework of basic social
rights to complement the new single market.
But as Mark Hall, at Warwick University's industrial relations research
unit, argues: 'There is a general lack of consensus among key parties about
the extent to which community-wide labour standards are necessary in a
single market, or in the context of economic and monetary union.'
Certainly, European employers and a number of member state governments will
resist any over-centralising tendency that seeks to undermine their
competitiveness and add to their cost burdens through highly detailed and
uniform social regulations.
EU social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn was well aware of the important
national diversity of labour markets in Europe during his tour of member
state capitals earlier this year. He reported: 'The urgent need for
collective reflection and co-ordinated action across the whole range of
policies affecting the broad employment environment has not yet been
realised. A fragmentary approach is still noticeable. Old and complex
national regulations still remain in force in many member states.'
But across Europe, there is widespread anxiety among the policymakers about
the impact of global competition on the continent's labour market
regulations and welfare states. High unemployment - with 17m jobless, or 11
per cent of the labour force in the EU alone - has has focused attention on
whether the current balance between labour-market flexibility and solidarity
can continue.
In its jobs study published earlier this year, the OECD argued that the EU
was suffering from 'poorly functioning labour markets', mainly because its
unemployment had ratched up over successive business cycles, resulting in
rising long-term unemployment. 'Inflows into unemployment have been
relatively low, but outflows have been even lower,' it argued.
The EU's own recently published annual employment survey criticised what it
sees as 'insufficient flexibility of labour markets' in western Europe,
which has 'slowed down the structural change in economic activity necessary
to maintain competitiveness.'
As a result, there has been an increasing social divergence inside labour
markets, between those with skills who are able to enjoy job prospects and
those without. The economic integration of the EU has been paralleled with
'limited progress in convergence of living standards and job opportunities
between people living in different regions of the union.'
The most up to date comparative labour statistics - published in the EU
employment survey - underline that observation. It shows:
A wide variation of four-to-one in wage rates, from an average of Ecu2,750
(Dollars 3,355) in Germany and Ecu2,500 in Belgium to under Ecu1,000 in
Greece and less than Ecu600 in Portugal.
Non-wage labour costs differ widely across western Europe. In 1991, for a
male manufacturing worker paid an average wage, they amounted to nearly 30
per cent in France, Italy and Belgium; under 20 per cent in Ireland and
Luxembourg; under 15 per cent in the UK; and under 5 per cent in Denmark.
The 22 per cent average non-wage labour cost rate for the whole of the EU
was slightly higher than in the US.
Social contributions and income tax paid in the EU by a male manual
manufacturing worker amounted to 45 per cent of his labour costs in 1991. He
received 55 per cent less than what it cost his company to employ him. But
the so-called 'wedge' was over 50 per cent in Germany, Holland and Belgium,
and not far below that in France and Denmark, compared with only 35 per cent
in the UK.
In nine EU countries, government-imposed non-wage labour costs are heavier
proportionately on workers at the lower end of the earnings scale than on
those at the higher end. The exceptions to this are the UK, Belgium and
Portugal.
One in six of those in work inside the EU had not been in their present job
a year earlier. The figure was highest in Spain, Denmark and the UK, and
lowest in France and Italy. Labour turnover was highest in Spain, where one
in five of those employed in a particular sector between 1986 and 1992 had
not worked there the previous year - compared with only one in 15 in
Germany.
Only 1 per cent of the EU's gross domestic product is concentrated on active
labour-market measures to get the jobless back into employment. It was under
0.5 per cent in the UK, but 1.8 per cent in Denmark.
There are vast differences in the EU's employment structure. In Germany, for
example, 50 per cent more of the workforce is employed in engineering and
motor vehicles than elsewhere. People with jobs in the social services make
up nearly 8 per cent of total employment in Denmark and Holland, but only 1
per cent in Spain and Greece.
The emergence of more flexible eastern European labour markets, after nearly
half a century of state control, has heightened the differences as
private-sector employers unilaterally set pay levels, pay structures and
employment conditions.
'This largely represents the unwinding of several decades of distortions and
misallocation of human capital and talents,'Professor Michael Burda, from
Berlin's Humboldt University, told an International Labour Organisation
conference in London. It seems likely to make a profound, if uneven, impact
on the rest of the European labour market.
But the diversity of employment conditions and social regulation across
Europe may have little significant impact on competitive costs. As the EU's
Employment in Europe report pointed out: 'It is exchange-rate movements,
rather than differentials in productivity or wage rises, which have been the
major determinant of the cost competitiveness of European producers,
relative to those in the rest of the world, as well as between producers in
different European countries.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (8): Inward
investment the main objective - Trevor Nuttall examines the grants structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR NUTTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grants and financial incentives have been part of the regional policy
armoury for several decades in western Europe, with two main objectives
usually being pursued:
To increase the growth (and improve efficiency) of the indigenous sector of
the economy; and
To attract inward investment, either from other neighbouring European
countries, or more likely from the big international investors, particularly
the US and Japan.
Other secondary objectives have also often existed, such as stimulating new
technology or encouraging decentralisation. The latter used to be important
in Britain, and is still very much the case in France.
The attraction of inward investment has, however, become the main purpose
for offering incentives in most countries, and there is no doubt that
internationally mobile firms are influenced by the amount of grant and/or
tax incentive available; though other factors, such as transport and
telecommunications, manpower and accommodation costs, and the social
environment, are all important influences, too.
While the policy of national governments has traditionally been the biggest
single influence, the European Commission has begun to play an increasingly
important role in recent years, and all the signs are that this influence
will continue to grow.
Its aim has been to try to impose consistent ground-rules throughout the
European Union, leading to greater emphasis on aid ceilings, eligibility
conditions and 'transparency' (including hidden grants).
In addition, financial and other constraints in most countries during the
last few years have led to a gradual downward pressure on the level of
grants. In the process of trying to reduce overall expenditure, EU member
states, encouraged by the commission, have become more selective and have
increasingly targeted financial assistance to encourage job-creation,
high-technology projects, exports, and sometimes the growth of small and
medium-sized enterprises.
In general, there has been increased emphasis on grants as opposed to
loan-related subsidies and fiscal concessions. A good example of this is the
recent change in the Italian regional policy package, a central feature of
which is grant support, as opposed to the previous package of tax
concessions, subsidised loans and social security concessions.
Central and regional governments, as part of a move towards greater
selectivity, are also favouring specific projects or locations, while still
operating within the broad policy framework.
In the UK, for example, there has been a gradual decline in the amount of
grant expenditure during the last decade. While this fall was briefly halted
in 1986 (partly because of an economic upturn, and partly because of
transitional grant arrangements), expenditure in 1990 was approximately half
the level at the start of the eighties.
This has been achieved partially by a reduction in the population coverage
of assisted areas (mainly in 1993), but also by a more stringent application
of the rules.
Other countries have reacted differently to budgetary constraints. In
France, for example, support has been focused increasingly on larger inward
investment projects, while in the Netherlands there has been some
restriction in spatial coverage, coupled with much more restrictive
eligibility criteria.
Other factors also have a bearing on the attractiveness to overseas
investors of the incentives (which are often paid out at lower rates than
the maximum levels available). In many countries, the approval of
applications is a long, drawn-out process which can discourage investors. In
others, there are only limited funds available, whereas in the UK the
regional grants scheme is demand-led.
The peak of activity in international relocations was reached in the 1970s
and 1980s, when the EC and other international trading groups, such as Nafta
and the Pacific Rim, became more important as sources for projects -
especially during the lead up in the late 1980s to the Single European
market (which was seen as possibly leading to increased restrictions on
imports).
While there were some very high-profile greenfield investments during this
period, ongoing investment by existing overseas companies remained the
largest element of foreign direct investment (FDI)
Significantly, big American and Japanese corporations decided (reluctantly
in the case of many Japanese companies) that it was more important to be
inside the EC than to try and sell to the Community from their domestic
locations. Many US multinationals had established plants in Europe
(particularly the UK) long before the 1970s, but decisions were made to
expand them in many cases or to invest overseas for the first time.
The UK, despite being only in the middle of the European grants league
table, has traditionally been by far the most successful country after the
US in attracting inward investment.
In total, FDI in the UK was approximately Pounds 9.2bn in 1992, an Pounds
800m increase on the previous year, but a much lower level than 1989 and
1990. The UK still attracts about one third of all incoming EU investment.
Intra-country movements during the next few years are likely to be
influenced by the same factors, except that the growing importance of the EU
single market, coupled with the improvements in infrastructure (particularly
transport) is likely to lead to centrifugal pull towards the
London-Paris-Berlin axis. There is already some evidence of the
centralisation process, and unless the EU takes strong remedial action, it
will probably accelerate.
This golden triangle (sometimes referred to as the 'hot banana', stretching
from south-east England through Benelux and Germany into Italy), which
covers only 5 per cent of the EC's land mass but approximately 25 per cent
of purchasing power, contrasts starkly with the peripheral areas of PortugaL
Spain, southern Italy, Greece, Ireland, Scotland, which have 45 per cent of
land area and only 15 per cent of purchasing power.
This does not mean that the peripheral areas in the UK and elsewhere are
doomed to permanent unemployment and decline. For them to share in the
prosperity of the golden triangle, however, measures will have to be taken
both to attract new investment, and to encourage local investment.

Leeds.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (6): Broad centre will stay in charge -
A look at whether the ruling party can defend its position once again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any prime minister who has presided over an sustained economic boom should
be riding high, confident of the outcome of the next election.
But Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, prime minister of Mauritius since 1982, is widely
seen on the island as battling for his political life. His ruling alliance
has been weakened by defections and disputes, the most notable of which took
place in February this year, when Sir Aneerood sacked Madun Dulloo, his
long-time confidant and agriculture minister.
'Sir Aneerood deserves a place in the Guinness Book of Records,' chuckles
Paul Berenger, his former party colleague and erstwhile alliance partner,
since turned political adversary. 'He is the only prime minister whose
popularity has fallen as the economy has grown.'
Mr Berenger may warrant an entry of his own, given his political record
which has included associations with no fewer than three other party
leaders.
It should be said that Sir Aneerood, as wily and resilient a politician as
the island has known, has had his back to the wall before - in 1991, plagued
then as now by scandals involving patronage, drugs and corruption.
The alliance that rescued him included Mr Berenger, who 'performed the
political equivalent of entering a revolving door ahead of Sir Aneerood and
coming out behind him', notes one Mauritian politician caustically.
Can Sir Aneerood do it again?
For all the considerable achievements - average annual GDP growth of 5-6 per
cent, the doubling of per capita incomes over the past decade, near-full
employment - the ruling alliance of Sir Aneerood's MSM and Dr Prem
Nababsingh's faction of the MMM is in serious trouble, challenged by Dr
Navin Ramgoolam's Labour Party and Mr Berenger's wing of the MMM.
Not the least of the prime minister's problems is resentment at a
personality cult that is inappropriate to a democracy.
Sir Aneerood's portrait has supplanted that of the island's head of state,
President Cassam Uteem, and is prominently displayed in most of the
country's public buildings and government offices.
His image appears on the island's gold coins, and on the 500 rupee note,
while that of his wife adorns the 20 rupee note.
No-one, however, underestimates the resilience of Sir Aneerood, who would
not otherwise have survived 12 years in office.
As one political observer, who concedes much of the criticism that is
frequently expressed, warns: 'It is too soon to write him off.'
The origins of the governing coalition go back to the 1970s when Mr
Jugnauth, as he then was, and Mr Berenger formed the MMM, with a trade union
base and a radical platform.
In the June 1982 election an MMM-led alliance with the Parti Socialiste
Mauricien captured all 60 island seats (Rodrigues has two, and up to eight
best losers are appointed) and swept to victory over the Labour party, led
by the late Sir Seewoosagar Ramgoolam, prime minister since independence in
1968.
It proceeded to lay the foundations of the island's economic success. Mr
Jugnauth and Mr Berenger, then finance minister, launched a reform programme
which has been at the heart of government policy to this day.
The relationship between the two went sour. Mr Berenger resigned in March
1983, taking with him the claim to the MMM, while Mr Jugnauth launched a new
party, the MSM.
A month later it amalgamated with the PSM, which was renamed the Mouvement
Socialiste Mauricien.
In the general election of August that year, Sir Aneerood's considerable
political talents helped create a broader alliance, defeating the MMM
opposition coalition, subsequently led by Dr Prem Nababsingh, who had been
chosen with an eye to the Hindu factor in Mauritian politics.
Hindu Indo-Mauritians constitute about 52 per cent of the island's 1.1m
population, while Muslim Indo-Mauritians make up about 17 per cent.
In 1991 Sir Aneerood was burdened by much the same issues as threaten him
today - low standing, scandal and drugs in particular.
However he emerged like a Mauritian Houdini at the head of an alliance
between the MSM and the MMM which captured 57 of the 62 elective seats at
the September election. Mr Berenger became the foreign minister in the new
government.
Once again, Sir Aneerood and Mr Berenger fell out.
Mr Berenger was sacked last August. In April, Mr Berenger's faction of the
MMM and Dr Navin Ramgoolam's Labour Party, formed an electoral pact.
Dr Ramgoolam would be the prime minister, with Mr Berenger his deputy. Of
the 62 seats that are directly elected, 35 would be allocated to candidates
from the LP and the remainder to the MMM-B, while the cabinet would give the
LP 12 portfolios and nine to Mr Berenger
On the face of it, this seems a winning combination, but Sir Aneerood's hand
has not lost its cunning.
According to Mauritian insiders, the prime minister has proposed an
electoral pact with Dr Ramgoolam, in which Sir Aneerood would remain in
office for the next two or three years, and would then stand down in favour
of Dr Ramgoolam.
Although the MSM-MMM-N commands a working majority in the assembly, many
observers believe that its days are numbered. In a country where political
allegiances shift and new coalitions form, the further defection of a
handful of deputies, once they see Sir Aneerood as a loser, would be enough
to force a general election.
However, it is clear that the dominant theme of the election campaign will
be a call for clean government. Mr Berenger also raises the need for tougher
measures to protect the environment and more emphasis on skills training,
but he stresses that he would not change the basic strategy.
In sum, the frequently changing coalitions and alliances provide a safety
valve, enabling politicians to let off political steam, but the broad centre
will win the next election, whoever leads the victorious party.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (7): Tax breaks aid the Freeport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mauritius Freeport, the island's international trade depot, is to raise its
capacity after a first year of operation in which demand for warehouse space
far exceeded supply. The government has signed a contract with the French
construction company Bollore to increase the 7,500 square metres of
warehouse space at the Port Louis site by 100,000 square metres.
In its first year the depot, which offers substantial tax breaks for firms
trading there, registered 180 companies and a turnover of MRs200m mainly in
the re-export of chemicals, fertilisers, plastic goods and textiles to
Africa. Activities are now diversifying.
Rajakrishna Chellapermal, marketing manager for the Mauritius Freeport
Authority, says French companies plan to assemble vehicle spare parts and
environmental equipment. Australian companies are importing computer
components from the Far East for re - export to Australia.
The Freeport is linked to the emerging offshore banking sector. Its
activities do not come under customs control. Raw materials, equipment and
other inputs are exempt from duty. Companies pay no corporate tax,
withholding tax on dividends or stamp duties on transaction documents.
Through Mauritius' membership of the African Preferential Trade Area,
exports to 18 countries enjoy lower tariffs if 45 per cent of the value
added originates in Mauritius. 'Goods don't physically need to come here,'
Mr Chellapermal says. 'They can be merely invoiced in Mauritius to take
advantage of the fiscal breaks.'
Shortage of warehousing means less than a quarter of companies are fully
operational in the Freeport, which urgently needs to develop specialised
facilities such as cold rooms.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (8): Barons braced for rationalisation -
The sugar industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to one third of Mauritian sugar factories are expected to close in a
series of measures aimed at making the industry more competitive.
Plans to diversify the country's agriculture have been devised after cuts in
agricultural subsidies were agreed during the Uruguay round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mauritian sugar barons have agreed five or six of the existing 18 sugar
factories should shut, and production rationalised into bigger, more
efficient mills, if the industry is to maintain profitability.
In a bid to avoid political resistance to mill closures, the sugar barons
are offering to set up an investment fund to allow planters and workers -
who form a powerful lobby - to acquire a 20 per cent equity stake in sugar
factories. It is the first time employees have been offered a shareholding.
The government believes it is doing its part in keeping the industry
competitive: investing in irrigation, landscaping the island's volcanic
terrain and abolishing the 4 per cent export duty on sugar.
In return, Kailash Ruhee, agriculture minister, expects sugar barons to
modernise production and move into food crops for local consumption. At
present, more than 90 per cent of the island's arable land is devoted to
sugar cane.
Since the mid-1980s the industry has been squeezed by rising production
costs and a fall in the guaranteed price paid by the European Union, which
buys more than three - quarters of the island's production.
A small, but rich Franco-Mauritian elite controls the industry, but 35,000
'petit planteurs' form a powerful and vocal constituency, as do the 40,000
sugar workers in the mills and larger plantations. Although the island's
sugar quota of 506,900 tonnes a year will not be affected by the GATT
accord, the intervention price the EU is prepared to pay is expected to
fall.
Patrick D'Arifat, director of Mauritius' Sugar Producers Association, says
mill closures will not take place immediately. The capacity of the remaining
mills will first have to be enlarged; new buyers must be found for the sugar
cane planters; and transport must be arranged to take the cane to more
distant factories.
Mr Ruhee, a former head of the department of crop production at the
University of Mauritius, says: 'There is potential to transform sugar cane
into a feed stock.' As an example of an alternative market, he says a South
African firm is planning to produce citric acid from sugar cane.
The government is also encouraging producers to diversify into 'special
sugars' - muscovado, demerara, golden granulated and organically grown sugar
 -for which there is a small but lucrative market.
'Mauritius supplies 80 per cent of the world market for special sugars,'
says G. Rajpati of the state-run Sugar Authority. With proper promotion, he
believes global demand for these products could grow.
He does not expect a dramatic fall in the EU intervention price - it would
be an unpopular move with sugar beet producers in Europe - but he admits
Mauritius is not in a strong bargaining position. Without the Sugar Protocol
between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in 1975, the
Mauritian sugar industry would have long ceased to exist.
Mr D'Arifat said: 'We could not possibly compete with large producers like
Thailand or Australia. We are limited by our scarcity of land and labour.
The government, for its part, is lobbying the EU for a share of its sugar
refiners' deficit, estimated at 300,000 tonnes a year. Mr Ruhee recently
returned from Europe, where he met nine of the EU's 12 agriculture
ministers.
'If we were allowed to supply 80,000 tonnes of the Euro - refiners' deficit,
we would be totally insulated from the world market,' Mr Ruhee says.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (6): Flag-carriers in
a flutter - Competition among airlines is likely to intensify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even during the last four years of recession, European business travel has
continued to grow at an appreciable rate.
A recent study by British Airways, covering all European airlines, shows
that the number of passengers travelling by air for business reasons in
Europe rose by 15.5 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and is expected to
continue growing by 4.4 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in 1996.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the Geneva-based
organisation grouping more than 200 airlines, also expects to see overall
European air passenger numbers increase from 394m this year to 653m by the
turn of the century, and as many as 1bn by 2010.
This growth in European air travel demand, which is likely to be further
stimulated by the emergence of the new markets of eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, is expected to intensify competition in the European
airline market, with airlines already having to adapt to growing
liberalisation and new competing modes of transport, including high-speed
trains and the Channel Tunnel.
Liberalisation is gradually changing the structure of the European airline
industry. Under the European Union's three-stage liberal policy, European
governments are being forced to abandon the era of heavy regulation, which
protected national flag-carriers from the rigours of free-market
competition, and has kept many air fares, especially for business
travellers, artificially high.
The process of liberalisation has been slow and controversial. Under the
EU's third package of liberalisation measures, EU-registered airlines were
finally given last year much greater access to the overall European market
and greater pricing freedom.
In theory, the process of deregulation will be completed in April 1997, when
all EU airlines will be able to fly wherever they choose within the single
European market. In practice, it is unlikely that full European 'open skies'
will lead to a rush of new airline start-ups, the opening of new routes and
services and fierce price competition, which has been one of the
characteristics of airline deregulation in the US, the world's biggest
aviation market, during the past decade.
Many governments continue to be reluctant to give up sovereignty over their
airspace. The French government, for example, fought hard this year to try
to block the opening of Paris Orly airport to UK competition, to protect its
financially troubled flag-carrier, Air France.
The European Commission has also come under pressure from several
governments to approve large financial support packages and subsidies to
help their national carriers restructure themselves and prepare for the new
deregulated European airline market. Privatised airlines like British
Airways, and other carriers in the process of being privatised like
Lufthansa, have attacked these latest subsidies as threatening to distort
competition in the new liberalised market.
In July alone, the EC approved state aid totalling Dollars 7.1bn to three
airlines, including Air France, Olympic Airways of Greece and TAP of
Portugal. Since August 1991, the industry calculates that the Commission has
approved state aids to European airlines totalling Dollars 10.35bn.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, recently said Europe was
creating a two-class airline industry. The first involved airlines which had
to solve their problems on their own; the other included airlines which
continued to defy the laws of economics and were being protected by their
governments to the detriment of other airlines.
But despite continued obstacles in the way towards full 'open skies' in
Europe, liberalisation has started to bear fruits for the European consumer
and the business air traveller.
On busy routes now served by more than two airlines, like London-Paris or
London-Brussels, fares have fallen and service standards improved. Smaller
regional carriers have emerged and opened new services between regional
centres. The big carriers have also intensified their efforts to strengthen
their European networks and sought partnerships with smaller carriers,
either by investing in equity stakes or forging commercial and franchising
agreements with these airlines, to feed traffic into their increasingly
global operations.
BA, for example, has developed a string of partnerships with smaller
European carriers, including taking stakes in TAT in France and Deutsche BA
in Germany. Many flag-carriers are also setting up lower-cost subsidiaries
to serve domestic markets, to provide lower-cost air travel, reflecting
growing competition in their home markets as liberalisation starts to gather
momentum.
But the expected growth in air travel in a more competitive and liberalised
European airline market risks being seriously undermined unless governments
step up their efforts to address the urgent issue of congestion at a number
of big European airports, as well improving European air-traffic control.
The rising tide of airline traffic is bound to put even greater pressure on
Europe's existing air-traffic control system as well as its airports
infrastructure.
The introduction of a new generation of larger aircraft, being developed by
Boeing and Airbus, may help to ease the growing strains on Europe's air
transport infrastructure; but much more will have to be done to avoid a
repeat of the crisis that occurred a few summers ago, when Europe's air and
ground infrastructure simply could not cope with the volume of traffic.
Since that crisis, European governments have started to address the problem
of congestion by attempting to harmonise and modernise Europe's diverse
air-traffic control systems, and encourage more airport development and
expansion.
But Iata has already warned that additional efforts will be needed in
air-traffic control and airport facilities to cope with the expected growth
in European air travel. Unless there is a common political will to undertake
these big investments, the benefits of 'open skies' will be quickly eroded,
and Europe could face, in the not too distant future, chaos in its skies.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (5): Missed
connections - Communications / Charles Batchelor pinpoints the flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look at a map of Europe, and you will see that motorways or roads of near
motorway standard will carry you from Aberdeen in the north of Scotland to
Brindisi in southern Italy.
Purchase a European railway timetable, and you will discover trains which,
with the appropriate connections, will take you from Stockholm to Lisbon.
Massive motorway building programmes and, more recently, initiatives to
modernise the railway network, have transformed travel and multiplied the
options open to the manager seeking to locate a factory, an office or a
warehouse in Europe.
But for all the progress that has been made, the idea that Europe possesses
a transport network comparable with, for example, the US freeway system, is
an illusion. Road and rail links have been designed largely with national
needs in mind, and rarely with the aim of achieving rational cross-border
connections.
Rail planners must contend with different track and loading gauges (the
latter determines the height and width of bridges and tunnels) and with
incompatible power and signalling systems. The Eurostar trains which will
run through the Channel tunnel have been designed to draw power from three
different electricity systems and to respond to four different signallings
systems.
Even the airline network, designed primarily for the purpose of
international travel rather than journeys within national borders, reveals a
worrying fragmentation. The continent's 42 air traffic control centres
reflect cumbersome national considerations, and are ill-suited to meet the
needs of the airlines and their customers.
Concern that rising travel demands will lead to an increase in congestion
and damage to the environment has led the European Commission to devise an
integrated transport system, including road, rail, air and inland and
coastal shipping.
The commission is working on a Ecu220bn (Dollars 268bn) programme to create
a series of trans-European networks over the next 15 years. Even governments
traditionally hostile to the idea of integrated transport planning have been
persuaded to join in. The spur is the prospect of community funds to finance
domestic investment, although it is by no means clear how these ambitious
plans are to be paid for.
The aim is tie the countries on the edge of Europe, such as Portugal and
Greece, where transport networks are not highly developed, more closely to
the centre. At the same time the commission wants to reduce congestion on
busy routes in the heart of Europe, such as the Rhine-Rhone corridor and air
traffic paths over north-west Europe.
A third goal is to reduce the relative dependence on roads for the bulk of
passenger and freight transport. The building of fast, convenient motorway
links has led to a decline in the use of other networks, most notably rail.
Passenger travel has increased by 85 per cent over the past 20 years, mostly
in the shape of private car journeys, which account for 79 per cent of all
travel. Freight shipments, meanwhile, have increased by half, and road
transport accounts for 70 per cent of goods transported.
The trans-European network programme envisages spending 30 per cent of
available funds on roads, 60 per cent on rail and 5 per cent on canals and
ports. This contrasts with present spending by national governments, of
which 66 per cent goes on roads and 23 per cent on rail. A further 6 per
cent goes on airports, with 5 per cent reserved for canals and ports.
The main elements of the commission's programme are:
A rail network of 70,000 kilometres, including 23,000km of extensions and
new lines for high-speed trains and a similar length devoted to freight and
intermodal transport (waggons and trailers which can be carried both by road
and rail).
A road network of 58,000km, including 15,000 km of new or improved roads.
Roads would have to be of a minimum twin two-lane standard, but would not
have to be motorways.
Improvements to freight terminals and agreement on a uniform loading gauge
for intermodal rail shipments.
Plugging gaps in the international canal network and improving seaports to
encourage waterborne traffic.
Airport improvements and the upgrading of links between airports and the
road and rail systems. The creation of an integrated air traffic management
system.
The commission hopes that, by identifying these key networks, it will
encourage governments to target their national budgets to making
improvements and filling gaps. But it also intends to put community funds
towards this programme and attract investment from the European Investment
Bank and the private sector.
The trans-European networks programme has been drawn up with the aim
primarily of improving connections within the 12 members states of the
European Union, but links with eastern Europe have grown in significance
with the collapse of communism and the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Many of the transport links in eastern Europe were in a state of chronic
disrepair before the strengthening of economic ties with the west. As
traffic grows they threaten to clog up completely.
Several projects are currently being planned with the help of funds from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A new motorway is to be
built linking Budapest in Hungary with Vienna, Austria and Bratislava in the
Slovak Republic.
Much effort is being put into upgrading road and rail links between Berlin,
Warsaw, Minsk and Moscow. However, in Poland, Belarus and Russia further
work needs to be done on creating a legal framework which will allow the
participation of private investors. These could be repaid by being awarded
concessions to collect tolls.
Good transport links are an important consideration for managers deciding to
locate or relocate a business activity. If the commission's plans are
carried out, they should make such decisions easier.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (7): Innovation
UK-style - Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For companies with heavy telecommunications requirements, the UK is the most
attractive of the larger EU states, in terms of the price of links and the
competition between operators.
For all organisations, large and small, the UK's telecoms networks are
generally considered a match for anywhere except the US. Even then, all
depends on requirements: leased lines are notably cheaper in the US, but
price differentials in other services are not wide, and in some services are
cheaper in the UK. The range of services on offer is larger in parts of the
US, but the UK is becoming a centre of innovation in its own right.
Companies have three main concerns about their phone systems. They want a
rapid installation service. They want cheap calls. And they want a high
level of network reliability.
British Telecommunications, the former state-owned monopoly, scores highly
on all three. According to surveys by the Telecommunications Users
Association, its network reliability is found to be high, and its service
record is almost as good.
Some companies report problems with rapidly changing BT account managers,
caused by the massive redundancy programme carried out by BT over the past
four years. Redundancies are continuing, and this may continue to be a
problem. But BT is more customer-responsive that the traditional national
monopoly phone company, and on measures such as reliability and speed of
response to complaints it has improved dramatically.
Part of the reason for the rapid improvement is the fact that BT now faces
fierce competition in the UK telecoms market. Mercury, a subsidiary of the
Cable &amp; Wireless group, was licensed as a national competitor to BT shortly
before BT's privatisation in 1984. In 1991 the BT/Mercury duopoly was
abolished, and upwards of 100 operators are now offering services, most of
them to the business sector.
Large companies in the City of London get the best deal, with a remarkable
concentration of operators competing hard for their traffic. About
two-thirds of the City's outgoing traffic now goes via Mercury. Two new US
operators, MFS and Colt, are constructing their own fibre-optic networks in
the City: most of the City can now choose between four operators all
providing direct telecoms links.
In addition, a number of other operators lease lines from the larger
operators and re-sell them to customers at a discount. They mostly
concentrate on international calls, but some offer long-distance UK
services. The largest is Worldcom, a US operator which offers City customers
about 10 per cent off Mercury's best business price and now claims to have
about 3 per cent of the UK's outgoing international traffic.
'Mercury is our main target, not BT,' says Mr David Hardwick, Worldcom's
managing director. That is true of most City telecoms operators, who are
thriving on the readiness of companies who have moved once from BT to move
again to other carriers. Many City institutions now have three, four, even
five telecoms providers.
Beyond the City, choice is more limited, but is growing fast. Mercury offers
a business service in all main UK centres. Local cable companies are
installing combined television and telephone networks across Britain's urban
areas, and offer competitive packages for businesses. And other operators,
such as local electricity companies, are building regional networks targeted
at business users.
It therefore pays to shop around. But many companies are wary of severing
their BT connections entirely, because of fears for the resilience of their
telecoms links without a direct BT link. The inability to transfer phone
numbers between operators is also a problem, although it is set to become
less serious under new rules, which will make it easier for users to take
their numbers with them when they move. Several niche operators are also
starting to offer 'personal numbers' for a fee, which will be particularly
attractive to small companies that expect to be on the move and want a
guaranteed number.
Mobile communications is an important requirement for much of the business
sector, and the UK scores highly in that sphere too. Although Scandinavia
has far more cellular users as a proportion of the population, the UK
cellular phone market is more competitive than any other in Europe, with two
national networks and a further two launched in the past year offering
regional coverage.
The two largest operators, Vodafone and Cellnet, have recently launched
digital GSM networks, which allow users to use their phone to make and
receive calls across most of western Europe.
Serious price competition is entering the mobile market for the first time,
which will be of particular benefit to businesses wishing to equip large
numbers of their employees with mobile phones. Orange and Mercury One-2-One,
the two new operators, have tariff packages priced well below those of their
larger rivals, although they lack national coverage. In particular, they are
far cheaper for incoming calls to mobile phones - an issue of concern to
companies issuing mobiles to employees so that they can keep in touch with
the office.
Mobile communications are still not cheap, however. Vodafone, the largest
operator, netted upwards of Pounds 700 in the year to June from the typical
subscriber on its business tariff, and more than Pounds 900 per customer on
its GSM Europe-wide tariff.
Lower fixed charges are available to users on low-usage or limited coverage
schemes - but they also face far higher call tariffs, rising in some cases
to 50p a minute. Companies need to make a realistic estimate of their mobile
requirements, and go through them with a dealer willing to sell services
from across the four cellular networks.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (5): Enter the foreign investor - The
rise of the stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By any reckoning, the Mauritius Stock Exchange has outperformed the most
optimistic expectations of its founders. In just five years, it has come
from nowhere to be ranked number three in Sub-Saharan Africa, after
Johannesburg and Harare, with a market capitalisation at the end of August
of MRs26.9bn.
The number of official market listings has increased from five, when the
Stock Exchange of Mauritius (SEM) was launched as a private limited company
in July 1989, to 31 today. The share price index (Semdex), reached a high of
462 at the end of August, up nearly 70 per cent since mid-1993.
This performance is all the more remarkable given the virtual exclusion of
foreign investors from the market. Unlike most emerging markets, the SEM has
been driven by domestic investors, primarily institutions.
In his 1994 budget, Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, opened the
door to foreign participation, which is likely to be limited to 24 per cent
ownership of any listed company, with no single foreign investor allowed to
hold more than 5 per cent of the equity in a listed Mauritian company.
Foreign participation could push the market much higher, partly reflecting
fund manager perceptions that the Mauritian price-earnings ratio, averaging
15 (excluding investment holding companies), is below the emerging market
average, but also as good quality shares are hard to find. Four companies
dominate market capitalisation. Conglomerate Rogers and Co, capitalised at
MRs4.1bn and the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MRs4.05bn), make up 30 per cent
of the market.
If Sun Resorts, the hotel group ranked number three with MRs3bn and Ireland
Blyth, a major shareholder in Sun (MRs2.3bn) are included, the four giants
account for half the market. The market desperately needs more paper.
Two major new listings are in the pipeline; commercial conglomerate Happy
World, possibly one of the island's best-run companies, and Air Mauritius,
the flagship of the government's privatisation programme. Air Mauritius will
issue MRs500m of new shares, which may well catch the imagination of foreign
buyers, given the booming tourism sector and the backing from British
Airways in the form of its 12 per cent stake in the national carrier.
Other privatisation issues in the pipeline include State Bank, the State
Investment Corporation, Sitcom, and Mauritius Telecom, implying new issues
of up to MRs2bn.
The SEM operates two markets - the official market where the 31 listed
companies are traded and an over-the-counter market which deals in unlisted
companies. The OTC market, which came on stream in April 1990, now comprises
some 71 companies, many of which are likely to move upmarket to 'official'
status over the next few years.
Listing requirements include an 'adequate' trading record, with published
accounts for three years before listing; an expected market capitalisation
of MRs20m and the issue of at least 25 per cent of the shares to the public,
though this threshold may be phased in, with companies issuing 15 per cent
of their shares initially, increasing this proportion to 20 per cent within
three years and 25 per cent by the end of five years.
As part of its policy of encouraging firms to go public, the government has
cut the rate of corporate tax on listed companies from the standard 35 per
cent to 24.5 per cent. There are matching incentives for investors.
Dividends paid by listed companies are not taxable in the hands of Mauritian
shareholders, while 30 per cent of the cash invested in new share issues is
tax-deductible over three years up to a maximum of MRs75,000.
Capital gains are treated generously, too, and the first MRs250,000 received
from the sale of listed securities is tax-free. In the light of such
incentives it is hardly surprising that both companies and investors should
have responded enthusiastically.
After a slow start in 1991-92 when only MRs108m was raised in new and rights
issues, the market took off, raising MRs1.7bn in cash calls in 1992-93 and
MRs141m in the year to June 1994.
Much now depends on how foreign investors respond. If emerging market
experience elsewhere in Africa is any guide, when foreigners take the
plunge, they will zero in on blue chip stocks, whose price-earnings
multiples are already looking high enough (Sun Resorts with 25 and Rogers
with 23), exacerbating the already-severe shortage of good quality scrip.
New issues, especially the large privatisation offers, will relieve some
buying pressure, but the signs are that the market will continue to advance,
albeit less spectacularly than in the past year.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (4): Predictions confounded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 30 years ago, the eminent Cambridge economist Professor James
Meade, led an official inquiry into the Mauritian economy.
He concluded, gloomily, that unless effective birth control measures were
introduced 'fairly promptly', the island faced 'ultimate catastrophe'.
The Meade report was based on data which suggested that the population,
estimated at 600,000 in 1960, was growing at 3 per cent annually and would
top the 3m mark by the turn of the century.
In the event, the rate of population increase since 1970 has been less than
1 per cent a year, and the economy which Professor Meade then described as
'a case study in Malthusian economics', has been increasingly constrained,
not by the excessive growth in the population that he had expected, but by
an acute shortage of labour.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (3): S Africa may emerge as rival - A
new offshore business sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abolition of exchange controls and the deregulation of the foreign exchange
and money markets in the 1994 budget are crucial steps forward in the
country's efforts to establish a strong offshore business sector.
Most of the island's exchange controls were dismantled during the 1980s, but
it was only in this year's budget that Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance
minister, sealed the process by lifting the remaining 5 per cent capital
transfer tax and removing the final obstacle to full exchange rate
convertibility.
At the same time, he announced that the Bank of Mauritius would become a
market player rather than the market maker in the foreign exchange market.
In effect, this means that the central bank 'indicates' a central rate for
the rupee each day, intervening in the market when necessary by buying and
selling dollars.
More important perhaps the liberalisation of the domestic money markets.
Bank Rate, previously changed at intervals of one year or even longer, is
now tied to the Treasury Bill rate - 1 per cent above the average bill
auction rate. To increase competitiveness, the liquid assets ratio applied
to commercial banks and the prescribed assets ratio for insurance companies
are to be phased out.
This means the government will have to compete for funds with private sector
fundraisers and the parastatals. Mr Sithanen hopes that this will lead to an
active secondary market for government paper, allowing the central bank to
conduct open market operations more effectively.
These measures have had two main impacts in the markets: interest rates have
firmed in line with the minister's stated intention of tightening monetary
policy to bring down inflation from 9.5 per cent in the 1993-94 fiscal year
to 5 per cent next year. Portfolio management opportunities are changing,
with financial institutions and individual investors offered a wider menu of
increasingly market-determined options.
Both developments will help the drive to establish Mauritius as an efficient
offshore business centre. Mauritius needs to move quickly given the probable
emergence of South Africa as a rival centre, as and when Pretoria eliminates
its exchange controls.
Already there is talk of Durban being developed as a free port, which would
undermine the Mauritius initiative on that front, and while the South
Africans are unlikely to push the offshore business option as such, the
reality is that - political stability permitting - Johannesburg is set to
become the regional business hub.
Nonetheless, Mauritius does have regional competitive advantage. It is the
only Indian Ocean offshore business centre; it has cultural and language
advantages South Africa cannot match. An impressive battery of
double-taxation agreements is encouraging financial and marketing companies
to set up shop on the island. The double-taxation agreement with India means
that companies investing there can do so via Mauritius, avoiding capital
gains tax in the process. Where it owns at least 10 per cent of an Indian
company, a Mauritian offshore company pays a withholding tax on dividends of
only 5 per cent, instead of the normal 20 per cent.
The offshore banking venture has done better than forecast. By mid-1994,
seven banks - Barclays, Banque Nationale de Paris Internationale, Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corp, Bank of Baroda, State Bank International, Edmond
de Rothschild and Banque Internationale des Mascareignes - had assets of
Dollars 400m.
Growth slowed from Dollars 125m in 1992-93 to Dollars 75m in the past year.
The two biggest players - on an asset basis - were Barclays and State Bank
International, a joint venture between the government-owned State Commercial
Bank and the State Bank of India.
However, with no new participants on the horizon, some bankers detect a
change of emphasis with offshore banking increasingly seen as an ancillary
operation, feeding upon and contributing to the growth of a broader offshore
business centre encompassing the freeport, international investment
institutions and global warehousing.
The growth record here is impressive, especially when set against sluggish
growth on the part of the offshore banks. Two years ago, just 10 were
registered offshore companies, increasing to 225 in mid-1993 and more than
1,000 by last month, including 21 investment funds with an asset base of
more than Dollars 1.7bn.
Three main factors explain this explosive growth. First, there are the
attractive incentives offered to companies that qualify for offshore status
 -zero taxation of profits earned in offshore operations, free profit
repatriation, concessionary personal tax arrangements for expatriate staff
at half normal tax rates, no withholding taxes on interest and dividends and
no capital gains tax.
The second factor is the liberalisation and deregulation of the Mauritian
economy and especially its financial sector, while the third is
liberalisation elsewhere, especially in India and China, but also in parts
of Africa.
Offshore business is unlikely to match the EPZ's role as an engine of growth
for the rest of this century. But the fact that it has performed so
impressively has bodes well for the future. But in taking this road,
Mauritius will run into increasingly fierce competition from a first world
that is anxious and determined to protect its jobs and earnings from such
service activities.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (2): Sustaining the miracle - Tony
Hawkins finds that diversification is essential for future growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We've done the easy part,' says a Mauritian businessman. 'From here on, its
going to be uphill all the way,' No-one disagrees.
For a decade or more the Mauritian miracle has been driven by the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ), more specifically by the clothing and textile sector.
The EPZ's share in GDP has more than doubled in the past 10 years from 5.2
per cent in 1983 to 12.5 per cent last year.
Net exports have risen 13-fold to MRs6.5bn, while the EPZ share in total
exports is now 70 per cent - up from a third 10 years ago. The zone now
accounts for 27 per cent of total employment, as against 12 per cent in
1983.
But that is yesterday's story. As the labour market tightened in the late
1980s and the island attained full and then over-employment, the EPZ began
to lose the competitive edge secured on the basis of low-cost labour. Output
growth has slowed from 26 per cent annually during the 1984-88 period, to 6
per cent a year since 1989. Employment, which had peaked at almost 91,000 in
1991 had fallen nearly 8 per cent by March this year.
Some of this is part of an inevitable restructuring process; the number of
enterprises quadrupled between 1983 when there were 146 EPZ firms and 1988
when the total reached 591. The subsequent shake-out has seen a net loss of
71 enterprises, with the number of closures, in the past 2 1/2 years
exceeding new ventures. In spite of this exports continue to expand,
increasing 37 per cent to MRs15.8bn since 1990.
Restructuring has three objectives - diversification away from the heavy
dependence on clothing and on exports to a narrow range of industrial
country markets; moving upmarket in the clothing sector to higher
value-added activities, and increasing output while shedding labour.
Diversification within the clothing sector - by increasing value-added  -
appears to have made more progress than attempts to broaden the zone's
industrial base. More than half the 520 EPZ enterprises make clothing while
another 30 firms (5.8 per cent) are in textiles. The largest non-clothing
segment is flowers (50 firms), followed by paper and wood products (26) and
jewellery (20).
Last year, clothing exports accounted for 80 per cent of total EPZ sales and
textiles for a further 4 per cent. The main non-clothing exports were clocks
and watches, which made up 3.9 per cent of the total.
In spite of efforts to diversify, this pattern has barely changed; in 1986,
60 per cent of the 365 enterprises were in clothing and textiles.
Ramakrishna Sithanen, the island's minister of finance, is confident that
the diversification effort - into printing, electronics, engineering,
jewellery - will bear fruit over the next few years. Indeed, one senior EPZ
official predicts that by the turn of the century Mauritian printers will
have supplanted the clothing industry as the EPZ's main player.
Market diversification is crucial too; four markets buy three-quarters of
EPZ exports. France is the lead market with 28 per cent, followed by the US
(25 per cent), Britain (14 per cent) and Germany (9 per cent). These markets
are increasingly at risk not just from fierce Asian-based competition, but
also from restructuring within the EU and US markets themselves.
The phasing out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and the loss of Lome
preferences over the next 10 years, underline the long-term need to
diversify markets and products. Restructuring was forced on the EPZ, not
just by the labour shortage and the need to find a new competitive advantage
to replace low-cost labour, but also by the fast-changing world economic
order.
With labour costs having doubled in the past four years, according to one
industrialist, Mauritius is no longer a player at the bottom end of the
garment market. New Asian producers - China, India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh - are forcing Mauritius to head up market in search of
higher-quality, higher value-added activities, with a greater emphasis on
design, style, flexibility and just-in-time delivery.
In spinning, with labour costs of Dollars 1.42 an hour, Mauritius is now a
far more costly location than Malaysia (Dollars 1.18), Thailand (Dollars
1.04) Philippines (78c), India (56c), Pakistan (44c), Vietnam (37c) and
China (36c).
Accordingly, it must now compete on quality and product differentiation
rather than price. This is not easy given that Mauritius has no large
hinterland market on its doorstep and incurs higher transport costs and
longer delivery times than many of its Asian competitors.
Multinationals are conspicuously absent from the EPZ which means few
Mauritian firms fit the modern model of globally-integrated businesses,
though the country's largest manufacturer, the Floreal group, the world's
second largest producer of woolmark products after Benetton of Italy, is
heading in that direction.
Five years ago, it went offshore to neighbouring Madagascar locating its
labour-intensive operations there in what has proved to be a highly
successful venture. Today it is looking further afield at China, India or
even, on a modest scale, the UK or France.
Investment figures are also indicative of the modest role of foreign
business in the EPZ showing that foreign capital has accounted for 28 per
cent of new capital projects since the mid-80s.
Going upmarket means heavy investment in both hardware and software. Only in
the past few years has Mauritius focused on training, with encouraging
results. In the EPZ, the productivity index (1982 = 100) which averaged 87
during the 1980s, has since risen 50 per cent.
More and better training and slicker management is only part of the story.
EPZ firms have invested heavily in state-of-the-art equipment - an average
of MRs700m annually in the past five years. Floreal management says its
CAD-CAM computerised plant is as good as, if not better than, that anywhere
in the world.
The government is doing its bit to help boost productivity and quality. Its
new Technology Diffusion Scheme, supported by the World Bank, will help EPZ
manufacturers access the technology and expertise necessary to compete in
global markets.
Under the programme, an estimated 250 firms will benefit from grants of some
Dollars 10,000 each. Grant funds may be used to pay 50 per cent of the cost
of external technology support services designed to improve productivity,
product quality, design and manufacturing response times.
A second initiative, launched two years ago, is the EPZ Development
Authority charged with helping Mauritius make the difficult transition from
a labour-abundant to a skills-intensive economy, by boosting technology,
management and productivity. Investment and value-added numbers point to
some progress along this difficult road.
In the four years to 1991, value-added per worker, at constant prices, rose
20 per cent in the EPZ sector, increasing 25 per cent in textiles and 18 per
cent in clothing. Value-added is forecast to grow more rapidly this year - 8
per cent - underlining the fact that it is premature to write its obituary.
It is still expanding faster than GDP as a whole and boosting its relative
importance to the economy.
But as labour costs escalate and labour shortages worsen, this will become
ever more difficult to achieve without accelerating the transition to the
information and knowledge-based economy which is now the country's goal.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (3): Later retirement
with smaller pensions - Eva Kaluzynska examines the implications of an
ageing population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EVA KALUZYNSKA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's workforce is ageing - 15 per cent of the population is already aged
65 or over, compared with an average of 6 per cent in the rest of the world.
'We're moving towards the low 20s (%) at the turn of the century,' said Dr
David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University, specialising in trends
affecting Europe.
There are relatively minor variations in birth and death rates among the 17
countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), but the picture is very
clear. Any company considering relocation will obviously factor in current
levels of social costs, lowest in Portugal, Greece, Spain and the UK;
highest in Germany, Denmark and Belgium. But employers must tune into
demographic trends now if they want to get a sustainable, long-term
personnel policy off the ground.
'Companies may be thinking of moving now to a country where costs are low,
but they must plan now to keep them low,' said employee-benefits specialist
David Formosa, of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes.
The baby boom after the war was followed by what demographers at Eurostat,
in Luxembourg, call a 'baby bust' in the 1970s. A marked decline in natural
population growth throughout the EEA is continuing, while the death rate
remains stable. In 1993, the birth rate was 11.2 per thousand, down from
11.5 per thousand in 1992; while the death rate stayed at 10.1 per thousand.
Women, currently 51.2 per cent of the population in the European Union (EU),
are having fewer children, and they are having them later if at all. Only in
Ireland (and Poland, in central Europe) are women still having two or more
children each. In 1993, there were 4.19m births in the 17 countries of the
EEA - 110,000 fewer than the previous year.
Demographers are ringing alarm bells about the need to adjust policies now,
both at company and government level. 'Germany is the forerunner,' said
Harri Cruijsen, team leader at Eurostat's project on demography. 'In the
next five to 10 years it is going to have the most acute problems in
adjusting to an ageing workforce.'
Italy and Spain lag by about five to 10 years. The situation is less serious
in France, which has had a policy of financial incentives for would-be
mothers. The UK could also buck the trend up to a point, due to what
Cruijsen calls an abnormally high rate of teenage pregnancies not seen
elsewhere in Europe.
The overall implications are stark. Employers who stay on the continent,
rather than move nearer to markets in Asia, must make the most of the
existing pool of potential labour, given the lack of youngsters. Experts
agree on the need for two significant shifts in policy and attitude:
postponing the age of retirement, and recruiting more women into the labour
force. 'Seniors will stay on, females will come on,' as Cruijsen puts it.
Many employees able to do so have retired early over the past decade, and
many still expect to do so. 'This will stop,' said Cruijsen bluntly. Italy
and Japan are already planning to raise the statutory age of retirement, and
other countries will follow suit, experts say.
'The notion of early retirement has overshot its usefulness,' said Coleman.
'Active, employable life is getting longer. The notion that a person is old
and past it at 65 is increasingly obsolete.'
The idea of older people giving up their places in the workforce to
youngsters gathered favour during the recession, though without any
significant effect in reducing unemployment. Employers encouraged the trend,
rejuvenating their workforces in the belief that younger people adapted
better to new technologies.
But Formosa urges managers to be innovative in adapting to new realities:
'Employers will have to start thinking differently.' Replacing key staff who
have specialised knowledge and experience will become far more difficult,
and flexible solutions, such as part-time schemes for key older employees
could be part of the answer. He would recommend phased retirement: 'Maybe
people will still be doing one or two days a week when they're aged 70.'
Employers casting round for reserves in the labour force will have to make
better use of women, experts say. Women currently make up about 40 per cent
of the labour force in the EU. Denmark has the highest rate of female
participation, at 46.6 per cent, followed by France (44.3), Portugal (43.2)
and the UK(43.2). Ireland has the lowest rate, at 34.1 per cent. 'All
projections for modest growth in the labour force at the turn of the century
come from increased levels of female participation,' says Coleman.
Formosa thinks employers will come round to offering women with caring
responsibilities for children or older people more flexible working
arrangements, as they realise the value of doing so. 'I believe employers
will make more of an effort to keep women, as there is more difficulty in
finding replacements.'
Coleman estimates that, if all EU countries matched Denmark's rate of female
participation in the labour force, the recruits would more than make up for
any shortfall. 'There is a hidden labour force of at least 30m, which will
be mobilised as married women increasingly take up work or return to work.'
Europe's ageing workforce can expect lower statutory pensions, with higher
retirement ages as the ratio of taxpayers to recipients descends from the
current 2.4:1 to under two. Incentives to retire early will go, and the
prospect of lower incomes will oblige seniors to work on.
Employers are likely to become involved in improving pension provisions,
partly through helping employees to set up appropriate schemes to which they
are the main contributors, partly through incentives for later retirement.
Formosa says there is still time to avoid scenarios in which pensions
systems collapse under the burden of payments due. Later retirement will cut
the cost of pensions by reducing the duration of payments.
Some experts have suggested migration as a potential solution to the
imbalance in western Europe's age structure. Coleman is adamant that this is
no quick fix. The EEA countries cannot absorb significant numbers of legal
migrants, other than those with specific skills for specific periods, he
says: 'It seems eccentric to propose immigration for low-grade labour,
especially since future demand emphasises high skills.'
Importing cheap young labour would exacerbate one of Europe's biggest
problems, its low productivity. Coleman argues that western Europe must deal
with the impending crisis through making the best use of its own resources.
It should, he says, retrain to reduce unemployment and invest in more
capital-intensive processes to improve productivity. And it should mobilise
more of its potential working population by making it easier for women to
work, as well as by recruiting those beyond current retirement age. Canny
employers can start planning now.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (4): The westerner's
choice - City profile: Budapest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the five years since the collapse of communism, Hungary has emerged as
the top choice for western companies investing in the former eastern bloc,
and Budapest has regained its pre-war reputation as one of Europe's most
cosmopolitan and dynamic capital cities.
By mid-1994, substantial investments by multinational companies such as
General Electric, General Motors, Nestle, Siemens, Suzuki and
Volkswagen-Audi had lifted total foreign investment in Hungary to over
Dollars 7.5bn - more than half the amount invested in all eastern Europe's
former communist states
Western companies in Budapest say the country has a historic advantage over
its eastern neighbours, in that it was the first of the former communist
countries to begin the transition to a market economy and to become open to
foreign investment.
'Hungary had a head start, and it shows. . . It is a western-oriented
country, and Budapest already has a sophisticated business culture which
makes it very attractive to investors. Hungarian businessmen speak the same
language as western businessmen,' says Mr David Young, director of business
development at Price Waterhouse Hungary.
Western companies say that expatriates enjoy living in Budapest, and that it
is not difficult to persuade good staff to relocate to the city.
'Budapest is a tremendously liveable place to be - it's beautiful, it's
cosmopolitan, the cuisine is great, it has all the creature comforts,' says
Mr Ed Bush, chief executive of the First American-Hungarian Insurance
Company, the local AIG subsidiary.
Although Hungarian is one of the region's more impenetrable languages, Mr
Bush says the numbers of Hungarians speaking foreign languages has increased
markedly in the past four years. 'In 1990, the first thing you searched for
was a bilingual secretary, who you had to pay several times more than a
brain surgeon; and the second, was a bilingual accountant. Now, these people
are available. Hungarians are very keen to learn foreign languages and the
principles of a market economy,' he says.
As in other former communist states, bureaucracy, often-changing regulations
and the rapidly evolving business environment can make it difficult for
foreign (and local) companies to set up and plan their businesses. But Mr
Bush says business life and the economy have begun to normalise, and that,
unlike in 1990, foreign investors can draw on the services of the many top
western banks, law and accountancy firms with offices in the capital.
Budapest is also central Europe's largest city, with a population of more
than 2m - about twice that of Prague or Vienna. Its size and downtown
commercial district give it an advantage over Prague, another of the
region's up-and-coming cities, says Mr Chris Bennett, head of property
company Debenham Zadelhoff's central European operations.
'Budapest has the potential to be a major commercial centre - it is
developing a business district in the heart of the city. With its historic
buildings, Prague cannot do this - most commercial developments will have to
be further away from the centre,' he says.
Commercial property prices in Budapest have fallen and stabilised since 1991
and 1992, and are now lower than in most western European cities.
'In 1990, there was virtually no modern stock of office space. Companies
were desperate for modern buildings with telephones and prices went up very
quickly,' says Mr Bennett. A building boom has since satisfied much of the
demand, and good commercial property in the centre now goes for around DM45
(Dollars 29) a month, compared with DM50 in Prague and DM42 in Vienna,
according to Mr Bennett.
Infrastructure remains a weak point, but is gradually being brought up to
western standards. By 1996, the number of telephone lines will have
increased to more than 3.2m - up from less than 1m in 1989; while a
ring-road around Budapest and motorways linking the city to Austria in the
west and to Croatia and Romania in the south and east are under
construction.
The city needs a good infrastructure if it is to capitalise on its position
at the centre of Europe, says Mr Frigyes Banki, managing director of the
Hungarian Investment and Trade Development Agency, which was set up by the
government to promote foreign investment and exports last year.
Mr Banki says western companies have been attracted to the country by the
low cost of high-quality labour - the average monthly wage is just Dollars
300. He says companies relocating production to Hungary can cut costs, but
remain at the centre of the huge European market. Although the country has a
relatively small population of 10m people, 240m live within a 1,000km radius
of Budapest. The country's association agreement with the European Union
gives it preferential trading rights with the EU and the prospect of full
membership by the end of the century.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (2): The old champion
is still on his feet - Philip Coggan considers Europe's long-term economic
problem, and the possible solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe stands condemned, in many economists' eyes, as an ageing boxer,
flabby with age and made soft though luxury, ripe for a bruising from
younger, hungrier challengers such as the countries of south-east Asia.
Accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand have predicted that Europe's share of world
GDP will fall to 17 per cent in 2010, from 22 per cent in 1990, while Asian
developing countries' share rises from 18 to 28 per cent over the same
period.
There are two broad schools of thought in dealing with this long-term
problem. The free-market, British approach is to argue that European labour
markets are too rigid, and that the costs of employing workers, in
particular in the form of additional social benefits are too high. Non-wage
labour costs were estimated by a House of Lords report to be 44 per cent of
total labour costs in the European Union, against 28 per cent in Japan and
24 per cent in the US.
'Europe's manufacturing cost-base is too high,' says Mr Stephen King, deputy
chief economist at brokers James Capel. 'The main problem countries, such as
Germany and Belgium, have high unit labour costs with a big government
element, in terms of employers' social security contributions. Clearly,
Europe will have a declining share of world markets if those high costs
continue, and we will tend to see a shrinking of the manufacturing sector.'
Mr Giles Keating, chief economist at CS First Boston, says: 'The problem
with the European economic system is not just that we're more expensive; we
are set up too inflexibly. Institutions were set up which worked well under
the old system but which aren't appropriate any longer.'
Among the problems that Mr Keating cites are regional concentrations of
heavy industry, strong trade unions, and a generous system of social
protection 'which was set up to look after workers who made temporary moves
in and out of a static employment profile.'
It is not just labour-market rigidities that impose a cost burden on
European countries. The steady ageing of European populations means that
those in work will face ever-increasing social costs of looking after the
elderly.
Around a fifth of the European Union's 320m citizens are aged over 60. Some
20m of those are aged over 74. By the year 2040, the proportion of those
aged over 60 is expected to grow to 25 per cent; Ireland which has more than
one child for every person of working age is one of the few exceptions to
this greying trend.
The burden of supporting the future elderly is increased, because most
countries have followed a 'pay-as-you-go' pension system, in which benefits
are met from current taxation rather than funded by contributions made
during the beneficiary's during working life.
CS First Boston has calculated that, as a proportion of GDP, unfunded
pension liabilities are higher than conventional debt in every EU member
except Belgium. Adding in unfunded liabilities, the only EU country with
total debt below 100 per cent of GDP is the UK; five countries (Belgium,
Greece, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal) have debt totalling over 200 per
cent of GDP.
Such drastic problems require radical solutions, according to the
free-market view. Flexible labour markets are needed before Europe can adapt
to the competitive challenge posed by Asia and other developing areas.
Proponents cite the success of the US in creating jobs, while Europe has
seen inexorably rising unemployment.
Critics of this approach refuse to countenance the social costs implicit in
freeing up labour markets in this way. They argue that the US has only
succeeded in creating low-quality jobs, and that real wages in America have
been stagnant for 20 years.
They also point out that the high-cost argument is too simplistic. Germany -
on many counts, one of the highest cost centres of all - is leading the way
out of European recession through an export boom. Its costs are evidently
outweighed by high productivity or the high quality of its products.
Nevertheless, such economists do believe that the challenge for Europe is to
emphasise technological development, education and training. The continent
cannot compete in commodity-style products, where the low wages of Asia will
be an insuperable barrier. Instead, it must try to maintain its comparative
advantage in high-quality, value-added goods.
'High labour costs are only part of a complicated equation,' says Mr Albert
Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson. 'When you're producing
sophisticated capital equipment, which can be differentiated, you can
command a premium price.'
However, there are worrying signs that Europe is falling behind in the
technological race. In 1991, the European countries devoted just under 2 per
cent of GDP to research and development, compared with 2.74 per cent in the
US and 2.87 per cent in Japan. And even the development of high-technology
industries may not improve the unemployment problem, nor make Europe's
citizens more prosperous. 'What essentially is causing Europe's problems is
structural unemployment caused by technological change,' says Mr Kit Juckes,
international economist at SG Warburg. 'Europe has to cope with the fact
that capital has become materially more competitive compared to labour. The
hit is going to take the form of minimum growth in real wages.'
The scale of the problem can be exaggerated, however. Some economists argue
that countries and continents do not compete against each other in the
manner of corporations. Growth in Asia will bring prosperity to Europe as
trade increases; Asia may catch up in terms of income per head, but both
continents will grow richer.
'The need in Europe is to be able to grow modestly at 2-3 per cent per
annum, while the Pacific rim is growing at 7-8 per cent per annum,' says
Kleinwort Benson's Mr Edwards.
'Over the long term,' says CS First Boston's Mr Keating, 'the adjustment
will occur in the form of a gradual rise in Asian real exchange rates.
European purchasing power will gradually fall, but its exports will become
more competitive.'
But in the short term, Europe's high costs may cause severe problems for
individual countries. 'Sweden is a classic case: far too generous a social
security system, whose weakness has been chronically exposed because they
didn't cut back quickly enough in the 1980s,' says Mr Keating.
The European boxer may not yet be knocked out, but he will need some nimble
footwork to stay on his feet over the next 30 years.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (1): Tiger in the making - Successful as
a manufacturing base, Mauritius needs to develop new skills and a stronger
service sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within a generation, Mauritius has gone from gloom to boom.
Some thirty years ago an eminent economist warned that the Indian Ocean
island faced 'ultimate catastrophe' unless its rate of population growth was
checked.
Today Mauritius prospers. Once a sugar mono economy, beset with high
unemployment and rampant inflation, it has developed a thriving,
labour-intensive, industrial sector, heavily reliant on clothing exports,
and a highly successful tourist business, while a start to the development
of offshore financial services has been made.
Population has stabilised at 1.1m, unemployment is negigible, and per capita
income has doubled in 13 years. It should be a role model for Africa;
instead it is leaving the mainland trailing in its wake.
Ethnically, politically, culturally, and especially economically, Mauritius
is not part of Africa.
Attitudes could scarcely be more different: contrast Mauritian industry
minister, Jean-Claud L'Estrac, extolling the virtues of foreign expertise,
skills and investment, with the suspicion of expatriates displayed in so
many parts of the continent.
While Mauritius is anxious to be part of Africa - much store, especially
from a marketing viewpoint, is laid on its membership of the Preferential
Trade Area of East and Southern Africa (PTA), and it is negotiating entry to
the (overlapping) Southern African Development Community - the island is far
more outward-looking, in economic policy as well as in political attitudes,
than its African counterparts.
Today Mauritius is closer to newly industrialising country (NIC) status than
to sub-Saharan Africa. The UN's Human Development Report lists the island in
the top 25 developing countries, ahead of Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Since the mid-1980s, gross domestic product growth has averaged 6.5 per cent
annually, and inflation 7.5 per cent; unemployment is estimated at 1.6 per
cent, and the budget deficit is a modest 2.2 per cent of GDP.
Finance minister Ramakrishna Sithanen's recent budgets bulge with
first-world supply-side ideas designed to improve market efficiency, offer
new incentives for savings and investment and improve the infrastructure.
Refreshing, too, is the country's ability to pay its own way. The ubiquitous
'donors', dominating such discussions in Africa, seldom feature in
Mauritius. External debt will fall to 30 per cent of GDP this year, while
the debt-service ratio will be only 6.5 per cent of exports.
Since 1982 Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, has presided over the
transformation, based on economic measures to which all the main parties
subscribe, ensuring policy continuity irrespective of who wins the next
general election, to be held by 1996.
All this means that the yardstick against which Mauritius must be assessed
is Asian rather than African, although whether it can make the leap to NIC
status will depend on practicising what it preaches.
Most agree that the Export Processing Zone is unlikely to maintain its
existing dominance of the economy. Mauritian businessmen accept the need to
develop new skills and a capital-intensive growth path, while retaining
their competitive strength, especially in garment manufacture, built up over
the past decade.
Some companies, the Floreal Group being the flagship, have taken the
multinational route, setting up a labour-intensive plant in nearby
Madagascar, while looking further afield to the possibility of manufacturing
in China or India.
Others, such as the New Island Clothing group, are manufacturing to Marks
and Spencer specifications for the UK market.
The strategy is crucial. Mauritius is increasingly at a competitive
disadvantage, not just because it is a full-employment economy, where wage
costs have doubled in the past four years, but also because of its location.
The choice is between importing labour, going offshore as Floreal has done,
or sharpening its competitive edge in manufacturing.
Devaluation - 25 per cent in the past five years - has helped maintain
competitiveness, but the zone must now implement structural solutions rather
than temporary palliatives. 'We have to redesign the Mauritian citizen,'
says a businessman, referring not just to the need for better and more
relevant education and training, but also for a change in attitudes.
Mauritius may be ahead of Africa in terms of work ethic, but when it comes
to the Asian tigers it is not in the same league.
Nor does investment efficiency measure up to 'tiger' standards. While ratios
are high, an estimated 30 per cent of GDP in 1994, the capital-output ratio
of 19.4 per cent in recent years is well below Korea's 29 per cent and
Taiwan's and Thailand's 35.5 per cent.
This is explained partly by weaknesses in the financial system, some of
which were tackled in this year's budget, but also by structural factors -
especially an inefficient labour market.
Welfarist attitudes die hard, reflected in the readiness to abolish exchange
control and to liberalise money markets, while retaining restrictive labour
laws. With much underemployment, labour market deregulation would allow
better use of scarce resources.
Immediate growth prospects are good. GDP will grow 4.5 per cent in 1994-5,
slower than the past two years because of the impact on sugar production of
cyclone Hollanda early in the year. The current account deficit last year of
MRs700m (1.2 per cent of GDP) will increase sharply to 4.2 per cent in
1994-5, but if aircraft purchases are excluded, it will be slightly lower at
1 per cent. With net capital inflows of some MRs3bn the balance of payments
will be in healthy surplus.
Inflation is expected to fall from 9.5 per cent to 5 per cent by mid-1995.
Real interest rates are positive, with bank rate, tied to the treasury bill
rate at 11.2 per cent, and the savings ratios (24 per cent of GDP)
should be boosted by budget measures designed to increase the flow of
investible securities. This includes privatising five parastatals, starting
with Air Mauritius later this year. At the same time, the Stock Exchange is
being opened up to foreign investors.
With the EPZ facing a more competitive international environment, including
the loss of Lome preferences ,growth will slow, while sugar prices will fall
in response to Uruguay Round agreement.
While tourism is most likely to fill the gap in the short term, physical and
environmental limitations, mean the potential for tourism-driven growth
beyond the turn of the century is hard to assess. This is why the drive to
develop the services sector - embracing offshore banking, the free port,
offshore companies, data capture, pre-press services for the printing
industry, computer software - has assumed such importance. The number of
offshore companies has risen from 150 a year ago to more than 1,000.
Leaders, both in government and business have few illusions. Business and
government are working more closely than in the past, while in the political
sphere there is a shared vision of the future.
But while the centre will hold, it is vital that the service culture,
increasingly evident in tourism, becomes more entrenched in the economy,
because that is where the island's future lies.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (1): Financial lures
may not be the answer - Traditional preferences for compartmentalised,
nationally-based businesses are only slowly giving way to a pan-European
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession in Europe may have blunted company profits, but hard times
have sharpened corporate efforts to take full advantage of the single market
completed nearly two years ago.
The hype and high expectations surrounding 1992 and the promised arrival of
a 'level playing-field' for the sale of goods and services may have
evaporated. But as company strategists lay their plans for the future, they
are increasingly and unavoidably being influenced by structural changes in
the political and economic landscape of Europe.
Recession-led pressures to reduce costs and improve all-round efficiency
have been running in tandem with the need for businesses to pursue economies
of scale and to reappraise manufacturing, marketing and distribution
policies within an expanding European customer base.
The pace of consolidation involving manufacturing plant and distribution
centres across Europe has increased over the past year, while the European
headquarters of many multinational groups have been accruing to themselves
more autonomy and responsibility.
But the old preference for compartmentalised, nationally-based businesses is
only slowly giving way to a pan-European approach requiring the EU market to
be treated as a single entity within which the best skills and production
techniques can be located and utilised.
SKF, the Swedish roller bearing producer, has spread its six European
manufacturing operations across the marketplace; Whirlpool, the US domestic
appliance manufacturer, is sharply reducing its network of European
warehouses; and Compaq, the computer group, has invested heavily to create a
centralised Euro-distribution facility in Holland.
Despite plentiful examples, however, the process of reorganisation and
rationalisation appears far from complete, indicating that the European
employment market could take much longer to recover than predicted by the
Commission before the completion of the single market.
According to Dr Wilfried Vossen, Brussels-based managing director of Plant
Location International, the location consultants: 'A game resembling
locational musical chairs is still being played out. There are plenty of
indications that, far from creating new jobs, companies will continue
rationalising their activities across the European Union'.
He cites a recent annual survey by the European Commission, which claims the
jobs outlook remains grim as companies improve productivity and drive down
employment levels.
Nor has the single market yet provided the truly uniform, internal
marketplace pledged by the politicians. Mr Nick Cowley, of Amsterdam-based
Cowley Research and Publications, says: 'There remains a bunch of structural
problems which 1992 was intended to deal with but which by and large still
exist. The reality is considerable political inertia and slowness to change
 -witness the continuing fiasco over telecommunications deregulation.'
He adds: 'For many companies, the European markets are still carved up along
old lines, and distribution is still organised by country, causing higher
than necessary costs to be borne. Things are changing, but perhaps
expectations surrounding 1992 were too high.'
While politicians and companies review progress towards full economic
integration, the return of economic growth has again revived questions about
Europe's continuing ability to attract a significant share of mobile,
international business investment.
It has already experienced a worrying fall in inward activity by some of the
biggest international corporate investors, triggering more intense
competition between EU countries for a slice of the funds. The rivalry,
which extends to within regions of individual countries, has never been more
intense, and is increasingly given a high-profile political priority.
France, not always effectively organised to attract foreign investment, has
appointed an inward investor 'ambassador' who reports to the president. The
Irish republic continues to do well on the back of an aggressive campaign
underpinned by attractive tax concessions for manufacturers; while hopes are
high in Northern Ireland that, after 25 years of civil unrest, peace could
reap big investment dividends. At the other end of the scale, nations like
Greece and Portugal are not regarded as particularly effective in attracting
foreign-owned operations.
Among the big external investors, Japanese interest in Europe has nosedived
since 1992, partially reflecting Japan's domestic problems, but also echoing
a change in attitudes to a European marketplace which has not pursued the
protectionist path once feared.
There is little confidence that Japanese capital investment is set to return
to former levels, given the growing popularity of Asian locations much
closer to home offering low-cost production and increasingly affluent
consumer markets. Targets include Singapore and Malaysia, which in turn form
part of a chain now extending to still lower-cost production centres such as
Vietnam and Cambodia.
The US, which has more usually seen Europe as a market into which it can
sell rather than undertake innovation or even manufacturing, has also reined
back on new investment in EU countries. It remains a big participant, still
seeing Europe as a very rich consumer market with good economic
infrastructure and high workforce skills, but the new projects being
approved have generally been smaller in size.
Both the US and Japan, along with other significant inward investors, share
rising concern about the relative expense of operating in Europe. The debate
about social costs, highlighted by the refusal of the UK to accept elements
of the social chapter regarded as costly barriers to competitiveness, has
become an important issue.
Mr David Rees, head of Ernst &amp; Young's location advisory service, says
German companies continue to seek locations elsewhere in Europe, to escape
the employment costs facing them within their own country. Britain, he says,
is maintaining its good record for inward investment by promoting the
country's flexible regulatory environment and lower unit labour costs, as
well as fewer restrictions on recruitment and dismissal.
The challenge to western Europe of maintaining the inward flow is compounded
by rising competition from other locations, some of them right on the
doorstep, not so evident before 1992.
'The risks traditionally associated with some other, competing locations for
corporate investment have been significantly reduced, leaving lower levels
of capital directed at Europe,' says Mr Cowley.
The former eastern European countries have inevitably attracted a great deal
of attention - primarily from Britain, France, Germany and the US  - given
their proximity to the European market and the continuing, though perhaps
temporary, cost advantages on offer. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
remain the most obvious areas of interest, and are now regularly included on
lists of candidate countries to be considered by engineering and electronics
businesses.
According to Mr Rees: 'Some of these markets now have to be taken very
seriously, even though the existing cost advantages may not last for too
long'. Many central European countries now have their own inward investment
authorities, part-funded by the EU. Given the prospect that some may
eventually join the Union and qualify for regional aid, the competition for
available investment will grow even more intense.
Efforts by the EU - notwithstanding national rivalries - to strategically
deploy the flow of inward investment to those declining regions low on
investors' preferences, but most in need of economic stimulation, have
always required a delicate trade-off.
But some location specialists are now beginning to questionwhether the
policy of offering financial rewards to overcome companies' instinctive
reservations is sustainable. 'You can offer massive incentives to get
companies to go to the north of Holland, or you can get them to Rotterdam,
where they really want to be, at far lower cos,' observes Dr Vossen of PLI.
'The issue of where to go in Europe is less and less based on industrial and
economic logic. Is it not time to let investors go where they want?'

FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bass unpopular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in brewing, hotels and soft drinks company Bass fell sharply after a
badly received trading statement from the group.
The slide started early in the day following the statement's release, and at
the day's worst the stock was down 18 before steadying with the improving
market to close a net 17 off at 523p after thin trade of 1.3m.
Market watchers were particularly concerned by the 0.8 per cent decline in
beer volumes, along with the poor outlook on margins for beer. However, one
analyst did say that trading in the soft drinks division was better than
expected. Another analyst said simply: 'Even the meeting with the company
was poor, with little there to find encouraging.'
The utilities sectors, traditionally safe havens during periods of extreme
turbulence in equities, were given the roughest of rides in the market as a
number of institutions were straight sellers of the 'recs' or aggressive
switchers, out of the 'recs' and into the water stocks, a move advocated
last week by Hoare Govett.
Dealers said there were no new stories behind the slide in the recs shares,
other than that the sector's closed period is looming. Details of the
flo-tation of the National Grid is not expected until the end of the recs'
closed season, in November.
Seeboard took advantage of the steep fall in share prices to buy in
substantial blocks of their own stock, announcing the purchase of 2.85m
shares at 427p. Seeboard closed 7 lower at 420p.
Midlands Electricity was the worst casualty in the recs, the shares
plummeting 35, or 4.5 per cent, to 755p. South Western dropped 24 1/2 to
749p. Northern Ireland Electricity was a lone good performer, closing 3
ahead at 388p.
British Petroleum edged higher, thanks to a buy note from SG Warburg and
evidence of keen support from the US as Wall Street opened on a firm note.
The shares settled 3 ahead at 401p on 7.5m traded.
Hanson was the most heavily traded stock in the market, the shares fighting
back after last Friday's Hoare Govett profits downgrade and closing a
fraction ahead at 230 3/4 p, with US institutions said to have been
aggressive buyers. Turnover amounted to 18m shares.
Royal Bank of Scotland was the pick of the banks sector, still responding to
aggressive buying by Credit Lyonnais Laing after the recent positive meeting
with Mr Peter Wood, the chief executive of Direct Line, the RBOS's insurance
subsidiary. RBOS shares closed 9 higher at 422p.
There was also a suggestion of substantial switching out of Abbey National
and into RBOS. Abbey slipped 7 to 383p.
Fears of a bitter price war among food retailers continued to cast a shadow
over stocks in the sector. J. Sainsbury relinquished another 6 to 391p as
several brokers indicated a preference for its rival Tesco and advised
clients to switch into the latter. It closed at 228p xd, down 2. Kwik Save
tumbled 27 to 545p on reports that Nomura had issued a sell recommendation
on the stock.
Publishing shares took in their stride the announcement that Hodder Headline
is to move away from the net book agreement from January. Hodder was
unchanged at 350p.
Activity among engineering shares was mostly concentrated on smaller
companies, with armoured vehicle maker Alvis plummeting 19 to 36p on
consideration of the weakening profits trend.
In the unlisted securities market, Belfast engineer Mackie closed at 195p,
compared with a placing price of 180p.
Granada Group finished 7 ahead at 508p after UBS issued a 36-page review on
the group's operations. Mr Julian Easthope at UBS reiterated his buy stance
on the stock and said he values Granada's 13.5 per cent holding in BSkyB at
around Pounds 540m, a figure he believes is not yet reflected in the current
share price.
Eurotunnel stood out sharply in an otherwise lacklustre transport sector,
ending 19 down at 250p, as stories of sea water seeping into the tunnel ran
round the market, causing confused trading.

FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs bid seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suggestions in the UK press over the weekend that Zeneca, the drugs group
demerged from ICI last year, may be preparing a Pounds 900m-plus bid for
Boots' pharmaceuticals division triggered a strong performance by the
latter's shares but left those of Zeneca floundering.
Some of the market's drugs analysts were unimpressed with the story; 'A
Glaxo move to acquire Boots' drugs division would make much more sense,'
said one.
Boots' intention to hive off its drugs business has been discussed in the
market for many months but Zeneca had not, until this week, been viewed as a
potential bidder.
Zeneca itself has been considered by the market as a potential target for an
overseas bidder and there has been talk around the City's trading desks of a
merger between Zeneca and Wellcome.
Zeneca shares dropped 25 to 797p on turnover of 2.9m, while Boots was one of
only a handful of FT-SE 100 stocks to make progress on the day, finishing 4
1/2 higher at 530 1/2 p, after touching 536p.

FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reckitt rights not welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing, if not the substance, of the move by Reckitt &amp; Colman, the
household goods and pharmaceutical products group, to acquire L &amp; F
Household from Eastman Kodak, took the market by surprise and triggered a
steep decline in Reckitt shares.
Reckitt stock was the FT-SE 100's worst performer, closing 43 off at the
session's low of 555p, as the market reacted violently to the deeply
discounted Pounds 230m cash call which accompanied the L &amp; F Household
purchase.
Talk that Reckitt was about to buy L &amp; F Household has been in the market
for around two months. In August, and before the latest steep slide in share
prices, the market was full of stories that Reckitt was prepared to pay
upwards of Dollars 1.7bn for L &amp; F.
One leading analyst described the proposed purchase of L &amp; F as a 'good
strategic move' but said the market had not taken kindly to the rights
issue. He professed concern, however, at Reckitt's claim that the purchase
will have insignificant impact on its earning's for 1995. 'Insignificant
impact is taken as market code for earnings dilution,' he said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had another troubled day, but volume improved and there
was evident relief when the long rumoured big stock loss trade did not
materialise.
The FT-SE December contract spent most of the day following rather than
driving the cash market, moving down to a low point of 2,987 around 1pm
before recovering to close at 3,009.
At this level the contract sells at a premium to the cash market of around
nine points, with the fair value premium extending to 18.4 points.
The locals - independent traders - made a number of testing runs when the
contract dipped below 3,000 but dealers said the market showed a surprising
degree of resilience.
There was a suggestion from major specialist that the futures market might
now be close to some sort of base, given its goodish volume yesterday which
included occasional flashes of genuine business.
The day saw 15,546 contracts, up from 12,700 on Friday and an average for
last week of less than 13,000.
Traded option volume was 39,507 lots, against 42.979 in previous session.
FT-SE and Euro-FT-SE volume combined fell just short of 22,000 lots.
The most actively traded individual stock options were Hanson with 1,771
lots, Argyll Group with 1,550 and British Steel with 1,330.

FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,000 lost as selling of shares
continues - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed selling in the UK stock market yesterday drove the FT-SE 100-share
Index down to its first close below 3,000 since mid-July as fund managers
backed away ahead of the meeting today of the Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee. Although views on the chances of a rise in US interest rates were
divided, and London closed well above the worst after US bonds opened
firmly, sentiment in equities remained negative.
Traders said that European funds had continued to switch out of UK equities
and into bonds. SG Warburg, reducing its portfolio weighting on
international equities to neutral, from overweight, warned clients that some
equity valuations look 'modestly stretched' and that markets may have
underestimated the chances of interest rises in the final quarter of the
year.
However, Warburg continues to favour 'an overweight of equities' on a twelve
month view, noting that equities can rise even when both interest rates and
bond yields are moving higher.
Equities opened lower and were hit hard at mid-session by another sizeable
sell programme, which took the Footsie 100 Index down by more than 40 points
to the day's low of 2,987.8.
Last week saw a series of equity sell programmes which, traders believe,
resulted from portfolio deals by fund managers who unloaded equity stakes to
marketmakers who were then left with the problem of passing the stock on
through the market; such deals were, as has become normal practice,
spearheaded by selling of the stock index future. Government bonds held
steady yesterday, reinforcing belief that cash was moving from equities to
bonds.
The Footsie recovered as yesterday's trading programme was unwound and,
spurred on by firmness in US bonds, cut its loss by nearly one third. The
final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,999.8 for a net loss of 28.4. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index also suffered yesterday, falling 39.5 to 3,521.4.
Seaq volume, slow at first, speeded up towards the close when the delayed
trading programme was reported on City trading screens. The final total of
515.8m shares through the Seaq network compared with 550.5m on Friday when
retail business, at Pounds 1.16bn, was moderate. A good value total of
retail business, contrasting with fairly average Seaq share totals, has been
a feature of recent sessions and also implies that the big institutions have
been active in equities.
A number of special situations enlivened the day's trading. Some analysts
took a cautious view of Reckitt &amp; Colman's Pounds 1bn purchase of Eastman
Kodak's household products business, suggesting that Reckitt had overpaid.
Shares in the UK group also paid the price for inflicting a large rights
issue on a market now clearly feeling less confident than it was only a few
weeks ago.
Consumer and retail issues remained badly unsettled by growing fears of
increased competitions and pressured margins. Bass and Tesco fell away and
most of the store groups ran into selling pressure again. The banks, with
their bad debt portfolios in the firing line if interest rates move higher
and hurt their customers, also gave ground.
Yesterday's fall below the Footsie 3,000 mark has left equity chartists
hoping to see for support for the market in the Footsie 2,970 area.
However, most UK analysts remain fairly confident for the equity performance
in the final quarter of the year, and point out that this week - the final
week of the third quarter - is unlikely to bring much new investment money
into the London stock market. Many market analysts still stand by forecasts
that the FT-SE 100 Index will move upwards towards the 3,500 mark by the end
of December.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances ahead of Fed
rates decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks forged ahead yesterday afternoon but the technology group
retreated, as investors awaited the outcome of today's Federal Reserve
policy-making session, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 17.49 up at 3,849.24 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.17 at 460.84, but the Nasdaq composite
slipped 1.83 to 755.63. NYSE volume came to 272.5m shares.
After a week of volatility, trading settled into a more even tempo
yesterday. The blue chip index meandered within a few points of its opening
level throughout the morning, mirroring a lazy drift by bonds. Few investors
were willing to make big new commitments before it became clear whether the
Fed would decide to lift interest rates immediately.
The session brought a piece of evidence suggesting that the economy was
cooling. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes fell by 1.8 per cent last month, a little more than
analysts had forecast.
Although the data had little impact on sentiment, the Dow managed to pick up
strength during the afternoon. Two stocks were mostly responsible. The
first, Coca-Cola, added Dollars 1 at Dollars 49 5/8 after announcing that it
was lifting its investment in Russia. Meanwhile, Philip Morris gained
Dollars 1 at Dollars 59 3/8 after signalling its intention of resisting more
stringent restrictions on smoking in New York City.
Walt Disney put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40 1/4 after deciding to quit
talks on buying the NBC television network from General Electric, which was
marked up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 .
The technology sector showed broad-based weakness. In semiconductors, Micron
Technology shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 36 and Texas Instruments dropped
Dollars 3 3/4 , or 5 per cent, to Dollars 67 1/4 . CS First Boston
downgraded both stocks, citing unimpressive demand for dynamic random access
memory, or Dram, computer chips.
On the Nasdaq, Oracle was off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 42 1/2 but Lotus
Development firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 . The two companies
reached an agreement to integrate their database software products.
In banking, EquiCredit surged Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 29 1/2 after Barnett
Banks agreed to acquire the company. But Arbor National Holding plummeted
Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/4 on news of its agreement to merge with
BankAmerica. On the NYSE, Barnett dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 5/8 and
BankAmerica held at Dollars 46.
Canada
The Toronto composite index declined in light trading as the market looked
to today's meeting of the US Federal Reserve for any move on interest rates.
The index closed 26.12 off at 4,341.42 as losing issues led rises by 471 to
284. Volume was 41.2m shares.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo fell 3.4 per cent in heavy trading amid concern over a
report quoting presidential candidate Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso as saying
that he saw possible government action to slow the inflow of foreign money
into Brazil as positive. The Bovespa index ended 1,881 down at 52,651.
Turnover amounted to RDollars 328.7m (Dollars 381.3m).

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Washington meeting worries
weigh on bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries about the outcome of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting
in Washington continued to weigh upon senior bourses, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT blamed the FOMC prospect as the Dax index dropped 21.45 to
2,068.67 on the session, but some brokers injected political apprehension as
the Ibis-indicated index fell further to 2,057.83 by the end of the
afternoon, down 1.9 per cent from last Friday's post-bourse close.
Turnover fell from DM5.7bn to DM5.3bn. On the session, Daimler lost DM13.50
at DM772 after last Friday's Standard &amp; Poor's downgrading of its debt; and
Deutsche Bank dropped DM14.50 to DM692.50 on US selling on its involvement
with Metallgesellschaft as one of the embattled trading group's major
banking shareholders.
Metallgesellschaft fell DM15.80 to DM133.20 and hit a new 1994 intraday low
of DM122 after hours before closing the afternoon at DM130, as stories
circulated that Deutsche Bank and other major banking shareholders were
reducing their positions.
The afternoon also brought a reaction from Siemens, down DM15.50 to DM647.70
at the close of Ibis trading, after a magazine article said the giant
electricals group would report slightly lower profits this year; Siemens
said the report contained errors.
PARIS fielded a number of corporate features as the general market fell on
interest rate worries in a gloomy opening to the new account. The CAC 40
index lost 24.63, or 1.3 per cent, at 1,902.72 after a low of 1,895.62 for
the day.
Turnover was FFr2.6bn. The best features were in leaders such as Peugeot,
down just FFr2 to FFr793 before news after market hours of a return to
profitability, and Societe Generale, expected to reveal higher profits today
and FFr1 up at FFr536.
At the more painful end of the performance charts, Eurotunnel dropped
FFr1.45, or 6.4 per cent, to FFr21.10 on reports of water leaks in the
tunnel, although the company said this was a normal occurrence; and Credit
Lyonnais, opening strongly at FFr415 on hopes of state aid, fell to FFr378
before closing FFr8.20 lower at FFr387 as those hopes were denied. The bank
will produce its delayed first-half results this afternoon.
AMSTERDAM was lower on interest rate worries and the AEX index closed 3.14
down at 400.47. Unilever bucked the trend, however, picking up 60 cents at
Fl 194.50 amid optimism over forthcoming third-quarter results.
A 30-cent advance in Aegon to Fl 101.70 was attributed to strong interest in
its call options on the EOE. ABN-Amro fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 57 and ING 90 cents
to Fl 74.80.
KLM ended 20 cents higher at Fl 47.60 after its deputy chairman said the
airline would seek to strengthen existing co-operation arrangements.
Heineken dipped Fl 1.70 to Fl 236.30: Kleinwort Benson, which continues to
rate the stock a buy after the higher than expected first-half results, said
the brewer was its preferred defensive play, along with CSM.
ZURICH finished lower in thin volume, the SMI index losing 23.0 at 2,586.1,
with many investors unwilling to commit themselves.
Roche certificates set the tone with a SFr70 loss to SFr5,955 while Nestle
gave up SFr14 to SFr1,191, and Sulzer fell SFr20 to SFr890 ahead of today's
first-half results.
Financials were broadly easier. Swiss Re fell SFr4 to SFr567. Among the
banks, SBC lost SFr5 to SFr367 and CS Holding fell SFr9 to SFr538.
MILAN edged ahead on a day of highly charged political debate and the Comit
index rose 3.95 to 672.14 as Friday's deadline approached for the government
to present its budget plans.
However, Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan noted that business was
light, with continuing delays and the postponement of yesterday morning's
meeting between the government and unions on pensions reform adding to
investors' worries about the eventual effectiveness of the budget proposals.
The small gain in the index was largely attributed to advances in telecom
stocks, particularly that of Stet, which rose L114 to L4,621 on arbitrage
activity ahead of the expiration of the warrants on its savings shares.
Telecom Italia gained L101 at L4,325: the group is expected to report
buoyant first-half figures today.
Six-month results continued to feature. Pirelli rose to a high of L2,660 in
reply to Friday's better than expected first-half figures before ending L27
down at L2,610. Fiat was off L9 at L6,692, after touching L6,745, ahead of
Thursday's figures.
MADRID reversed an early improvement to close with the general index 1.65
easier at 297.17.
Repsol was one of the few winners on the day, gaining a token Pta10 at
Pta3,825 on news that the equity offer forming the third stage of the oil
major's privatisation could be delayed until next year.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Markets in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's equity markets accelerated their downtrend last week, the
FT-Actuaries World index losing 1.05 per cent in local currency terms
against a decline of 0.37 per cent in the week before.
Mr Robin Griffiths, technical analyst at James Capel, noted a week ago that
when the US bond market topped out at the start of this year, it not only
cracked all other bond markets, but brought most equity markets down as
well. Now, he said, the process is being repeated: 'After three months of
stability, bond prices are headed down again in a second dip that will take
equity prices with it.'
Hong Kong underperformed for the second week in succession. Last week's fall
was directly linked to growing fears of an interest rate rise in the US,
since the US and Hong Kong dollars are linked, but investors were also
inhibited by the withdrawal of the five Jardine group companies from the
local Hang Seng index, ahead of their imminent delisting from the exchange.

policies inhibit general trading

<TEXT>
Stocks drifted lower in thin trading, with most participants sitting on the
sidelines,
The Nikkei 225 average eased 19.31 to 19,814.36 after a three-day weekend;
Tokyo markets were closed on Friday for a Japanese national holiday. Small
early gains lifted the key index to a high of 19,922.4; the day's low was
19,780.5.
Declines outscored advances by 526 to 467, with 193 issues unchanged. Volume
fell to an estimated 250m shares from the 353.7m traded last Thursday. Most
traders were cautious over foreign exchange movements. Adding to market
uncertainty was the looming Friday deadline for the imposition of Super 301
trade sanctions by the US.
The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 index inched ahead 0.22 to 290.07, while
first-section Topix stocks closed at 1,585.21, up 0.99 from Thursday.
The second section index receded 9.44 to 2,237.02, with an estimated 7.25m
shares changing hands. Japan Telecom, widely regarded as a market indicator
ahead of the upcoming listing of Japan Tobacco on October 27, continued to
decline. Listed on the second section, the stock fell Y100,000 to Y4.05m,
its lowest value since listing on September 6. DDI, another second-section
telecom stock, dipped Y8,000 to Y871,000, but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
remained flat at Y885,000.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index finished 0.89 firmer at 1,297.37.
A Sunday newspaper report that electronic parts maker Hosiden will spend
Y60bn to build a large thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD)
plant in Kobe, western Japan, raised Hosiden shares Y80 to Y2,280. Hosiden
supplies all LCD cockpit display panels used in Boeing 777 aircraft.
Other high-technology issues lost ground. Toshiba slipped Y4 to Y747, NEC
was Y10 softer at Y1,170 and Oki Electric shed Y20 to Y760.
In Osaka the OSE average gained 28.18 points at 22,101.53 in volume of 60.8m
shares.
Roundup
Worries about the outlook for interest rates after today's US Federal Open
Market Committee meeting were an inhibition to trading in some Pacific Rim
markets.
Bombay opened as normal but brokers refused to transact business, in
sympathy with 10 brokers whose offices were gutted in the fire on Friday.
The exchange is expected to reopen today.
SEOUL made headway after Friday's consolidation to end at another all-time
high as early strength in financial and banking shares spread to other
issues. However, profit-taking in primary blue chips limited the advance.
The composite index closed 7.71 stronger at 1,045.12, just off a record
intraday peak of 1,047.34 set in the morning.
The sub-group index for banks rose 11.26, or 1.6 per cent, to a fresh high
for the year of 696.06, but profit-taking was seen in last week's best
performers.
Samsung slipped Won1,900 to Won138,100 and Posco declined by Won500 to
Won86,600.
TAIPEI put on 1.5 per cent amid late demand for banking stocks. The weighted
index finished 103.74 higher at 7,025.76, although turnover was slow at
TDollars 48.4bn.
Financials reversed early falls and supported the market. Chang Hwa Bank put
on TDollars 8 at TDollars 209, First Commercial Bank TDollars 9 at TDollars
205 and Hwa Nan Bank TDollars 9 at TDollars 229.
Closed-end funds also attracted buying on hopes that they would be converted
into open-end funds soon. Kwang Hua Fortune, the most active issue, climbed
20 cents to TDollars 13.15.
HONG KONG saw modest gains, although the market remained overshadowed by
concern about the outlook for US interest rates.
The Hang Seng index was up 11.16 at 9,643.63 after an early high of
9,700.92, as turnover improved to HKDollars 3.4bn from Friday's HKDollars
3.07bn.
Among the seven stocks which will enter the Hang Seng index later this year
and early in 1995, Sino Land moved forward 45 cents to HKDollars 8.75 and
Oriental Press put on 40 cents at HKDollars 5.30.
Stocks which had been widely expected to join the main index, but failed to
make last Friday's list, fell sharply. First Pacific dropped 47.5 cents, or
8.4 per cent, to HKDollars 5.15, Guoco Group lost HKDollars 1.60, or 4.1 per
cent, at HKDollars 37.60 and Henderson Investment shed 37.5 cents, or 5.1
per cent, to HKDollars 6.975.
Lai Sun and Winsor both declined steeply after the announcement that they
would be removed from the index, following their underperformance of the
market. Lai Sun retreated HKDollars 1.10, or 6.9 per cent, to HKDollars
14.90 and Winsor was 60 cents, or 5.4 per cent, lower at HKDollars 10.55.
On the opposite tack, shipping company IMC picked up 42.5 cents, or 7.7 per
cent, to HKDollars 5.95 on institutional buying following signs of recovery
in the industry.
SYDNEY edged forward in quiet conditions ahead of today's FOMC meeting. The
All Ordinaries index closed 2.3 higher at 2,030.0 as rises by golds and some
industrial stocks offset falls in finance and some resource sectors.
WELLINGTON eased, with the threat of higher interest rates acting as a
disincentive. The NZSE-40 Capital index finished 4.73 off at 2,075.80 in
very low turnover of NZDollars 19.49m.
SINGAPORE was softer, although prices showed some resilience and the Straits
Times Industrial index closed only 2.24 down at 2,299.81. Over-the-counter
Malaysian shares were dampened by heavy profit-taking in the afternoon,
after an unexpectedly strong start.
Yeo Hiap Seng Malaysia lost 45 cents at SDollars 8.45 after the Malaysian
authorities' move to calm recent feverish speculation by making it a
'designated security'.
KUALA LUMPUR was worried about interest rates and the composite index gave
up 13.14 at 1,157.18.
Against the trend, Econstates and Actacorp, which resumed trading after
recent suspensions, were sharply higher. Econstates rose MDollars 2.65, or
67.9 per cent, to MDollars 6.55 on the purchase of a port developer which
has been awarded the privatised Klang West Port.
Actacorp climbed MDollars 1.75, or 29.4 per cent, to MDollars 7.70 on news
that a businessman has bought a 26.6 per cent stake.
MANILA was pulled down by declining blue chips, and the composite index lost
15.16 at 2,944.20. Heavy selling was seen in a number of issues as investors
cashed in profits, including Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust, which fell 35 pesos,
or 4.2 per cent, to 795 pesos.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark loses ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark was weaker against the dollar, the pound and the Swiss franc
yesterday as markets took cover following electoral results in the state of
Bavaria, writes Motoko Rich.
The failure of the Free Democrats, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior partner,
to achieve the 5 per cent vote necessary for a place in the state parliament
unsettled market expectations for the October 16 German federal poll.
Such nervousness allowed the dollar to rise against the D-Mark, while
growing market acceptance of a likely compromise in the US-Japan trade talks
also gave the US currency a boost against the yen.
In London the dollar finished at DM1.5551, up from a Friday close of
DM1.5443. Against the yen it closed at Y98.70 from Y97.705. It ended in New
York at DM1.5535 and Y98.75.
Sterling was also firmer against the D-Mark, though slightly weaker against
the dollar. Against the D-Mark, the pound closed at DM2.4482 from DM2.4380.
Against the dollar, it finished in London at Dollars 1.5743 from Dollars
1.5788.
The Italian lira rose against the D-Mark in late trading as Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi and leaders of his coalition parties reached an accord on
the shape of Italy's 1995 deficit-cutting budget.
The Free Democratic party, the junior partner in Mr Kohl's government, only
achieved 2.8 per cent of the Bavarian vote, far short of the 5 per cent
needed to guarantee it a place in the state parliament.
Markets were spooked by this result because it foreshadowed the federal poll
next month, when a similar setback for the FDP could force Mr Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union to forge a coalition with the Social Democratic
party, a prospect the markets do not favour.
The D-Mark was generally softer against other European currencies. Against
the Swiss franc, it closed in London at SFr0.828 from SFr0.831. Against the
French franc, it finished at FFr3.417 from FFr3.419.
Mr Steve Hannah, economist at IBJ, noted that most national polls are
showing the FDP with 8.5 per cent support for its bid to join the national
parliament. 'So no-one is panicking yet,' he said.
The weakness of the D-Mark helped the dollar to turn in a fairly strong
performance. Against the yen, it breached the Y98.50 level for the first
time in a week.
Although analysts were reluctant to pinpoint any one factor as the
motivation for the dollar's improvement, Mr Hannah said the markets were
beginning to realise that trade negotiations between the US and Japan do not
hinge on this Friday's deadline.
'The markets are beginning to realise that even if the Japanese are named
for engaging in unfair practices in some areas, it would not necessarily
mean a wholesale trade war or that the US will start talking the dollar
down,' he added.
Today's meeting of the FOMC, the policy-making arm of the US Federal
Reserve, should provide most of the focus for the foreign exchange markets,
as expectations are divided on a possible interest rate rise.
Sterling continued its firming trend against the D-Mark, piercing the
resistance level of DM2.45 early in the day. Although it has not yet
consolidated its gains, analysts believe it will move upwards.
The markets are bullish on the pound due to confidence in the monetary
policy of UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke. 'He has never denied the idea of
another base rate rise in the future,' said Mr David Cocker, economist at
Chemical Bank. 'That is seen as very positive by the markets, especially as
he gives the impression of being mildly pre-emptive.'
He said the pound's slight fall against the dollar was primarily a result of
profit-taking.
The lira was boosted by a coalition agreement in Italy over the 1995 budget.
Although no details were revealed, the tone of the announcement suggested
that the government intended to shape the budget to cut the deficit.
Against the D-Mark, the lira finished at L1006 from L1009, and was trading
as high as L1004.5 after the close of the London markets.
Canadian short-term forward interest rates fell against US rates for the
first time since 1984, demonstrating the market confidence in the Canadian
dollar.
Since the Quebec election, when Bloc Quebecois, the party which promotes the
separatist cause, won by an unexpectedly narrow margin, the markets have
been shrugging off the risk of Quebec's secession from Canada, giving a
boost to the Canadian dollar and allowing the markets to discount lower rate
rises.
The UK December short sterling contract finished unchanged at 93.19,
discounting a short-term interest rate of 6.81 per cent.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds
561m after revising its shortage forecast to Pounds 550m. Overnight rates
traded between 2 and 5 per cent.
German call money was quoted between 4.25 and 4.50 per cent.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures rally as Brazilian
drought continues - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures closed higher on the London Commodity Exchange yesterday,
having rallied after a Brazilian official suggested that continuing drought
meant that his country's 1995-96 coffee crop would be even lower than the
15m bags (60kg each) to which it was estimated to have been reduced by
frosts in June and July.
The November position ended at Dollars 4,080 a tonne, up Dollars 13 from
Friday but Dollars 16 below the day's high.
'We are very worried,' said Mr Frederico Robalinho, secretary at the
Brazilian trade and industry ministry. 'The drought hasn't stopped. We have
to wait for the rain to arrive. We are expecting rain every day.' He was
speaking to reporters during a break in a meeting of the International
Coffee Organisation in London.
At the London Metal Exchange base metals prices continued to drift lower in
afternoon trading after an earlier spike in the COPPER market to a fresh
26-month high of Dollars 2,570 a tonne, for delivery in three months, met
profit-taking and resistance. The price closed at Dollars 2,561.75, down
Dollars 8.75 on the day and lost further ground in after hours trading.
Dealers suggested that copper was still poised to head higher, though it
would have to break resistance around Dollars 2,575 to spark a move towards
Dollars 2,600 a tonne.
ALUMINIUM prices remained under pressure from trade selling, though
technical support and speculative buying appeared near Dollars 1,600 a tonne
for three months metal, which closed at Dollars 1,607.50, down Dollars 24.
NICKEL remained boxed in a narrow range, closing Dollars 20 lower at Dollars
6,527.50 a tonne.
Precious metals turned firmer in Europe during the afternoon after a bout of
short-selling ahead of the New York opening took markets lower.
GOLD closed at Dollars 395.95 a troy ounce, down just 5 cents and well off
the day's low. Weekend news that Britain was to propose IMF gold sales to
help ease poor-nation debt sparked short-selling in the early afternoon.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US producer says aluminium
demand exceeds expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium industry is enjoying a time of extraordinary demand growth,
according to Mr Lloyd O'Carroll, corporate economist at Reynolds Metals, the
second-largest US aluminium group. He suggests that western world
consumption is set to rise by 7 per cent in 1994 to 16.7m tonnes.
Physical aluminium is being sold at very high premiums to London Metal
Exchange prices nearly everywhere in the world. 'This tells me that the
physical market is pulling the LME, rather than the LME pushing the market,'
he adds.
Mr O'Carroll says that European demand is causing the greatest surprises.
Orders for flat rolled aluminium are up 20 per cent from last year's
depressed levels and orders for extrusions are up 10 per cent. This could
easily translate into a 5 per cent rise in primary aluminium consumption in
Europe this year.
In Japan, which like Europe was expected to provide only weak or flat demand
for this year, the recovery in aluminium sales growth is proving faster than
in the previous two cyclical economic recoveries. The underlying trend is
very strong but the Japanese, conscious that they are the world's biggest
purchasers of the metal, 'are going out of their way so as not to sound too
optimistic'.
For the US, where deliveries of aluminium rose by 11 per cent in the first
half compared with a reasonably buoyant first six months in 1993, Mr
O'Carroll is predicting 10 per cent growth in demand for the full year to
7.94m tonnes.
He says aluminium sales in the US are likely to slow now because the country
is past the mid-point in the latest macro-economic cycle. But. with Europe
and Japan just starting their recoveries, the aluminium market can look
forward to strong world wide growth for the next three to five years. Mr
O'Carroll's analysis puts long-term aluminium demand growth at an annual 3
per cent to 5 per cent.
Aluminium stocks are likely to drop by 500,000 tonnes this year and by
nearly 1.5m tonnes in 1995.
Russian supply remains an enigma, says Mr O'Carroll. In 1993 aluminium
exports from Russia probably were close to 2m tonnes. However, if Russia cut
output by 300,000 tonnes, as part of its contribution to the recent trade
agreement between aluminium producing countries, it was likely that Russian
exports would be flat or down a little next year.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Lush
leaves belie disappointing sugar crop - Recent rain in the UK has encouraged
foliage growth at the expense of the beets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An old farming neighbour used to say he enjoyed growing root crops like
potatoes and sugar-beet because of the element of surprise. The value, he
would explain - the tubers and the beets - was hidden in the soil and the
farmer never quite knew what was there to harvest until the roots were
lifted.
Implied in his tongue-in-cheek comment was that it was difficult to assess
the yield of a root crop by looking at the leaves and foliage above ground
level. The old man died many years ago but his words are as true today as
they ever were and the 1994 sugar-beet crop seems likely to prove the point.
Recent heavy rain (we have had close to 8 inches over our Norfolk farm
within the last month in an area which has a long term average rainfall of
23 inches a year) has encouraged lush growth of sugar-beet leaves and a
cursory inspection might suggest excellent crops. But dig some of the roots
out of the land and it soon becomes evident that they are significantly
smaller and lighter than usual.
The problem began back in the spring. Much of the land on which sugar-beet
was to be grown remained wet and cold far longer than normal. Planting was
inevitably delayed for a few weeks beyond the optimum date and even when the
seeds were in the ground growth was retarded by low temperatures. That meant
that, in many cases, full leaf cover was not achieved by the critical date
of the end of June. Then followed the July heatwave, which dehydrated the
plants to the extent, in worst cases, that leaves fell flat on to the baking
soil and literally cooked in the sun. But not all the leaves were
irreparably damaged. August rains perked them up and September downpours
encouraged the plants to grow new green leaves.
Unfortunately some of the energy stored in the roots was needed to grow
these leaves. So, instead of gaining weight and sugar from the radiated
energy of autumn sunshine, as they usually do, they were obeying their
natural imperative to survive and produce seed. Sunshine has been pretty
sparse this autumn in any case and as regular samples taken by the monopoly
processor, British Sugar, have confirmed, this has resulted in an unexciting
prospect for this year's crop.
The official figures show that average root weight on the September 20 was
just 590g compared with 713g at the same time last year and a five-year
average of 661g. Sugar content was equally disappointing. This year it was
16.6 per cent compared with 17.46 per cent last year and a five-year average
of 17.92 per cent. The critical measurement of the weight of sugar per root
showed that this year's level on September 20 was 97.9g, against 124.5g last
year and a five-year average of 118.5g.
It is possible for these weights and sugar percentages to improve,
especially if the weather for the rest of the autumn improves to be more
like the seasonal normal. But the reality is that in spite of British
Sugar's decision to delay the start of processing by almost two weeks in the
hope that the roots will mature, this crop can now yield no better than
average and it may well produce below that.
So, as most of Britain's sugar processing factories begin the harvesting
'campaign' later this week, the farmers who supply them already know that
returns will be down. For unlike potatoes, sugar beet are priced according
to a formula agreed by the European Union and there is no boost to the
market value if there is a shortfall in production. That, anyway, is the
case with those roots produced within so-called 'A' and 'B' quota tonnage
limits - the proportion of the crop grown on each farm that enjoys a
guaranteed price.
If a UK farmer grows more than his A and B entitlement the excess is called
'C' sugar and this has to be disposed of on world markets for whatever it
will fetch. This year, according to some sugar pundits who see further
tightening of world stocks, C sugar is likely to be worth about Pounds 20 a
tonne delivered to factories. That compares with Pounds 35 for A and B quota
beet, but, given that most production costs are covered by the A and B
element, it can still provide a worthwhile additional profit to the grower.
But, short of a weather miracle over the next few months, there will be
little C sugar this year. That is bad news for growers and for British
Sugar, as the EU quota regulations restrict the UK sugar beet industry to
producing less than half of domestic demand. This means that the rest of the
sugar consumed in Britain has to be imported - mostly from African,
Caribbean and Pacific sugar cane-producing countries under the terms of an
agreement entered into when Britain joined the European Community in 1973.
But increasing amounts are now coming in from other EU member states which
have beet production quotas massively higher than their own domestic demand.
Needless to say this has annoyed British sugar beet growers and processors
for many years. That annoyance seems set to intensify over coming weeks as
EU sugar quotas are renegotiated in Brussels for the next five years. For
while they recognise that the EU sugar surplus of some 30 per cent in years
of optimum production must be reduced, they resent the suggestion that
Britain's already inadequate quota should be reduced at all. Indeed in any
reallocation there is a strong case for the UK quota to be increased.
Moreover, campaigns have been launched by beet growers, the National
Farmers' Union, British Sugar and a farming magazine to try to ensure that
the new minister of agriculture, Mr William Waldegrave, defends and
prosecutes the British case in Brussels.
In spite of poor prospects for my own and other farmers' crops this year,
sugar beet remains of vital economic, rotational and environmental
importance on many UK farms. I very much hope the campaigns are successful.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swedish group lifts newsprint
prices 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stora of Sweden, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, will raise prices of
newsprint by 20 per cent next year following sharp increases in pulp prices
and a recovery in European demand for paper.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, president and chief executive officer, told analysts
in London that the company had achieved an increase of only 3 per cent this
year. Even after a further 20 per cent increase, 'there will still be some
way to go to reach the level of the late 1980s,' he said.
Newsprint prices have lagged behind increases for pulp and other types of
paper because negotiations with customers take place only once a year. Mr
Helgesson said prices had fallen by about 30 per cent during the severe
cyclical downturn from which the industry has been rebounding this year.
The Stora increase is in line with that proposed by other Nordic paper
groups.
Mr Helgesson declined to say whether Stora would increase pulp prices again,
after a series of rises that lifted prices by 80 per cent to Dollars 700 a
tonne this year.
But he said the fact that spot prices for pulp were higher than 'regular'
prices pointed to the likelihood of further increases. Spot prices were
consistently lower during the downturn.
The latest rise in Nordic pulp prices earlier this month was caused by
growing shortages of wood and a huge increase in demand for fine paper.
Mr Helgesson said non-integrated suppliers of fine paper in Europe 'will
obviously suffer as (pulp) prices go up,' but added: 'They've been able to
put through price increases faster than I expected'.
Stora has also just announced increases of 10 and 20 per cent for coated and
uncoated magazine paper, following 8 to 12 per cent rises for fine paper.
Despite this, he said, 'our average prices are somewhat lower than in 1993'.
The group would need to increase present capacity of 7m tonnes by at least
200,000 tonnes a year to hold its share if the market continued to grow by
3-4 per cent a year as predicted, Mr Helgesson said.
'We can do this either by building new machines or acquiring capacity and we
will see a combination of that in the future,' he said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasury gains eroded ahead of Federal
Reserve meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds dipped yesterday afternoon in cautious trading ahead of
today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 lower
at 96 17/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.794 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was unchanged at 99 17/32 , to yield 6.492 per cent.
It was a quiet session in which activity was constrained by impending
decisions on monetary policy.
Traders appeared satisfied with previous adjustments to their positions,
though no clear consensus had emerged on whether the Federal Reserve would
opt to lift interest rates at the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC)
meeting.
Some analysts argued that the strength of recent economic data, especially
August industrial production figures, would encourage the central bank to
tighten credit conditions immediately to keep ahead of inflation.
Others believed that the Fed would wait until the release of another month's
data before making its move.
The approach of the November congressional elections was a consideration
which would discourage an early rate increase, analysts said.
Amid such speculation, a shred of news suggesting economic weakness cast a
positive tone over the morning's activity.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family
homes had fallen 1.8 per cent last month to an annualised rate of 3.9m.
The data suggested that the economy was not growing as fast as some traders
had feared, though the report, viewed in isolation, was not seen as being
especially convincing.
With conviction in such short supply, the slim gains eroded as trading
slowed to a crawl during the afternoon.
European government bond prices drifted yesterday as nervous markets waited
the impact on US interest rates of today's meeting of the FOMC. Trading
volume was very low and most markets were largely unchanged on the day, with
only Italy and Spain reacting to domestic events and providing a slight rise
to relieve the torpor.
German bunds slipped in the morning but recovered to close largely
unchanged, with the December bund future around 88.94 in late trading, down
0.04 on the day.
Mr Adrian Owens, European economist at Yamaichi in London, said a key factor
in the bund market this week would be the meeting on Thursday of the
Bundesbank council.
While he said he did not expect a change in interest rates this week, he
added, 'If things continue as they are, there may be one final cut in
interest rates later this year.'
Mr Kit Juckes, at SG Warburg, said: 'The US is the driving force behind
European markets at the moment.'
UK gilt prices were unmoved yesterday as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, held their regular
meeting on monetary policy.
Few in the market expected that meeting to result in an increase in base
rates so soon after the September 12 rise of 50 basis points. Mr Ifty Islam
at Merrill Lynch said: 'They will probably agree to keep policy on hold.'
The main event in the gilt market this week after today's FOMC meeting is
likely to be the 10-year gilt auction on Wednesday. Mr Islam said he
expected to see good demand for the bonds, with the auction likely to be
covered between 1.5 and 2 times.
Yields on Italian government 10-year bonds fell by 5 basis points to 11.86
per cent yesterday on hopes of progress on pension reform, which would cut
the government deficit.
Spanish government bonds rose slightly yesterday, buoyed by the conclusion
of the budget.
Mr Simon Maggs at UBS said: 'This removes any political risk for the
foreseeable future.' The yield on the 10-year bond fell 5 basis points to
11.14 per cent.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank considers pension fund
gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is considering ways to design gilt-edged securities for
UK pension schemes which have been wound up by an insolvent employer or have
large numbers of deferred pensioners.
Impetus for the move comes partly from the expectation that many pension
schemes of insolvent UK employers will be wound up following a European
Court of Justice ruling on sex equality on Wednesday. UK schemes have been
waiting four years for the judgment.
Wound-up schemes, which do not receive contributions from members, need to
ensure they can meet the liabilities of former employees who may not retire
for many years.
Contracts to ensure that such benefits are paid are sold by insurance
companies but cost far more than pension schemes typically allocate for
deferred liabilities.
The Bank has been approached by numerous groups urging the creation of
securities for pension schemes which do not need to earn cash flow from
their investments immediately. However, once the liabilities become due,
they will need an inflation-linked investment return over a period of many
years.
One plan calls for the creation of long-term gilts issued as zero-coupon
bonds for a period of 5, 10 or 20 years. At maturity they would pay interest
at an agreed rate over, say, a 10-year period. Alternatively, they could pay
a rate equal to the retail price index or five per cent, whichever is lower.
From April 1997, all UK pension schemes will be required to increase
benefits to pensioners at that rate.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Belgium sets scene for World Bank DM
global
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Belgium launched its long-awaited D-Mark eurobond issue
yesterday, with a DM1bn offering of five-year fixed-rate bonds.
The bonds, priced to yield 25 basis points over government bonds, were sold
mainly to European investors, joint lead manager Dresdner Bank said. But
demand from retail investors is expected to increase over the next few days.
This sets the scene for the World Bank's global D-Mark offering which it
expects to launch next week, the Bank said yesterday. The deal is likely to
be a DM2bn issue of five-year fixed-rate bonds.
The offering, the World Bank's second ever global D-Mark issue, is likely to
be priced at a spread 'in the low to mid-teens' over government bonds,
officials at Morgan Stanley said yesterday.
Morgan Stanley is joint lead manager of the deal with Deutsche Bank.
The World Bank has a funding requirement of DM7bn to DM8bn for the current
fiscal year in D-Mark group currencies, which include other currencies such
as Swiss francs, Bank officials said. The fiscal year ends in July 1995.
So far this fiscal year, the World Bank has launched one issue in D-Mark
group currencies with an offering in Swiss francs worth SFr200m.
An official revealed yesterday that the Bank is now considering a second
global D-Mark offering in the first half of 1995. 'There is room now for a
second global deal in the first half of 1995,' he said. 'We came now with
this offering in order not to crowd out that next issue.'
The official said that there had been significant interest in the current
planned offering in a number of European markets, in North America and in
Asia.
At the short-end of the French franc sector, the Abbey National launched a
FFr2bn issue of two-year bonds, offering a yield of 7.25 per cent.
This follows its decision last week to postpone its proposed global dollar
offering due to volatile market conditions.
Mr Gareth Jones, Abbey National's treasurer, said: 'There is now some
appetite for bonds after the sell-off over the last couple of weeks, enough
to support a relatively small deal such as this, but hardly enough to
support a global offering.'
'Abbey National is becoming an increasingly well-known name in this sector,
and we have a positive outlook for French franc rates since we believe there
is going to be another cut in German interest rates,' said an official at
lead manager Banque Paribas.
The current deal is the Abbey National's third offering in French francs so
far this year.
San Miguel, the Philippines brewing and food company and the country's
largest manufacturing enterprise, launched its debut eurobond offering with
a Dollars 115m issue of bonds due April 2000.
The bonds, which were priced to yield 190 basis points over US Treasuries,
were sold 40 per cent into the US, 35 per cent into Europe and 25 per cent
into Asia, lead manager JP Morgan said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp seeks ruling on
Pearson convertibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, the media group, is taking legal action against merchant
bank J Henry Schroder Wagg over preference shares and convertible bonds
issued by News.
The dispute stemmed from confusion over the conversion terms of the issues,
which were convertible into shares owned by News in Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times.
Several investors, including Schroder, incurred significant losses and asked
for the matter to be brought to the City Disputes Panel but News chose to
take the matter to the High Court to obtain a 'declaratory judgment' ruling
the bank has no grounds for compensation.
Schroder does not consider the courts to be the appropriate forum for the
dispute and wants the matter to be brought before the disputes panel.
News Corp said that it 'decided to take steps . . . to have the matter
resolved by the most appropriate and comprehensive means and, accordingly,
has commenced proceedings against a claimant whose claim raises many issues
common to those of other claimants for a declaration that it has no
liability in respect of that claim'.
The Schroder claim was selected 'as suitable subject for proceedings . . .
because it raises more issues common to claims made by investors than any
other claim'.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: British Gas delists in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock exchange was presented yesterday with fresh evidence of
declining competitiveness when two more blue chip foreign companies
announced that they would delist.
British Gas and Scott Paper, the US personal paper products group, yesterday
asked to be delisted in Tokyo from December 31.
They cited the low volume of trading in their shares and the high costs of
maintaining a Japanese listing as the reasons. A Tokyo listing costs three
to four times as much as other leading markets, at Y15m to Y20m (Dollars
153,523-Dollars 204,697) a year, mainly for translating reports for Japanese
permits and observing regulations.
The companies' decision will bring to 17 the number of foreign companies to
have moved off the Tokyo stock market since the turn of the year, leaving 93
foreigners still listed.
At its peak three years ago, the number of foreign businesses listed in
Tokyo stood at 127.
British Gas, which received a Tokyo listing in 1988, said its move was part
of its effort to cut costs worldwide. Maintaining a listing in Japan was
more complicated than elsewhere, it added.
Scott Paper said it had no need to raise equity capital in Tokyo.
The exodus of foreign companies, plus heavy staff cuts among foreign banks
in Tokyo over the past year, has underlined how Tokyo's capital markets are
losing competitiveness to fast-developing financial centres in Asia and
rivals in the US and Europe.

<TEXT>
Austereo, the Australian radio group, and the entertainment group Village
Roadshow, which were involved in a hostile takeover bid last week, have
agreed to merge their radio networks, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
In place of its hostile bid, Village will acquire at least 50.1 per cent of
Austereo in two stages via a placement and a partial bid at ADollars 0.55
(USDollars 0.40) a share higher than Village's first offer.
Austereo will issue 52.5m shares to Village and Village will offer ADollars
1.75 a share for 20 per cent of each Austereo's shareholder's existing
stake.
Village Roadshow's original takeover offer for Austereo was ADollars 1.20 a
share, but the market soon moved above this level and on Friday the shares
closed at ADollars 1.35.
Austereo shares were suspended yesterday at the company's request.
The Austereo share issue, together with Village Roadshow's current 12.8 per
cent stake, will take Village's shareholding to 40.8 per cent of Austereo's
enlarged capital.
Under the deal, Austereo will purchase Village's Triple M radio stations in
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, and may acquire Triple M in Perth
by means of the share issue.
The Triple M stations will join the current Austereo network comprising
seven stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra.
The merger is subject to clearance by the anti-monopoly Trade Practices
Commission and approval by Austereo shareholders.

Shougang Concord International Enterprises Company, the mainland metals
conglomerate listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has reported a surge in
first-half net profits of 920 per cent to HKDollars 103.19m (USDollars
13.32m).
The profits were struck on a turnover of HKDollars 2.9bn, 262 per cent up on
the HKDollars 805.4m of the same period last year.
Mr Zhou Beifang, chairman, said the metals trading business performed
impressively but was held back by construction materials, where keen
competition prompted losses.
Basic earnings per share rose 176.7 per cent to 8.3 cents. Shareholders are
to receive an interim dividend of 2.5 cents.
Shougang Concord Grand, formerly Kader Investment and about to come under
the control of Shougang International, recorded a fall of 35 per cent in
first-half net earnings to HKDollars 20.5m from HKDollars 31.6m. It is
recommending a dividend of 1.5 cents. Earnings per share, on a fully diluted
basis, fell 37 per cent to 2.8 cents from 4.43 cents.

Amoy Properties, the property investment company which joins the Hang Seng
Index as a constituent stock in November, has reported a 24 per cent rise in
net profits to HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for the year to June 30,
from HKDollars 1.2bn the previous year.
The company also proposes an increase in dividend.
The parent company, Hang Lung Development - the property development and
hotel company controlled by the Chan family - saw profits rise 26 per cent
to HKDollars 2bn over the same period, from HKDollars 1.6bn last year.
The results were broadly in line with market expectations, with Hang Lung's
earnings at the lower end of forecasts.
Mr Ronnie Chan, group chairman, said Amoy spent an aggregate HKDollars 4bn
in adding four quality properties to its portfolio in the year under review.
The company also holds a 70 per cent stake in a project led by Hang Lung to
develop a 211,300 sq m commercial and office complex in Shanghai.
Taken on a fully diluted basis, Amoy's earnings per share climbed 20 per
cent to 62.3 cents from 52 cents. Directors are recommending a final
dividend of 27.5 cents, 17 per cent up on the 23.5 cents paid out this time
last year.
Hang Lung has added a total buildable space of around 107,300 sq m to its
land bank in Hong Kong, which Mr Chan says is sufficient for development up
to 1997. The price tag on this additional land was HKDollars 2.1bn.
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose 20 per cent to 153.4 cents
from 128.3 cents and shareholders are to receive a dividend of 43 cents - an
improvement of 18 per cent on the previous year's 36.5 cents payout - as
well as a bonus issue of warrants.
The one-for-10 bonus issue will entitle the holder to subscribe HKDollars 16
for shares from January 1 to October 31, 1997.
The share price closed at HKDollars 14.2 on Friday, before the results were
announced.

writes David Gardner in Brussels.
Turnover in the same period rose from BFr123.3bn to BFr130.5bn, largely due
to expanding sales in the group's international electricity and gas
business.
Tractebel said that it expected results for the full year to be 'at least

It also expected to maintain 'at least' the level of last year's dividend.

<TEXT>
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive of Coles Myer, the Australian retailer,
said he prefered the option of cancelling a further 11.45 per cent of the
company's shares rather than sell the equity to a third party, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
The question of what to do with the stake arises from Coles's decision to
buy back the 21.45 per cent interest in its shares which has been held by
Kmart, the Michigan-based retailer. Coles last week gained shareholder
approval for the ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 920m) deal.
The transaction will take place in two parts. Coles will buy back and cancel
129m shares, or just under 10 per cent of the equity, for ADollars 586.9m.
But it has yet to resolve the question of what to do with the second tranche
of Kmart shares, covering 11.45 per cent of its stock.
Both tranches are being bought back by Coles at ADollars 4.55 a share, a
substantial premium to the company's closing price on Friday, which saw the
stock end 4 cents lower at ADollars 3.98.

venture deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Normandy Poseidon, the Australian gold producer, and Bureau de Recherches
Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM), the French government-controlled mining
group, have announced plans to form one of the world's most diverse resource
ventures through transactions involving almost ADollars 740m (USDollars
544m).
The deal represents the first major overseas expansion by Normandy and
follows a recent decision by the French Government to merge its mining
division with a privately-owned group with a view to building an
international mining house.
It also calls into question the long-standing relationship between Normandy
and Anglo American Corporation of South Africa which in the past Mr Robert
Champion de Crespigny, Normandy's chairman, has described as 'very special'.
Anglo recently transferred its near-20 per cent holding in Normandy to its
offshore operating arm, Minorco, which also has ambitions to expand
globally. Although Normandy and Minorco will find themselves competing for
international assets, Minorco welcomed the BRGM deal and said: 'The world is
a big place. We hope relationships are good enough for (Minorco and
Normandy) to work side by side rather than in competition.'
Normandy's deal with BRGM will create a group with mining and exploration
interests in Europe, Africa and South America and also involve BRGM taking a
9 per cent interest in Normandy, which has annual Australian gold production
of more than 1m oz.
The centrepiece will be the formation of a new company, La Source Compagnie
Miniere SAS (LaSource), controlled 60 per cent by Normandy and 40 per cent
by BRGM.
The Normandy group will earn its interest in LaSource by paying ADollars
118m, while BRGM will contribute assets valued at around ADollars 338m and
liabilities of ADollars 50m.
Other major components of the deal include:
Poseidon Gold, a Normandy associate, will pay a further ADollars 130m for a
37 per cent share in Company Miniere International Or SA (Mine Or SA), which
will include all BRGM's gold interests. La Source will control 40 per cent
of this company and BRGM 23 per cent.
Mine Or SA will purchase, for about ADollars 43m to be satisfied by a
promissory note, companies controlling Eurogold Madenclik, a Turkish gold
operation, and other resource interests in Greece and Bulgaria.
On completion, BRGM will subscribe for 47.6m Normandy shares at ADollars
2.19, representing about 9 per cent of the company's capital, and raising
ADollars 105m. The price compares with a close of ADollars 2.55, up 5 cents,
for Normandy shares on Australian stock exchanges yesterday.
The deals are subject to government and shareholder approvals, and possibly
some pre-emptive rights. The contractual completion date is June 30 next
year.
Mr Champion de Crespigny said the transaction represented a quantum leap in
offshore expansion for Normandy. The new venture would provide access to
exploration ground and potential for further acquisitions.
Its assets would include an iron ore project in Guinea, a mineral sands
project in Cameroon and control of the Yanacocha gold mine in Peru.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Tokyo relaxes rules to allow
derivatives trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday took a small step on its long road to financial deregulation
by permitting banks to trade in two forms of financial derivatives.
The finance ministry's decision to allow forward rate and forward exchange
agreements from next Monday enacts a proposal included in the most recent
government deregulation package in June - under pressure from Japanese
commercial banks.
This will be of only moderate practical use to banks operating in Japan, but
it does bring highly-regulated Tokyo more in line with other financial
centres in this specialised area of financial derivatives.
It means banks and their customers will be allowed to trade foreign exchange
and fixed interest instruments outside the regulated futures exchanges,
giving them the scope to set agreed interest and currency rates.
Until recently, the finance ministry was reluctant to permit this kind of
contract on the grounds that it was close to gambling for cash prizes,
forbidden under Japanese law.
But the ministry is now becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of
securities and banking business leaving Tokyo for cheaper and less regulated
markets in Asia and Europe.
This concern has yet to translate into a desire to make Tokyo's capital
markets as free from official regulation as New York or London. Accordingly,
deregulation of the instruments concerned will be only partial, as is the
case in many other financial services.
Banks wanting to trade the new instruments will have to reveal essential
details to the ministry, such as the currency, the parties to the contract,
and the method and period of settlement. They must make regular reports to
the ministry on the conditions of transactions, said an official.
Parties able to take part in the transactions will include commercial banks,
securities houses, companies with credit ratings, and companies listed on
the main stock exchange or over-the-counter market, said the ministry.

McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday announced
the appointment of Mr Harry Stonecipher, chairman of Sundstrand, the
Illinois-based aircraft and industrial products company, as its new
president and chief executive, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Mr Stonecipher, 58, takes over from Mr John McDonnell, who will remain as
chairman. He joins McDonnell at a critical time for the company, which will
have to navigate choppy waters as the domestic defence industry reshapes
itself in the wake of a sharp contraction in US military spending. As part
of that restructuring, several of McDonnell's largest competitors have
joined forces recently in billion-dollar mergers, including Lockheed and
Martin Marrietta, Grumman and Northrop.
Among his more immediate tasks, Mr Stonecipher will have to persuade the
Pentagon and Congress not to reduce orders of the C-17 military transport
plane, and decide whether to sell McDonnell's missile business.
Investors and analysts appeared to welcome the appointment, with buyers
bidding up McDonnell's shares Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 113 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

overall information technology support, including process re-engineering and
systems development, through an outsourcing agreement. EDS expects to
generate revenues of Dollars 400m to Dollars 700m with the agreement.
'Our alliance will enable each company to take advantage of the other's core
competencies to help them maintain competitive advantage in their
industries,' said Mr Gary Anderson, EDS group executive for high-tech
manufacturing.
Moore, a leader in the design and production of printed business forms, aims
to reposition itself as a provider of information handling services. The
company said that it would take advantage of EDS' business process
re-engineering services to speed up the transformation.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Chevron upbeat on Tengiz project
 -The Kazakhstan scheme would virtually double the group's oil reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chevron, the US oil company, says it had no plans to pull out of its Dollars
20bn Tengiz oil project in Kazakhstan in spite of repeated failures to reach
an agreement on an oil export pipeline through Russia.
Mr Ken Derr, chairman, said that negotiations were continuing on the
proposed pipeline, 'but we have not been able to reach a satisfactory
agreement on the financial exposure' of the various parties in the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium.
This has not undermined Chevron's support for the Tengiz project, on which
it has spent Dollars 600m. Mr Derr said Tengiz was 'a one shot opportunity
to make a strategic, long-term investment' that would virtually double the
company's oil reserves.
The positions of Chevron and the Kazakh government, the joint developers of
the field, were 'completely compatible' according to Mr Derr. They have,
however, been unable to agree financial terms with Russia and the Oman Oil
Company, the other two consortium members. Mr Derr was optimistic, however,
that a deal would emerge 'sooner rather than later'.
Asked about recent statements from Moscow questioning the legality of
western oil deals in the former Soviet republics bordering the Caspian Sea,
Mr Derr agreed that Russia was taking 'more than a passing interest' in the
region.
But he believes it is in Russia's interest to see the development of
petroleum reserves in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
That was because of the substantial pipeline revenues it would receive and
the economic stability which oil development would bring to the region.
He denied that Chevron had been rash to book Tengiz reserves without a
guaranteed export outlet. Only 1bn of the 3bn barrels of Tengiz reserves
attributable to Chevron under the 40-year deal had been booked. He said 1bn
barrels could be exported over the life of the project through swap deals
with Russia even if no dedicated pipeline materialised.
In recent weeks Chevron has increased its Tengiz exports to 50,000 to 60,000
barrels a day, almost double the original quota. But that is half of the
130,000 b/d capacity which Chevron will have in place early next year and
well below the planned peak of 700,000 b/d.
Mr Derr said Chevron's financial performance was likely to improve in the
second half of the year after a disappointing first, in which low crude oil
prices and operating problems at US refineries took their toll.
The sale of some of Chevron's oldest refineries and a Dollars 1bn
improvement programme at refineries in its home base of California would
place downstream operations in a 'very competitive position' by the end of
next year, he said.
Chevron's future, he added, 'lies in the international exploration and
production business' because so much of the US was off limits to oil
companies.
But the company saw no reason to split its international E&amp;P business from
its domestic operations.
They were already separated internally, said Mr Derr, and the combination
gave the company a 'built-in balance'.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Air France under pressure to
reduce stake in Sabena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sabena is seeking to pressure Air France into reducing or selling its
minority stake in the Belgian state-owned carrier to enable the formation of
partnerships with other interested airlines.
Sabena confirmed yesterday that Delta, American Airlines, Swissair and KLM
had expressed an interest in buying a share of the company. Under an
alliance formed in 1992, Air France owns two thirds of Finacta, a Belgian
holding company which has a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena.
Mr Elio di Rupo, the Belgian transport and communications minister, and Mr
Pierre Godfroid, president of Sabena, are examining the findings of a report
assessing the relationship between the two airlines. They are unlikely to
comment on the report, carried out by Lazard Freres, the French bank, before
the middle of next month.
'It is clear that we can't stand still in this period of rapid transition of
the aviation world,' Sabena said yesterday. 'If we do, we will lose terrain
to our competitors.'
Air France said that it had not yet received the report from Lazard and that
it did not intend to sell its stake in the Belgian airline. 'We are in
Sabena and we will stay there,' the French state-owned carrier stated.
Air France officials said that they had performed their duty as a
shareholder in Sabena, completing the fourth and final BFr1bn (Dollars 31m)
payment for its investment in July. The payment was the subject of
uncertainty given the financial constraints facing Air France, which
suffered losses of FFr8.48bn (Dollars 1.6bn) last year.
The French airline said that the report commissioned from Lazard is aimed at
presenting an analysis of the performance and prospects of the alliance. The
partnership has brought co-operation in several areas, including the
co-ordination of flights between Paris and Brussels, shared agencies in some
cities and co-operation on air miles schemes.
Industry observers said that Sabena was seeking to forge new partnerships in
an attempt to strengthen its international operations. Both Sabena and
Swissair have code-sharing agreements with Delta under which they link their
route networks on booking systems. The airlines plan a joint service between
Chicago and Brussels from November and co-operation in areas such as cargo
and passenger handling. Analysts believe the agreements could herald a
deeper strategic partnership between the airlines.

Nextel Communications, which aims to create a US-wide wireless
communications system, has announced plans to acquire American Mobile
Systems for stock in a deal valued at about Dollars 78m.
Last year Nextel reached agreement to acquire up to 61 per cent of AMS for
cash and certain assets. The restructuring of the agreement into a non-cash
transaction follows the cancellation of MCI's plans to acquire a 17 per cent
stake in Nextel for Dollars 1.3bn.
The previous agreement between Nextel and AMS will be terminated when the
companies enter into a definitive merger agreement.
Nextel is pressing ahead with plans to create a nationwide wireless
communications service combining voice, data, paging and radio dispatch. It
recently expanded its services in California to cover San Francisco,
Sacramento and Los Angeles.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Chrysler unit adds lawsuit to
Castor pile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The pile of lawsuits surrounding Castor Holdings, the Montreal-based
property finance group which collapsed in 1992, has grown further with a
CDollars 200m (USDollars 149m) claim by Chrysler's Canadian subsidiary
against a Toronto-based trust company which acted as custodian for
Chrysler's pension funds.
Chrysler Canada's pension fund was the biggest single creditor of Castor,
which was created by Mr Wolfgang Stoltzenberg, the German-Canadian
financier, as a tax-sheltered vehicle for European investors to share in the
1980s North American property boom. Many of Castor's investments were in
high-risk second and third mortgages.
Castor's creditors have submitted claims of about CDollars 1.3bn against the
estate. However, the chances of them retrieving anything are negligible.
The creditors and Castor's bankruptcy trustee have also launched numerous
legal proceedings, notably against Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Castor's auditors. The
claims against Coopers total more than CDollars 900m.
Chrysler Canada claims that National Trust is responsible for losses
totalling CDollars 180m which were suffered by its pension fund in Castor's
collapse. National said yesterday, however, that all investment decisions
relating to Castor were taken by senior Chrysler employees. It said that
Chrysler also made direct corporate investments in Castor.
Besides the claims against Coopers, the bankruptcy trustee is also suing Mr
Stoltzenberg and Castor's other directors. According to the trustee, the
directors should be held liable for a dividend declared less than a year
before Castor collapsed.
All the actions are being vigorously defended. Coopers has submitted a list
of 492 'particulars' on which it wants further information. But the courts
have so far allowed it to proceed with only a fraction of the queries.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Court allows ousting of Wallace
McCain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A New Brunswick court has allowed one faction of Canada's feuding McCain
family, which controls the McCain frozen food and beverage empire, to oust
Mr Wallace McCain as the group's president and joint chief executive.
The court decision follows three years of wrangling between Mr McCain and
his brother Harrison over who should succeed them as McCain Foods' chief
executive officer, and over the future direction of the multinational
company.
McCain Foods has 68 plants in North America, Europe and Australasia. It
reported sales of CDollars 2.7bn (USDollars 2.0bn) last year.
The two brothers, who are both in their mid-60s, founded the company 38
years ago. Their relationship, however, has been marked by lawsuits and
public insults since Wallace angered Harrison by tipping one of his sons as
the group's next chief executive.
A majority of McCain family shareholders decided earlier this month to give
Wallace the title of deputy chairman. Harrison would remain sole chief
executive until an outsider was recruited.
Wallace, who owns some one-third of McCain Foods' shares, sought an
injunction to prevent the decision being carried out.
However, Mr Justice Creaghan said that 'while it is true that Wallace McCain
has made a significant if not essential contribution to the success of the
company in the past, that is not to say that the company cannot successfully
operate in the present without guidance from (him) acting as a co-CEO.'
Wallace McCain has launched a separate lawsuit which seeks to have McCain
Foods and its holding company restructured. The restructuring would include
a public offering of about 20 per cent of the McCain family's shares. But
this proposal has so far been rejected by Harrison McCain and other family
members, mainly the children of two other brothers who died.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group, yesterday announced the
collapse of plans to merge its health and beauty businesses with Wheaton,
the privately-owned US packaging group.
The planned merger, announced in June, would have created the world's
largest beauty and healthcare packaging concern with annual sales of FFr5bn
(Dollars 940m). It failed because of difficulties in the past few weeks,
said CarnaudMetalbox.
'After extensive discussions we have been unable to resolve some
differences,' said Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman of the Franco-British group. He
said the decision not to pursue the merger had been amicable and joint
development projects between the two companies remained possible.
The failure is thought to have centred on reservations by some of Wheaton's
shareholders about their level of control of the 50-50 joint venture.
Virtually all of Wheaton's shares are held by relatives of the family which
founded the group. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr Hintz was to be
chairman of the joint venture, while Mr Bob Veghte, from Wheaton, was to be
chief executive officer.
CarnaudMetalbox said it was disappointed by the collapse, which it described
as an attractive strategic move. The aim was to strengthen its position with
cosmetic, pharmaceutical and perfume manufacturers and to provide a broader
geographical presence.
The two companies said they had sought to derive benefits from pooling
research resources and technical know-how and from expanding their
operations in south-east Asia.
CarnaudMetalbox said it remained committed to developing its health and
beauty packaging businesses.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metall shares tumble 11% to 1994
low
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Metallgesellschaft fell further yesterday amid continuing concern
over the financial state of the ailing German industrial company and US
comments about the handling last year of its controversial oil losses.
As the share price fell by DM15.80, or nearly 11 per cent, to DM133.20
(Dollars 86.40) - a new low for 1994 and the lowest for many years -
Deutsche Bank denied speculation that it and other banks involved in the
company's rescue (such as Dresdner Bank) were cutting their shareholdings.
Deutsche Bank, a leading creditor as well as shareholder, denied US reports
about an alleged investigation by US authorities of the bank's role.
Deutsche Bank North America said in response to US press reports about an
investigation by the New York district attorney's office that it had not
been contacted by its officials.
Last night the attorney's office said it was inquiring into 'activities in
the US by several companies related to Metallgeselleschaft'. No charges had
been filed.
The reports centre on allegations that Deutsche Bank may, in the latter
stages, have become involved in the management of Metallgeselleschaft's
controversial US oil business, carried out through MG Corporation.
This would be against US law; Deutsche Bank said the oil expert hired to
sort out the futures contracts had never been paid by the bank.
Metallgesellschaft said it had no explanation for the continued drop in the
shares. Three weeks ago, the shares fell sharply to around DM180 on reports
of moves to reduce the share capital.
The deterioration in Metallgesellschaft's share price could also be a
response to US articles suggesting its losses on oil futures trading could
have been diminished if that business had not been liquidated so quickly.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: IMF wants tougher hedge fund
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stronger requirements for hedge funds and other investors to disclose large
trades in government bonds could help prevent manipulation of smaller
markets, according to a study by the International Monetary Fund.
The study of trends in international capital markets argues the lack of
regular information on position-taking in bond markets makes it hard to
determine the impact of hedge funds, or detect manipulation.
Although it says there is no evidence that hedge funds, which may have
capital of up to Dollars 100bn, collude to move prices, it points out that
they 'often seem to react similarly to a given set of market opportunities'.
The study says that information could be 'particularly useful in the smaller
government securities markets, where the action of a set of placers is
likely to have a larger potential impact on prices'.
Hedge funds have attracted controversy since their role in the 1992 European
exchange rate crisis, and the study analyses a number of regulatory concerns
over their activities.
It finds no clear evidence that the 800 to 900 hedge funds, which aim for
high returns by leveraging capital and making bets on foreign exchange and
bond markets, have increased volatility in bond markets.
Instead, it says that hedge funds add to liquidity in bond markets. It says
governments and central banks have found cases where only hedge funds have
been willing to buy bonds as prices have fallen so stabilising markets.
The study, released to coincide with the IMF/World Bank annual meetings in
Madrid next week, reports the view of one country's supervisory authority
that 'hedge funds have become the 'buyer of last resort' in some of these
markets'.
However, it says that the sums which funds have to deposit with banks in
order to borrow cash to trade on bond markets - typically 2 per cent to 4
per cent of the facility - may be too small to prevent markets becoming
excessively leveraged.
It points out that hedge funds are calculated to wield up to four times the
equity capital of large US securities firms.
More than half the capital is thought to be in 'macro' funds that make bets
on changes in interest and exchange rates.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: BgB's sale raises mortgage
stakes - The bank aims to pool resources with Nord LB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decision by Bankgesellschaft Berlin (BgB) to sell a 10 per cent
stake to Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (Nord LB) for DM1bn (Dollars
600m) could mark a turning point in BgB's strategy to capture a niche in the
rapidly expanding mortgage sector in north and eastern Germany.
Nord LB's access to BgB should allow the Hanover-based bank, the largest
public savings bank in the region, to start denting the monopoly held in the
eastern state of Brandenburg by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, Lower
Saxony's largest bank.
BgB, which was founded last January, is one of the first German institutions
to bring the public and private banking sectors under one holding company.
BgB includes the state-owned Landesbank Berlin, the private Berliner Bank,
and the private Berliner Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank mortgage bank.
Through its monopoly stake in Landesbank Berlin, the region's public savings
bank, the state of Berlin holds a 67.7 per cent stake in BgB, with the
Gothaer Insurance group holding 10 per cent, and minority shareholders
holding the remaining 22.3 per cent. By last June, BgB's consolidated
business volume was DM222bn.
However, the ability of the state of Berlin to retain its high stake has
been undermined by the city's parlous finances. It is strapped for cash,
running a budget deficit of nearly DM9bn, and embarking on more public
spending cut-backs. As a means of reducing the deficit, the state of Berlin
is free to decrease its stake in BgB to 50 per cent plus one share, the
minimum required to legally guarantee the deposits of Landesbank Berlin. The
question was how it would find the right partner for the initial sale of a
10 per cent stake in the Landesbank Berlin.
'We had been seeking Nord LB as a partner for some time,' said Mr Dietrich
Beier, BgB's chief economist. 'Of course, the DM1bn which the state of
Berlin will obtain from selling a stake of the Landesbank is very important
for the city's finances. But for BgB, we saw Nord LB's presence in BgB as a
crucial development of our strategy,' he added.
Part of BgB's strategy with Nord LB is targeted on the mortgage sector,
reckoned to be one of the fastest growing sectors in eastern Germany.
Private residential demand - and demand for housing loans in the five
eastern states - is expected to grow between 12 per cent and 15 per cent
this year, and continue to grow by double digits over the next few years.
But the question is how Nord LB and BgB can together tap into the market.
At the moment, there are two mortgage banks in the BgB holding company:
Berliner Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank, and Braunschweig-Hanoversche
Hypothekenbank in which Nord LB holds a 30 per cent stake and BgB 60 per
cent.
'What we want to do is to merge these two mortgage banks and pool our
resources because we can then tap a huge market in this part of Germany,'
explained Mr Beier. Such a merger would either require the agreement of Nord
LB, or else BgB would need to hold 75 per cent of Braunschweig-Hanoversche
Hypothekenbank to push through the merger. That would mean buying 15 per
cent of Nord LB's stake in the mortgage bank.
BgB believes it can avoid this costly step and still merge the two mortgage
banks largely because of the new relationship formed with Nord LB following
its 10 per cent stake in BgB.
'We would hope to pool our resources in the two mortgage banks,' said Mr
Ralf Sernau, head of investor relations in BgB. Such a merger would lead to
the creation of Germany's fourth largest mortgage bank, but the largest one
in terms of assets.
For Nord LB's part, the merger, the access by Nord LB and BgB to each
other's customers and markets, and Nord LB's 10 per cent stake in BgB would
allow the Hanover bank to gain a foothold in the state of Brandenburg.
More crucially from Nord LB's point of view, it would be in a much stronger
position to challenge West LB, Nord LB's great competitor which is making
rapid inroads into eastern Germany.
For BgB, Nord LB's stake in BgB would allow this Berlin financial
institution to take over the Nord LB's EDP computer processing system. At
the moment, all three banking institutions under BgB have different computer
systems. And since BgB has identified Nord LB as the most effective network
 -Landesbank Berlin is operating under its system - all the softwear of the
BgB will be lined up with Nord LB. 'We will all have immediate access to
customers, accounts, and information,' said Mr Beier.
Once the mortgage banks are merged and Nord LB's 10 per cent in BgB is
signed and sealed, BgB will tackle its next project. With the state of
Berlin's stake in Landesbank set to decrease by 10 per cent to 57.7 per cent
following its sale to Nord LB, there is speculation that Berlin is seeking
to reduce its stake to just above 50 per cent.
'In which case, we would consider a foreign partner,' said Mr Beier.

first six months

<TEXT>
Societe Generale de Belgique, the diversified Belgian holding company,
increased its net earnings by 53 per cent in the first half of the year to
BFr6.7bn (Dollars 210m) compared with BFr4.4bn in the previous corresponding
period.
Mr Etienne Davignon, president, said all shareholdings made an increased
contribution to earnings in terms of both ordinary activities and net
earnings, with Tractebel, the Belgian energy group, making the strongest
contribution to overall growth.
Tractebel's success was mainly due to an improvement in the electrical
sector.
Mr Davignon said there would be no change in its shareholding in Accor, the
French hotels group, which would remain at 12.2 per cent.
He told a press conference that Mr Karel Vinck was shortly to succeed Mr
Jean-Pierre Rodier as the head of Union Miniere.
La Generale's consolidated earnings were up 38 per cent in the first half of
the year. The group forecast that in spite of a generally poor economic
climate, it would be able to achieve earnings this year 'which are at least
equivalent to those of 1993'.
During the first half of the year the group's service sector activities had
continued to improve steadily, while the industrial companies benefited from
a pick-up in their markets or, as in the case of Union Miniere, from the
benefits of internal restructuring.
There was a marked increase in the earnings of Fortis to BFr888m in the six
months to June this year, from BFr579m in the first half of 1993.
Earnings from Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, rose to BFr1.57bn
against BFr1.2bn in the first half of 1993.
Union Miniere returned to profit in the first half of the year after losses
of BFr449m in the first half of 1993.
The BFr148m in after-tax profits for the six months to June was attributed
almost exclusively to a new management approach within the company.

FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cockerill seeks Eko Stahl stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steel producer, wants to buy a 60 per
cent stake in Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill, with a
further option on buying the remaining 40 per cent, Cockerill said
yesterday.
At the same time, Cockerill confirmed it wanted to build an integrated steel
mill, incorporating a hot-rolling mill with the aim of gaining a bigger
foothold in the German market as well as expanding in eastern Europe.
Eko Stahl, located in Eisenhuttenstadt in the eastern state of Brandenburg,
is close to the Polish border. 'We think Eko Stahl would be a very
interesting investment given the fact that we want a greater presence in
Germany,' Cockerill said.
Cockerill, which last week submitted a formal bid to the Treuhand
privatisation agency, said it would be investing between DM800m and DM1bn
(Dollars 519.4m-Dollars 600m) if the deal was accepted. The agency is due to
respond to Cockerill's bid by October 10.
The purchase of Eko Stahl would lift Cockerill's annual capacity. Last year,
the east German mill produced 900,000 tonnes of steel, a fall of nearly 1.2m
since it was placed under the Treuhand in 1990. Cockerill's annual steel
capacity is 4.5m tonnes.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Growth in advertising helps lift HTV by 75%
to Pounds 2.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the help of Budgie the Little Helicopter, cost reductions and growth in
advertising revenue, HTV turned in a 75 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
for the six months to end June, up from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 2.8m.
Trading performance at the ITV company for Wales and the west was even
stronger because the 1993 half year pre-tax figure included a Pounds 1.8m
property gain.
'This half year's figures represent a sustained and significant improvement
in the company's performance,' said Mr Louis Sherwood, HTV chairman.
Turnover on continuing operations was slightly down at Pounds 57.3m (Pounds
57.5m).
Profits from television activities rose sharply to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 1m).
Earnings per share were ahead at 2.7p (2.3p) taken after property sales.
The company has restored an interim dividend of 0.75p against a single final
of 1p last year.
HTV has finally disposed of its last three non-media subsidiaries, including
the loss-making fine art business.
The company increased its advertising revenue by 11 per cent to Pounds 45.3m
(Pounds 40.7m), ahead of the ITV average of 7 per cent growth.
The outlook for the company was significantly improved by Flextech's
purchase in March of 20 per cent in the company for Pounds 27m. This reduced
borrowing to Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 27.9m).
The connection with Flextech, which owns or manages a range of cable and
satellite channels, has also led to new media deals for HTV.
Contracts are already in place for 1,250 hours of new programming for cable
and satellite. HTV is now producing nearly 3,000 hours a year,one of the
largest programmes producers in volume in the UK.
A significant contribution is promised from the cable and satellite channels
from next year.

Newarthill, the holding company for Sir Robert McAlpine, the civil engineer,
announced a reduced pre-tax loss for the six months to end April, down from

Turnover was ahead at Pounds 116m (Pounds 94m), but the higher activity

Northern Leisure, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and amusement park
concern, announced pre-tax profits sharply up from Pounds 663,000 to Pounds
2.54m in the year to August 31 1994.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 23.2m). It included Pounds 980,000
(Pounds 2.23m) from discontinued operations.
Trading since May, when the company underwent a refinancing, had been 'very
satisfactory', the directors said. Accordingly, the company is resuming
dividend payments with a proposed 2p final, the first payment since 1990.
It hopes to pay an interim next year of not less than 1p. Earnings per share
were 7.7p (2.3p).

How Group, the engineering concern, cut pre-tax losses by 23 per cent to
Pounds 1.12m in the first half of 1994, against Pounds 1.45m last time which
included Pounds 488,000 related to discontinued activities.
Turnover was Pounds 58.4m (Pounds 70.5m), which Mr Peter How, chairman, said
was because of the normal time-lag of converting construction orders into
work-in-progress. A marked increase was evident in work being undertaken and
turnover for the year was expected to be similar to 1993.
Mr How said that 'generally, there is a renewed feeling of optimism, which I
do not believe to be misplaced. . . . Competition, though still fierce, is
becoming a little more realistic as the volume of enquiries rises.'
Losses per share came to 2.69p (2.64p), but the interim dividend is again
0.375p.

Shares in J Billam tumbled 10p to 134p yesterday after the Sheffield-based
engineer reported a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 271,000 to Pounds
34,000 for the first half of 1994. Turnover on continuing operations fell
from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 3.08m.
Restructuring the ASME subsidiary led to reorganisation costs of Pounds
68,000 this time. However, Mr Stephen Ingram, chairman, said the benefits
should now begin to appear in trading results. He believed that the downturn
had now been arrested.
Earnings per share were 10p lower at 1.4p, but the interim dividend was held
at 2.2p.

<TEXT>
Universal Ceramic Materials, the manufacturer of refractory and heating
element products, yesterday announced a 35 per cent increase in first half
1994 pre-tax profits from Pounds 837,000 to Pounds 1.13m, in its first set
of results as a quoted company.
UCM showed a 4 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 13.6m).
The sharper rise in profits was fuelled by the decision to turn down high
volume, but lower margin business in countries such as Mexico, Spain and
France.
Mr Bob Hughes, chief executive, said pricing competition continued to be
fierce. However, the outlook was encouraging with a competitor set to
withdraw from the industry by the end of the year.
There was no dividend. Earnings advanced by 14 per cent to 4.1p (3.6p).

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Confidence at AMV after 58% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, yesterday reported a 58 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.38m for the half year to June 30,
against Pounds 1.5m.
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said the increase represented a 'step-change' in
profitability. Last year's new business wins and increased spending by
existing clients had begun to show significant benefits to the company, he
said.
He described the outlook as the brightest for many years, and predicted that
underlying client spending would continue to increase.
Turnover increased 14 per cent to Pounds 108.1m (Pounds 94.4m). Earnings per
share jumped from 5.71p to 9.16p.
A rise in the interim dividend to 4.5p (3.2p) reflected increasing
confidence in the sustainability of the company's performance, as well as
the strength of its cash position, said Mr Abbott. The board is also
proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue.
Annualised new business gains during the first half totalled more than
Pounds 100m, a record for the group, including work for British
Telecommunications and Motorola.
In July, the group announced it had bought Redwood Publishing, the contract
publisher, for an initial cash payment of Pounds 2.85m. Mr Abbott said
second half figures would reflect contributions from the acquisition.
The shares gained 11p to close at 684p.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson rises to Pounds 24.5m - New team
signals intention to expand in continental Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hammerson, the property company which came under new management last year,
yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.5m, against Pounds
15.2m, and signalled its intention to expand in continental Europe.
Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive, said that the company was considering a
number of opportunities to buy retail property in France. He added that any
deal would not depend on the outcome of negotiations which might lead to the
sale of Hammerson's Pounds 176m Australian portfolio.
'If we can sell (the Australian assets) at a price which adequately reflects
likely increase in values over the next couple of years we will do so,' said
Mr Spinney.
During the first half, Hammerson spent Pounds 25m acquiring 99 Bishopsgate -
the City of London office block bombed by the IRA last year - and Pounds
143m buying a portfolio of retail and office properties from Postel. In
July, after the half-year end, it spent Pounds 75m on three Canadian
shopping centres.
Bishopsgate is being refurbished and may be expanded to more than 300,000 sq
ft, an operation which the company expects to complete by the end of 1995.
Including the Canadian deal, Hammerson's gearing is about 64 per cent,
little changed from the end of the last full year.
Mr Spinney said that he would be happy to see gearing rise modestly, given
the likely improvement in overseas property markets.
Net rental income was Pounds 57.9m in the first six months of the year,
compared with Pounds 59.8m. Acquisitions partially compensated for lost
rental income following the disposal of Woolgate House in the City a year
ago.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 27m, from Pounds 38.3m, reflecting the impact
of last year's Pounds 199m rights issue and lower interest rates on foreign
currency borrowings. Administration expenses were Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.8m).
Adjusted earnings per share were 6.5p (5.5p) and the int-erim dividend is
unchanged at 3.5p.
COMMENT
Mr Ron Spinney has made good progress reshaping Hammerson's empire since he
took over as chief executive last year. If he can achieve a decent price for
the company's Australian assets and deliver an attractive deal in France his
reputation will be further enhanced. The overall strategy of increasing
Hammerson's exposure to stable retail property and concentrating on markets
where it has critical mass makes perfect sense. The snag is that much of the
good news is already in the share price. At yesterday's close of 323p, the
shares are on a discount of 14 per cent to analysts' forecasts for year-end
net assets. The average discount for the sector is closer to 18 per cent.
Moreover, likely earnings per share of about 12p for the full year would
leave little room to increase the 10.5p dividend.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Girolami paid Pounds 1.5m in final year as
Glaxo chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Paul Girolami received almost Pounds 1.5m in pay in his final year as
chairman of Glaxo, Europe's biggest drug company, Pounds 46,000 higher than
in 1992, according to the company's annual report.
His salary and other benefits were Pounds 1.05m, compared with Pounds 1.03m.
He also earned a performance-related supplement of Pounds 436,000 (Pounds
410,000).
The company increased its contributions to his pension schemes from Pounds
487,000 to Pounds 696,000.
Sir Paul stepped down as chairman at the end of the company's financial year
on June 30, having worked at Glaxo for 29 years.
The annual report also shows that Mr Arthur Pappas, who was the director
responsible for Canada and Latin America until his departure in February
1994 over 'differences in management approach and style', is likely to
receive more than Dollars 2m in a contract termination payment, salary and
other benefits, over three years.
The salary of the second highest paid director was Pounds 930,000 last year,
compared with Pounds 1.32m the year before.
The report shows that 'payments for termination of executive office'
amounted to Pounds 1.04m with another Pounds 1.09m paid to former directors
in performance-related pay and pension contributions. Most of this was
payable to former chief executive, Dr Ernest Mario.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flextech obtains part in original cable
drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flextech, the oil services company which became a media group, yesterday
announced what it believes is the largest co-production deal to make
original programmes for cable and satellite channels.
The deal with Hallmark Entertainment of the US could involve total spending
of up to Dollars 140m (Pounds 89m).
The agreement covers the making of 30 feature-length original dramas in the
UK or other parts of the EU over the next two years. The deal also covers
eight original animated features and four original animated series of up to
26 episodes each.
'It's a huge deal,' Mr Roger Luard, chief executive of Flextech said
yesterday. Flextech, which holds 20 per cent of HTV and is controlled by TCI
of Denver, the largest US cable operator, manages or has interests in 11
cable and satellite channels including The Children's Channel, The Family
Channel, UK Gold and Bravo, which at the moment mainly shows old films.
The new dramas would probably be shown on either The Family Channel or on
Bravo.
Hallmark makes network movies and mini-series, including Lonesome Dove and
Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind, and has won 102 Emmy awards.
Flextech is believed to be paying considerably less than one third of the
total budget for the UK, Benelux and Scandinavian rights and Eastern
hemisphere rights for the animated programmes.
Mr Luard said Flextech was determined to build up a library of programme
rights as part of its business.
In a separate agreement with Hallmark, Flextech will acquire UK rights to
all the US company's productions for two years with an option for a third
year. This will cover a minimum of 125 hours of programming a year.
Mr Adam Singer, vice president international of TCI, said: 'This is the
first step in fulfilling cable television's promise that it would supply
quality British television drama the equal of anything currently made in the
UK.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Redrow's 45% advance confirms housing
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing recovery among UK housebuilders was confirmed yesterday when
Redrow Group, which came to the market earlier this year, reported annual
pre-tax profits 45 per cent ahead at Pounds 19.2m, against Pounds 13.2m.
However, Mr Steve Morgan, chairman, said it was too early to forecast a
sustained recovery. 'Trading conditions are fairly neutral at the moment.
The house price rises we saw earlier in the year have subsided, but so too
have some of the inflationary cost pressures.'
Turnover increased 45 per cent to Pounds 188.3m (Pounds 129.6m), including
Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share
rose from 5.1p to 8p. An initial dividend of 1.8p is proposed.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 600,000) charge
for the leisure division, which was sold to Mr Morgan prior to flotation,
and a Pounds 1m investment profit.
The number of completed homes rose 61 per cent to 2,038, which included a
first contribution of 451 from the group's new south-eastern division, the
former Costain Homes business, bought in July 1993. The purchase marked the
company's return to the south-east. Mr Morgan said the region remained a
priority for expansion, as witnessed by the recent purchase of Gudgeon Homes
for Pounds 4.6m.
He added that the company was also considering a move into Scotland, the
only area of the UK where it had no presence.
First-time buyer incentives, particularly in the south-east, meant the
average house price declined from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 82,400. However,
Mr Morgan said that he expected prices to recover this year, although it was
too early to make a firm prediction.
On turnover of Pounds 168m (Pounds 111m) the home division reported
operating profits of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 13.3m).
The land bank rose from 5,000 to 7,100 plots, which was 79 per cent higher
in value terms at Pounds 89.7m. Although land prices had risen during the
year, the company had managed to secure most of its purchases at below
market prices.
Turnover in the construction business rose 48 per cent to Pounds 15.8m,
although operating profits halved to Pounds 100,000 and the operating margin
fell from 1.9 per cent to 0.6 per cent.
With trading conditions continuing to be tough, the company was taking steps
to rationalise the division.
COMMENT
Good first year results from Redrow come at a time when many investors, with
an eye on higher interest rate expectations, are reducing their weighting in
the construction and builders sectors. Forecasts for the current year have
been shaved back to about Pounds 28m, giving an earnings of 9.8p and a p/e
of about 13. This is slightly ahead of the market and a 10 per cent premium
to the sector and higher than the likes of Bryant and Wilson Bowden, both of
which have track records.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Director quits after failed coup -
Community Hospitals lifts annual pre-tax profits by 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Community Hospitals Group, the private medical care company, yesterday said
one of its senior directors had left the group following a failed boardroom
coup.
Mr Oliver Prentice, managing director of the company's continuing care
division, resigned earlier this month after the board rejected his bid to
oust Mr Alan Dexter as chief executive.
Although the company released few details of the dispute, it admitted there
had been a clash of personalities between Mr Dexter, who led the group to
flotation in 1989, and Mr Prentice, widely credited with building its
nursing homes business.
'I knew Oliver had aspirations to become chief executive, but this was a
surprise move,' said Mr David Croker, finance director. 'He asked the board
to make a choice, and when they backed Alan he had no alternative but to
leave.'
Mr Dexter claimed there was no strategic argument with Mr Prentice, who is
negotiating a compensation package based on his two-year rolling contract
and Pounds 77,000 annual salary.
City analysts suggested that Mr Prentice might have quit because he feared
that plans to invest up to Pounds 2.5m on enlarging the group's Duchy
Hospital in Cornwall would divert funds from nursing home development.
The continuing care division, comprising 13 nursing homes, homecare services
and sheltered accommodation, helped lift pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to
Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 6.1m) in the year to June 30.
Although the division saw profits increase by more than a third to Pounds
2.35m (Pounds 1.76m), its contribution was overshadowed by Pounds 8m (Pounds
6.2m) from the hospital division.
The two sectors underpinned a 26 per cent increase in operating profits from
Pounds 7.96m to Pounds 9.99m on increased turnover of Pounds 57.6m (Pounds
49.4m).
The improvement was helped by growth in private medical insurance and maiden
contributions from three new nursing homes and a new hospital in Colchester,
which opened in January.
Mr Dexter said the group planned to consolidate operations at its 10
hospitals and gradually win greater market share for the continuing care
business.
Earnings per share rose from 14.3p to 17.2p and an increased final dividend
of 7.9p (6.9p) has been proposed.
While welcoming the results, analysts left profit forecasts for this year
unchanged at about Pounds 8.7m, putting the shares, up 1p at 256p yesterday,
on a forward multiple of 13.8.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome ends cancer drug trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome has abandoned research on one of its more promising drugs intended
for use in cancer and organ transplants.
Campath 1-H, licensed from British Technology Group, was set for launch in
1997 and had potential sales of Dollars 250m (Pounds 158m) a year, according
to Lehman Brothers, the stockbroker.
Wellcome said data from the latest clinical trials showed only low or
moderate efficacy and therefore 'this compound is not likely to have
adequate commercial potential'.
The drug had reached phase two of human clinical trials, a relatively late
stage in the expensive development process for a drug to be recognised as a
failure. Wellcome had been conducting trials with it since 1991.
The areas of study were in cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in
advanced rheumatoid arthritis, a condition caused by the failure of the
immune system.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 100m interest gloom for Brent Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest payments of more than Pounds 100m overshadowed an improvement in
interim operating profits at Brent Walker, the bookmaking and public house
group laden with Pounds 1.4bn of bank debt.
The group, which is also losing Sir Keith Bright as chairman, warned that
turnover in its core business had shown 'little sign of an upturn, leaving
the results potentially vulnerable to competitor activity and the economic
climate, especially in the short term.'
Operating profits increased from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 35.2m for the six
months to June 30, while turnover edged ahead from Pounds 858.9m to Pounds
867.9m.
But after exceptionals and payment of net interest at Pounds 103.6m (Pounds
98.1m) the loss amounted to Pounds 73.5m, compared with a previous loss of
Pounds 83.3m. The deficit in shareholders' funds widened from Pounds 629.8m
to Pounds 877m.
A Pounds 10m cost incurred by breaking previous finance arrangements at the
William Hill betting chain is believed to be the main reason why the latest
interest payment is higher than for first half 1993. The group will pay only
Pounds 20m of the interest total in cash, with most of the rest converted
into preference shares.
Sir Keith joined the group in January last year in order to oversee the
reorganisation of its finances, including the refinancing last March of a
Pounds 325m loan at William Hill. He feels that he has completed the work he
originally undertook, and now 'wishes to follow other interests.'
He will be replaced by Sir Brian Goswell, already a non-executive director,
and a senior partner in Healey &amp; Baker, estate agents and surveyors.
Operating profits at William Hill, now the main engine of the group,
improved from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 30.8m on turnover of Pounds 806.8m
(Pounds 791.4m). The group described its retention of market share as
'encouraging' ahead of the National Lottery launch in November.
However, 'the most significant event' was the refinancing that had enabled
the chain to stay within the group. Mr John Leach, finance director, said
yesterday that flotation was an option for William Hill, 'but not
necessarily the only one'.
Brent Walker is claiming Pounds 200m in a dispute with Grand Metropolitan
over the purchase of the chain, which is in the balance sheet at Pounds
697.2m. A valuation of the assets at the end of last year showed it was
worth Pounds 486.1m.
The Pubmaster chain of public houses reported increased operating profits of
Pounds 5.77m (Pounds 5.14m) on turnover of Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 46.9m).
Operating profits at the 'other businesses division' - which includes the
Cardiff International Arena and Brighton Marina - fell to Pounds 1.77m
(Pounds 2.11m) on turnover of Pounds 15m (Pounds 18.8m).
The loss per share was 20.83p (24.32p). There is no dividend on either
ordinary or preference shares.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Discounting helps T&amp;S to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;S Stores, the confectionery, tobacco and news retailer and convenience
store operator, lifted pre-tax profits by 3 per cent from Pounds 6.79m to
Pounds 7.02m in the 26 weeks to July 2.
Operating profits, before losses from business disposals of Pounds 212,000
(Pounds 88,000 profit) grew more strongly. They showed an 11 per cent
increase to Pounds 7.62m (Pounds 6.85m).
Turnover was 17 per cent ahead at Pounds 201m (Pounds 171m).
The shares edged up 2p to close at 182p.
Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, said he was 'happy' with the results. They
were achieved in a mature market and in spite of declines in cigarette
volumes.
He said that although the UK confectionery market was up 2 per cent over
last time, the grocery market was 'flat or slightly down', and the news
market was down in the wake of the price war in newspapers and magazines.
In February the group bought the 74-store Gibbs Newsagents chain for Pounds
7.1m including expenses and in March it acquired 23 Macs convenience stores
for a total of Pounds 6m.
These contributed Pounds 399,000 to profits and Pounds 10.7m to turnover.
By division, Supercigs, the core high-street 'deep discounter' chain, raised
profits 22 per cent to Pounds 2.96m on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 87m.
The rise was fuelled by multi-buy discounts and discounts on everything in
the stores - even news in 125 of the 217 stores.
Average branch profits rose 18 per cent.
Profits in the 336-strong CTNs chain advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds
3.97m, mostly as a result of the Gibbs acquisition. Turnover grew 24 per
cent to Pounds 63.3m, with like-for-like sales edging up 3 per cent.
The C stores format showed the strongest organic gains.
Here, profits rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 3m with only a small
contribution from Macs. Turnover was 36 per cent ahead at Pounds 50.7m. Like
for like sales rose 9 per cent. Ten extra stores were opened.
The interim goes up to 2.6p (2.5p), payable from earnings of 7.27p (7.06p)
per share.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Metalrax advances to Pounds 4.11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metalrax Group, the precision components, houseware and storage equipment
group, increased pre-tax profits by 15 per cent from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds
4.11m in the six months to June 30, on sales which rose by 17 per cent to
Pounds 38.88m.
Mr John Wardle, chairman, said only a very small proportion of the profits
rise was due to acquisitions, of which the full benefit would be seen next
year and thereafter.
Mr Wardle said: 'Despite conflicting evidence as to the strength of the
apparent recovery and the dubious optimism very naturally shown by official
pronouncements, life continues to be very difficult at the sharp end of
manufacturing industry.
'It is only because of the very heavy investment in technology over the last
five years that we have managed to mitigate the intense pressures on margins
that have increased rather than relaxed.'
Earnings per share grew by 15 per cent to 3p (2.6p). The interim dividend
rose by 10 per cent to 1p (adjusted 0.91p).

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bass shares slip after statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bass slipped 17p to 523p yesterday after it delivered a cautious
trading statement which indicated its breweries and pubs remained under
intense competitive pressure.
The group's beer sales fell 0.8 per cent in volume terms in the first 48
weeks of this financial year while the UK market fell 1.2 per cent.
Brewers had pulled back from the large trade discounts they were offering
last year and in this first half, but there was 'still a knock-on effect' in
pricing overall, said Mr Ian Prosser, chairman.
Bass's gross profit margins on beer were slightly lower in the second half
than the first, although this reflected in part an 11 per cent reduction in
the number of pubs in Bass Tavern's estate.
On a like-for-like basis, pubs managed by Bass reported a 3 per cent rise in
takings within which food revenues were up 8 per cent, indicating a decline
in drink sales. Mr Prosser declined to give a figure for the decline in beer
volume sales in Bass pubs but said the group 'had done better than the
market' which was down about 5 per cent.
Off-licence beer sales were up 6.4 per cent.
Bass's other activities showed progress in the year to date with Britvic,
the soft drinks business, benefiting from the UK's hot summer. Its volumes
were up 9 per cent in the first 48 weeks after being ahead only 3 per cent
at the half year.
Holiday Inns reported a rise in occupancy and room rates in the Americas. In
Europe, a slight deline in room rates was offset by higher occupancy.
Bingo clubs reported a 5 per cent increase in spending per head. Betting
shop turnover was up 4.3 per cent and the average stake was 2.3 per cent
higher.
Bass enjoyed a strong cash inflow in the second half after an outflow in the
first half. Bass Brewers, for example, was cash positive and is expected to
remain so for 'the foreseeable future.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel share fall casts doubt on
finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's share price fell 19p, or 7 per cent, to 250p yesterday, as
reports of leaks in the Channel Tunnel added to the challenge the company
faces in avoiding a further refinancing, following its May Pounds 858m
rights issue.
The salt water leaks were dismissed by the company as in line with the
design, with the only problem coming from the silting up of parts of its
secondary drainage system. Eurotunnel said it would cause no further delays
to the start of a paying passenger service.
If the share price remains depressed, however, this would have a knock-on
effect on anticipated capital from the conversion of warrants.
At the time of the rights issue, the company's financing plan gave Pounds
473m of leeway. However, this figure assumed that about Pounds 180m would be
raised from conversion of the 1993 warrants, expiring in October 1995.
The warrants have a conversion price of marginally above 300p, making this
source of capital far from certain.
In addition, the rights prospectus anticipated Pounds 137m of revenues for
the current year, which assumed the commencement of the passenger shuttle
service in October.
This has been put back by six weeks until mid-November. This is likely to
remove at least half the projected turnover from the passenger service for
the current year.
Mr Richard Hannah, an analyst at UBS Securities, said: 'The funding margin
is looking very tight, and it looks like a third rescue rights issue could
be in the offing during the next 12 months.'
The company's banks separate projections indicated a funding margin of only
Pounds 34m, excluding cash from the warrants.
With Pounds 48m of income due to have come in from Le Shuttle in 1994, much
of that margin will have disappeared through the delay in the customer
service.
The company has a further Pounds 50m from a fall back loan facility from
Morgan Grenfell and Warburg. It is also involved in arbitration over delay
in the start up of the Eurostar Service and is claiming up to Pounds 400m,
plus tariff increases.

Camas, the building materials group demerged from English China Clays in
June, is paying Dollars 15.1m (Pounds 9.5m) for the majority assets of C&amp;M
Ready Mix Concrete of Boulder, Colorado.
The assets comprise about 12m tons of proven aggregate reserves, which are
situated north-east of Denver, five ready mixed plants and a fleet of
concrete delivery trucks. In addition, Camas will receive Dollars 3m of
income from trade contracts already undertaken.
Mr Christopher Bailey, Camas finance director, said the deal would probably
push the group into first position in the Denver ready mix market ahead of
Redland.
C&amp;M reported operating profits of Dollars 1.5m in 1993.

<TEXT>
Enterprise Computer Holdings suffered a slide in turnover from Pounds 58.2m
to Pounds 16.4m in the year ended March 31, after a series of
disappointments left the Berkshire-based computing services group in the red
again.
In a note to the full-year financial statements, the auditors observe there
is a fundamental uncertainty over whether the company's bankers will renew
facilities and so ensure that the group and its subsidiaries 'will continue
in operational existence'. The auditors, Stoy Hayward, have not qualified
the accounts because of this, however.
The group made slightly higher operating profits of Pounds 4.9m, but
interest charges and rent resulted in a loss after tax of Pounds 1.96m
(Pounds 5.75m). Loss per share was cut to 2.6p (7.4p). No dividend is being
paid.
Enterprise has been changing market position from a seller of secondhand
mainframe computers to more broadly based computing services but Mr John
Small, chairman, said the process was taking longer than expected.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape warns on Japanese car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the international motors, marketing and services group, yesterday
confirmed that the strength of the yen had hit sales of Japanese cars in
Europe, but said all the rest of its operations were performing well.
Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said: 'It has been very tough
for the Japanese manufacturers - and might be for some time. But make no
mistake, they will be back.'
Mr Mackay said the Japanese had moved their vehicles too far upmarket,
seeking higher prices and offering more sophisticated equipment. This had
cost them sales when recession struck, but they were now bringing in new
models and cutting their production costs.
Inchcape reported a 4 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 130.4m
to Pounds 125.5m in the six months to June 30 on flat sales of Pounds
3.03bn.
Sir David Plastow, chairman, pointedly failed to repeat the optimism he
expressed at the group's AGM in May that the full-year profits would exceed
last year's level of Pounds 272m. However, analysts were reassured by the
overall tone of the statement. The shares, which have fallen by a third this
year, closed unchanged at 410p in a falling market.
Sir David described the results as a 'satisfactory overall performance' -
particularly since the previous period included a Pounds 10.6m profit
contribution from a joint venture exporting Toyota vehicles to China, which
had now ended. Excluding this, underlying group profits grew 6 per cent, in
spite of a Pounds 20.6m drop to Pounds 19.6m in the profits contribution
from distributing Japanese vehicles in Europe.
Inchcape said its Japanese motors businesses held up reasonably well outside
Europe, and the contribution from the group's European and American marques
around the world improved strongly. The retail motors operations were now
benefiting not only from the rationalisation in the UK and continental
Europe, but also from an upturn in the cycle in the UK. Operating profits
from total motor activities fell 11 per cent to Pounds 81.8m.
The marketing stream increased operating profits by 20 per cent to Pounds
34.2m after a difficult 1993, although Japan continued to suffer from from
recession.
All the services businesses performed strongly. Insurance - primarily Bain
Clarkson - grew operating profits by 31 per cent to Pounds 19.4m. Hogg
Group, bought for Pounds 177m in April, contributed Pounds 1.1m after
financing costs in its first month.
Testing services increased profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 9.8m, with the
the petrochemicals business benefiting from restructuring over the last two
years. An upturn in mining exploration activity helped the minerals
business.
Shipping services raised profits 26 per cent to Pounds 7.8m, with a
particularly good performance from the North American and Middle East
operations. The small buying business returned to profit.
Earnings per share fell by 7 per cent to 14.8p (15.9p), while the interim
dividend rose by 3 per cent to 6p (5.8p).

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline jumps to Pounds 2.05m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hodder Headline yesterday announced a large profits rise in its first
interim figures to include results of Hodder &amp; Stoughton acquired last year.
Sales quadrupled to Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 8.3m) and pre-tax profit more than
trebled to Pounds 2.05m in the first six months of 1994, against Pounds
570,000 last time.
The results were accompanied by the announcement that Mr Tim Hely
Hutchinson, chief executive, had decided to leave the net book agreement
that sets minimum prices for most books in the UK. From Christmas
booksellers will be free to discount Hodder Headline titles if they want to
do so.
Mr Hely Hutchinson said the results 'look particularly strong viewed with
the background of flat UK trading conditions and the very substantial
reorganisation we have been completing.'
The company said the post-merger reorganisation was now largely complete and
Hodder, which plans to publish more than 2,000 titles in 1995 compared with
1,700 this year, is looking for expansion and acquisitions that will enhance
earnings.
The company is interested in increasing the size of its reference, schools
and childrens' publishing operations.
If the company is unable to make a significant acquisition in the next year,
Mr Hely Hutchinson said yesterday: 'I think I would be very disappointed.'
Earnings per share rose by 41 per cent to 3.8p (2.7p) and the interim
dividend increased to 2p (1.65p).
Mr Hely Hutchinson said he looked forward to a 'good second half' and
analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 8m for the full year.
Lord Donoughmore, Hodder's chairman and Mr Hely Hutchinson's father, also
revealed that from May it had ceased to recognise trade unions.
'The board does not believe trade unions have a useful role to play in the
group,' Lord Donoughmore said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sales training behind Refuge Assurance fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training and testing its 2,100 sales agents contributed to sharp falls in
both regular and single premium business at Refuge Assurance, the life
insurance group, in the first six months of this year.
New regular premium life, annuity and pensions business fell by 31 per cent
to Pounds 13m (Pounds 18.8m), while single premium new business fell 24 per
cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 24.7m).
Mr Tom Booth, chairman, said about half the drop in new business could be
attributed to sales foregone as a result of the extra effort spent on
training and testing, while about half reflected trends within the life
insurance sector as a whole.
There was a particularly marked fall in regular premium new business on the
industrial side - where a sales agent calls once every two weeks or so at
the home of a customer to collect what are often relatively small amounts.
It dropped from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 5.2m.
Refuge said it was raising its interim dividend to 3.7p (3.45p). The cost of
the dividend is Pounds 5.81m. Like other life insurance companies, it is not
required to release interim profits figures.
There were encouraging signs in the group's general insurance underwriting -
where more favourable claims experience helped turn a pre-tax loss of Pounds
1m into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 156,000 - and in unit trust sales which
rose to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 4.6m).
Mr Booth said that though the training exercise had restricted sales in the
first half, there were signs of an improving trend.
Against a background of a reduction in the number of sales agents in the
life industry, he added that Refuge envisaged its sales force remaining at
its current size.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Close Brothers 86% ahead to Pounds 33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Close Brothers, the fifth largest quoted UK merchant bank has sustained its
record of profit growth, and for the year to July 31 announced pre-tax
profits ahead from Pounds 17.82m to Pounds 33.06m.
The 86 per cent advance was achieved on operating income of Pounds 76.9m
(Pounds 53.1m), up 45 per cent.
The half-year results had exceeded market expectations but the full-year
figures diverged only marginally from analysts' forecasts and the share
price closed unchanged at 215p.
Earnings were diluted by the Pounds 17m share issue made by Close Brothers
to finance the acquisition last year of Winterflood Securities, the market
maker in the shares of smaller companies.
Earnings per share increased by 61 per cent from 13.7p to 22.1p.
Winterfloods, traditional merchant banking and asset financing contributed
in roughly equal measure to total profits.
Subtracting the impact of the acquisition of Winterfloods, Close Brothers'
other activities showed an increase in profit contribution of about 50 per
cent.
This figure too was flattered by a fall in provisioning for bad and doubtful
debts from Pounds 7.74m to Pounds 4.85m. Stripping out this line, underlying
and organic profits growth at Close Brothers was about 27 per cent,
according to one anal-yst.
The proposed final dividend of 5p (3.9p adjusted) lifts the total from an
adjusted 5.5p to 7.5p.
Total assets at the year-end had improved by 24 per cent to Pounds 715m
(Pounds 575m).
COMMENT
Close Brothers is a victim of its own success. The firm's results cannot
rebound because they never fell; the company yesterday reported its 19th
consecutive year of profits growth. The reduction in provisioning has gone
about as far as it can. Further improvement in results has to be achieved on
top of a high base. Winterflood Securities may have had a record year but
analysts judge it is past its peak and will prove a drag on profits growth
in the current year. Nor does Close Brothers have the steady fee income that
other larger firms have through their fund management arms. That said, Close
Brothers' record is not one to sniff at: consistent profits growth; the
lowest cost-income ratio in the merchant bank sector; and the highest return
on equity. Merchant banking and asset finance are well-placed to benefit
from the economic recovery in which Close Brothers say their clients are
clearly sharing. Analysts' forecasts of roughly stable profits of Pounds
42m-Pounds 44m give a prospective p/e of about 10. Its small discount to the
sector's 10.3 rates a tentative buy.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Automotive Products drops into Pounds 4.7m
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive Products, the motor components subsidiary of BBA, yesterday
reported a first-half loss following the parent company's decision to settle
a long-running patent infringement case for Pounds 13.1m.
The company, which traditionally issues a separate results statement to BBA,
made pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.7m in the six months to June 30, against
profits of Pounds 5.7m.
The figures were undermined by the payment earlier this year of Dollars
18.4m (Pounds 11.9m) to Tilton Engineering, the US company which sued
Automotive Products for manufacturing carbon racing clutches on which it
held patents.
Operating profits, meanwhile, were unchanged at Pounds 9.5m on flat turnover
of Pounds 121.2m (Pounds 119m).
Mr Peter Clappison, finance director of BBA, said the sluggish figures
disguised a general improvement in trading conditions and the success of
cost-cutting measures.
Although he highlighted 230 job cuts at the subsidiary, he made no mention
of the departure of Mr Peter Crawford, chief executive of the automotive
business, who left in July following a disagreement with Mr Roberto Quarta,
BBA chief executive.

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hanson makes three US disposals for Pounds
40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson Industries, the US arm of Hanson, announced the completion of three
asset sales for Pounds 40m, which will realise a pre-tax gain of about
Pounds 8m.
'These latest disposals are part of the general process of tidying up
Hanson's portfolio,' said Mr Christopher Collins, director of corporate
development.
The disposals fit in with Hanson's strategy of reducing debt through
disposals and flotations while expanding its core businesses. In the
financial year that ends on Friday Hanson has sold assets worth more than
Pounds 950m on both sides of the Atlantic.
These included the flotation of its Beazer housebuilding operations, the
sale of 11 UK companies to management buy-out teams backed by Electra, the
venture capital group, and the sales of Axelson oil industry equipment group
and Hanson Office Products contract stationery business.
The latest disposals in the US include International Mini Warehouse
Associates, which was part of the Kidde acquisition in 1987 and owns nine
warehouses in New Jersey and Connecticut.
Proctor &amp; Schwartz, part of the SCM Corporation acquired by Hanson in 1986,
which designs and manufactures industrial drying and heat setting machines
for the food, tobacco, textile and chemical industries, has also been sold.
Hanson also announced the sale of 100,000 acres of land, including surface
and mineral rights, which it acquired with the purchase of Beazer in 1991.
The assets sold generated operating profits of Pounds 2.3m in the year to
September 30 1993 on turnover of Pounds 38m.

The Go-Ahead Group turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.86m for the year to
July 2, which was 25 per cent higher than its prospectus forecast. This
compared with a previous Pounds 315,000.
Turnover rose from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 61.4m, because of the impact of
acquisitions in Brighton and Oxford. Operating profit rose from Pounds

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost for Allied London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of acquisitions over the past year boosted annual results at Allied
London Properties, which yesterday posted pre-tax profits 56 per cent ahead
at Pounds 10.6m, against Pounds 6.8m last time.
But net asset value per share of 110p (85p) came in below market
expectations and contributed to an 8p fall in the shares to 100p.
The results for the year to June 30 confirmed the first half trend and
yesterday Sir Geoffrey Leigh, chairman, said that the outlook remained 'very
favourable' for both capital values and the rental market.
The 12 per cent rise in rental income to Pounds 21.94m (Pounds 19.52m) was
derived substantially from the group's Pounds 52m worth of acquisitions.
These included an Pounds 11.3m portfolio in Glasgow for its newly
established Scottish subsidiary. A further five properties have been bought
in the region since the year-end at a cost of just over Pounds 9m.
The company also spent Pounds 34.35m on six properties from Provident
Mutual, which in return paid Pounds 21.6m on a portfolio of Allied's retail
portfolio. Sir Geoffrey said the balance of Pounds 12.75m had produced a net
annual rent of Pounds 1.8m.
There were also big investments in properties in Leeds and Basingstoke.
Pelham Homes, the former Rosehaugh subsidiary, was bought from the receiver
for Pounds 3m, which brought with it a substantial land bank in the
south-east.
The year-end valuation on the group's portfolio was 6.7 per cent higher at
Pounds 220m than the previous year. Offices comprised 52 per cent of the
properties, followed by business parks, light industrial and warehouses at
39 per cent and retail 9 per cent.
A final dividend of 2.7p is to be paid, making a total of 3.88p (3.53p).

FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker declines to Pounds 3.15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weaker furniture sales helped lead to a decline in pre-tax profits at
Cornwell Parker, the furniture and fabrics group best known for its Parker
Knoll chairs. In the year to July 31 profits fell from Pounds 4.61m to
Pounds 3.15m.
However, Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, said group trading profits in the
second half were 'significantly higher' than in the first. However, year on
year, they fell to Pounds 4.33m (Pounds 5.08m).
There was a Pounds 705,000 (nil) charge relating to further reorganisation
of Fardis, the French fabrics business.
Mr Jourdan said that tax increases earlier in the year had 'not obviously
damaged demand'. While he acknowledged that the recession was over, he
stressed that the feelgood factor was 'not yet with us. The middle classes
are just not buying.'
Operating profits of Pounds 3.66m (Pounds 5.21m) took in losses of Pounds
36,000 from Minty Design Furniture, against losses of Pounds 133,000 from
Lock, the now closed importer of antique furniture from Romania.
Group turnover was flat at Pounds 89.9m (Pounds 89.2m) including Pounds
598,000 from Minty (Pounds 1.18m from Lock).
Trading profits in the furniture division emerged at Pounds 2.1m (Pounds
3.6m) on sales lower at Pounds 48.4m (Pounds 50.6m).
Retail sales fell at Parker Knoll in spite of new product launches.
The fabrics division lifted profits by Pounds 676,000 to Pounds 2.2m on
sales up 7.5 per cent at Pounds 41.5m. About one third of those sales were
exported and the proportion is expected to rise.
The final dividend is unchanged at 4p for a maintained total of 5.7p, which
is uncovered by earnings of 4.6p (7.3p) per share. However, Mr Jourdan said
the payout was covered by the trading profit after tax, while the Fardis
restructuring costs would come in part from reserves.

<TEXT>
Sycamore Holdings, the loss-making laboratory, office, and garden furniture
group, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Adam Kingdon, its
operations director.
In July the company announced the resignation of non-executive director Mr
Michael Hunton. Three days later Sycamore warned of substantial write-offs
for the financial year and said its bankers were reviewing the level of
financing facilities in light of the expected provisions.
In August Sycamore announced pre-tax losses for the six months to 31 March
of Pounds 1.84m, against losses of Pounds 6.85m; turnover was Pounds 9.71m
(Pounds 10.16m). Operating losses stood at Pounds 609,000 (Pounds 4.69m).
Sycamore has been in discussions with its bankers since last year, when the
value of net assets fell to less than half its called up share capital.
Mr Kingdon joined Sycamore in April 1993.
Sycamore's shares closed unchanged at  1/2 p yesterday.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Model range helps Peugeot Citroen return to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot Citroen yesterday provided evidence of the French car industry
recovery while announcing the strengthening of its product range and net
profits of FFr688m (Pounds 82.5m) for the first half of the year, compared
with a loss of FFr1.12bn in the same period in 1993.
The results were at the lower end of analysts' forecasts, but Peugeot
Citroen predicted further improvement and a 'clear positive result' for the
full year. It said the improvement would be partly based on the impact of
its revamped model range which would offset a slowdown in growth in the
automobile market in the second half of the year.
According to Peugeot Citroen, the slowdown partly reflects the weakening of
stimulatory measures introduced by the French government. The measures,
which were introduced in February and included a payment of FFr5,000 to car
owners who traded in vehicles more than 10 years old to buy a new one,
helped lift sales in the first half. Combined with an end to recession in
France and other European markets, the measures had prompted a 14.8 per cent
increase in sales to FFr83.8bn.
Peugeot Citroen, said its improvement reflected the impact of new models,
from utility vehicles to the estate version of the Citroen ZX and the
Peugeot 306 convertible. In addition, the first half of the year saw the
launch of the group's multi-purpose vehicles, the Peugeot 806 and Citroen
Evasion.
The group raised its share of the western European market from about 11.9
per cent to 12.5 per cent. In France, market share increased from an average
of 30.3 per cent in the first half of 1993 to about 32.8 per cent.
Improved cash flow and a tighter control on investments allowed the company
to reduce debts. At the end of June, group debts stood at FFr9.34bn,
compared with FFr16.67bn at the beginning of the year. At the operating
level, Peugeot Citroen reported a profit of FFr2.45bn, compared with a loss
of FFr1.25bn last time.
Despite an upbeat assessment of the company's performance, Peugeot Citroen
expressed caution about the prospects for the European market. It pointed
out that although the 6.48m new registrations in the first half represented
a growth rate of 6.7 per cent over the first half of 1993, the total volume
still represented a fall of almost 12 per cent compared with the first half
of 1992.
The company was also cautious about the second half, saying 'growth in
western European automobile demand should be much slower. Growth in
passenger car registrations for the full year was likely to slip to about 4
per cent in western Europe and 12 per cent in France.

<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the French banking group, is expected today to unveil
losses of FFr4bn-FFr5bn (Pounds 480m-Pounds 600m) in delayed results for the
first half of 1994.
The losses are expected to be accompanied by substantial additional balance
sheet provisions against worsening bad loans on activities outside its
traditional lending base. The bank confirmed its board was due to meet today
after which the results are scheduled to be published.
The results were due for release last Thursday, but were delayed by an
apparent collapse in discussions between Credit Lyonnais and the government.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, issued a statement suggesting he had
only been informed last Monday of the size of the bank's bad debts, which
could require additional provisions of up to FFr25bn.
Mr Alphandery stressed that the government would provide support to the
bank, although the Ministry of Finance and Economy publicly rejected some
speculative reports that there would be any immediate state aid of
FFr3bn-FFr4bn required.
Credit Lyonnais sources suggested that the group had sufficient capital to
exceed European minimum solvency requirements. The state is believed to be
continuing to press for accelerated sales of banking assets as well as other
parts of the group.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Cleaning up its act to fight the giants: Roderick Oram
explains why Reckitt &amp; Colman is spending Pounds 1bn to build its US
household products portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mustard, barbecue sauce and potatoes were all Reckitt &amp; Colman was selling
in the US 10 years ago. Two acquisitions turned it into a provider of
cleaners and other household products, making the US the British group's
largest single market. But it remained a second-tier company lacking some
key products in a field dominated by leading brands.
Reckitt's ambition, though, is to compete with the likes of
Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble on their US home ground, by far the
largest market in the world, and abroad. Yesterday's Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds
1bn) purchase of L&amp;F Household from Eastman Kodak gives it the weapons to
take them on. It may also hasten the day when Reckitt concentrates entirely
on household products by selling its over-the-counter drugs including such
famous brands as Disprin, an aspirin-based painkiller.
L&amp;F 'fits our strategy perfectly,' said Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive.
'It transforms the position and profitability of our US business.' According
to Mr Paul Woodhouse, a Smith New Court analyst: 'Reckitt was in need of
something to get it moving. It was in the second division with few products
mass marketers needed.'
But L&amp;F also presents Reckitt with some stiff challenges. The biggest is to
assimilate L&amp;F and use its brands and technology to good effect abroad.
Reckitt has a rather patchy record on these management techniques. It has
yet to maximise the potential, for example, of its Dollars 1.25bn purchase
in 1990 of Boyle Midway, another US household products group. The group has
found it hard to increase US sales and profits in recent years.
Founded in 1874 by Mr Lane and Mr Fink as an importer of raw materials for
New York City pharmacists, L&amp;F became one of the first suppliers of
antiseptics. From that technology grew a range of disinfectants and other
household products. It was taken over by Sterling Drug in 1966 which in turn
was bought by Kodak in 1988.
Its products are tightly focused on some six brands such as Lysol which are
first or second in their markets. It has products such as lavatory cleaners
which Reckitt lacks in the US. It has disinfectant technology that Reckitt
hopes to use elsewhere in the world. It is much more experienced in the US
than its new owner at 'controlling shelf space', the art of dealing with
retailers. Strength in brands and distribution helped it to achieve a profit
margin last year about 2 percentage points better than Reckitt's world wide
average of 15 per cent.
Lysol is a leading brand with its products used in two out of three US
homes. Sales of Lysol products totalled Dollars 360m last year, about half
L&amp;F's sales, but only Dollars 30m came from outside the US. Moreover,
Lysol's annual sales growth of about 2.5 per cent in recent years has been
moderate and some US analysts see it as a 'tired brand'. Reckitt could play
to both the strengths and weaknesses of Lysol. It intends to rebuild its US
business around Lysol and L&amp;F's other main brands by selling off lesser
products from the two companies. L&amp;F's products generating less than 25 per
cent of sales could be sold, Mr Sankey said.
The new US line-up, including successful existing products such as Woolite
fabric washes and Easy-Off oven cleaners, will broaden the range of products
Reckitt offers retailers and allow it to make better use of its marketing
expenditure. Reckitt could also apply to Lysol its skill at extending the
range of brands and take it into new markets.
North American sales by Reckitt after the acquisition and related disposals
will be about Pounds 775m, about 35 per cent of the group total, compared
with Pounds 553m and 26 per cent now. Once integration is complete in 1997,
the synergies will be worth some Pounds 40m a year in operating profits in
addition to the money Reckitt and L&amp;F are currently making, Mr Sankey said.
In a world increasingly dominated by large over-the-counter drugs companies,
Reckitt will be a small player. Mr Sankey said yesterday its drugs 'were a
very fine piece of business' both for its brands and growing penetration in
south-east Asia which it intended to exploit.
But the division could be worth some Pounds 500m to a big player, analysts
suggest. A sale would give Reckitt the resources to make further
acquisitions to build itself into a worldwide household products company.

FT  27 SEP 94 / BT alliance with three Nordic partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications yesterday boosted its international ambitions on
the announcement of a partnership agreement with three of Scandinavia's four
national telecommunications operators.
Norwegian Telecom, Telecom Finland and Tele Danmark, the Danish national
operator, will work with BT to market one-stop international telecoms
services across Scandinavia.
The move marks a further stage in the division of the world's leading
telecoms operators between three rival alliances, each bidding to become the
leading supplier of international telecoms services to multinational
companies.
The deal pitches BT into fierce competition with Unisource, a grouping of
European telecoms operators which recently forged an alliance with AT&amp;T, the
largest US operator.
AT&amp;T is BT's main challenger in the international arena.
Telia, the Swedish state operator, is one of Unisource's four European
members. BT and its Nordic partners yesterday highlighted Sweden's business
market as their principal target. They aim to exploit Sweden's open telecoms
regime to offer a pan-Nordic telecoms service to multinationals in the
region.
Telia already faces intense competition in its home business market. A
senior executive said that France Telecom has been offering Swedish
multinationals discounts of up to 30 per cent on international traffic.
France Telecom belongs to a third alliance, which includes Deutsche Telekom,
the German state operator.
Telia said, however, that BT's Nordic alliance was 'not unexpected' given a
previous tie-up between BT and Norwegian Telecom. It called on Denmark and
Norway to end restrictions on competition in their home telecoms markets.
The backbone of BT's international strategy is its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds
3.3bn) alliance with MCI, the second-largest US long-distance operator. The
two companies have established a joint venture, 'Concert', to service
multinationals.
BT's Scandinavian deal is far more limited and none of the three Nordic
partners will take an equity stake in Concert. But all are committed to
working with BT to provide pan-Nordic services.
Mr Hans Wurtzen, Tele Danmarks' chief executive, said: 'The agreement marks
a new era for Nordic telecommunications, addressing customer needs on a
regional and global basis.'
Analysts are divided on the scope for the new alliances to develop
significant revenues, given the limited number of multinationals and the
savings they will demand from one-stop suppliers. However, the alliances are
set to exert downward pressure on Europe's high international phone prices.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Disposals at Kodak near end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of L&amp;F Household to Reckitt &amp; Colman brings Eastman Kodak almost to
the end of the ambitious disposal programme announced in May by Mr George
Fisher, its new chairman. The deal also brings total cash raised by the
programme to Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.6bn), leaving Kodak apparently
debt-free.
More important in strategic terms, it virtually completes Kodak's strategy
of returning to its basic business. This the company defines as 'imaging' -
not only traditional photographic activities but the high-tech world of
multi-media, with which Mr Fisher is familiar from his previous job as boss
of the electronics firm Motorola.
The one substantial disposal remaining is the rest of L&amp;F, consisting of DIY
products such as wood finishers. Kodak is coy about the size of this
business or how much it might fetch. However, a clue can be derived from the
fact that when it decided to sell L&amp;F in two parts - on the grounds that it
could not reach its target price for the business as a whole - that price
was rumoured to be about Dollars 2bn.
Also to be sold are a small technology subsidiary, NanoSystems, and the
research and development headquarters of Sterling, the drug company which
Kodak sold to Sanofi of France earlier this year. Sanofi has agreed to lease
the building from Kodak for a year.
When Mr Fisher arrived at Kodak last December, some observers were sceptical
about his ability to turn around a company which seemed to have lost its
way. However, the speed at which he has moved has won Wall Street's
admiration.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Cheaper books are signalled as Hodder rejects price pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, chief executive of Hodder Headline, withdrew his
company from the net book agreement yesterday, dealing a blow to the
voluntary pact which allows publishers to set minimum prices for most books
for six months after publication.
Authors such as John le Carre and Stephen King are likely to be in the front
line of discounting and might be available in hardback from as little as
Pounds 10 by December 26.
Mr Hely Hutchinson, one of the UK's more iconoclastic publishers, is the
second publisher to leave the agreement.
Reed Books, the publishing arm of Reed Elsevier, already publishes its books
'non-net' and says market share has increased as a result. 'I have been an
abolitionist since my first working day in publishing,' said Mr Hely
Hutchinson, who believes that price is an essential weapon in increasing
book sales.
After Christmas the company will offer 25-30 per cent discounts in return
for firm sales of top novels and biographies.
The Hodder Headline action surprised the Publishers' Association, whose
council last week decided unanimously to defend the net book agreement
before the Restrictive Practices Court.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has asked the court to
look at the agreement to see whether conditions have changed since it ruled
more than 30 years ago that the agreement was in the public interest.
Mr Clive Bradley, the association's chief executive, said last night that he
was 'very bullish' about the level of support for the agreement and said it
would be defended in court.
The association argues that the agreement helps to ensure that the widest
range of titles are published, keeps prices generally down and helps small
independent booksellers.
Most large publishers are believed to have renewed their support for the
agreement, but that might change if both Reed and Hodder Headline are seen
to be gaining market share.
Mr Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber &amp; Faber, the independent publisher, said
last night: 'I will be very surprised if this is not the end of the NBA.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Rail strike still on after talks fail to secure deal: Tube
workers to take action on Friday over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of averting further widespread rail disruption from midnight tomorrow
suffered a setback when the latest session of talks to resolve the
four-month signal workers dispute was adjourned late last night.
The failure to achieve a breakthrough came as members of the RMT transport
union on London Underground prepared for a 24-hour strike on Friday after
talks on their separate pay claim broke down unexpectedly yesterday.
The talks on the signal workers dispute will resume at 11am today at Acas,
the conciliation service. Last night's failure to reach a successful
conclusion suggests some difficult issues remain unresolved. Earlier both
sides had expressed hopes that they were coming together.
The RMT and the state-owned Railtrack, which operates the network's
infrastructure, have been negotiating for 60 hours over six consecutive days
on a productivity package.
Neither side would make any formal statement at the end of of the latest
session of the marathon talks. Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT's chief negotiator,
said: 'There is still a bit of work to be done.' When asked whether the
48-hour strike due to begin at midnight tomorrow was still on he replied:
'Yes, certainly.'
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, said there
was 'a lot of talking still to be done'.
Earlier in the day negotiations between RMT and London Transport lasted only
45 minutes. The union demanded a 5 per cent pay rise for its 7,000 members
who work on the Underground.
London Transport said it could not improve on a 2.5 per cent increase this
year on basic rates, already accepted by the two other rail unions. The RMT
secured a large majority in a ballot for strike action, but LT management
pointed out that no more than one in four of their members had backed a
strike.
Further disruption can be expected on the Underground after Friday but LT
said it hoped that half the network would be running through any action.
On the railways, it might be too late to call off the 48-hour stoppage even
if a deal is reached before tomorrow night. In that case, British Rail
expects more than half the services to run, with about 60 per cent of the
network being kept open by managers and supervisors operating signal boxes.
The intensity of the negotiations reflects an awareness that September 30 is
the legal deadline for a settlement. After that, British Rail's pension fund
will be redistributed as a result of the privatisation, and the signal
workers stand to lose substantial amounts of money if their basic pay rate
has not been agreed.

Armed supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide were reported to
have taken over a Haitian town yesterday, heightening concern that US troops
may have to intervene more strongly to maintain order.
The civilian unrest arose as President Bill Clinton announced that the US
was lifting all unilateral economic sanctions against Haiti, except those
targeting the outgoing Haitian military junta and its supporters.
A Haitian military official claimed that Aristide supporters had 'attacked'
and taken over the northern coastal town of Le Borgne. The town is near Cap
Haitien, where US troops shot dead 10 Haitians in a clash at a police
station at the weekend.
The latest apparent upsurge of violence has underlined the difficulty of
US-led efforts to bring about a bloodless change of power in Haiti.
US officials are concerned that, after acting to protect civilians from the
Haitian militias and police, US troops may have to intervene to protect the
Haitian security forces.
Fear of retribution is growing among the security forces, who have been
accused of repression and murders in defence of the military-backed regime
in the past three years.
'The US supports the peaceful expression of political opinions, but will not
tolerate acts of violence,' Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman in
Port-au-Prince, said in an attempt to stem popular unrest.
But in further trouble, a UN food warehouse near Port-au-Prince was
ransacked. A mob emptied it of 11 tonnes of food, a UN official said.
Mr Clinton, in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly announcing
the lifting of sanctions, said the US would act as quickly as it could to
restore water and power to Haiti.
US ambassador to the UN Ms Madeleine Albright said the decision would also
clear the way for resumption of commercial flights to Haiti. Food could be
shipped to Haiti beyond staple items permitted under the sanctions such as
flour, beans and rice, she said.
Haitians will be allowed to transfer money to and from Haiti, and Haitians
in the US will now be able to send any amount of money to family and friends
in their homeland, instead of the Dollars 50 (Pounds 32) a month allowed
under the sanctions.
But to keep the squeeze on the Haitian military officer corps and its
wealthy supporters, a total of 600 people, their assets in the US will
remain frozen and a targeted ban on their financial transactions will stay
in place.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by gold's unruffled reaction to Mr Kenneth Clarke's IMF sales
proposal, the market does not yet believe it will happen. The chancellor
will clearly have his work cut out persuading Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's
managing director, to part with gold holdings in order to assist heavily
indebted poor countries. Even if he succeeds, it will be a year or more
before any sales actually occur. The phased sales programme which might then
be introduced would probably be smaller than the large disposals undertaken
by the IMF in the 1970s. With luck, IMF sales might coincide with an end to
Canada's official sales programme, so the market might scarcely notice the
increased supply.
Even so, the fact that IMF gold sales are on the discussion agenda must damp
enthusiasm. Buoyed by indications of rising inflation in the US, gold had
been pushing towards the Dollars 400 level. Underlying demand in China and
India has recovered after a lull and the incipient economic recovery in
Europe seems likely to push up jewellery fabrication demand in Italy.
Before Mr Clarke's announcement, the danger was that the market might run up
on speculative buying, only to succumb to profit-taking as call options were
cashed in at prices about Dollars 420. If the rise now becomes more gradual,
higher prices will be more sustainable. That would please longer term
holders. It would also help calm bond market concern about the inflationary
implications of a sudden spike in the gold price, and surely please leading
central banks as well.

FT  27 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's interim results from Inchcape were on the face of it
encouraging. The impact of the strong yen on its European motor distribution
business was bad - operating profits dropped Pounds 20m as a result - but
not as bad as analysts had predicted. Moreover, strong results from other
divisions helped make up the slack, demonstrating the resilience inherent in
the group's spread of activities.
Yet some of the shine was taken off the figures because of management
caution about the outlook for the full year. Stocks, particularly of cars,
are also up sharply, highlighting an underlying weakness in Inchcape's
bargaining position with the manufacturers which supply it. Though the fall
in motor trade margins from 3.9 to 2.9 per cent largely reflects currency
movements, Inchcape is unlikely to recoup the slippage easily even when
currency pressures subside. The priority of its suppliers will be to improve
their own margins as soon as market conditions permit. Inchcape's position
as a distributor thus leaves it vulnerable to a squeeze which will limit the
cyclical upturn in its profits.

FT  27 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No one expected Bass to report much of an increase in its beer margins in
yesterday's trading statement. But the 3 per cent fall in its shares, even
in a weak market, suggests limited faith in the strategy now emerging to
secure future earnings growth. Having effectively abandoned its dash for
volume growth in beer, Bass is turning to brand management and product mix
as a way of increasing its revenues. In beer this involved driving specific
brands such as Carlsberg and Grolsch, but the pub estate is also being
expanded and upgraded with more emphasis on food. The rebranding of Holiday
Inns will put pressure on franchisees to invest in moving at least some way
upmarket.
It is hard to quibble with this approach given the market conditions Bass
faces, but Bass is coming late into food retailing in so-called
'destination' pubs where Whitbread already has an edge. Its strategy has
been less consistent than that of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which has secured
growth first through its Center Parcs and then its purchase of Chef &amp;
Brewer.
Nor is the external environment that favourable, even though price pressures
have abated. Courage has yet to reveal its strategy for coping with the
looming end of its Inntrepreneur supply contracts, while the
Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture must still aim to recoup its weak start last
year. One must hope that Mr Ian Prosser's new approach is robust enough to
withstand external pressures. Otherwise shareholders could come to regret
their willingness to tolerate his combination of the roles of chairman and
chief executive.

FT  27 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Reckitt freshens its act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strategically, Reckitt &amp; Colman's Dollars 1.55bn acquisition of Kodak's L &amp;
F household and personal care products business cannot be faulted. The group
neatly side-stepped the trap of buying the subsidiary bundled with the
do-it-yourself operations, as Kodak originally wanted. The deal provides the
group with one of the last decent-sized US household products businesses -
and one of sufficient scale to allow Reckitt to compete with the big boys in
the North American market. Abandoning the emotionally-charged food business
also looks wise. Although Reckitt's business commanded some useful niches,
it was weak internationally and even in the UK remained too small.
Nor can the company be criticised for over-paying. A price of twice sales
and 13 times earnings is in line with similar deals. Whether L &amp; F proves
good value is another question altogether. Much depends on Reckitt's ability
to achieve synergies. Its management has promised savings of Pounds 40m
during the next three years. However, the group's track record is not
auspicious. The Pounds 713m acquisition of Boyle-Midway in 1990 was not a
conspicuous success. In spite of three and a half years of economic growth,
US sales have proved mostly pedestrian, and occasionally immobile. Reckitt's
North American team may acknowledge its past mistakes, but that is no
guarantee it will not repeat them.
The debt issue is less troublesome. Reckitt's cash-flow is strong,
generating more than Pounds 100m a year. Even without the Pounds 400m
disposal programme, the company can reduce debt to present levels within
five years. Reckitt will not be a distressed seller, but that is just as
well. Large chunks of the UK food industry are on the block, but there has
not been a noticeable rush of buyers. The predicted exit multiple of one
times sales may eventually look justifiably conservative. Given the shares'
underperformance over the past three years, though, the rights issue is
thankfully small.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Russian bear's new clothes: A survey which dispels many of
the myths about the country's new business class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IGOR BUNIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new business class is emerging in Russia, rapidly and from nowhere. But
its unfamiliarity and a lack of information have led to a distorted image of
the Russian businessman in the public mind.
Since 1992, a group of sociologists at the Centre for Political Technology
in Moscow has been studying the backgrounds and attitudes of these Russian
entrepreneurs. Their findings, drawn from interviews with the leaders of 60
big and 50 medium-sized and small businesses and 10 directors of state
enterprises, do much to dispel the myths about the new business class.
These businessmen have come from a variety of backgrounds: some worked in
the black economy during the period of 'stagnation' (under Leonid Brezhnev);
some are from the old nomenklatura, those appointed to top jobs in the
communist period; some are repainted 'red directors', the former factory
bosses; and some are 'new Russians', entering business for the first time.
The new Russians seem to be the dominant element in this rising class. The
overwhelming majority of entrepreneurs are men aged between 30 and 40, with
a reasonable education.
Of those surveyed, more than 80 per cent had completed higher education.
Many are graduates of the most elite institutes in the country, some with
two degrees, some having held posts as scholars. The majority are
second-generation intelligentsia (that is, their fathers also had higher
education).
The belief that the new business leaders are mainly from national minorities
 -such as Jews, Armenians and Georgians - is not borne out by the survey, or
any other research. Figures show that 84 per cent of small and medium-sized
business leaders are ethnic Russians, which is slightly higher than their
representation in the population of Russia.
However, in big businesses, only 63 per cent of business leaders are ethnic
Russians, with a higher-than-average proportion of Jewish business leaders.
Before perestroika, business was the only area in which Jews could get
ahead.
There was no evidence in the survey that non-Russian entrepreneurs were
founding business clans composed solely of their ethnic kin - their hiring
practices were based on merit.
Findings such as these are at odds with the views about Russia's business
class which are widely held by the public. But the survey also shows the
extent to which successful Russian businessmen owe little to the past.
A few of those surveyed said they had taken part in the 'shadow' economy -
trading in foreign jeans during their student days, for example. But the
majority said they had never been part of the black economy.
Nor were many of the successful business leaders from the former communist
nomenklatura of state factory bosses, secret police and second-level
bureaucrats. Many of these ex-officials moved into business, often
privatising state property into their own hands - a practice known as
'grabitisation'.
However while the practice was widespread, it has not created successful
business leaders. The former nomenklatura survive only in regional or
sectoral pockets of economic activity.
They have not succeeded in becoming a powerful and cohesive economic group,
having entered the market independently of one another, often in competing
or conflicting activities. The survey found just a couple of clear examples
of grabitisation among the business leaders surveyed.
The idea that former 'red directors' have been the driving force behind the
market also appears ill-founded. There are almost no former factory
directors among the country's well-known entrepreneurs. Indeed, the survey
results suggested that experience has made these men too conservative to
succeed in business.
Their average age is significantly higher than that of the entrepreneurs;
more of them come from workers' families; they have often graduated from
technical colleges, while the entrepreneurs have received a higher and more
broadly based education.
The professional experience of the former 'red directors' is more limited:
they have usually worked all of their lives in one plant, rising from the
ranks of worker to that of director, or made their careers in branches of
the industrial ministries.
These directors now appear disoriented. In the past, they were guided by a
patriarchal philosophy, acting as guardians to their workers and as the
fathers of their enterprises. The power of a director depended on the number
of workers - or 'sons' - in his enterprise. Many of these directors now
understand the need to cut the workforce to raise productivity, but in
practice they find this hard to do.
Instead, they continue to hope for cheap credits from the state or rack up
large mutual debts with other enterprises. These people are unlikely to be
creators of financial or industrial empires; they can at best fulfil their
traditional role of worker-managers.
In setting up businesses since 1987, the leaders surveyed fell into two
types. The first type of entrepreneur was created to supply the party or
state, and was given first call on resources such as land and funds. The
second type began with nothing, compensating in large part for his lack of
resources with new ideas.
The borders between state-sponsored and independent businesses are fuzzy. A
number of the new enterprises, especially the medium-sized ones, steer clear
of involvement with the state machine. But the development of powerful
financial and industrial empires is impossible unless close relationships
are formed with the state.
Many of the entrepreneurs surveyed had acquired state assets on the cheap
(for instance, by buying shares in former state enterprises very cheaply
from workers), or even stole them during the haphazard break-up and sale of
state property.
Indeed, an entire philosophy seems to have been created to justify this type
of activity. Respondents explained to interviewers that they were the only
people capable of breathing life into dead state assets.
Businessmen have also managed to invest illegally-acquired capital, often
former party funds, in the developing market. However, the centre's research
suggests that the role of laundered capital has been greatly overstated.
Bribery is, however, a common practice among the new business class. Some 70
per cent of respondents in the state sector and 76 per cent in the private
sector reported that bribery was habitual, in which they were quite ready to
take part. Many pointed to the difficulty of running a business on any other
basis in a market still dominated by a state with a strong tradition of
bureaucratic corruption.
The rules for doing business remain ill-defined. However, entrepreneurs seem
to realise that it is impossible to work in a permanent state of disorder
and lack of trust. There is a standard of morality springing up between
business partners, which, by Russian standards, is high.
The new class is also developing its own value system - abandoning the
traditional Soviet notions of state tutelage in favour of the principles of
individualism and equality of opportunity. The new entrepreneurs see life as
a contest in which the strongest and the worthiest win - they wholly reject
the idea of social equality, believing instead in the creative qualities of
each human being.
And gradually, society appears to be accepting both the new rich and their
values. Between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the population believe that
only entrepreneurs can save Russia, according to polls by the Russian Centre
for the Study of Public Opinion.
However, entrepreneurs are still more likely to be viewed favourably by
those who have gained most from the new economic conditions. The majority of
Russians of a high social status said entrepreneurs were useful to Russia,
while those of a low social status believed they were damaging the country.
Overall, there remains some distance to go before the market is widely
accepted as the main organising principle of the emerging society.
Igor Bunin is director of the Centre for Political Technology.

the early hours of the morning in front of an Eiffel Tower draped with a

printing presses broke down for the second time in 21 years.
The result was that the new-look paper did not hit the streets until
yesterday afternoon. The finger was pointed at a glitch in the computer link
from the editorial centre rather than a bolshy printer who had not been
invited to the Eiffel Tower party.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
And as young, marketing-minded Hely Hutchinson was stirring up the book
trade, the industry lost one of the last remaining old guard, Colin
Haycraft, who died at the weekend at the age of 65.
He was chairman and managing director of Duckworths, one of the last
independent publishers. In 1992 he faced an attempt to oust him. Haycraft -
who paid himself Pounds 25,000 a year - simply remortgaged his house, bought
shares to regain control and kicked out those who had tried to do the same
to him.
A classical scholar, one of Haycraft's obsessions was to see the publication
of a full edition of Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of The Roman
Empire; characteristically, he denounced another publisher, Everyman, for
producing a three-volume version with 11 chapters omitted.
'The blurb on the (Everyman) slipcase gives no hint that the edition is not
complete, and as the three volumes inside are shrink-wrapped, in their
special condoms, we don't realise until we get home,' was the view of one of
the last gentleman publishers.

price-rigging? Lilley &amp; Chase, a novel set against the background of
publishing, by Tim Waterstone, founder of the Waterstone bookshop chain  -
and a noted supporter of the net book agreement. And who illustrated the

Raymond Blanc. The occasion was a celebration of the work of a husband and
wife team of sculptors, Lloyd Le Blanc and Judith Holmes Drewry. Most of the
90-odd worthies who turned up seemed unaware that their 'discovery' was so
widely shared.
The two - she does figures and he does wildlife - dispense with a London
gallery, instead wooing prospective clients to their Leicestershire studios.
Several guests had bronzes of their family in the garden, while others
prefered animals such as yearling calves. Indeed, with HMV celebrating its
75th anniversary in 1996, a bronze Nipper may soon be listening intently to
His Master's Voice in Southgate's office.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Casting a smaller net
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the authorities continue to ponder a death sentence, the Net Book
Agreement is dying of its own accord. Opponents of the 37-year old pact will
applaud Hodder Headline's announced withdrawal from the NBA. But defenders
should also welcome the news: the more voluntary the agreement appears to
be, the weaker the case for abolishing it.
Pricing agreements of some kind or another have been a part of the UK book
trade for nearly 100 years. Minimum price-setting by manufacturers was
banned in other industries in 1956. But books, it was argued, were
'different': and the Net Book Agreement survived.
Abolitionists argue that the only thing which is different about the book
industry is that it is better at scaring the competition authorities into
inaction. The 1956 decision has withstood repeated re-investigations. Last
month, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, ushered in
another one, deciding to refer the agreement to the Restrictive Practices
Court. The NBA's detractors will be hoping that this time will be different.
Yet the argument for banning it has never been entirely clear-cut.
First, and most important, it is voluntary: publishers signing it are free
to apply minimum ('net') prices to some, any or all of their books, as they
see fit. Second, it does not necessarily impede competition: indeed, the
object of the exercise is to keep as many book retailers in the market as
possible.
Why, after all, would any self-respecting manufacturer want to stop
retailers from cutting the price of their product? Once goods have been sold
to the retailer, the producer generally has an interest in the volume of
sales, not the price the retailer charges. Companies claiming that their
industries are different are generally up to no good.
Silent intimidation
But the fact that publishers have long freely opted to pursue a policy which
would lose them money in most other businesses has always been a good reason
to give the 'difference' claim a little more weight.
Opponents, however, have always countered that the agreement is not really
voluntary, and it is not really in the industry's self-interest. Some
publishers are allergic to change, and their silent intimidation of newer
members means that the industry is trapped in the past. They would rather
hold on to a restrictive practice than be forced to think of other,
potentially more lucrative ways of doing business.
As long as publishers feared publishing non-net books, the case for
abolishing the NBA as a restrictive practice was a reasonable one. But over
the past few years, a growing number of publishers, large and small, has
decided to stop netting their books, or to do so only selectively.
Guaranteed margins
Hodder Headline, which controls around 10 per cent of the most important,
trade-book, market, is one of the biggest players to have discarded the
practice. Smaller companies who may have feared leaving may be encouraged by
their decision.
But so should the NBA's remaining supporters. As long as the decision to net
is solely a business judgment by publishers, and not collusive price-rigging
exercise, they should be allowed to make decision by themselves. The number
of shops is important to the sales of books, as is the standard of service
and choice offered in each bookshop. This may have led publishers to protect
small retailers in the past by using guaranteed margins: they should be
allowed to opt for this in future.
But there may be other ways to protect small bookshops. Hodder Headline
claims it has no desire to see small retailers go to the ropes as a result
of its decision. It will merely adopt other means of subsidising them,
through special discounts instead.
This may prove a more efficient, and more profitable way of recognising that
books are different. But small bookshops are facing tough competition from
larger outlets, with or without the NBA. The world is changing: possibly,
the UK book trade has resisted change too long. Slowly, change is taking
place. It would be better for all concerned if, as seems likely, the NBA
withered away without being heavy-handedly uprooted by the Restrictive
Practices Court.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The state of the presidency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the outsider Bill Clinton won the 1992 US presidential election,
pundits most commonly attributed his victory to two things. On the one hand,
there was a hostility in the country at large to political incumbents in
general and to the Washington establishment in particular. On the other, Mr
Clinton was seen as promising solutions to America's lengthening list of
domestic problems - an agenda almost wilfully neglected by his predecessor
George Bush, who made no effort to conceal his much greater interest in
foreign affairs.
It thus seems cruel that the Clinton presidency should have arrived at its
current pass. Nearly two years on, Mr Clinton is suffering from the same,
sour, anti-Washington mood that produced Ross Perot and brought the
president his wafer-thin victory, with polls suggesting that the
congressional mid-term elections in November will create a Republican
majority in one or both houses of Congress. He has failed to deliver on the
most important element of his domestic agenda: healthcare reform will
certainly not pass this year, and may be doomed next as well.
Worse, the administration is mired in a foreign policy adventure, in Haiti,
whose outcome is at best uncertain and at worst disastrous. With such a
record, it is tempting to conclude that the presidency is already mortally
wounded, and that Mr Clinton himself bears most of the blame.
Tempting, but premature. For Mr Clinton's problems, though undoubtedly
daunting and certainly exacerbated by his own indecisiveness and naivete,
reflect more than the failings of one man. They testify to the uncertain
state of the nation he governs - anxious about its perceived social and
economic ills despite a robust economic recovery; divided about how to cure
those ailments; undecided about its place in the world.
Forgotten successes
The collapse of healthcare reform is not only a failure by Mr - or Mrs -
Clinton: it reflects a paralysis of the US's entire body politic, which when
asked to tackle the biggest issues seizes up or succumbs to a multitude of
high-spending interest groups. Mr Clinton scored some notable and easily
forgotten successes in his administration's first year: on the budget and on
north American free trade. But now - on crime, on trade, even on badly
needed reform of America's outmoded telecommunications regime - Congress
seems to experience the greatest difficulty in passing coherent or
constructive laws.
Likewise in foreign policy. Mr Clinton may be having trouble formulating a
clear view of his country's international role, or in consistently applying
principles once formulated, or in showing resolve under pressure. But in all
this he is not alone. At a time when the US has emerged as the world's only
superpower and is being asked by the rest of the world to take on
commensurate responsibilities, Americans are probably more divided about
whether, and how, to do so than at any time since world war two.
Simplistic postures
In the face of a public turning increasingly towards isolationism, Mr
Clinton has on occasion shown admirable willingness to plead the cause of
international engagement, notably in persevering with the Uruguay round of
multilateral trade negotiations. But his ability to pursue a consistent or
coherent foreign policy remains strictly circumscribed: by the simplistic
postures often struck in Congress on such issues as Bosnia; by his own need
to shore up his position among such domestic constituencies as Irish
Americans and Cuban exiles; by his past insistence on giving precedence to
domestic over international issues. It is not at all clear that any of Mr
Clinton's often vicious assailants would fare better in similar political
circumstances.
The truth is that the post-cold-war world presents challenges of a similar
order to those that broke Woodrow Wilson and underlined Franklin D.
Roosevelt's greatness. Mr Clinton is more a Wilson than a Roosevelt, and his
country's mood more akin to 1919 than 1945. America's allies should resist
the temptation to gloat or to wring their hands. Instead, they should
concentrate on damage limitation - seeking to engage America in multilateral
forums and actions wherever possible, and doing nothing that might turn the
country further in on itself.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Personal View: A world of minimal job security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BRITTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pundits are often asked whether the UK economy really can be recovering
since most people still seem so miserable. Perhaps the explanation is that,
despite the excellent performance of the economy as a whole, individuals are
quite right to be uneasy. The behaviour of the economy, and especially of
the labour market, is changing. No-one can feel altogether secure, even if
we do see years and years of steady growth with low inflation, as the prime
minister would have us believe.
Competition is hotting up, between countries, between companies and also
between individuals in the labour market. The process has been a very
gradual one, but it has been going in the same general direction now for
more than a decade.
The experience of the last recession and the present recovery suggests that
it is gathering pace. Perhaps we should try to imagine where it might lead,
to imagine a world in which job security was reduced to a minimum.
From the employer's point of view there would be obvious advantages.
Companies could expand or contract rapidly, adjusting the size of their
labour force more or less continuously. They could change the composition of
the labour force as well if they decided to change the mix of products or
the techniques of production. Sometimes they might decide to hire the same
individuals for several years in succession, because they knew that they had
skills for which the firm had a continuing need, but they would be under no
obligation to do so. Their situation would, in a word, be 'flexible'.
From the employee's point of view the situation does not seem so
comfortable. It would pay to keep one's options open and stay in touch all
the time with the external labour market. It would pay to accumulate some
reserves of savings to see one through the inevitable gaps between jobs.
On the other hand those gaps might not be quite so long if companies were
actively recruiting in the labour market all the time, and were prepared to
replace their existing workforce if the opportunity arose. It might, indeed,
not be so very different from being self-employed, especially for those who
decided to spread their risks by taking on several part-time jobs instead of
a full-time one.
Things have not gone this far, of course, and perhaps they never will. But
the direction of movement is clear enough and its implications are profound.
Not only economics is involved: for many people the company or organisation
they work for is the main focus of their loyalty and aspirations, as well as
the centre of their social life.
What will replace that focus for those who change their jobs every year or
so? How will this fit in with family life or life in a local community?
These, perhaps, are the really big questions, but there are some quite large
economic questions to ask as well.
If the labour market is to work efficiently with frequent job changes then
more resources will be needed to secure a good match between supply and
demand. There will be a greater need for 'market-makers', including
independent careers advisers, employment agencies and so on. This is a
social cost to set against the efficiency gains which may result from the
flexibility of employment from which firms will benefit.
The cost of supporting those 'between jobs' will fall in large part on the
social security system. Most of the unemployment will, hopefully, be
short-term, but there could also be an increase in longer-term unemployment
and in the numbers dependent on other forms of benefit, especially as those
who lose their jobs are likely to be those with few skills or with skills
that are no longer marketable.
There are, indeed, especially important questions about the training and
retraining of the labour force. If employees come and go so readily,
companies will have little or no incentive to pay for their training.
Individuals will have to plan and finance their own acquisition of skills
with an eye to future jobs a well as their present one. And pay
differentials for skills will have to widen sufficiently for that investment
to be worthwhile.
It is no wonder, then, that people seem anxious even as the economy
recovers. We are in a state of transition, and no one knows how far it will
go. It is a direction of change which the government has encouraged and
applauded, but it is not under its control.
Those who lose in the process will tend to blame the government, while those
who benefit will take the credit for themselves.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Gateway to China: Investment banks moving into Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment bankers are moving into Hong Kong.
It is not that they have decided that the colony's transition to Chinese
rule, in 1997, is likely to be trouble-free. Nor are they overlooking the
chances of financial turmoil, as the Hong Kong dollar's link to the US
dollar is tested in the run-up to, and during, the changeover.
But they have decided that Hong Kong is just too good an opportunity to
miss, as both the gateway to China and as a regional hub for the booming
economies of south-east Asia.
The number of employees and offices in the colony have risen sharply this
year. Swiss Bank Corp now employs 400 people, against 340 a year ago.
Goldman Sachs has grown more rapidly, now employing more than 400 people in
Hong Kong, compared with around 200 a year ago. Morgan Stanley currently
employs 450 people in Asia (excluding Japan) and expects that figure to rise
to 530 by the end of this year, from 320 last year.
'If you look at the growth rates in the region then basic maths tells you
that there are going to be enormous opportunities in the issuance and
trading of securities,' says Mark Evans, managing director of Goldman Sachs
(Asia).
Hong Kong is close to the customer, he says, and investment banking is a
client business: 'To work for the best issuing and investing clients in the
region, you have to be local and in the local information flows.' It is on
this basis that investment banks are reorganising their global operations.
Jobs that were once done in New York, London, Tokyo or Zurich are being
transferred to Hong Kong as the volume of business grows.
Swiss Bank Corporation has relocated its global head of equity trading to
Hong Kong from Zurich; it also plans to station its deputy chief executive
in Singapore. Warburg has transferred a four-person capital markets team
from London to Hong Kong to provide on the ground expertise for capital
hungry Asian companies. Salomon Brothers has created a 'syndicate desk' in
Hong Kong responsible for Asian equity transactions - formerly handled from
London.
But many of the regional jobs are coming to Hong Kong from Tokyo, with banks
concentrating on Japanese business alone from Tokyo.
Salomon Brothers upgraded Hong Kong to take charge of its Asian business,
excluding Japan, earlier this year. Staff expect that within a year the Hong
Kong office will also boast a main board director. This will be in addition
to a board director in Tokyo.
Japan still possesses the largest and most liquid financial markets in Asia
 -markets where investors can execute large transactions involving
derivatives, such as futures, options and swaps. But 'the Chinese and Asian
client likes to be serviced out of Asia and although Japan is in Asia it's
not quite the same,' says one US investment banker. 'Tokyo is a long way
away.'
Hong Kong's market, the largest in Asia after Tokyo, is relatively small.
Stock index options were only introduced last year, while the biggest
derivative instruments are warrants and index futures. But Hong Kong, not
Tokyo, is the place to tap into the powerful networks of overseas Chinese.
Overseas Chinese, numbering 20m-30m people, make up the merchant class in
much of Asia, dominating economic life in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
Indochina. However, although large in number and in wealth, they keep a low
profile. There are large anti-Chinese lobbies in many of the countries in
which they do business. There were anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia earlier
this year and the Malays have been pushing for years for a fairer
distribution in economic power.
For this reason, they prefer to hold their public assets in Hong Kong. The
colony is a Chinese city and a free market. Unlike Singapore it is also an
easy place to do business.
The banks, themselves, are wary of Singapore. They see it as a market where
information flows are restricted by government sensitivities - with limits
on how frank they can be and even greater limits on how provocative they can
be.
Banks are, nonetheless, expanding their operations in Singapore, and other
Asian emerging markets.
Typical is Warburg, which currently employs about 250 in Hong Kong. Mr
Rodney Ward arrived in Hong Kong this summer with the aim of 'building an
integrated investment banking business that has a base in Hong Kong and is
spread throughout Asia'. He says that most of the bank's expansion in
staffing will be in Korea and Taiwan - which Warburg will soon upgrade to
full branch status - and possibly in Singapore.
But by far the the bulk of banks' expansion plans are for their Hong Kong
operations. Many of Asia's other markets are monitored by regulators, who
are wary of foreign securities companies and worried that they may lose
control of their exchange rates and markets to foreigners.
Hong Kong also has the advantage of its proximity to China. Many overseas
Chinese are using their operations in Hong Kong as a springboard into China,
raising capital in the colony for operations on the mainland.
Typical is the Lippo group, an Indonesian Chinese group, which holds most of
its public assets in Hong Kong, but is directing its operations at business
opportunities in finance, hotels, electrical power and ports on the
mainland, especially in Fujian, the group's ancestral home.
Banks also see the colony as a gateway to China. Many have stationed their
'China teams' in Hong Kong, until they can be transplanted to Shanghai or
Beijing - using the colony as a staging post to marshal their resources.
These operations are necessarily more short-term.
But most of these investments are being made on the basis that the
investment banks intend to stay in Hong Kong. They are not expanding with
the intention of getting out tomorrow. Banks are betting on the colony as a
future financial centre.
Should times become too troubled, the banks would be able to move out of
Hong Kong just as quickly as they are moving in. Investment banking is a
relatively mobile industry.
And they see their other Asian offices as a way of spreading their risk:
'You could do it all from Hong Kong but you don't put everything here;
political risk militates against that so you build up the regional offices,'
says one banker.
But what they are really betting on is China. Says Mr Ward of Warburg:
'While there will be undoubtedly political uncertainty, Hong Kong's
importance as a financial centre will continue. You either believe in China
or you don't. We do.'

Sir, I admire almost all Colin Amery's contributions, even when he omits
cost as the prime reason why so few people commission architects to build
new houses in England. But his outburst against architectural competitions
is intemperate, ill-timed and wrong ('The tyranny of the few', September
26). It could have been written any time in the last century and a half;
what clearer target than that arch-conceptualist, Pugin? At least you gave
equal prominence (Arts, September 24) to William Packer's admirable plea for
professional judgment in the award of artists' prizes.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lottery must aid smaller arts
applicants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER S GUMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Antony Thorncroft's article on the lottery ('The lottery: will it end
in tears?', September 26) and the financial help it will provide for the
arts rightly highlights the need for cautious optimism. However, it fails to
make several important points about the management and policy of the Arts
Council of England, which is responsible for the distribution of these funds
to arts organisations.
First, ACE is determined to provide a significant proportion of its lottery
funds for small applications. They must not be disadvantaged. This would be
against both the spirit and the letter of the lottery legislation. From
these applicants we will not be looking for matched funding but for real
evidence that they have rigorously sought funds from private sources. If
they can only raise 10 or 15 per cent of the total required then so be it.
Indeed, we would consider revenue funding commitments from local authorities
or the private sector, for example, as part of that 10-15 per cent.
Second, so important are the smaller applications that a flexible, lower
limit for funds will be set at around Pounds 5,000 to encourage a balance
between the size of successful applications.
Third, we are happy for those applying, but particularly smaller arts
organisations, to come to the lottery first before going outside for funds.
We can tell them whether they qualify; and, if so, give a conditional grant
and thereby a head start in raising private finance for the balance.
If all the lottery does is fund the large arts organisations, vital and
important though they are in the UK, then the lottery will not have been a
disaster. However, it will have failed to fulfil its real potential in
providing money for small arts organisations in villages, towns and cities
up and down the country.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Uncertain workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Workers' Rights' (September 21), rightly points out that
the principle of security of employment established by the European
Commission's Acquired Rights directive is inappropriate when applied to
short-term contracts for public services.
While the revised directive to which the Commission has agreed goes some way
to solving this problem, the wording is so uncertain that its scope could
only be properly determined after litigation in the European Court.
Companies in the service sector have faced two problems with the directive
over the past two years; the problem of applying it to service contracts,
and legal uncertainty as to whether it applied in the first place. While the
former might ultimately be solved by the Commission's proposal, this would
follow a renewal of uncertainty which could take years to resolve.
Further clarity is required. Fortunately, the revised directive remains to
be agreed by the Council of Ministers. It appears that several member states
are now as concerned as the British government at the impact of the
directive on their programmes of privatisation and contracting out.
Because of this, business interests across Europe must press for their
national governments to demand further changes, clearly excluding service
contracts from the scope of the directive, before it is agreed to by the
Council of Ministers.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Criticism of progress in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M MOHANDAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stefan Wagstyl's analysis of India's economy ('Not nearly radical
enough,' September 19) deserves praise as it was very constructive and
accurate.
I also trade with a very reputable Indian company and all the Indian
businessmen I meet are unanimous in their criticism of the slow progress of
Indian economic reforms. There are still many areas where the reforms have
not achieved any real change. Foreign investors still have to pay hefty
capital import duties for machinery. Interstate taxes also need urgent
reforms.
As for Srichand Hinduja's letter (September 22) criticising Stefan Wagstyl's
article, I cannot see it serving any useful purpose other than highlighting
his involvement in power plant developments in India. It is also interesting
to note Gordon Wu of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong is planning Dollars
12.7bn power plants in India. This is even better news for India.

The changes to the Labour party are not quite complete. There is more work
to do. For a start there is that dreadful colour, red. Blue is so much more
sympathetic. Then there is that awful song, the Red Flag. Surely something
better could be sung at the conclusion of next week's party conference? Land
of Hope and Glory, possibly? The delegates might be given little Union Jacks
to wave as the leader takes his bows. Not least is the need to look again at
the party's name. We must be frank here. On its track record of the past 15
years, 'Labour' is not exactly bankable as a harvester of hearts, minds and
little crosses on ballot papers. The word 'Conservative' springs to mind.
That has proven potential.
Yeah yeah. Say it. The old cracks are truly the best ones. The line about
Land of Hope and Glory is to be found in this morning's 'open letter to Tony
Blair' from Demos, an eclectic think-tank. The Labour leader is doing well,
but he cannot avoid such observations. During the past few years he has
given some of us the impression that he seeks to make truly revolutionary
changes to the Labour party. I suspect that, if he could, he would rename it
 -not 'Conservative', of course, but, say, 'Democratic'.
Short of the absurd, Mr Blair will do what he believes is necessary to win.
Perhaps he is mindful of the sermons of Hugh Blair, an 18th century divine
whose works were known to Jane Austen. I like to imagine that the
long-forgotten clergyman to whom she refers in Mansfield Park is one of the
Labour leader's ancestors. 'Let us then neglect no means which may be of
avail for procuring the grace and favour of that divine Providence on which
so much depends,' this ancient Blair preached. 'Because Providence is
superior to us, it does not follow that therefore man has no part to act; or
because our industry is sometimes disappointed, that therefore it is always
in vain.'
To date, little of Mr Blair's industry has been without fruit. Not content
with snatching the label of purveyor of law and order from the Tories, he is
engaged this week on an exercise designed to portray the government as a
bunch of profligates and the people's party as the ark of fiscal prudence.
Yesterday Ms Harriet Harman was put up to deliver an ingenious recalculation
of the public expenditure tables, allocating so much to 'rescue' spending
and so much to 'renewal'. It appears that the former has risen and the
latter fallen. Fancy.
We need not spend time debating whether the shadow chief secretary's sums
are accurate. That is beside the point. What is going on is the manipulation
of our perceptions. The Tories are branded tax liars, which is only right
considering their ruthless disregard of veracity during the April 1992
election campaign. They have failed to manage the economy properly, says
Labour, with less chance of being believed now that the prospect of a long
period of non-inflationary growth lies before us. Never mind. We are to take
it that 'rescue' spending, on social security, is the consequence of
Conservative economic failure. Today Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
will follow through with the argument that the old dispute about which party
is likely to tax us more belongs to a bygone era. The terms of the debate
are to be changed. There are no quick fixes on offer. Labour, he will
intimate, will invest for the long term.
Decoded, this had better mean 'no new taxes', or it will not help Providence
to do its work of granting the opposition a spell in government. Mr Brown
need not say as much in so many words. Like Mr Blair the shadow chancellor
is blessed by his opponents, both inside his party and beyond. Think about
it. The Labour left, depleted in numbers, is still quoted on the airwaves.
There will be trouble at next week's party conference, the broadcasts warn
us. It does not sound like much of a threat to me.
The traditional left is a damp squib. It should be called the Pipsqueak
tendency. Yet Mr Peter Hain and Dr Roger Berry, both MPs who cast doubt on
the Brown-Blair-Harman strategy, serve a useful purpose. As critics who are
easily squashed, they give verisimilitude to the centrist proposition that
Labour modernisers want us to digest. The Conservative chief secretary to
the treasury is equally helpful. 'I can hardly believe my ears,' said Mr
Jonathan Aitken yesterday, after hearing Ms Harman's remarks. 'Here we have
the shadow chief secretary attacking the Tories over money they are spending
on the poor and the unemployed.'
Precisely. Labour's pitch is that it will manage a dynamic market economy
better than the Conservatives. When it succeeds, it can help the worse-off.
Wealth creation first, redistribution, maybe, to follow. It is not
socialism, but Providence has little patience with that outmoded creed. The
new doctrine is impertinent, but no more so than Mr Blair's campaign on
cutting down crime, or his statement that he thinks it better for children
to be raised by two parents than one. He is running for office in a
conservative country, and must campaign accordingly.
There is plenty of evidence in favour of such an accommodation. A new Fabian
pamphlet, Any Southern Comfort, by Giles Radice and Stephen Pollard, draws
on focus group research to establish that while Labour is better regarded
than it was, it is still on probation. White collar and skilled manual
employees, floating voters to a man and woman, are worried about crime,
jobs, health care, their children's futures. These anxieties have arisen
under a succession of Conservative ministries. Labour is correct to
concentrate on them, but it has not yet convinced sufficient potential
converts that it will make the streets safe and enlarge the employment
market without raising taxes or restarting inflation.
Labour's theft of chunks of the Tories' image is a direct response to this
kind of research. It may not please Demos, whose wish-list demands that Mr
Blair produce a vision of Britain as a 'teleworkshop of the world'. He is
asked to end middle class tax reliefs to finance a basic income tax rate of
15 per cent, as suggested by Mr Frank Field some years ago, and adopt other
policies regarded by Demos authors as radical. And why not? We all project
our fantasies on to Labour's changing screen. Mr Blair's job is to select
those that assist Providence to assist him.

<TEXT>
Sir, In his article (The Long View: 'When numbers deceive', September 24),
Barry Riley expresses his concern at the obstacles in the way of measuring
true performance. In the process, he castigates those who do not report
return on capital and those who have problems with the latest accounting
standard concerning acquisitions. One effect of new accounting rules passed
by the majority of the Accounting Standards Board is that figures for return
on capital will become increasingly misleading because reported capital will
not contain the total cost of acquisitions.
This was one reason for my dissenting opinion at the ASB.

<TEXT>
Sir, My publishing business is relocating. As our customers cover the globe,
I wanted to leave a message giving our new phone number in English, French
and German. Imagine my utter amazement to discover that BT is incapable of
doing this. The message can only be in English. And what is the cost of this
recorded message? Pounds 50 a quarter]
Right across Europe I listen to recorded messages re-routing me in every
language under the sun.
Yes, I could leave an answering machine on the line to give a message in
English, French and German. But then, of course, I would have to continue to
to pay BT for the line.
The alternative is to have calls re-routed through to the new number. For
this BT charges Pounds 82.60 a quarter plus a Pounds 50 charge for
connection. The service is only available for a minimum of 12 months - so
the re-routing option costs a minimum of Pounds 380.40. And you have to pay
local call rates on top for every transferred call.
Could all this reflect the fact that BT faces no competition in this area?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN BYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peggy Hollinger's article, 'Water company appeals to MMC on price caps'
(September 22) suggests that I have taken a tougher approach with South West
Water as it had the highest charges and price increases since privatisation
in 1989.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commissions will doubtless look at this. I
contend that the methodology I used in setting price limits was applied
fairly and consistently across all companies.
It is not true that I promised South West Water (in 1991 at the time of its
interim determination) price increases after 1995 similar to its current
K-factor of 11 per cent. At that time I had already announced that I would
be resetting all the company price limits from April 1 1995, including South
West Water's, at a periodic review in July 1994. It is only at periodic
reviews that I am able to examine all the issues underlying price limits.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: Pre-Raphaelites unbuttoned - William Packer admires
the exhibition of drawings at the BM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The richness and scope of the collections in the British Museum's Department
of Prints and Drawings alone, to say nothing of the whole place, are an
unending source of surprise and delight. And it is gratifying to discover
that even in these lean times, the work of scholarly accumulation has
quietly gone on. Two new displays, drawn entirely from within the
collections, the one of English drawings and water-colours, the other of
French prints, neatly make the point. Both are comparatively modest in
scale, yet both are as comprehensive as one could wish.
But why are drawings still so much the province of the specialist and
connoisseur? Is it that they, vulnerable and fugitive, are altogether too
problematical for the ordinary collector? Is it that the market itself,
conforming to prejudice, is still reluctant to set an inherent rather than a
comparative value to works on paper, save with proven or rarer masters?
For myself, I would as soon be engrossed by drawings, old or new, as by any
of the more substantial works, to which, perhaps, they led. For with drawing
we find ourselves taken immediately into the intimate presence of the
artist, unselfconscious in his private engagement with his subject, his
interests and ideas. We are with him in his scrutiny of the figure or
object; with him as he teases image from imagination; ever following his
hand across the page.
In all of this the pre-Raphaelites are admirable companions. In their
youthful, mid-Victorian, high-minded earnestness, they can be quite as
off-putting as they are fascinating. We may admire the technical
accomplishment and beauty of the work, and yet recoil still from the
religiosity, the sentimentality, the priggishness. Or so we might say of the
full-dress paintings.
But here they are with their collars loosened, as it were, lively and
personal in their address and as light-hearted and funny as they are
serious. They work up their formal compositions as the merest sketches and
cartoons; they draw their models and lovers with easy familiarity and
affection; they sit in the field and paint the barns and houses as the sun
goes down.
And yet, for all the apparent informality or simplicity, these are works of
real achievement, and often the more so for being so slight or modest.
Millais' skinny lady delicately cuts a flower from the trellis, her little
boy up to no good by her side, an image that contrives to be at once ideal,
statuesque and a miracle of amused and accurate personal observation.
Rossetti turns incessantly to his adored Miss Siddal - now standing,
sitting, day-dreaming, now windswept on the beach with a gentleman friend.
Charles Collins' studies for his 'Railway Accident' combine poignancy with
reality, the lady anxious at the clerk's shoulder as the news comes through
on the telegraph. Ruskin paints the ivy on a rock, George Boyce,
exquisitely, a Streatley farmhouse, Henry Holiday two women in fancy-dress,
Burne-Jones a wistful Annunciation. Frederick Sandys' drawing of stunning
Ruth Herbert is magnificent. There are many such treats.
The Shadow of the Forest, in the same room, is a collection of prints by the
artists of the Barbizon School, more or less the pre-Raphaelites'
contemporaries. Barbizon is a village on the edge of the Forest of
Fontainbleau, south-east of Paris, which artists had been visiting since the
early 19th century. The ascription to it of a school of painters is more
convenience than hard art-historical fact, for artists came and went in the
loosest of fellowships. It is rather in their commitment to working close to
the landscape in the open air, in which they foreshadowed the
Impressionists, that the significance of Barbizon's painters lies.
They were by no means the first to do so, and the show makes no secret of
their influences, from Constable and Bonington to Rembrandt and Ruysdael.
Nor were they principally print-makers. But the print, the etching
especially, has always been attractive to artists for its convenience, given
a workshop, and directness. The multiple image largely met the problem of
permanence, and there was throughout the 19th century the ever-growing
attraction of publishing editions for the mass market.
But the engraved reproduction of paintings is a secondary business and less
interesting in this context than the artist's direct engagement with the
image, the plate and the processes of the print. A smaller edition could
always achieve a reasonable return. All the major figures are represented in
this way - Millet, Daubigny, de la Pena, Corot, besides Jongkind and Israels
from the Hague.
In every case, the closer they stay to the direct act of drawing, and to the
particular qualities of line and tone that only the etching can achieve, the
better. And Corot stands out among them all for the sheer bravura of his
line and touch. His use of the now obscure cliche-verre, that marries
etching to photography, could not be more sympathetic.
Pre-Raphaelite Drawings in the British Museum; Shadow of the Forest - Prints
of the Barbizon School: both exhibitions at the British Museum, Great
Russell Street WC1, until January 8.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: The Tate shortlists 13 to build for the millennium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The race is on to design one of the most prestigious of the millennium
projects, and one that seems likely to get the go-ahead - the Tate Gallery
of Modern Art on London's Bankside. Yesterday 13 architects were
shortlisted, with the field being whittled down to five by November 21, and
the winner to be announced in February.
Two leading British architects, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, who are
already involved with millennium projects at the British Museum and the
South Bank, decided not to submit. The candidates going forward, in an
international list, are Alsop &amp; Stormer; Arata Isozaki (Japan); David
Chipperfield; Future Systems; Herzog &amp; de Meuron (Switzerland); Michael
Hopkins; Nicholas Grimshaw; Office for Metropolitan Architecture
(Netherlands); Rafael Moneo (Spain); Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Italy);
Rick Mather; Rolfe Judd/ Claudio Silvestrin; and Tadao Ando (Japan).
The building will cost at least Pounds 40m (while the overall cost will be
Pounds 80m) and work should start in the summer of 1996 in readiness for an
opening in 2000. The Bankside project is unusual in that it involves an
existing building, Gilbert Scott's 1947 power station, most of the exterior
of which will be retained. Because the gallery will house mainly
international art, there seems to be no prejudice against an overseas
architect and Tadao Ando has already been tipped as a possible winner.
Now the Tate's director, Nicholas Serota, will embark on an acquisition
drive to plug the gaps in the Tate's modern collection before 2000. He will
buy works, but also hopes for gifts from Friends of the Tate and will be
approaching leading artists asking for fine examples of their work in return
for immortality.
Meanwhile work will start next year on the revamp of the old Tate, which
will increase the space available to show British art by a quarter. It is
made possible by a Pounds 12m donation from an anonymous American
benefactor.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: Philadelphia, Here I Come - Theatre in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New York theatre season is off to a promising start with Joe Dowling's
top-notch revival of Brian Friel's early play Philadelphia, Here I Come, at
the Roundabout Theatre.
After the Broadway failure last year of Friel's strained, heavy-handed
Wonderful Tennessee, New York needed to see this Irish playwright at his
best. And Philadelphia, which premiered in Dublin in 1964 and on Broadway in
1966, is echt Friel: poetic, wistful, aching, and funny, it is full of the
playwright's characteristic fascinations: memory, the isolation of a
transcendent moment of happiness and, above all, the Irishman's search for
personal and national identity.
Like many of Friel's plays, Philadelphia is set in the fictional town of
Ballybeg, on 25-year-old Gareth O'Donnell's last night in Ireland before he
leaves, probably forever, for America. Gar is of two minds about going away,
which Friel represents quite literally: two actors play Gar, one his outer
self (Jim True), and the other his private thoughts (Robert Sean Leonard).
His mother long dead, Gar lives and works with his uncommunicative father
(Milo O'Shea), who still treats the young man as if he were a child. In the
play's best scene, father and son exchange banalities at the dinner table,
while Gar's alta ego mocks, curses, wheedles and exhorts the expressionless
older man.
Even more tragic than the boy's non-relationship with his father is his
estrangement from himself. Behind closed doors, both public and private
selves come alive, but around other people, Gar watches life happen,
inwardly commenting on the action but unable to participate. Gar's passivity
has already bred one cataclysmic mistake: he let the girl he still loves
(the radiant Miriam Healy-Louie) get away, a painful episode he recalls in
flashback.
Most of the play, however, progresses in real time, as various people pass
through the house to give Gar their regards. As much as Friel casts a
cynical eye on Irish society, he does not romanticise the alternative:
America's representative is Gar's brash and pretentious Irish-American aunt,
whose invitation to Philadelphia offers Gar his escape.
Dowling's production has a marvellously directorless quality, as if the
events on stage were happening for the first time. The two young actors are
excellent. True plays outer Gar like a brooding time bomb, while Leonard is
a fine inner Gar, capturing both the character's cynicism and his
childishness. The redoubtable O'Shea and Pauline Flanagan fit so naturally
into their roles as the father and his loving but acid-tongued housekeeper
that John Lee Beatty seems to have designed them as part of the
picture-perfect set.
American appetites whetted for more Friel will be sated later this season:
Noel Pearson is planning a Howard Davies-directed Broadway production of the
playwright's 1981 Translations in March, and talk of bringing Friel's
latest, Molly Sweeney, to New York has surely escalated after the New York
Times' rave review of its premiere production at Dublin's Gate Theatre
earlier this month.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: Mahler's 2nd - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the equipment was in place for Mahler's Symphony no. 2 at the Barbican
on Sunday, the second instalment of Michael Tilson Thomas's Mahler cycle.
The London Symphony was on cracking form, with the requisite extra brass,
and the London Symphony Chorus in glad cry; two excellent solo voices made
vivid personal contributions (very welcome) to the massive sound. This was
certainly a 'Resurrection' Symphony to wake the dead.
If you detect a note of reserve in this, it may indicate nothing more than a
jaded appetite. Mahler's grandiose canvas was brightly lit up (granted a
couple of smudges in the offstage brass, which made no difference), and the
newly improved acoustic proved itself again at the monster climaxes - plenty
of impact, without clotting or congestion. There was little in the way of
chiaroscuro, nor does the Barbican Hall afford much room for depth-effects.
Tilson Thomas delivered the score with sharp precision and some mildly
unusual ideas. The low-strings recitative at the start was fast and hard,
tempo giusto, a far cry from the sullen lament that older conductors used to
make of it, but most of that opening movement was solemn and quiet; so too
the Andante moderato, though tautly measured. Contrariwise the Scherzo, made
newly famous by Berio's Sinfonia, went like the wind: the sense of a
sinister moto perpetuo was enhanced, at the loss of any black humour.
The 'Urlicht' movement went to the Parisian contralto Nathalie Stutzmann,
whose exquisitely wrought line came in a lovely, dusky timbre. Suddenly the
symphony showed a human face. Nina Stemme (Cardiff's 'Singer of the World'
last year) joined her in the Finale, with a fine-spun, tremulous tone
perfectly adapted to her music. The timpani thundered mightily, and the
Chorus roared their heads off. One felt a bit battered at the end.
What to play with Mahler Two is always a problem. It is a tad short for an
evening, but hardly brooks anything substantial by way of programme-filler.
Tilson Thomas opted for a little Oliver Knussen commission from six years
ago, his racing, twinkling 'Flourish with Fireworks' (it nods gracefully to
Stravinsky's Fireworks), and an earlyish Krenek piece Die Nachtigall, for
coloratura soprano with flutes and strings, in which Sarah Leonard warbled
with all her customary charm. It seemed hardly ten minutes before we were
out in the bar again for the interval.

Social issues abound on the screens this evening. The award winning Canadian
mini-series Look who's talking: the Boys of St Vincent (Channel 4 at 10pm)
is based on an actual case in which a Catholic priest abused the children in
his orphanage. Many of the parts are taken by non-professional actors.
Look Who's Talking: My Dad is Mrs Bottomley (Channel 4 at 9pm) examines the
lives and aspirations of three teenagers stuck in a children's home in south
east England.
There is no shortage of TV dramas set in hospitals, but writer Donna
Franceschild has pushed the genre one step on by placing Takin' over the
Asylum in a psychiatric hospital. Ken Stott leads as the hospital DJ who
tries to bring back radio to a hospital where life revolves around the
television set. Former patients are included in the cast of this six part
series (BBC 2 9pm).
Network First (ITV at 10.40) offers a documentary about Cuba which includes
a lengthy interview with Fidel Castro.
For light relief there is the TV version of Paul Merton's Palladium show of
earlier this year (BBC 1 at 10.20).

FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: Dangerous Liaisons - Opera in San Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PFAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two centuries and numerous stage and screen adaptations later, The Dangerous
Liaisons emerged in a new incarnation as The San Francisco Opera mounted the
world premiere of Conrad Susa's and librettist Philip Littell's opera.
It is baffling that the company commissioned Susa to create its first
full-scale premiere in 18 years. It had previously produced two Susa operas
for a spring season (Transformations) and for its apprentice singers (The
Love of Don Perlimplin), neither of which proved musically memorable
occasions. While Liaisons, now being filmed for television, may well prove
more memorable, its musically faceless score is unlikely to linger long in
the mind.
Ironically, for an opera about people obsessed with appearances and style,
Susa's score is virtually devoid of a unifying musical style - or even
personality. The orchestral carpet is a tangle of meandering sounds and the
vocal writing lacks tension, shape, and even a rudimentary sense of
direction. But for all that, San Francisco's expert cast, headed by
Frederica von Stade as the Marquise de Merteuil and Thomas Hampson as the
Vicomte de Valmont, took to the vocal parts as if they were top-drawer
Verdi.
Strangely, the most obvious blemish on Susa's score, its orchestration, may
not represent his own work. The programme discreetly identified Donald
Ontiveros, Manly Romero, and an entity called Music Publications
Technologies under a new category, 'Orchestration and editorial assistance.'
And in the weeks preceding the premiere there were rumours of other people,
with the requisite musical acumen (or the right software), orchestrating
this passage or that.
Music director Donald Runnicles lent his customary tireless energy and
cogent leadership to the enterprise, but there is a limit to what even a
music director can ask.
In most other respects, the makings of a promising opera seemed on hand.
Littell's English verse libretto - drawn directly from the Pierre Choderlos
de Laclos novel - proved serviceable, although Susa's heavy hand with the
musical applique did make one grateful for the surtitles. Production
director Colin Graham cleverly realised the letter motif that underlies
every aspect of this complex tale and effectively staged the overlapping of
scenes, characters, and even time and space frames that are at the heart of
Littell's play.
Resident designer Gerard Howland's fluid settings and costumes unearthed
subtle connections within the overall picture of decadent beauty. And Thomas
Munn's lighting was dramatic and narrative in its own right. All that said,
it was the cast that made the work as involving as it became. (Subject
matter notwithstanding, the long first act was simply dull.) As the Marquise
de Merteuil, Frederica von Stade was formidable and husky of tone one
minute, vulnerable and kittenish the next, and typically - but arrestingly -
sympathetic in her portrayal.
Thomas Hampson's Valmont was similarly fine-grained, convincingly sinister
and susceptible without once defaulting to stage cliche. Renee Fleming's
melting, then molten, performance as the tormented Madame de Tourvel took
over the second act, as it should.
Judith Forst's imperious Madame de Volanges, Mary Mills' complex and
affecting Cecile, and Johanna Meier's worldly-wise Madame de Rosemond were
accomplished, affecting musical characterisations. Australian tenor David
Hobson's Danceny was convincingly hormonal but had yet to come into focus.
The comprimario roles were played faultlessly.
Despite the cumulative theatrical power of this Liaison's second act, it is
so musically evanescent as to become, in the end, insubstantial and
unmemorable. As currently scored, Conrad Susa's The Dangerous Liaisons
becomes the latest entrant in a dispiriting string of American opera
premieres. In a savagely defiant final tableau, von Stade's Merteuil - in a
harsh caricature of Strauss' Capriccio Countess departing for a dinner of
Weltschmerz - exits with the raspy, vulgar exclamation, 'I'm hungry.' So, it
happens, are we.

FT  27 SEP 94 / People: Philip Jarrold to head Vernons pools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years with Peaudouce, the nappy manufacturer, managing director
Philip Jarrold is to head Vernons, Ladbroke's pools division, from next
month.
Before joining Peaudouce, which is part of the Swedish SCA/Molnlycke group,
Jarrold, 44, had worked for Reed Elsevier, Kraft Foods and Mars.
Ladbroke said it thought Jarrold's experience would be vital in helping to
counter the imminent threat of the national lottery, which begins in
November. It said it particularly valued Jarrold's expertise in dealing with
retailers.
Although pools coupons are often available in tobacconists' shops, their
legal status in retailers' premises has been unclear. However, as part of
the attempt to allow other gambling products to compete with the national
lottery, pools companies are being given a formal right to distribute
coupons through retail outlets.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Technology: Ship-shape for the high seas - Robert Corzine
explains why floating oil production systems may prove increasingly popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like its mythological namesake, the Gryphon, a tanker-like vessel anchored
in the North Sea 200 miles northeast of Aberdeen in Scotland, is an unlikely
combination.
From a distance it looks like any other large oil tanker. But whereas most
such vessels measure their lives in millions of miles travelled, over the
next 15 years or so the Gryphon is unlikely to move more than a few metres
from its present position.
Part ship, part crude oil and natural gas processing and storage plant, the
Gryphon represents the latest thinking on how to exploit remote offshore
petroleum deposits too small to justify building a large and expensive
conventional platform fixed to the sea bed.
Roy Phillips, an executive with Kerr-McGee, the US company that operates the
Gryphon, says the decision to use a floating production, storage and
offloading system (FPSO) saved 40 per cent over the cost of a conventional
platform.
In addition, the early availability of the ship, which had been built as a
floating oil storage vessel on a speculative basis in Spain, meant the
company was able to produce the first oil from the field in October last
year, about a year after the go-ahead was given. First oil production from a
conventional platform would not have been possible until early 1996, he
says.
Although the Gryphon is the only FPSO operating in the UK sector of the
North Sea and one of only a dozen or so in the world, industry observers
expect them to become an increasingly common sight in coming years. Wood
MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil consultants, earlier this year estimated
that nine UK North Sea fields being considered for development will use some
form of floating production system, with two-thirds expected to adopt a
ship-shape solution similar to the Gryphon.
The effectiveness of FPSOs have been enhanced by progress in a number of
technical areas. The method used to keep the Gryphon on station is
straightforward: a turret at the centre of the vessel is secured to the
seabed by 10 anchors, each weighing 35 tonnes. The vessel, which has five
thrusters mounted along its hull, is able to rotate around the turret so
that it is always lying head to the wind.
The 'smart' part of the system lies within a sophisticated computer software
system. It receives precise navigational data from automatic electronic
identification systems, or 'transponders', on the seabed and satellite
transmissions. It also receives constant weather data and updates on the
stresses on each anchor chain, before recommending to the crew that they
activate one or more of the thrusters.
The system can also 'learn the weather and react to it', according to the
Gryphon's crew. Its effectiveness is such that the maximum lateral motion
experienced by the ship in last winter's Force 10 gales, with winds gusting
to 120 miles an hour, was 30 feet, although it can move more than three
times that.
Other technical advances have also made FPSOs more cost-effective. New metal
alloys, for example, have helped to reduce the cost of the flexible pipes
which lead from the wells, located on the sea bed 1,500 metres from the
ship.
Kerr-McGee executives expect the operating costs of the Gryphon to be
relatively low. The vessel is not due to return to port during its planned
15-year stay in the North Sea. The double-skinned hull allows inspections to
be made on site, says Roy Phillips, while the hull is protected from
corrosion by an electrical system, or anode array.
But the big cost advantage of FPSOs over their fixed counterparts will come
when the field is depleted. For the Gryphon, with a life expectancy of 40
years, will be able simply to weigh anchor and steam to a new site anywhere
in the world.

FT  27 SEP 94 / People: Newton sails into Kingshott's harbour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Wilfred Newton, 65, the former chief executive of London Transport, has
been appointed non-executive chairman of John I. Jacobs, the small
ship-broking and transportation group headed by Michael Kingshott, chairman
of the Sally ferry line.
Kingshott, who reversed his private Sheertrucks vehicle transportation
business into Jacobs a few months ago, wants to develop Jacobs into a
broadly-based shipping, transport and property group.
The company is currently capitalised at less than Pounds 20m but is known to
be interested in bidding for Embassy Property, where Kingshott is deputy
chairman. Last week it agreed to manage the Dartford International ferry
terminal and announced that the terminal's first customer will be Sally
Freight which is launching a two-ship freight service between Dartford and
Vlissingen.
Sir Wilfred (right), who sits on the boards of HSBC Holdings, its subsidiary
Midland Bank, and Sketchley, qualified as an accountant in South Africa and
had a varied career in industry before being appointed chairman of the Mass
Transit Railway Corporation in Hong Kong in 1983.
Kingshott said that he had been keen to recruit a chairman who was not just
a 'mate of mine' and had a good knowledge of the transportation business. He
said he had found Sir Wilfred through his merchant bank (Hambros) and his
own personal network.
Kingshott, the biggest single shareholder in John I Jacobs, intends to
rename the company and appoint more non-executives to his board. Earlier
this month, Paul Pascan, Sally Line's financial controller, was appointed a
non-executive director.

WEW, the company previously known as Amber Day which runs the What Everyone
Wants chain of discount stores, has lost another senior executive. Elaine
Gray, 34, the buying director, has left by mutual agreement for 'personal
and private reasons'.
Peter Carr, chairman, says he is sorry to lose Gray, who joined the company
at a young age and worked there for nearly 17 years.
Following the resignation last month of managing director Ian Grabiner, and
the loss of a chief executive and two chairmen within the past two years,
Gray's departure is a blow for the group, which is currently engaged in an
expansion programme. However, Carr says recent restructuring of the buying
department, with the addition of four new people, will lessen the disruption
caused by her departure.

FT  27 SEP 94 / People: Foley quits Triplex Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The managerial merry-go-round at Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands
engineering group, took another whirl yesterday as John Foley stepped out as
group managing director and Graham Lockyer stepped in.
Lockyer, 47, a former Dowty executive, joined Triplex Lloyd only in July as
group operations director, reporting to Foley. Foley, 38, became finance
director in 1989 and, since 1991, a partner with Colin Cooke, the chairman,
in the reorientation of Triplex Lloyd as a group concentrating on precision
components.
Cooke said there was 'an amicable understanding' with Foley. 'We need a
strong operations guy - we're a very technical company.' Lockyer is just
that in Cooke's view.
Foley's background is accounting and the law, while his talents, according
to Cooke, 'are more on the financial, acquisitions side'.
Foley and Cooke have apparently been talking about Foley's future since
early summer, so Lockyer's arrival foreshadowed Foley's departure. 'I'm
perfectly relaxed about it. I'd like to go off and do other things,' Foley
says.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Technology: X-ray vision of the future - A new
'super-microscope' facility for probing the structure of molecules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest and brightest X-ray source, the Pounds 300m European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, begins operating this week.
Twelve European nations have clubbed together to build the ESRF in Grenoble,
at the foot of the French Alps. It will give academic and industrial
researchers a super-microscope for probing the atomic and molecular
structure of materials.
Several thousand scientists are expected to use the ESRF over the next few
years from many fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, materials
science, geology, environmental studies and medicine. Applications range
from examining surface corrosion of metals to identifying the structure of
enzymes as potential targets in pharmaceutical research.
The ESRF has 11 X-ray beams in operation, generating radiation one billion
times brighter than a typical hospital X-ray machine. By 1998, 40 beams will
be available.
X-rays are well suited for probing molecular structures because their
wavelengths - less than a millionth of a millimetre - are similar to the
distances between atoms in molecules.
The main technique for discovering the structure of an unknown compound,
X-ray crystallography, has been known for 80 years. Its best known success
was in enabling James Watson and Francis Crick to propose a double helix
structure for DNA.
But deducing a structure from an X-ray diffraction pattern is still a very
tricky and time-consuming job; the brilliant, narrowly focused beams from
the ESRF will give clearer patterns than conventional sources.
Synchrotron radiation is given off whenever charged particles are
accelerated close to the speed of light. When scientists first observed the
phenomenon in the primitive particle accelerators of the 1940s, they found
it a nuisance because it diverted energy from the particles.
But by the 1960s they realised that synchrotron radiation was a useful
research tool in its own right and they started to tap the X-rays emitted by
accelerators that had been designed for fundamental physics research.
During the 1970s and 1980s, about 40 accelerators were built around the
world as dedicated synchrotron radiation sources.
The ESRF is the first of a new generation of ultra-bright synchrotron
machines. It will be followed by the US Advanced Proton Source, due to begin
operations at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago in 1996, and
Japan's SpRing-8 at Tsukuba science city in about 2000.
In the ESRF an intense beam of electrons, as thin as a human hair,
accelerates around a giant ring 844 metres in circumference. An array of
magnets keeps the beam in shape and controls the radiation. There are 64
'bending magnets' to direct the electrons around the ring, and special
'wigglers' and 'undulators' to make the beam twist and turn in a way that
gives off particularly intense X-rays.
Industrial researchers will have two routes to using ESRF. If they want to
keep their work secret, they will be able to buy time on the machine at a
rate of Pounds 3,300 per eight-hour shift.
Alternatively, if a company intends to publish its experimental results, it
can submit a proposal to the ESRF 'peer review' panels which divide up the
machine's 'public time' between competing research groups according to their
scientific merit.
Richard Oldman, a chemist at ICI, the UK chemicals group, has been allocated
beam time during the first round of experiments this autumn, for a
collaborative experiment with Keele University to investigate the structure
of polyester, a common polymer (plastic). He and his colleagues will be
making molecular movies, to see how the long polyester chains behave during
industrial processing.
'Polyester is widely used in industry, for example to make plastic bottles
for soft drinks,' Oldman says. 'We hope to learn more about the way the
polyester chains relate to the mechanical properties of the bottle, so that
we can sharpen up our processing and make stronger plastics.'
ESRF will also have a medical beam. This will be perfectly suited to
angiography, for example, enabling researchers to take detailed pictures of
the fine blood vessels around the heart, whose narrowing is a sign of
cardiovascular disease.
As well as the main public beamlines, which will be used for a great variety
of short-term studies, the ESRF has reserved several slots for long-term
projects. For example, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council has given Malcolm Cooper of Warwick University and William Stirling
of Keele University a Pounds 2.3m grant to build an X-ray facility for
British scientists to study the structure of magnetic materials.
Cooper says there are several reasons why the ESRF will enable them to do
research that would not be possible with less powerful national X-ray
machines such as the UK Synchrotron Radiation Source at the Daresbury
Laboratory in Cheshire. One is that ESRF beams 'can be focused down to small
focal spot sizes (less than 0.2mm by 0.3mm) so that small samples and thin
films can be studied'.
Even when the ESRF is fully operational, the demand for intense X-rays will
be great enough to require new national synchrotron sources too, Cooper and
Oldman say.
In the UK, government-funded research councils are considering spending
about Pounds 100m on a Medium Energy X-ray Source as a successor to the
Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury. If MEXS goes ahead, it will start
operating in 2001 or soon afterwards.
There is no doubt that X-rays have a brilliant future in materials research.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Business and the Law: Liable to exposure - Closer legal
scrutiny of derivatives losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent disclosures by several US public companies that they have suffered
substantial losses through trading in derivatives has resulted in the
announcement of tighter controls by US regulators. It has also led to the
realisation that many of the legal issues which arise from the use of, or
failure to use, derivatives have yet to be tested in the courts.
Why do public companies use derivatives - financial instruments, such as
futures and options? The answer is to manage financial risks associated with
their business. A company can reduce the risk of a rise in the future cost
of borrowing by fixing its borrowing costs by the use of interest futures,
options or swaps. Equally, multinational companies can hedge against foreign
exchange exposure through foreign currency futures and options.
But derivatives are not without their risks, as recent large trading losses
in derivatives in the US illustrate. In May, Air Products and Chemicals, the
US industrial gases group, was the fourth listed US company to take a charge
against its earnings this year as a result of losses on derivatives
contracts bought from Bankers Trust, the New York bank.
The losses suffered by Air Products and the other three companies - Proctor
&amp; Gamble, Mead Corporation, the US paper group, and Gibson Greetings, a
greetings card manufacturer - have raised questions of liability.
On September 13, Gibson Greetings filed suit in the Ohio Federal District
Court seeking damages of Dollars 23m, the amount owing on the derivatives
transactions, and punitive damages of Dollars 50m in respect of transactions
with Bankers Trust.
The action, alleging fraud and deceit, claims the bank 'made false
representations and failed to disclose to Gibson the risk of the extremely
complicated derivative products' sold to Gibson. Bankers Trust denies the
claim.
Depending on the success of the Gibson action, Proctor &amp; Gamble has said it
may follow with an action over its loss this April of Dollars 157m on two
highly leveraged interest rate swaps.
Although the company has not yet started legal proceedings it attributes the
loss to Bankers Trust, arguing that the transactions, based on complex
formulae which multiplied the effect of interest rate increases, were not
usual for the company and were inconsistent with its policies.
The bank denies liability for these losses, saying the transactions were
entered into after much discussion, that it formally recommended to Proctor
&amp; Gamble that the company limit its risk by unwinding all or part of the
transactions when changes in market rates began to affect its position
adversely - advice Proctor &amp; Gamble rejected.
The Bankers Trust action highlights the question of the liability of banks
in providing derivatives services and the level of advice given.
Losses arising from derivatives dealing are an emotive issue, according to
Mr Tim Plews, of City solicitors Clifford Chance. 'Derivatives are somewhat
intangible and large sums can be lost or gained overnight, making losses
particularly unpalatable,' he says
Mr Jonathan Melrose a partner of City lawyers Simmons &amp; Simmons says the
basic premise of UK derivatives regulation is full and frank disclosure,
though financial institutions dealing with professional clients are
permitted to place greater reliance on the client's own judgment.
But lawyers accept that even compliance with standard disclosure
requirements to professional clients may not avoid claims.
Given its sophistication, Proctor &amp; Gamble's assertion that it was relying
on Bankers Trust's advice has been greeted with derision in the US markets.
But the company has not ruled out litigation.
Gibson Greetings alleges it was positively misled. That shows a financial
institution is never out of the firing line, Mr Melrose says. 'Large losses
can concentrate the mind on what action may be available. Clients may try to
argue that they are owed a duty of care or, as with Gibson, allege they were
actively misled,' he adds.
With exotic derivatives questions of liability are more complex, Mr Plews
says. 'There can be a fine line between what it takes to market a product,
especially a new one, which has to be demystified for a customer, and the
giving of advice. To what extent is a bank encouraging reliance on its
explanation before a customer commits to the contract?'
The possibility of shareholder action against companies using derivatives
adds another dimension to the problem. Shareholders may be philosophical
about trading losses in traditional areas of business, says Mr Plews, but
less forgiving about derivative losses. There is certainly more pressure now
on directors to ensure they understand the products the company is dealing
in, says Mr Melrose.
The point is illustrated by a recent Australian decision in which the chief
executive and chairman of AWA Ltd, a public company, was found to have been
negligent in foreign exchange transaction losses because he failed to
establish adequate internal control systems in the foreign exchange
department and properly control the activities of the department head.
The decision by the Commercial Division of the New South Wales Supreme Court
is under appeal, but Mr David Williamson, London partner of Australian law
firm Blake Dawson Waldron says: 'The Australian decision should focus the
minds of directors and professional advisers, such as auditors, on their
potential exposure in this area.'
Directors may find themselves in a quandary over derivatives, according to
Mr Melrose. 'In any company where there is a sophisticated treasury
operation inadequate use of derivatives to hedge may also be open to
question.'
He points to a US case where directors of the LaFontaine Grain Co-operative
were found by the Indiana Court of Appeals to be negligent for not
adequately using derivatives to minimise financial risk.
Directors may in some circumstances be covered by Dirtectors &amp; Officers
Liability insurance, now common in the US and becoming so in the UK. Trading
losses from failure of management may be covered by such insurance, but some
policies exclude failure of investments, in which case losses incurred
through derivatives may not be insured.
UK and US lawyers will watch the US litigation with interest. Apart from the
Hammersmith and Fulham litigation, where the House of Lords ruled local
authorities did not have the powers to enter into swaps contracts, little
legal action has been taken on derivatives in the UK.
Yet, as the recent US action confirms, the use of derivatives is under
increasing legal scrutiny.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): US lead that London
ignored - A look at Nasdaq's return for one venture investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange's announcement earlier this month that it is to set up an
Alternative Investment Market (AIM) for trading in smaller company shares
has been nothing if not controversial.
The new market may well provide an alternative to the old rule 535 (2)
trading facility (now called Stock Exchange rule 4.2) under which about 200
shares currently trade. In this way it might become viewed as a replacement
for the Unlisted Securities Market, which will accept no new entrants from
December and will be wound up at the end of 1996.
But it remains to be seen whether young and rapidly-growing companies will
be able to raise larger amounts of capital. In the US, for example, where
many such companies choose to float on the regulated National Market of the
US Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the average new issue size this year has been
Dollars 34m (Pounds 21.5m). The largest was for Dollars 413m.
With AIM unlikely to require issues to be sponsored by recognised
stockbrokers or to have rigorously vetted (and therefore expensive) listing
particulars, some venture capitalists say that institutional interest will
be limited. The obstacle, some investors and stockbrokers say, is the lack
of regulation - precisely the feature the Stock Exchange wants to maintain
for its new market.
Advocates of a more regulated market argue that venture capitalists would be
much more likely to back young growing companies if they knew there was a
market in which they could achieve a much earlier exit than is currently
possible on the Official List in London. The London Stock Exchange has only
made an exception for bio-technology companies, which do not need an
earnings record before floating.
'The experience in the US is that the public market is crucial to a private
equity market,' says Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners and a lukewarm
supporter of AIM.
A similar view is taken by Thomas Judge, director of Alternative Investments
at AT&amp;T Investment Management Corp, the biggest investor in venture capital
in the US. AT&amp;T's investment returns from venture capital investment might
make UK institutions take greater interest in the formation of a vibrant and
accessible stock exchange for young rapidly growing companies.
AT&amp;T started investing in venture capital in 1980. After a slow start, it
now has Dollars 1.3bn invested in the asset class through 87 venture capital
firms. This means about 3 per cent of the Dollars 39bn AT&amp;T pension fund is
in seed investment, development capital and what it calls 'smaller
buy-outs'.
'Nearly all the Dollars 592m of investments distributed to us was from stock
that was listed on Nasdaq,' says Judge.
AT&amp;T does not sell its investments as soon as shares are distributed to it
on flotation. In 1989, it hired Warburg Pincus, the US investment
institution, with a mandate either to sell or hold the stocks in the
distributed portfolio. From 1989 to the end of last year, this portfolio
achieved an annual 22 per cent compound rate of return, Judge says.
This compared with a 15 per cent return on the Nasdaq Industrial Index over
the same period and a 12 per cent return from the Russell 2000 Index, which
tracks the performance of smaller issues traded on Nasdaq and other US
exchanges. In the UK, where until last year the level of flotations had been
modest for three years and trade sales were a more common exit route for
venture capitalists, such returns would not have been possible.
One other US fact supports the case for a Nasdaq type of market for growing
companies. According to VentureOne, a San Francisco-based research
organisation, more than 95 per cent of venture backed companies go public on
Nasdaq. For AT&amp;T, the figure is slightly lower at 88 per cent. Judge is
quite clear about the role the exchange has played in allowing AT&amp;T to
invest Dollars 1.3bn in growing companies. 'We feel without Nasdaq in the US
we would have been hard pressed to do what we did,' he says.

search of a job - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Talking of recycling assets, the Connect for Growth programme sponsored by
London TECs is still looking for unemployed executives to match with smaller
companies seeking to take on additional managers.
Set up a year ago by The Enterprise Partnership, a London-based consultancy,
the programme has already 'matched' 100 companies with previously unemployed
executives. After a short refresher course, executives join a growing
company for a three-month project or trial.
During this period, the company pays only Pounds 500 to the Enterprise
Partnership, while the government's training for work scheme picks up the
cost of paying the executive. The Enterprise Partnership - 071 627 4991

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is said that every cloud has a silver lining. What is insolvency for one
company can be an opportunity for another to pick up cheap assets and stock
or to expand its customer base.
Smoothing the way in this corporate jungle is a new publication that claims
to be the first service to provide daily information about corporate
insolvency by fax. London-based IT Systems Publishing compiles information
from the official publication, the London Gazette, and the High Court and
faxes subscribers overnight.
Subscribers may request a tailored service that will give them information
about insolvencies only in manufacturing or the computer industry, for
example. The service gives the names and contact number of liquidators.
Publisher Simon Thompson says subscribers also use the service, which lists
petitions for winding-up orders, to give them an early warning that
customers are in trouble.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Hard sell for enterprise
cells - A look at an innovative scheme that assembles teams ahead of a
business idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early next month a new company will begin trading in Doncaster, South
Yorkshire. Unlike many start-ups, Magnatech is moderately well capitalised,
is not being run by one entrepreneur out of a garage, and will be able to
lean on an unusual amount of external advice and support - including the
services of a non-executive director.
What is also novel about Magnatech is that the four members of its
management team were brought together with no idea of what business they
would start. The company is one of about 40 experimental 'enterprise cells'
being set up by some Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and their
Scottish equivalents, the Local Enterprise Councils, with the support of the
David Hall Partnership, a Rotherham-based consultancy involved in supporting
the government's business start-up scheme.
The aim is not only to try to increase the rate of manufacturing business
start-ups, particularly in areas where traditional manufacturing industry
has closed; it is also designed to increase the likelihood that enterprises
have a reasonable chance of becoming viable growing businesses. By
comparison, the government's business start-up scheme - which makes payments
to recipients of about Pounds 50 a week - has generally backed ventures that
have only helped unemployed people become self-employed.
'The enterprise cell process is more dynamic,' says Julie Readman, research
manager of Barnsley and Doncaster Tec, which is hoping to have helped six
cells set up by Christmas. 'The principle is we look for good ideas and try
to find people who can service this market instead of waiting for
entrepreneurs to come along.'
Magnatech will be importing and modifying a Swedish invention that has been
developed in the US. The equipment heats metals in a uniform manner by the
use of oscillating magnetic fields. Colin Wilson, Magnatech's marketing
director, says the technology produces less thermal stress in metals than
conventional induction heating and will find applications throughout
industry, including the aerospace and automotive industries.
While Magnatech, which raised Pounds 150,000 in capital, is probably the
largest enterprise cell, the basic approach is the same in each case.
'Most start-up schemes look for people with ideas to support and that is
generally not successful,' says Bill Bolton, a former Cambridge academic who
helped set up the St John's College Innovation Centre and is one of the
architects of enterprise cells. 'We create teams and put ideas around them.'
The process starts with the David Hall Partnership advertising for people
interested in starting their own businesses. From applicants, some
unemployed but many who are middle managers with jobs, David Hall conducts
psychometric tests to assemble balanced teams. Bolton says: 'I am not not
naive enough to believe you can get good teams that way, but you can avoid
disasters.'
The partners in the team then receive training, funded by the Tecs, in basic
business skills and are introduced to what Jeff Cooke, a David Hall director
and architect of the cell scheme, calls 'a data base of business ideas'. It
assembles these from a range of sources, including the import statistics
from the Customs and Excise (for possible import substitution opportunities)
and trade missions that hold lists of foreign companies interested in
alliances in the UK.
Having chosen and researched their market, the businesses then have to seek
backing. In the case of Magnatech, it raised start-up funding from its
founders, the loan guarantee scheme and a regional venture capital group.
David Hall then acts as hands-on consultants to the cells' partners for up
to two years.
The scheme is still at a very early stage. The first cell to be set up in
Scotland, a company making fasteners, had a turnover of only Pounds 40,000
in its first year, although it broke even. Its annualised sales rate after
three months this year could be Pounds 100,000, and it could start employing
extra people this year.
David Hall is also helping to set up cells as part of a European Union pilot
project in western Scotland that is looking at ways of regenerating the
economy.
The enterprise cells scheme is initially not cheap. Readman says Barnsley
and Doncaster Tec has allocated Pounds 200,000 to set up eight cells in its
area, including a contribution from Rechar, the EU fund that supports
regeneration in coalfield areas. But because the investment is in businesses
with potential to grow, Readman believes it may become a cost-effective way
to create jobs.
There are other concerns. What chance do Tecs and the research departments
of a consultancy have of finding business opportunities that existing
companies with capacity and marketing capability have not already looked at
and discarded? If there is imperfect information in the market, are Tecs and
consultants equipped to sniff new opportunities out? And will the enterprise
cell idea encourage people with limited knowledge of running a business to
try schemes that are not viable for them?
'We would not normally encourage people to go into a high volume market,'
says Cooke. 'We try to be careful we are not giving people false hope when
they will not be able to penetrate or service a market.' Supporters say it
is difficult to tell which ideas will succeed and that all ventures have to
pass the test of raising capital.
It is far too early to say whether the scheme will work. Cooke does not
expect to start thousands of businesses and accepts that much will depend on
the quality of ideas it can put forward. There will also be no way of
knowing whether those businesses that do start would have launched anyway
had taxpayers' money not been used to entice them into areas in need of
regeneration.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Sir David Napley, leading lawyer: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Napley was the most high-profile solicitor in Britain, celebrated
for the famous cases he took on and for his masterful advocacy.
He was lauded by the legal profession as the most distinguished solicitor of
his generation, but also attracted hostility from barristers who felt he
usurped their role.
The list of those he represented reads like a potted history of causes
celebres of the last 20 years.
It includes politicians such as Mr Jeremy Thorpe and Mr Harvey Proctor,
Princess Michael of Kent and murderer Jeremy Bamber.
Born the son of a London stockbroker in July 1915, David Napley was educated
at Burlington College, Essex.
He founded the now prominent legal practice of Kingsley Napley in 1937. He
joined the Queen's Royal Regiment in 1940 and was commissioned into the
Indian Army in 1941. After contracting a mystery illness, he was invalided
out in 1945 with the rank of captain.
He sought advice whether to aim for the Bar or to remain a solicitor and was
told by a senior judge to go for the more mundane life of a solicitor. Too
late he discovered his talent for advocacy, although in later years he said
he had no regrets about the decision.
He was elected to the council of the Law Society in 1962 and was chairman of
the Law Society criminal law committee from 1963 until 1975. He became
president of the Law Society in 1976-77 and was knighted in 1977.
It was Sir David's defence of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe on charges
of incitement and conspiracy to murder in 1978 that thrust him to fame.
In 1986 he acted for Princess Michael of Kent. He negotiated an out-of-court
settlement after the princess was accused of plagiarism in her book,
'Crowned in a Far Country'.
In 1989 he was brought in as a solicitor for Guinness to help with the
Department of Trade and Industry investigation into the takeover of
Distillers. Consequently he figured prominently in the trial of Guinness
chief executive Mr Ernest Saunders.
He also represented families of victims involved in the Zeebruge Herald of
Free Enterprise ferry disaster, the Lockerbie air crash and the King's Cross
fire.
He leaves his wife Leah, whom he married in 1940, and two daughters.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Andersen confirms merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Andersen, the UK's third largest accountancy firm by fee income,
yesterday formally announced its long-awaited merger with parts of Binder
Hamlyn.
Arthur Andersen said seven of Binder Hamlyn's offices would join Arthur
Andersen Worldwide Organisation in a merger which would 'break new ground in
the accounting profession' but would continue to practice under the Binder
Hamlyn name.
The 17 other offices of Binder Hamlyn, which was the eighth largest
accountancy firm, have declined to join the merger.
The new grouping will have a fee income, based on the last published
figures, of almost Pounds 500m a year. This could bring Arthur Andersen
close to KPMG Peat Marwick, the second largest firm by income.
Mr Jim Wadia, UK managing partner for Arthur Andersen, said: 'It is no
secret that we wanted to grow our audit base in the UK market, and organic
growth takes time.'
Mr Adrian Burn, managing partner of Binder Hamlyn, said the polarisation of
the profession made operating outside the big six accountancy firms an
'inhibition' when trying to provide for quoted clients who required access
to an international network of services.
Half the total fee income for Binder Hamlyn came from the Leeds and London
regional offices, which are joining Andersen, with offices in Manchester and
Newcastle.
Of offices outside the new grouping Belfast and Enniskillen have joined
Grant Thornton, Birmingham and Bristol have joined Touche Ross, and Ayr,
Bacup, Bury St Edmunds, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newmarket, Norwich, Nottingham,
Poole, Rochdale, Saltcoats, Stranraer, and Wolverhampton have joined Stoy
Hayward.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Pounds 4bn cost of housing benefits attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 4bn cost of housing benefit could be substantially reduced if the
government dropped a ban on leasing by local authorities, Labour claimed
yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's housing spokesman, said that housing benefit - rent
subsidies paid to private landlords - had nearly quadrupled to Pounds 4.83bn
since the government deregulated private rents in 1989.
Deregulation was 'a harmful and monumentally expensive failure, whose costs
to the public purse are now approaching those of the poll tax,' he told a
local authority housing conference in Cardiff.
Mr Straw said the government had created a free for all for private
landlords. 'It is a rigged market . . . Private landlords can effectively
charge what they like, and many of them do,' he said.
Mr Straw said the average cost to the taxpayer of local authority housing
was Pounds 720 less per family than the cost of private rented housing.
He challenged Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, to cut
costs by allowing local authorities to lease homes from housing associations
for rental, rather than reducing the level of housing benefit.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Grand shipbuilding tradition goes under: The death of an
extraordinary industry in the north-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The loss of Swan Hunter's design team means the unthinkable is about to
happen. North-east England, the source for many years of more than a third
of the world's ships, is to see its last shipbuilder die.
The departure on Friday of most the remaining designers brings to an end the
struggle by Swan Hunter's workforce and local community, unions, politicians
and receivers Price Waterhouse to keep alive one of the world's great
shipbuilding companies.
Few industries have the grandeur and resonance of shipbuilding, in spite of
the arduous toil it imposes on those who work in it.
Still fewer companies enjoy the exceptional commitment and loyalty Swan
Hunter has sustained from its founding in the mid-Victorian era to today.
Swan Hunter's employees and its reputation for quality form the bridge with
that distant time before cars and aircraft.
Fourth-generation employees include Mr David Swan, 54, former quality
assurance inspection manager - the last of the Swans and Hunters on the
payroll. He is now unemployed, having been made redundant by the receivers
in May.
Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield, an insolvency practitioner for 21 years,
said: 'There's a sense of kinship which is quite extraordinary, something
I've never really experienced before. It's a function of history, of shared
triumphs and disasters.'
Because Swan Hunter comprises several historic Tyneside shipyards the
company's founding can be set at 1860, 1873 or 1874, when shipbuilder
Charles Mitchell took over the Wallsend shipyard and made his brother-in-law
Charles Sheriton Swan, David Swan's great grandfather, its manager.
Mr Swan, trading under the name CS Swan &amp; Company, travelled regularly to St
Petersburg to advise the Tsar on construction of ironclad battleships. His
enthusiasm for marine engineering cost him dear. In 1879 he leaned too far
over the rail of a steamer's paddlebox, fell and was killed.
In 1880 his widow brought George Burton Hunter, later Sir George Hunter,
into the business. His arrival started the company's rapid expansion as
north-east England entered its greatest shipbuilding period.
Among Swan Hunter's biggest triumphs was the Mauretania, which for 22 years
held the Blue Riband as the world's fastest liner across the Atlantic.
Launched in 1906, she combined sumptuous beauty with technical innovation,
thanks to Sir Charles Parsons, Tyneside-based inventor of the steam turbine.
US President Franklin Roosevelt wrote, in a comment that could have applied
equally to Swan Hunter itself, that neither size nor speed alone could have
given the Mauretania her fame. 'That rested on something more secure and
intangible - on her personality, for the Mauretania was a ship with a
fighting heart.'
Also exceptional was the supertanker Esso Northumbria, a 253,000 tonne ship,
1,143 ft from stem to stern, launched in 1969. She towered so high Swans had
to pay the lighting bills of the terraced homes overshadowed during
construction. Her launch was a logistical challenge. The Tyne was only 167
ft wider than the ship, even with a large notch cut out of the opposite bank
to stop her slamming into Swans' Hebburn yard when she was launched.
More recent triumphs include the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, currently
visiting the Tyne after active service off the former Yugoslavia, and
Illustrious, on which Swans worked day and night for the Falklands campaign.
Swan Hunter has had bad times before, in periods of international recession.
In the 1920s its workforce turned to making garden furniture to survive as a
team.
Recent decades have brought increasingly cut-throat competition from Far
East shipbuilders and rivals under more favourable subsidy regimes.
Even so, as recently as 1975 the Swan Hunter group could claim to be
Europe's biggest shipbuilding and ship-repairing consortium, with worldwide
activities and 33,000 employees in 10 UK shipbuilding yards and nine repair
yards at home and abroad.
The Type 23 frigate Richmond, to be handed over to the Navy on November 2,
is the last of 2,700 vessels, merchant and naval, built by the company. One
of the most dignified aspects of the receivership has been the workforce's
unwavering commitment to finishing their last three frigates on time, to top
standards.
After 16 months of receivership, of worldwide marketing and dogged
negotiating, Mr Horsfield has only now given up hope of a going concern
sale.
He said: 'All the opportunities there have been explored and no buyer has
been found.'
The Swan Hunter name is likely to be sold as part of the intellectual
property rights. This means it could go overseas.
For Mr Horsfield the workforce's humour and dedication to high quality have
made this a receivership of bitter-sweet memories.
For the workforce, Swan Hunter's demise is a tragic bereavement.
Mr Peter Hilton, 47, design team member and an employee for 30 years, said:
'It's a family. The last people, you'll have to show them out and close the
door behind them. If you left them, they'd just stay there.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Swan Hunter closure becomes virtual certainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Closure of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipyard in liquidation, yesterday
became a virtual certainty when the bulk of the design team, crucial to the
continuation of the business, were told that they would be made redundant on
Friday.
Receivers Price Waterhouse yesterday told the unions a further 177 would be
made redundant on Friday, of whom 79 were from the 103-strong design team.
Loss of the team would make it impossible for Swan Hunter to tender for more
work, in effect ensuring its demise by ending the prospects of its sale as a
going concern.
This week's redundancies will leave just 450 workers at the yard, which has
been in receivership for 16 months. Union officials said they had been told
that more jobs would go in mid-October and most of the rest at the start of
November, when the yard's last frigate, HMS Richmond, leaves to be handed
over to the Royal Navy.
Only about 100 will remain for maintenance and security - the last survivors
of the 2,500 on the payroll last May.
The unions insisted that they still did not regard closure as inevitable -
there could be a move for the yard after everyone has been made redundant.
Shipbuilding could continue on the Tyne after the company was broken up. The
unions understood that 'parties' were interested in constituent parts of the
business such as the Hebburn dry dock and the Neptune and Wallsend yards.
Norma Cohen writes: Members of the Swan Hunter pension scheme are being
asked whether they wish to accept a cash sum to transfer to a personal
pension which may not pay benefits equal to those promised by the employer's
scheme.
Alternatively, they could accept a lump sum to buy guaranteed benefits from
an insurance company which would probably cover no more than 60 per cent of
their benefits.
In a letter to scheme members Law Debenture Corporation, independent trustee
for the pension scheme, told members that if all deferred pensioners - those
who are no longer employed by Swan Hunter but are too young to retire - took
the first option, the scheme would have enough money to provide a full
transfer value for all.
Some deferred pensioners may be able to have an immediate pension if they
are more than 50 years old.
According to Law Debenture the scheme will be formally wound up in late
October or early November, when payments can be made.
The letter notes that all current pensioners will continue to receive their
entitlements in full.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Newcastle launches plan for city regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A public and private-sector initiative aimed at bringing jobs and investment
to Newcastle upon Tyne was launched yesterday by the city council.
The city's 1994-7 Economic Regeneration Strategy has been devised in the
past year in consultation with senior executives of more than 50 locally
based companies, academic institutions and other organisations.
It sets out the main challenges Newcastle needs to tackle to be recognised
as an important European regional capital. Its top priority is creating
employment and economic activity.
It acknowledges that the majority of the resources needed to implement the
plan will have to be secured from private investment, kick-started by
considerable public-sector spending.
The initiative identifies three strategic objectives:
Physical development, including improving the city centre, developing high
quality business sites, and enhancing transport and telecommunications
links.
Business development, including job creation, strengthening the
manufacturing sector, reducing crime, improving Newcastle's image and
promoting its arts, sports and tourism sector.
Human resource development, including raising skills and educational
standards, building on the academic sector's strength, tackling poverty and
reducing unemployment.
The strategy proposes promoting Newcastle as a 'European City of Energy', an
allusion both to its liveliness and its energy-related businesses.
Mr Alan Clarke, the city council's chief economic development officer, said
the involvement of so many leading executives gave the strategy much greater
credibility. Partnership was increasingly important in attracting central
government and European funds, he said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Avon launches target of creating 7,000 jobs a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strategy for the economic development of Bristol and Avon has been
launched with a target of creating 7,000 jobs a year.
Avon planners estimate that by the year 2001 at least 25,000 jobs will be
needed in the county to redress unemployment, another 7,000 because of a
growing workforce, and up to 20,000 new opportunities will be required as a
consequence of industrial restructuring.
The strategy has been drawn up by the Western Development Partnership, a
public and private-sector regeneration agency which was launched in Avon
last year. The strategy, which will be regularly monitored and updated, has
been endorsed by its members, which include all the local authorities.
A WDP taskforce which prepared the strategy says 17,000 manufacturing jobs
have been lost in Avon in the past five years. Local unemployment this
spring stood at 46,000 people, or 9.2 per cent, double the number out of
work in 1990. Sixty per cent of them had been out of work for more than six
months.
The strategy sets a target of reducing unemployment at a faster rate than
the UK average. It is intended to bring down the jobless rate more quickly
than the Avon average in six areas which have pockets of very high
unemployment.
The action programme for the next 12 months includes the promotion of the
area's competitive advantages, support for existing businesses, lobbying for
additional government and European funds and attracting inward investment.
Last month the Department of Trade and Industry agreed to provide Pounds
100,000 in the current financial year to launch a West of England
development agency, which will seek to win investment from abroad.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Walker growth 'based on fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid expansion of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group,
throughout the 1980s was heavily dependent on the fraudulent profit-boosting
operation orchestrated by Mr George Walker, the company's former chairman
and chief executive, the prosecution in his trial alleged yesterday.
Mr Peter Rook QC told the Old Bailey that the fraud took place at a critical
phase of the company's development and had a substantial effect on how Brent
Walker was regarded by investors.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the
company's accounts.
Mr Rook said in his closing speech that comparisons of the Pounds 19m bogus
profits with the operating profits reported to shareholders showed how
important the fraud was to the company's expansion.
In 1984 the false profits were 25 per cent of Brent Walker's total operating
profits. In 1985 they were more than 80 per cent, in 1986 45 per cent and in
1987 more than 50 per cent.
Mr Rook said the evidence showed that Mr Walker had been the originator of
the fraud. Mr Walker had the contacts used for the bogus transactions and
money laundering operations and he had authorised crucial money transfers.
The trial continues today.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Smokers put cities under a cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unsightly cigarette end was the most consistent litter problem mentioned
yesterday in the first national survey of cities by the Tidy Britain Group.
Bath and Ripon emerged as the UK's cleanest cities. London came eighth and
Manchester bottom of the 57 cities surveyed.
Cities were ranked according to the cleanness of a 1km circle around the
centre. The areas were visited by 54 trained teams which checked for litter,
graffiti, dog fouling, fly-posting and signs of vandalism.
The cities were graded on a scale from A to D. Smoking-related litter,
especially cigarette ends, caused many potential grade A sites to be demoted
to grade B.
The surveys, which covered more than 12,500 sites, were carried in May.
Professor Graham Ashworth, director-general of the Tidy Britain Group, said
it planned to repeat the survey regularly to monitor progress and encourage
higher standards of cleanliness.
The group said that far too many cities - 26 per cent - had to be classified
as unacceptable, but it hoped that the survey would help them target their
resources more effectively.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Bleak forecast for life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 40 life companies, accounting for almost a quarter of new business
premium income, will be struggling to continue to sell life insurance within
a decade, according to actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow.
Its analysis suggests that 40 per cent of the 103 UK life companies have
expense ratios which would make them vulnerable if competition in the sector
took the form of a price war. Only 10 per cent are what B&amp;W calls 'cost
competitive'.
The study reveals a gap between the cost of acquiring and maintaining
business and the premium income which it produces.
Mr Carl McNicholas, B&amp;W strategy and marketing specialist, said: 'This
situation is unsustainable right now for many individual companies. The
number of companies open to new business will fall considerably.'
The analysis shows that as a category the 37 subsidiaries of overseas
companies had the highest average expense ratio. The lowest average was
recorded by banks and building societies.
Mr McNicholas said, however, that he expected the expense ratio for banks
and societies to rise with the new disclosure regime next year, when
companies would have to specify the costs associated with selling life
products.
Broken down by main channel of distribution, the analysis indicates that
life companies selling largely through independent financial advisers have
the highest average expense ratio, while those selling mostly via a direct
sales force have the lowest average.
On the basis of the findings almost two-thirds of the sector has worsening
expense ratios. Bancassurers - selling of life products through bank and
building society branch networks - account for many of the minority with
improving expense ratios.
The study is based on information life companies must pass annually to the
Department of Trade and Industry, adjusted to take into account whether the
ratios of expenses to new and continued premium income have improved or
deteriorated.
Mr McNicholas emphasised that an expense rating on the basis of the analysis
did not mean any one life company was doomed, since there could be special
factors which would affect specific results.
The overall picture presented by the analysis supports a commonly held view
in the sector that the number of life companies still selling will fall to
about 60 in a few years.

Only one in four voters think the economy would be stronger under Labour,
says an NOP survey for The Independent newspaper and BBC2's Newsnight. The

FT  27 SEP 94 / Council workers reject pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union officials representing 1.5m local government workers - white collar
and manual - have rejected a two-year pay offer which they say will be below
the rate of inflation in both years, David Goodhart writes. Industrial
action is not expected.
The three unions - Unison, the public service union, and the TGWU and GMB
general unions - are seeking an urgent meeting with the Labour-dominated
local authority employers.
The unions say that if no improvement can be made they will meet again to
consider further options 'including arbitration'.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Plea for milk review refused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dairy Trade Federation is considering further action after being refused
leave by the High Court yesterday to seek a judicial review of the
government's handling of milk market deregulation.
Mr Justice Dyson ruled that the federation had an 'arguable case' but had
failed to bring its action promptly enough after government approval of the
new arrangements in June.
The milk market in England and Wales is due to be liberalised on November 1,
when the Milk Marketing Board will be replaced by Milk Marque, a voluntary
farmers' co-operative which already controls at least 65 per cent of
supplies.
Dairy processors say that Milk Marque's system for selling milk to dairy
companies will push prices up sharply and encourage a flood of imports.
The judge ruled that it was arguable that the market reorganisation scheme,
in particular the pricing system, 'was such as to amount to an abuse by Milk
Marque of a dominant position' under the Treaty of Rome.
It was therefore arguable that the government had broken European law by
approving the scheme and failing to remedy the abuse.
However, he said hard evidence of the scale of likely price increases was
available in late June. 'It was vital that a challenge of this kind, having
such potentially far-reaching consequences, should be mounted with great
expedition, and it was not,' he said.
Mr Justice Dyson said the federation had adequate alternative remedies. 'The
reality here is that the complaint is against the system being used by Milk
Marque,' he said. 'The issues raised are ones which the European Commission
and/or the Monopolies and Mergers Commission are well-qualified to
determine.'
Mr John Price, the federation's director-general, said any further action
would be decided later this week after consultation with dairy companies.
Other possible remedies were to sue Milk Marque in the High Court for
damages for abuse of a dominant position, or to appeal against the judge's
ruling to the Court of Appeal.
He said: 'The problem is still there. The judge seems to be giving a fair
hint that it was the right action but the wrong court.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Foes of secrecy claim a victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campaigners seeking to reduce official secrecy in Whitehall yesterday
claimed an important victory after a government department was forced to
release a hitherto confidential document.
A Department of Transport inspector's report into proposals to build the
Birmingham northern relief road was released to the public under the new
code of practice on access to government information introduced earlier this
year.
DoT officials had strenuously resisted demands from a group of MPs to
publish the report, which was drawn up in 1988. However, in his first
adjudication since the code was introduced, the ombudsman, Mr William Reid,
demanded that the report be published, overruling claims by DoT officials
that this would prejudice the current inquiry into a similar scheme.
Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information,
said yesterday that publication of the document was an early sign the
government was taking its obligations to reveal official secrets more
seriously than had been expected.
Under the code, Whitehall departments are not obliged to release primary
documents but can summarise their findings in a letter. 'The fact that the
ombudsman has called for full publication - and that this has been followed
up - is a very positive sign indeed,' Mr Frankel said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Labour supergun charge rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has rejected Labour claims that a
director of Astra Holdings, the collapsed munitions company involved in the
Iraqi supergun affair, was spared disqualification because of
security-service links.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the DTI's decision not to
seek the disqualification of Mr Stephan Kock was 'derived exclusively' from
an inspectors' report into Astra's dealings.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow open government minister, said last month in a
letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that the DTI's
decision to seek disqualification of six Astra directors was 'a significant
piece of the cover-up over arms to Iraq'.
Mr Meacher said it was 'obvious' that Mr Stephan Kock, a seventh Astra
director, had been excluded from disqualification proceedings because of his
publicly admitted security-service links.
Mr Hamilton said in a letter to Mr Meacher that Mr Kock 'did not entirely
escape criticism' by the inspectors. But the report did not contain
sufficient grounds to justify disqualification proceedings.
He said: 'No extraneous consideration, whether of the sort you suggest, or
any other, played a part in these decisions.'
Mr Meacher said the letter failed to answer his claim that the proposed
disqualifications were 'a shabby and sordid political vendetta' designed to
intimidate the six Astra directors because of their willingness to reveal
details of the arms trade with Iraq.
The DTI launched disqualification proceedings in August, nearly a year after
the inspectors' report, which focused on Astra's Pounds 22m acquisition in
1989 of PRB, a Belgian company.
Astra, which is in receivership, became involved in the supergun affair
after discovering that PRB had a contract to supply propellant. Customs
officers blocked the project by seizing giant steel tubes in 1990.
The DTI report criticised the directors for continuing with the PRB
acquisition in spite of warnings from advisers about PRB's financial
condition. They were also criticised for misleading shareholders about
Astra's financial situation.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Skills training 'pays off for employees'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training for work pays off - at least for the employees who take advantage
of it. One of the biggest studies of the link between training and earnings
has found an 'impressive' differential of between 6 per cent and 14 per cent
for each step up the skill ladder.
The study, by Mr Michael White of the Policy Studies Institute, found that
even one month of initial training was worth an average 6 per cent addition
to pay. A vocational qualification was worth 7 per cent.
The study, based on the Economic and Social Research Council's Social Change
and Economic Life Database, looked at more than 2,000 people in comparable
jobs.
People who acquired skills from personal study, rather than from their
employers, received an even higher 9 per cent advantage, as did people who
had been retrained to work on new technology.
Mr White found that there was no gain for employees if an employer trained
them without aiming for higher skill levels, or tried to increase skill
without formal training.
The study concentrated on continuing, rather than initial, training and took
account of possible distortions.
Mr White said the results might be undermined if benefits were coming from
being in a big, strong, successful organisation. But he added: 'Although
larger firms are more likely to have training policies in place . . . the
size of the firm has no bearing on the earnings differentials for training.'
The findings will be useful ammunition for the training lobby and the
training and enterprise councils, which are trying to promote in-company
training.
It will not, however, prevent the continuing scepticism about the value of
large-scale spending on training the unemployed.
A Department of Employment survey at the end of the 1980s found that nearly
three out of four vacancies being filled could have been filled by people
straight off the unemployment register.
The fact that they were not suggested that employer prejudice rather than
lack of skills was the biggest barrier to getting most of the unemployed
back to work.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Coventry lift-truck activity boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish owner of the old Coventry Climax company - once one of the most
famous names in the UK lift-truck industry - is reorganising its UK
operations to try to broaden its customer base and boost sales.
The UK subsidiary of Kalmar will start moving to a new site in Coventry next
month as part of a Pounds 2.5m investment aimed at securing its future.
The move, to be completed next year, will round off the transformation of
the UK operation into a distribution, service and support company, severing
links with its manufacturing past.
In its heyday Coventry Climax employed about 3,500 people. It has been based
at a 240,000 sq ft plant in Sandy Lane, Coventry for the past 15 years. It
came under Swedish ownership in 1987 but volume manufacturing became
increasingly uncompetitive.
Annual production of lift-trucks had dwindled to about 1,000 units and the
workforce had fallen to 500 when manufacturing ceased three years ago.
Climax trucks are now made for Kalmar by companies in the US and Japan. Most
of the Sandy Lane site was sold this year.
In May all Kalmar operations in the UK were brought together under one
company for the first time. Apart from Climax lift-trucks the company sells
medium to large LMV lift-trucks and Irion side-loaders, all made in Sweden.
The restructured UK company, Kalmar Ltd, employs 150 people. Mr John Arkell,
managing director, said the closer relationship between the product ranges
would enable the company to reach customers who otherwise would not have
considered buying from it.
He is particularly aiming at the market for medium-size lift-trucks where
the company has made little impact in the UK and competition is less intense
than in the smaller 1 tonne to 3 tonne market.
He also wants to increase Kalmar's presence in the construction, and ports
and shipping industries, building on its strengths in engineering and
commodity sectors.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Warning over costs of building new N-plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proceeds from the privatisation of Nuclear Electric, the state power
company, would be as much as Pounds 7.2bn less if the company was committed
to building new power plants, says an analysis published yesterday.
Cola, a consortium of local authorities opposed to new nuclear-plant
construction, says Nuclear Electric has substantially underestimated the
government support required for investment in new plant.
Support for Sizewell C, on the Suffolk coast, could amount to Pounds 4.5bn
and another station at Hinkley Point in Somerset would add more, Cola says.
'Government support on such a scale cannot be justified, because nuclear
power stations do not provide strong net environmental and strategic
benefits,' it says.
In a study commissioned by Cola, Mr Gordon MacKerron, senior research fellow
at Sussex University, forecasts that the capital cost of building Sizewell C
is likely to be Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.6bn, compared with Nuclear Electric's
estimate of slightly more than Pounds 3.5bn. Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear should be privatised, not as specialist nuclear companies but as
companies with power generation as their main business, says the Institute
of Economic Affairs.
In a submission to the government's nuclear review, the free-market
think-tank says the companies should be allowed to diversify into other
lines of business, as far as shareholders and the competition authorities
permit.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Rivals dispute price claims by Energis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Energis, the new UK long-distance telecommunications operator, unveiled its
prices yesterday, promising strong competition with British
Telecommunications and Mercury.
However, Energis's claims that its tariffs were up to 44 per cent cheaper
than BT's standard rates met an angry denial from BT, which said that some
of Energis's published figures exaggerated BT's tariffs by half.
For daytime calls the price differential between Energis and BT standard
tariffs is between about 11 per cent and 17 per cent. It is also
significantly cheaper than Mercury for some calls.
Volume discounts can make straight comparisons misleading, but taking
account of its own volume discounts, Energis remains strongly competitive
with both BT and Mercury, particularly for high-volume telecoms users.
Energis has no local network and is competing with BT only for long-distance
and international traffic.
A subsidiary of National Grid, Energis has used National Grid's pylons to
carry its 3,500km fibre-optic network.
It said that its overheads were far lower than those of its rivals in terms
of initial investment and operating costs. Energis has invested Pounds 250m
in its long-distance network, compared with Mercury's Pounds 2.7bn. It has
about 340 employees, Mercury 10,500.
The prices were presented by Mr Gordon Owen, Energis chairman, and Mr David
Dey, chief executive.
Mr Dey said that unlike BT and Mercury Energis would contract out all
functions except strategic management and customer service, significantly
reducing its cost base.
Energis identified small and medium-size businesses as its main target. This
is the segment of the corporate sector which has gained least from Mercury
in the last decade. Mercury said it was now concentrating on the same group.
BT also faces local competition from cable operators, and from other
operators concentrating on specific sections of the business market,
particularly in the City.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, the merchant bank,
said the launch of Energis was likely to accelerate the reduction of
long-distance phone tariffs, bringing them more closely in line with local
call prices.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Interest rates expected to hold steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, met yesterday amid widespread expectations that base rates would
remain unchanged.
This follows their decision to raise rates to 5.75 per cent this month.
The meeting, part of their regular monthly monetary discussions, took place
as Mr Clarke prepared to fly to Malta for a meeting of the Commonwealth
countries' finance ministers today.
The decision to raise rates this month - the first such rate rise for five
years - surprised the markets, not least because many economists had
expected Mr Clarke to delay any rate rise until after the Conservative party
conference next month.
Most analysts believe that another rate rise is extremely unlikely for at
least another month.
The money markets are assuming that base rates will be almost 7 per cent by
the end of the year. But recent indications that the growth in consumer
spending and overall gross domestic product is likely to slow later this
year, coupled with the current low levels of inflation, have partly damped
speculation about another imminent rate rise.
These suspicions were yesterday boosted by the publication of the Treasury's
monthly monetary report. The report, which is little more than a compendium
of the latest economic statistics, noted that the 'monthly indicators were
mixed' in August, albeit consistent with steady economic recovery. The
report noted that retail sales had fallen in August, although the broader
trend remained upwards, while Confederation of British Industry output
expectations remained high and unemployment continued to fall.
Manufacturing stocks were slightly higher in the second quarter of the year
than previously estimated, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The total level of stocks and work in progress in manufacturing rose in the
second quarter, by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 85m at 1990 prices, compared
with the first quarter. Stock levels in industry rose Pounds 320m in the
quarter, the fastest rise for a year.
Manufacturing investment grew at 3.7 per cent in the second quarter compared
with the first, down from the CSO's original estimates of 4.3 per cent
growth.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Adams raises prospect of fresh IRA threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, raised the temperature in the Northern
Ireland peace process last night by appearing to threaten the emergence of a
new IRA leadership if a settlement was not reached soon.
In a veiled warning to the government he said Ireland's traditional cycle of
one paramilitary force replacing another could recur if there was no
progress towards peace.
He told the Boston Herald newspaper during his US visit: 'None of us can say
two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't
resolved, that another IRA leadership won't come along. Because this has
always happened. The history of Ireland is filled with phases of armed
struggle and then of quiet.'
Mr Adams, who is on a tour of the US, tempered his warning with a
reaffirmation of his hope there would be a lasting peace. 'I want to see the
gun taken permanently out of British politics. I mean that is our intention.
Who's interested in temporary? We live there.'
Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister sent by the
government to shadow Mr Adams's tour, said the Sinn Fein leader's remarks
about a permanent peace 'take us a little further. I happen to believe that
the intention is that the end should be permanent, but he cannot say it'.
The government has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn
Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA
violence.
David Owen writes: Conservatives from Northern Ireland are moving to rock
the boat before next month's Tory conference by urging the party 'actively
to persuade' the people of the province that their best future lies within
the UK.
They are trying to force a vote on this by canvassing support among Tory
constituency organisations.
Their amendment to the motion on Northern Ireland that will be debated at
the conference also calls for the deletion of a reference to the courage of
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. A letter to constituency
chairmen from Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, argues
that it would be 'distasteful to ask the party conference to praise Mr
Reynolds'.
Tory party rules vest the 'absolute right' to decide whether to call
amendments with the conference chairman, making it unlikely the Northern
Ireland amendment will be voted on. However Mr Fee, chairman of the Tories'
Northern Ireland Area Council, believes the party's high command could be
embarrassed if a significant number of constituencies write in to express
their support.
He points out that although most motions submitted on Northern Ireland are
concerned with 'strengthening the union and governing Northern Ireland as
the rest of the United Kingdom,' these sentiments are not reflected in the
motion selected for debate.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Hume will back Labour line over Irish unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's commitment to campaign for Irish unity by consent will be bolstered
next week by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, in a surprise
intervention in the party's debate on the Northern Ireland peace process.
Mr Hume, in an address to the party conference in Blackpool, will rally
support for Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, in the
face of growing criticism of his pro-nationalist approach.
SDLP officials said that Mr Hume, a long-standing political ally of Mr
McNamara, would pay tribute to the 'responsible role' in the peace process
played by Labour's front bench.
The depth of concern about the party's existing policy was demonstrated
yesterday by the powerful conference arrangements' committee, which decided
to allow a number of emergency motions on Northern Ireland to be debated.
One of the motions, drawn up by the Independent Labour Publications pressure
group, calls for a full review of Irish policy in the light of the Downing
Street declaration and the IRA's open-ended ceasefire. Such a review would
raise the prospect of a more neutral Labour approach to Northern Ireland, in
line with comments by Mr Tony Blair since his election as party leader.
Some leading members of the moderate Ulster Unionist party have suggested
that the party's nine MPs might be willing to work with Labour after the
next election if Mr McNamara and the unity-by-consent formula were dumped.
Concern about Labour's nationalist approach is also spreading among MPs not
normally regarded as close participants in party debates on the issue.
Mr Mike Gapes, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, calls in
Co-operative News for a rethink on Northern Ireland, warning against 'glib
official slogans' such as unity by consent. He says 'Toytown trotskyist talk
of colonialism' and phrases such as 'self-determination for the Irish people
as a whole' can only worsen the province's problems.
The party's unity-by-consent policy has been under severe strain since the
IRA ceasefire. Mr Blair has given unequivocal support to the Downing Street
declaration and to the government's promise of a referendum in Northern
Ireland on constitutional changes.
However, Labour's formal conference agenda, drawn up before the IRA
ceasefire, contains only hardline nationalist resolutions.

members of the pension scheme of Belling, the cooker manufacturer that
collapsed two years ago. The pension scheme members say they were defrauded
by a solicitor and claimed the money from the society's discretionary
compensation scheme.
Law Debenture Corporation, independent trustee for the Belling pension
scheme, said it intended to seek judicial review of the decision.
The Solicitors Complaints Bureau, which runs the compensation scheme, has
been facing steeply rising costs from claims in recent years. Mr Charles
Elly, the Law Society president, has identified rooting out fraud among
solicitors as one of his chief priorities.
The sum sought by Law Debenture represents an advance fee for a Dollars 50m
loan which was to be made to Belling itself in 1991 when the company faced
severe financial difficulties. Two directors of Belling, Mr Richard Belling
and Mr Michael Stewart, who were also pension scheme trustees, authorised
the pension scheme to make the payment from its own bank account directly
into the account of solicitor Mr Charles Julian Deacon. The loan to Belling
never materialised and in May 1992 receivers were appointed to the company.
Law Debenture says that, before making the payment to Mr Deacon, the Belling
directors received assurances from the Law Society that Mr Deacon was a
properly accredited and bona fide solicitor.
The Law Society said it rejected the claim because 'the directors (of
Belling) were the cause of the loss,' and the trustees should be pursuing
them. However even had the directors approached the fund, the application
'in all probability' would have been rejected because the directors should
not have misused pension scheme monies.
Mr Deacon, a solicitor from Newcastle-under-Lyme, was charged in May with
fraud and attempt to defraud. The charges allege that Mr Deacon and Mr Keith
Fuller obtained money by falsely representing a fee was an advance payment
for a larger loan. The two men are awaiting trial.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Ulster Tories seek to rock conference boat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservatives from Northern Ireland are moving to rock the boat before next
month's Tory conference by urging the party 'actively to persuade' the
people of the province that their best future lies within the UK.
They are trying to force a vote on this by canvassing support among Tory
constituency organisations.
Their amendment to the motion on Northern Ireland that will be debated at
the conference also calls for the deletion of a reference to the courage of
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. A letter to constituency
chairmen from Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, argues
that it would be 'distasteful to ask the party conference to praise Mr
Reynolds'.
The move emerged yesterday as Downing Street renewed its demands for an
unambiguous assurance that the IRA has ended violence for good. The
government's remarks came after Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said
during his US visit that he wanted 'a permanent peace'. 'I am not interested
in any temporary suspension,' Mr Adams said.
Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister sent by the
government to shadow Mr Adams's US tour, said the remarks 'take us a little
further. I happen to believe that the intention is that the end should be
permanent, but he cannot say it.'
The government has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn
Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA
violence.
Tory party rules vest the 'absolute right' to decide whether to call
amendments with the conference chairman, making it unlikely the Northern
Ireland amendment will be voted on.
However Mr Fee, chairman of the Tories' Northern Ireland Area Council,
believes the party's high command could be embarrassed if a significant
number of constituencies write in to express their support.
He points out that although the vast majority of Ulster-related motions
submitted to conference are concerned with 'strengthening the union and
governing Northern Ireland as the rest of the United Kingdom,' these
sentiments are not reflected in the motion selected for debate.
Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist party members on their return from a US trip said
they were interested in an all-party visit. Mr Jeffrey Donaldson, party
secretary, said the UUP was 'keen to explore ways in which there could be a
joint effort by the political parties in working for inward investment'.

FT  27 SEP 94 / MTV to establish HQ in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTV Networks, the US-owned music television group, is to make London its
international headquarters for all activities outside the US.
Mr Bill Roedy, chief executive of MTV Europe, will become president of MTV
Networks International, in charge of everything from MTV Latino, the Latin
American service, to the launch of two channels in Asia by the end of the
year.
He will continue to be based in London at the headquarters of MTV Europe
although he will also have an office in New York.
London has been given increased importance as an MTV centre because MTV
Europe, with music, news and features adapted for the European market, is
becoming bigger than the US operation.
MTV Europe has been profitable for two years although it declines to give
figures. It is available in more than 60m homes in 37 countries compared
with 59m for the US version, and in the past year has extended its reach to
Greece, the former Soviet Union, Lebanon and Turkey.
MTV, which is owned by Viacom, claims it is the biggest television network
in the world, reaching 250m homes in 63 countries.
On Friday MTV Networks launches a new UK satellite channel - VH-1 UK, a
music channel aimed at people aged 25 to 49.
Mr Roedy is studying the feasibility of a VH-1 channel for Germany and
planning two MTV Asian channels by the end of the year. MTV went off Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Star TV satellite system in April after the two sides
failed to agree.
The company is planning a scrambled Mandarin-language service aimed at
China, Taiwan and Singapore and an English language service with some Hindi
programming for India and south-east Asia.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Yeltsin's link to capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When Russian President Boris Yeltsin begins his Washington engagements
today, he will see Mrs Ruth Harkin, president of the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (Opic), almost everywhere he goes. They will meet at
the White House today for lunch with President Bill Clinton and leading
businessmen; at the White House state dinner tonight; at the Russian embassy
dinner tomorrow night; and Mrs Harkin will accompany Mr Yeltsin to Seattle
on Thursday.
Mrs Harkin's high profile role owes much to timing. The US no longer has the
dollars needed by new democracies to satisfy the demands of their liberated
electorates. But it does have credit and a flourishing private sector. With
its loans, guarantees and political risk insurance, Opic can be the key to
packaging financing for private sector development.
Congress has been impressed that Opic stretches a dollar as few
bureaucracies have done before. It has raised Opic's comparatively small
budget allotment from Dollars 50m in 1994 to Dollars 105m in 1995 for
project finance funding. Most of that is to go to the newly independent
republics of the former Soviet Union. Using its guarantees and insurance,
Opic attracts private investors and bond holders to risky but promising
projects. It can take Dollars 40m in loan guarantees and leverage this into
Dollars 1bn in investment. In less risky regions, it takes only Dollars 25m
to raise Dollars 1bn in backing. Opic's guarantees make only project finance
available. This means investors get the project as collateral and are repaid
from the profits.
The White House is equally pleased with Opic as the leading agency on
foreign policy initiatives. It is financing laundries and dry cleaners in
South Africa, supermarkets in the Russian Far East, and hotels in Gaza and
on the West Bank. Next month it will lead an investment mission to Hungary
to assist in the modernisation of its energy sector.
During this week alone, it is committing Dollars 1bn in financing and
political risk insurance for eight projects worth Dollars 2.3bn. These
include:
A consortium of western investors led by Texaco, backed by Dollars 400m in
Opic financing, to explore and develop the Timan Pechora Basin of Artic
Russia.
Dollars 250m in insurance and guarantees for an engine design project with
US, German and Russian partners.
A Dollars 60m loan guarantee for a project to improve phone services in 40
former Soviet cities and expand the number of international lines to Moscow.
Mrs Harkin wants to help develop Russia's pharmaceutical and agribusiness
sectors, where she sees 'enormous changes underway' in the food chain. She
plans investment in flour mills, grain storage facilities, seafood canning
and freezing facilities.
The impact of Opic's political risk insurance - covering political violence,
currency convertibility and expropriation - is rarely noted. With about
Dollars 100,000 in Opic insurance, a US munitions company, Alliant Tech
Systems, has embarked on a joint venture in Belarus, melting down old Soviet
munitions and selling it for scrap steel. A second project will be launched
in the Ukraine.
Around the world, Opic has 10 investment funds operating or in the process
of being launched.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan tries again to avoid US sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's international trade and industry minister,
will today make a last-ditch attempt to resolve the deadlock in US-Japanese
trade talks and avoid sanctions.
Mr Hashimoto's decision to fly to Washington for further talks coincided
with a warning from Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, that US trade
law obliges it to impose economic sanctions if there is no accord by the
Friday deadline.
'It's not something we'd want to do, but it would be something we would be
compelled to do under the law,' said Mr Mondale.
Mr Hashimoto will meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and
plans to return in time for the opening of the next parliamentary session on
Friday.
He takes the baton from Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, who had to
break off talks to prepare for a United Nations speech today.
There were signs of progress in talks on foreign access to Japan's public
procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, and on the
insurance market, said Mr Mondale.
Agreement on these would be 'the key to a more positive tone in the whole
trade matter', he said.
Access to Japan's car and car parts market, representing nearly 60 per cent
of its trade surplus with the US, and access to the market for flat glass,
where the economic stakes are small but symbolic, are the other outstanding
matters.
Cars - the main subject of Mr Hashimoto's mission - were 'not quite ripe'
for an accord and the outlook for a deal on glass was unclear, Mr Mondale
said.
The US ambassador could give no indication whether Washington might postpone
the sanctions deadline - as it did in a row over the Japanese construction
market last year - if there was an accord on public procurement or
insurance.
'I don't know if we will accept a partial package. . . but if we can't, the
provisions of our law will take place,' he said in reference to the US Trade
Act. Under this, sanctions would be announced in the event of failure to
agree on public procurement on Friday, to apply after a 30-day comment
period, on October 30.
Other sectors are covered by Super 301 of the act, an 18-month process which
has never yet led to penalties in other trade rows.
Mr Mondale said the latest negotiations were more productive than in
February, when the US and Japan broke off trade talks after a summit between
president Bill Clinton and former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa ended in
impasse. Tax cuts proposed by the Japanese government last week were a
'positive' move towards stimulating consumption and reducing the current
account surplus, he said.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Political storm in a Taiwan port -
Tensions with Beijing stand in way of Asian transport hub plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan has anointed the southern port of Kaohsiung as the centrepiece of a
plan to make the island an Asian transport hub. But its ban on direct trade
with China stands in the way of such regional ambitions.
Dubbed ROC (regional operations centre), the strategy was conceived by
government planners several years ago as one that would position Taiwan for
a new stage of industrial development.
The hope is to attract multinational companies to establish regional
headquarters in Taiwan as a base from which to penetrate China and
South-East Asian markets, especially after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
Kaohsiung was chosen for its harbour facilities and central location in East
Asia, says Mr Shive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, the government's top planning agency.
A government-commissioned study prepared by McKinsey &amp; Company, the US
management consultancy, on the development of Taiwan into a regional centre
for business, finance and transportation is to be released soon.
An earlier study on port development by consultancy Frederick R Harris,
Taiwan, concluded that from the perspective of shipping companies, using
Kaohsiung as a hub port for 'greater China' trade made better economic and
logistical sense than using Hong Kong - provided direct cross-strait sea
links were re-established.
The groundwork for such links has been done, according to Mr Hsieh
Ching-chang, the acting director of the Kaohsiung Harbour Bureau. But there
are still political tensions between Beijing and Taipei.
'Technically speaking, there is no problem whatsoever,' Mr Hsieh says. 'If
the government changes its policy tomorrow, we are ready.'
Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party broke off links with mainland China when
it fled to the island in 1949 after losing the civil war with Mao Zedong's
communist forces.
Dr John Ricklefs, senior vice president at Frederick R. Harris, estimates
that 15 per cent of Hong Kong's cargo volume, mainly trans-shipment, would
shift to Kaohsiung were direct links resumed. 'The real market growth in
this region is China, and the port of Kaohsiung has been locked out of
serving that market for purely political reasons,' he says.
Kaohsiung was the world's third-largest container port in 1993 with a total
volume of 4.64m TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units), half that of
first-ranked Hong Kong with 9.2m TEU. Singapore, second in the world at
9.05m TEU last year, does not directly compete with Kaohsiung as it serves
the South-East Asian market.
'Hong Kong is now being used by international shipping companies as the
gateway to the China market,' says Mr Peter Hsu, a manager in the Kaohsiung
offices of Sea-Land Service. With Hong Kong harbour operating at 10 to 20
per cent above capacity, space is at a premium. Sea-Land bases its large
ships in Kaohsiung and uses feeder lines to service mainland ports via Hong
Kong. 'With direct cross-strait trade, we could just skip Hong Kong,' Mr Hsu
says.
At least 75 per cent of Taiwan's rapidly rising exports to China are routed
through the British colony, with a small portion going via other ports such
as Singapore and Korea. Taiwanese businessmen are lobbying for direct trade
as it would reduce travel time and shipping costs.
Mr Chang Chun-hsiung, a legislator and the opposition Democratic Progressive
party's candidate for Kaohsiung mayor in year-end elections, is less
sanguine than ruling party officials about Kaohsiung's prospects.
'Kaohsiung is just not competitive with Hong Kong and Singapore,' he says.
'In the past, the harbour made a lot of money from Taiwan's exports and
cheap labour, but we cannot rely on those any longer. The port has not
sufficiently improved its efficiency, facilities and services.'
However, the main problem lies not in the port itself but in government
policy. 'If you don't have direct links with China, how can you become a
regional operations and transportation centre?' says Mr Chang.
Government officials brush off the thorny issue of direct transport links to
China's vast potential market. 'Already, 39 per cent of the container
traffic at Kaohsiung harbour is trans-shipment,' says Mr J T Chen, a senior
analyst at a think-tank under the ministry of transportation and
communications.
'If we can create favourable conditions to attract shipping companies to
Kaohsiung, then we can become more competitive. If the government can
provide a commercial park and if the management of the port can be improved,
then we should have no problem becoming a regional hub,' says Mr Chen.
Plans to expand port facilities and streamline its administration are being
drawn up, say harbour bureau officials. A fifth container terminal is
scheduled to be completed in 1998 and there are plans for either a sixth
container terminal or back harbour terminal on land bordering the harbour.
Customs clearance and processing will be expedited by a new computerised
system that is being installed, and which will reduce docking charges,
officials say. Authorities will also tackle labour issues, the problem
foreign shipping companies most often complain about. Ways to improve the
port's management structure and partially privatise harbour facilities are
under study.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Pakistan's energy sector attracts Dollars
4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's efforts to attract investments in power generation and in oil and
gas exploration have borne fruit in the form of contracts with US companies
worth about Dollars 4bn. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, described
the contracts as 'a landmark in the history of private sector investment' in
Pakistan.
The bulk of the new contracts involve power generation projects backed by US
businesses, including AES Corporation, Enron, GE Capital and Tenaska.
Occidental and Union Texas are involved in oil exploration contracts worth
Dollars 275m and many officials hope that new oil finds will help the
country's power generation efforts by providing lower cost fuel.
Domestic businesses have suffered production losses due to disrupted power
supplies. The rains that followed a long dry spell restored the country's
hydro-generation capacity and narrowed the gap between demand and supply.
However, the relief may be only temporary.
Many transmission lines are in a state of disrepair and the government
estimates that up to 33 per cent of the power generated in Karachi,
Pakistan's largest city, is lost in breakdowns, leakages and power thefts.
In the rest of the country, up to 23 per cent of generated power is lost in
similar ways.
An energy policy announced this summer has set the tone for fresh
investments. The government has eliminated much red tape by replacing a
series of official procedures with a one window set-up in Islamabad.
Moreover, investors have been assured of a bulk tariff rate of 6.5 cents per
kilowatt hour, considered to be one of the more attractive rates among
developing countries.
The government's private power board estimates that up to Dollars 5bn worth
of investments could come in power generation, in addition to the American
commitments, during the next three years.
However, for some investors, the signing of the deals may just be the
beginning of a difficult process involving financing. The financial package
requires them to put up a 20-30 per cent equity, while raising the rest in
loans or other financing. Senior Pakistani officials concede privately that
some of the sponsors may not be able to put together their financial
packages, especially as international demands for financing remain high.
Concerns have also been raised over the delay on Pakistan's plans to float
its first sovereign Eurobond offer worth Dollars 200m. It was originally
scheduled to take place this month but was postponed due to recent
turbulence on international bond markets.
Pakistani officials hope that the US commitments have opened the most
important window to attract fresh investments, and that other foreign
investors may follow.

FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US car industry in Asian mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US motor manufacturers and parts suppliers yesterday embarked on a campaign
to increase their business in South-East Asia, where the vehicle market is
dominated by Japanese corporations.
The 11-company US mission to Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia - sponsored by
the big three US carmakers Chrysler, Ford and General Motors and supported
by the US administration - comes at a time when US automotive companies are
attempting to increase their presence in the region after years of neglect.
'We're looking at how we can become members of the supplier community,' said
Mr Christopher Bates of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers' Association,
'in order to position ourselves for the growth that's going to occur over
the next decade.' Critics say they are arriving 20 years too late and have
allowed Japanese corporations to dictate policy to South-East Asian
governments on everything from industry standards to import tariffs.
In Thailand, for example, Japanese manufacturers supply more than 90 per
cent of the local vehicle market, with European luxury carmakers making up
most of the balance. 'We plan for the next quarter. The Japanese plan for
the next quarter-century,' admitted one executive for a US car company.
But some US businessmen are bullish about their chances in Asia. They point
out that South-East Asian markets are only now becoming big enough to enjoy
important economies of scale.
They also say some Japanese manufacturing operations in Asia and their local
parts suppliers are profitable only because of high tariffs which may be
reduced as Asian countries liberalise their trade regimes; just as the
Japanese successfully seized a big share of the US market after 1970, US
executives say, so it should be possible for US manufacturers to break
Japanese dominance in Asia today.
US car component makers, furthermore, see opportunities for supplying parts
to Japanese assemblers in Asia as they do in the US. In the past two years,
Chrysler has begun operations in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to
assemble the Jeep Cherokee and has tussled with its Japanese rivals to
ensure that its products are not discriminated against in national tariff
systems.
General Motors has re-entered the Indonesian market. Ford, which closed its
assembly operation in Thailand in 1976, is conducting a feasibility study on
whether to produce pick-ups in Thailand with Mazda. Thailand is the second
largest market in the world for pick-ups after the US.
This week's trade mission is supported by a US Commerce Department export
promotion programme announced by Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, in June.
The six-nation Association of South-East Asian Nations took Dollars 28bn of
US exports in 1993.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Settlers prepare for Golan fight to the last: David Horovitz
visits the site of most Israeli resistance to a deal to return the occupied
Heights to Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a bad pun, but it seems to be working. 'The keys to the Golan are in
your hands,' shouts the moustachioed salesman, proffering a cheap key-ring
bearing a map of the Golan Heights on one side and the slogan 'Peace with
the Golan' on the other.
At 10 shekels (more than Pounds 2) a time, the profit margin is healthy. And
there's no shortage of customers. Well over 100,000 Israelis have sauntered
past the key-ring vendor in the past fortnight, along the dusty track that
leads to the awning where a dozen Golan Heights activists are on hunger
strike.
Stirred into action by a flurry of reports that Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister, is ready to give up the Heights in return for a peace deal with
Syria, the hunger-strikers are becoming unlikely national celebrities, and
their hilltop headquarters is an essential stop-off for all those who
consider the mountainous Golan ridge essential to Israel's defence.
Until recently, Mr Rabin was of that opinion himself. Indeed, one of the
most powerful propaganda weapons in the pro-Golan campaigners' armoury is a
videotape of the prime minister at the height of his pre-election oratory
two years ago, declaiming earnestly that 'It is inconceivable, even at a
time of peace, to come down from the Golan.' Recorded on a self-rewinding
tape, the prime minister's stirring words boom out across the Gamla site,
hour after hour, day after day, from a television on a mobile stand across
the path from the key-ring salesman.
It was none other than Yitzhak Rabin who, as chief of staff, presided over
the capture of the Golan in the 1967 Arab-Israel war and who later, as prime
minister in the 1970s, encouraged many of the Golan's 13,000 Jews to move
here. And it was none other than Syria's President Hafiz Assad, then his
country's inexperienced defence minister, who relinquished the Heights.
Now Mr Assad is apparently prepared to make peace with his enemies in return
for the precious land. While Mr Rabin is saying nothing, Mr Shimon Peres,
his foreign minister, has as always put the cards on the table.
'Complete peace is more important to Israel's security than the entire
Golan,' Mr Peres said at the weekend.
Mr Sammy Bar-Lev, the mayor of the Golan's main Jewish town, Katzrin, and
one of the hunger-strikers, is disgusted by the turnaround. 'They've always
said Rabin couldn't take the pressure. Now here's your proof. Peres and the
Americans have bludgeoned him into a deal. And he's capitulated.'
Hardly plump at the best of times, Mr Bar-Lev looks almost emaciated,
subsisting with his 11 colleagues on a diet of water and salt tablets,
camped out on a hilltop in vicious heat that three electric fans are doing
little to ameliorate. On Sunday, he collapsed and was hospitalised but
continues to refuse food.
He says they have a clear aim and will fast for weeks if necessary to
achieve it: blocking parliamentary approval for a Golan land-for-peace
accord, by persuading several hawkish members of Mr Rabin's own Labour party
of the validity of their cause.
Mere Knesset (parliament) approval, however, will not be enough. Having
delivered that pre-election pledge, Mr Rabin recognises that he has no real
mandate for a full withdrawal. So he has promised to hold a national
referendum on the issue. And it is here that the Gamla protesters may have
their most profound impact.
Opinion polls suggest that fewer than 50 per cent of Israelis favour even a
partial pull-out. The visitors to Gamla - fed the legendary account of how a
few thousand Jews defied the Romans for years at this very site, before
jumping to their deaths from a jagged hilltop - are having that anti-
withdrawal sentiment reinforced.
In marked contrast to the noisy, but ill-supported campaigners against the
autonomy deal with the PLO in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
tens of thousands of Gamla pilgrims are neither overwhelmingly religious nor
right-wing.
Indeed, some of the strikers and many of their supporters are card-carrying
members of the Labour Party. 'Rabin isn't with us any more,' says Yehuda
Harel, a veteran Labour man who is one of those fasting, 'but the Labour
movement is. There is no other Labour movement.'
In truth, many in Labour are hesistant about leaving the Golan. But if Mr
Assad were to make a Sadat-style trip to Jerusalem and declare a genuine
desire for peace, a healthy proportion in Mr Rabin's party and among the
electorate at large would probably put their doubts aside. With that in
mind, Mr Bar-Lev argues that the referendum should be held immediately -
that it is 'immoral' for Mr Rabin to promise an eventual vote 'when the deal
is all wrapped up'.
'He'll play it so that to vote against the deal will seem like voting for
war. It's unethical. It's not right.'
But it is good politics. And it could well mean that, for all the thousands
of supporters patting Mr Bar-Lev gently on the back and shaking their heads
at Mr Rabin's empty videotaped Golan rhetoric, the resistance at Gamla is
destined to fail again.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Rabin lifts ban on West Bank settler homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli government is lifting the freeze it imposed two years ago on
building new housing for Jewish settlers in the occupied territories.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has approved plans for the construction of
almost 1,000 housing units at the settlement of Alfei Menashe, just inside
the West Bank, adjacent to the narrow strip of central Israel where the
country is just five miles wide. Building is set to begin in about six
months.
Housing Ministry officials are said to be drawing up a list of several other
settlements where they plan to construct new housing.
Mr Marwan Kanafani, a spokesman for the PLO chairman, Mr Yassir Arafat,
called the expansion plans a violation 'in letter and spirit' of all
Israeli-PLO peace accords.
He said Palestinian negotiators, due to meet the Israelis in Cairo next week
to discuss the next phases of the autonomy process, would lodge an official
protest.
Mr Oded Ben-Ami, a spokesman for Mr Rabin, defended the move, noting that
Alfei Menashe lies only just across the 'seam' that separates the West Bank
from sovereign Israel.
About 130,000 Jews live in 140 settlements dotted across the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
Mr Rabin has little regard for what he calls the 'ideological settlements',
located close to Palestinian population centres. But he does value the
security buffer provided by settlements around Jerusalem, on the Jordan
border, and along the western edge of the West Bank where Israel is
narrowest.
Alfei Menashe falls into this last category, and the building plans suggest
Mr Rabin is keen to reinforce buffer settlements in advance of an Israeli
army withdrawal from much of the West Bank as the peace process moves
forward.
On taking office in July 1992, Mr Rabin froze new settlement building, and
approved the completion of fewer than half of the approximately 25,000 West
Bank Jewish housing units then in mid-construction. Those moves were crucial
to the success of Israel-PLO autonomy negotiations.
He must be hoping, too, that the issue will not derail a meeting in
Washington next week between Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Jordan's
Crown Prince Hassan, hosted by President Bill Clinton, at which the two
reportedly plan to discuss the drafting of a full Israel-Jordan peace
treaty.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Protests greet Israel's new interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Israel's decision to raise interest rates by a sharp 1.5
percentage points, in what looks like an increasingly desperate effort to
rein in surging inflation, has brought a chorus of disapproval.
The stock market has dipped, the Histadrut labour federation has lamented
the rise workers face in mortgage repayments, the Manufacturers' Association
has warned of looming recession, and Mr Micha Harish, minister for trade and
industry, has spoken of a dangerous lack of co-ordination between the
central bank, the Finance Ministry and the various other economy ministries.
Professor Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, is unmoved by the
protests. He has raised interest rates no fewer than seven times since last
November, including another 1.5 percentage point increase only a month ago.
He has given no firm assurance that this week's rise, to 15.5 per cent, will
be the last.
The government had set a target of 8 per cent for inflation in 1994, and one
of 8-11 per cent for 1995, he notes. In reality, the 1994 rate is running at
about 14.5 per cent. If the 1995 goal proves unrealistic, he says, 'it will
really undermine the credibility of the government's economic policy'.
At the back of Prof Frenkel's mind lies the memory of the early 1980s, when
Israel's annual inflation rate soared to 450 per cent and the then finance
minister suggested tying the Israeli shekel directly to the dollar.
A drastic austerity package finally pegged the triple-figure rate to below
20 per cent within two years, a package that included interest rates as high
as 40 per cent.
Some experts believe that treatment is needed now. 'If the bank really wants
to fight inflation with monetary policy,' says Mr Ya'acov Sheinin of the
Economic Models company, 'interest rates would have to double.'
But Mr Harish and Mr Dan Popper, president of the Manufacturers'
Association, warn that the current 6 per cent-plus annual growth is already
threatened by the interest rate rises, noting the government has plenty of
other weapons in its armoury. The problem is that the government has seemed
reluctant to use them.
A key component in the inflationary spiral is the rise in house prices,
propelled not only by local buyers, but by foreign investors keen to buy
property in an Israel on the threshold of peace.
Cabinet meetings have been devoted to tackling the issue, committees have
met, prime minister Yitzhak Rabin has pledged his trouble-shooting
expertise. Yet, for all the proposals, no significant increase has occurred
in housing starts. Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, admitted last
weekend he could not see anything stemming the house price rises in the near
future.
It is a similar story with fruit and vegetable prices, at present the
leading factor in pushing up the monthly consumer price index. The
Agriculture Ministry has been resisting calls for import of cheaper produce,
and only recently licences have been granted for limited imports of apples,
pears and potatoes.
Mr Danny Gillerman, president of Israel's Chambers of Commerce, says the
government is shooting itself in the foot, by approving high public-sector
wage settlements and, recently, price increases for phones and public
transport.
Overall, Prof Frenkel takes pains to emphasise the economy is in robust
shape, with growth high and unemployment falling. 'But there are signs it
may be overheating,' a bank spokesman said yesterday. 'Savings are down,
credit is too readily available, private consumption is rising rapidly. The
time has come for more restrictive monetary policies.'
Prof Frenkel's problem is that interest rate rises are his only means of
fighting inflation. To tackle it more effectively, he needs more
co-operation from Mr Shochat and his cabinet colleagues.

South Africa's inflation rate jumped to 9.4 per cent in August, well up on
the 8.2 per cent recorded in July and over 2 per cent higher than the 7.1
per cent reached in April, Mark Suzman reports from Johannesburg.
The figures are the latest in a series of worrying economic statistics for
the South African government, which said at the weekend that the trade
surplus had slumped to R288m (Pounds 51.6m) in August, down from R1.65bn in
July, and the lowest in nearly two years.
The South African Reserve Bank yesterday raised its key bank rate to 13 from
12 per cent.

Saudi Arabia announced last night that the authorities were holding 110
people in connection with 'attempts to sow dissension and cause chaos',
Reuter reports from Dubai.
An interior ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency
was the kingdom's first confirmation that opponents of the government had
been arrested.
A London-based opposition group alleged a week ago that more than 1,000
followers of a Moslem sheikh had been rounded up after demonstrations
against his arrest.
'The total of those detained is 110 people. The release of some will be
considered once investigations now under way with them are complete,' the
statement said. 'The cases of those who played a leading role will be
considered after the completion of investigations into plans to cause
chaos,' the statement added.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Algerian radical leader shot dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algerian security forces shot dead Mr Cherif Gousmi, leader of the country's
most feared fundamentalist group, the Islamic Armed Group (GIA) in Algiers
yesterday, Francis Ghiles writes.
The GIA leader whose nom de guerre was Abou Abdallah Ahmed had reiterated
his movement's opposition to any dialogue with President Liamine Zeroual
after two leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), were
transferred from jail to house arrest two weeks ago.
The GIA has claimed responsibility for the murder of most of the 60
foreigners killed in Algeria in the past year, and has burned down more than
300 schools and threatened to murder teachers working for 'an impious
state'.
Its campaign against intellectuals claimed another victim yesterday when a
lecturer at the Economics Faculty of Oran, Mr Abderrahmane Fardeheb, was
shot and injured.
Analysts agree that the violence unleased by the interruption of elections
the FIS was poised to win in January 1992 has cost 28,000 lives, two-thirds
lost since last November after three French consular officials were
kidnapped.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Keating has little doubt Australia will be republic
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's prime minister Paul Keating has 'little doubt' his countrymen
will endorse a move to make Australia a republic and sever its ties with the
British Crown, he said in Hobart yesterday.
Opinion polls suggest that a majority of Australians still support the
current constitutional structure, albeit by a declining margin.
But Mr Keating told the conference of his ruling Labor Party in Hobart that
'effectively we have handed the baton of the republic to the Australian
people.
'I am in little doubt that they will carry it across the line.
'A healthy debate is now under way,' he continued. 'We want to see the idea
of the republic become clearer in the public mind.
'As it becomes clearer, the resolve will grow stronger.'
The Australian Labor party subsequently confirmed its support for any
changes necessary to make Australia an independent republic by the year
2001.
In a wide-ranging keynote address to the ALP conference, Mr Keating placed
much emphasis on the importance to Australia's future of the 'information
superhighway' and on the increasing trade links with the Asia-Pacific
region.
The meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum
in November, he said, was 'of profound importance to Australia's exporters,
farmers and workers. No one can estimate what even modest success with Apec
might be worth.'
The necessary ALP approval for proposed privatisation of the 22 airports run
by the Federal Airports Corporation is likely to be forthcoming today after
hectic backroom dealing in Hobart.
However, the airports will probably be sold on a piecemeal basis rather than
as a group, and on 50-year leases.
There is also likely to be a cap on foreign ownership of 49 per cent.

<TEXT>
China and the government that will take over Hong Kong after Beijing regains
sovereignty in 1997 would suffer if the work of the Joint Liaison Group
(JLG), set up to oversee the detail of the handover, was not speeded up, Mr
Chris Patten, the governor, said yesterday.
On the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Joint Declaration agreeing
terms for Hong Kong's transfer, he said: 'We are beginning to run out of
time; the last meeting registered little progress. We've got to do better.
The issues are complicated but mostly not political. But they are important.
China and the SAR (post-'97 Special Administrative Region) will suffer if
they are not resolved.'
Echoing the words of Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, who visited the
colony 12 days ago, Mr Patten urged an imaginative and patient approach,
suggesting some tinkering with the existing machinery might be needed to
attack the growing backlog of issues now with the JLG. 'Douglas Hurd will
want to discuss with China's Vice-Premier Qian Qichen whom he's meeting on
Thursday, how we can get around some of these obstacles, how we can get the
forward movement we need.'
Last week's JLG talks were muddied by a deadlock on Hong Kong's badly needed
ninth container terminal. China intends to veto the franchise. Other
pressing issues on the JLG table cited by Mr Patten yesterday are freedom of
travel and the local re-enactment and adaptation of some 800 laws and
ordinances. Mr Patten used the occasion to commend the Joint Declaration,
initialled on September 26, 1984, and to enumerate the milestones reached by
Hong Kong since then.
These were: a doubling of GDP in real terms every decade (Hong Kong is today
the world's eighth biggest trading economy and has a per capita GDP of
Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 12,667) and a 15-fold increase in the capitalisation
of the stock market.
'The Treaty sets a clear framework for Hong Kong's future up to and well
beyond 1997. No one pretends it is perfect, nor that it has dispelled every
uncertainty. But imagine what Hong Kong would have been like without the
Joint Declaration, as 1997 loomed ever larger and the uncertainties grew.'

The Sri Lankan government has appointed a former Supreme Court judge to
investigate the purchase of five aircraft worth Dollars 643m (Pounds 407m)
by Air Lanka, from Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft maker, writes
Mervyn de Silva in Colombo.
Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the prime minister who took office a month ago,
has asked Mr O M Seneviratne to head a commission of inquiry into the
contract, which was signed in August 1991, under the rule of the previous
United National Party government.
The purchase has been criticised for being secretive and too costly.
The contract is the largest of several transactions involving foreign
companies which are being investigated after widespread allegations of
financial irregularities.
Allegations of irregularities by members of the UNP government, which held
power for 17 years until its general election defeat last month, played a
big role in the election.
Mrs Kumaratunge's victory was due partly to her promises to root out
corruption.
Air Lanka originally contracted to buy five Airbus A340-300 jets - three to
be delivered in 1994 and 1995, and two for delivery in 1998 and 1999. The
orders were placed amid controversy in Sri Lanka about whether scarce
foreign exchange should be spent on the aircraft.
Whatever the inquiry finds, the newly elected government would find it
costly to scrap the contracts because Air Lanka has paid a pre-delivery
deposit of Dollars 74m.

FT  27 SEP 94 / India seeks to limit spread of plague

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian health authorities were yesterday struggling to control the spread of
pneumonic plague after signs of further outbreaks following the flight of
some 300,000-500,000 people from the western city of Surat.
The number of new patients admitted to hospital in Surat fell yesterday to
about 40, the lowest daily figure since the outbreak started, but the
disease was blamed for two deaths in villages about 40km away. There were
also reports of people with plague-like symptoms in hospital in other parts
of northern and western India - including Ahmedabad, Bombay and in New
Delhi, 1,200 km from Surat.
Health officials in Bombay, New Delhi and elsewhere have been put on alert
following the outbreak, which has left at least 43 people dead and about 400
others desperately ill. Other countries are also monitoring the plague,
including Arab states, which were yesterday holding a meeting of health
officials of members of the Gulf Co-operation Council to co-ordinate a
response.
The meeting followed a decision by the United Arab Emirates to carry out
medical checks on all travellers arriving from India.
Meanwhile, India has received offers of medicine from the World Health
Organisation, Unicef, the US, Russia and elsewhere.
Pneumonic plague is a deadly variant of the bubonic plague which decimated
Europe in the 14th century. Unlike bubonic plague, it is spread easily by
airborne infection but can be effectively treated as long as the remedy -
the antibiotic tetracycline - is given early enough.
In Surat, 800 paramilitary personnel were yesterday searching the city for
plague victims.
They also stood guard at the main hospital to prevent patients from fleeing,
following the escape of about 100 victims at the weekend, who ran away in
the belief they would receive better care at home.
There is considerable confusion about the precise number of victims because
some people who died early in the outbreak with plague-like symptoms have
since been found to have died of other causes. Also, an unknown number of
people died outside hospital and have been cremated or buried by their
families.
Municipal workers were yesterday clearing piles of rubbish, including the
carcasses of animals left behind by a recent flood, which many residents
believe caused the disease. Others have connected the outbreak to an attack
of bubonic plague which erupted last month in central Maharashtra in a
district hit last year by a devastating earthquake. But health officials say
the origins of the outbreaks, the first in 30 years, are not clear.
The outbreak has disrupted business in Surat, a city of 2m known for
textiles, chemicals and diamond polishing.

<TEXT>
The Mexican peso strengthened yesterday and secondary market interest rates
eased on the first day of trading after renewal of the annual economic pact
between the government, business and unions.
The government resisted pressure in the pact to boost short-term economic
growth, deciding to leave exchange rate policy unchanged and to run a
balanced budget next year.
The pact committed the government of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, which is due to
take office in early-December, to an inflation rate target of 4 per cent
next year, from the current rate of just under 7 per cent.
The decision to push for a lower inflation rate at the expense of higher
short-term economic growth was seen as positive news for the peso and for
fixed-income instruments.
'The announcement will be sufficient to restore calm to the foreign exchange
and money markets, after the speculation last week,' said Mr Lawrence
Goodman, vice-president at Salomon Brothers.
'This was an aggressive move to instil confidence in the market.'
The peso, after strengthening on Friday as rumours of a renewed pact reached
the market, climbed further yesterday, and closed at 3.378 to the dollar.

There were no live television pictures from a Los Angeles courtroom
yesterday as the US murder trial of the year got under way.
How the country will survive without its daily televised fix of the trial of
O J Simpson, the retired American football star accused of the murder of his
former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, is
doubtful.
The cameras did not roll yesterday because Judge Lance Ito of the
Californian Superior Court began questioning as many as 1,000 prospective
jurors, from whom a panel of 12, with eight alternates, must be chosen. This
process is held in camera, as it were.
Judge Ito must first ascertain which jurors cannot, for business or personal
reasons, take three months off, especially if the jury is sequestered. This
could reduce the 1,000-name list by 75 per cent.
Defence and prosecution lawyers have submitted briefs outlining the
questions they would like to see satisfactorily answered. Since no
prospective juror living in the US can claim ignorance of the case,
selection criteria include sex, race, age, known attitudes and personal
history.
Lawyers, psychologists, DNA scientists, and experts in race relations (Mr
Simpson is black, his wife and Mr Goldman were white) have all had their
disparate views fully aired in preliminary sessions.
A Los Angeles Times poll yesterday found 34 per cent believed him guilty,
and 16 per cent innocent, with the balance undecided. As with other surveys,
far more blacks than whites thought him a victim of racial prejudice.
It may take up to a month for a jury to be empanelled. Even then, there is
no guarantee the trial will be covered live. Last week, the judge, enraged
at press leaks and stories of little apparent substance, said he would
consider banning some or all media.
This is within his power but he is unlikely to impose the extreme sanction.
If he did, the media would go to court to demand that he be overruled. Last
week, a committee of judges recommended that the experiment of televising
federal trials be discontinued - but this is a state case and California is
the home of television.
Beyond its celebrity element - Mr Simpson, after a glittering career on the
field, became one of the most visible TV pitchmen for assorted commercial
products - the trial itself may prove of legal importance as a test of the
usefulness and admissibility of DNA analysis.

FT  27 SEP 94 / US health reform lost for this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The centrepiece of President Bill Clinton's domestic agenda, reform of the
US healthcare system, was last night formally declared lost for this year by
the man who had fought hardest to keep it alive.
Pronouncing what has been obvious for the best part of a month, Senator
George Mitchell of Maine, Democratic majority leader in the Senate, conceded
that not even a skeletal bill, stripped of all the president's most
ambitious plans, had a chance of passing Congress in the two weeks before
the recess for Congressional elections in November.
Speaking in New York last night, the president said he was 'disappointed',
but added: 'Our mission will continue.'
The House of Representatives had given up hope of a bill some weeks ago, but
Mr Mitchell had stubbornly refused to do so while a bipartisan group of
Senate moderates was seeking a politically saleable, modest, alternative.
That effort is also now doomed, as many of its protagonists have publicly
accepted.
Mr Mitchell said that the final straw had come last week when the Republican
leaders in Congress told the president they would block approval of the
Uruguay Round trade agreement if Mr Mitchell insisted on bringing a
healthcare bill to the floor.
When he announced, earlier this year and to universal surprise, his decision
not to seek re-election in November, Senator Mitchell pledged to strive
might and main to pass a healthcare bill. His disappointment, then, is as
great as that of Mr Clinton and his wife, Hillary, a leading architect of
the president's proposals. They deserved 'enormous credit' for their
efforts, Mr Mitchell said last night.
Prospects of any such legislation next year depend heavily on the outcome of
the November elections. Predicted Republican gains, including control of
either the Senate or the House, do not augur well. Even so, partly for
tactical reasons, Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader, had
proposed a bill by his party, mostly directed at reform of health insurance.
However, the Republican obstruction of healthcare reform, allied to
comparable attempts to frustrate other legislation, do give Mr Clinton and
the Democrats arguments for the congressional campaigns. The Republican view
is that this is more tolerable than having the Democrats go to the country
with great legislative success to flourish.
The administration's bill was laid before Congress a year and four days ago
by Mr Clinton, with great fanfare and considerable initial support by the
public. Its failure may be ascribed to systemic factors above and beyond
pure political partisanship.
The original blueprint, seeking to extend, by the end of the century,
insurance coverage to the estimated 37m Americans now unprotected was both
complex and controversial. Several key components, such as the creation of
insurance purchasing alliances, ran into heavy fire and the whole plan was
attacked for the controls it would have vested in the federal bureaucracy.
Special interest groups, representing the medical and insurance industries
and small businesses, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into lobbying
and advertising against the bill. This helped turn public opinion and
produced great divisions in Congress. By midsummer, four committees of the
House and Senate had recommended to their full chambers assorted legislation
 -but the differences were huge.
In August, Senator Mitchell introduced his own bill, a much lesser affair
than Mr Clinton's, so as to bridge the gaps. But the House, unwilling to act
before the Senate, delayed crucial votes. Congress then became consumed by
the crime bill.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Cubans urged not to forget their sugar: Havana recognises
food market reforms are not enough to rescue economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a recent broadcast, Cuban state radio chastised some of the country's
sugar workers for spending more time growing food than weeding cane fields.
More food is what the government would like - and has announced reforms to
encourage - but not at the expense of sugar production. Even if its farm
reforms, modelled on those that proved so successful in China and Vietnam,
do produce results, boosting sugar production will prove more difficult.
But Cuban officials say it is imperative to help haul the country out of its
four-year-old recession that has seen the economy's buying power (its
capacity to import using available export revenues) contract from USDollars
8bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.7bn in 1993.
'Cuba is a sugar economy . . . . Economic recovery must come through
recovery in the sugar harvests,' Mr Octavio Castilla, deputy minister for
foreign investment and economic co-operation, said.
From this Saturday, Cuba's farmers will gradually start legally selling
produce directly to the public. Under reforms detailed last week, state
farms and individual growers, excluding sugar co-operatives, will be allowed
freely to set their own prices to sell surplus fruit and vegetables after
they have fulfilled government supply quotas.
The reforms, part of an on-going cautious process of economic
liberalisation, are aimed at easing chronic food shortages and combating the
flourishing black market. To some extent they amount to the legalisation of
an already widespread sale of black market produce by Cuban farmers which
has resulted in inflationary black market prices.
'I am sure that with this legislation we can stimulate food production
through the law of supply and demand,' Cuban defence minister Raul Castro,
brother of President Fidel Castro, said.
The strategic sugar sector appears headed for another difficult season. It
was one of the areas hardest hit by the unravelling of the comfortable
cocoon of preferential trade and aid ties Cuba had enjoyed with the now
defunct Soviet bloc. The impact of this economic shock has been compounded
by a US trade and financial embargo that remains firmly in place.
The 1992-93 sugar harvest, hit by bad weather and shortages of fuel,
fertilisers and spares, was only 4.2m tonnes, a 40 per cent drop from the
previous season. The 1993-94 crop fell lower still. Cuba put it at just
above 4m tonnes. Some international traders said it was even lower.
Sugar is not just the island's biggest export earner, accounting for about
40 per cent of total external revenue in 1993. It is also a key commodity to
trade for vital oil imports and is closely inter-linked with other sectors
such as farming, export rum production and energy generation.
As Cuba prepares for the start of the next harvest in November, alarm bells
are sounding about sloppy preparations. In unusually frank reports, the
state media have criticised poor repairs and maintenance at sugar mills,
delays in new cane plantings and the failure of sugar workers to weed
growing cane fields.
'One of the most critical points at this time is the sugar harvest,' Mr
Castilla said. He said urgent reforms were needed to de-centralise,
re-organise and revitalise the sugar sector.
Incentives for sugar workers either in the form of bonuses or improved
access to necessary consumer goods in exchange for higher productivity,
similar to those already introduced in the tourism sector, are being
discussed.
If this season's harvest is as bad, or worse, than the last, gross earnings
from tourism could overtake sugar as the island's leading hard currency
earner. The tourism industry, one of the first to be opened to foreign
investment, had became more profitable and cost effective as the number of
foreign visitors increased.
Figures published by Cuba's Centre for Studies on the Cuban Economy show
that tourism grossed Dollars 650m in 1993 - net earnings are substantially
less because of the imports needed to service the tourist industry -
compared with Dollars 720m earned by sugar exports.
Besides tourism, foreign investors, especially Mexicans, are putting money
into textiles, cement, steel and glass manufacturing, cosmetics production
and citrus farming. Canadians are leading the field in the oil exploration
and mining sectors.
One additional external squeeze will come from the US government's decision
on August 20 to restrict dollar remittances sent to relatives in Cuba by
Cuban-Americans living in the US. Mr Jose Luis Rodrguez, the finance
minister, said this would hurt, but described as 'exaggerated' US reports
that the remittances represented Dollars 500m of income for Cuba each year.
Over the last 18 months, the government has lifted a ban on Cubans using
hard currency, legalised limited private initiative in some trades and
crafts and moved to balance the country's lopsided internal finances through
cutting subsidies, starting a tax system and raising prices of utilities and
consumer goods such as alcohol and cigarettes.
'We're moving, we're not standing about with our arms crossed. There is a
process of reform in progress,' Osvaldo Martnez, president of the Cuban
parliament's Economy Commission, said.
But it is clear the reform process will be cautious and controlled and
limited by the government's expressed intention to preserve its one-party
socialist system. 'We can't let the process run away from us,' Mr Martnez
said.
The government's dilemma is that it must move quickly enough to respond to
popular pressure in demands for improved economic conditions while not
letting the momentum of economic reform wrest centralised control of the
economy completely from it hands.

FT  27 SEP 94 / US warns Moscow on complacency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, yesterday urged Russia to quicken
economic reform while simultaneously taking additional steps to control
inflation.
Speaking in advance of today's summit between presidents Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, he said: 'Russia's progress has been better than most people
expected, but the danger now is that complacency could lead to a severe
setback.'
Specifically, Mr Bentsen said that adoption of a tougher fiscal budget could
release Dollars 8bn to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6.3bn) in western
assistance already promised at the G7 summits. Pegging the rouble on the
foreign exchange markets 'would bolster market confidence by delivering an
effective Dollars 6bn currency stabilisation fund'.
'Let me be clear,' he went on, 'our support policy has been successful
because our lending is conditional. For Russia to get all this money I've
mentioned, it needs a bold economic reform programme.'
Mr Bentsen was complimentary about Russia's political and economic
achievements. He noted that inflation was down to about 5 per cent a month
from more than 20 per cent a month last year; that real interest rates were
now positive, real incomes rising, not declining; and that 50 per cent of
gross domestic product was now in privatised hands.
But Russia, he went on, 'must finish the privatisation job and not get stuck
half-way'. More companies needed to be sold and more land released from
state control.
'In the long run our relationship must be based on trade and investment, not
aid,' Mr Bentsen maintained. US assistance approved by Congress is due to
fall next year to Dollars 850m from the Dollars 2.5bn of 1993-94.
The Clinton administration is broadly satisfied with the present state of
relations with Russia, although nervous about political developments over
which US influence is marginal at best.
Rifts with Moscow over the former Yugoslavia have been carefully avoided so
far, through strong Russian involvement in the Bosnian 'contact group'. The
US worked hard to help resolve the difficult issue of the status of Russian
military and civilians still in the Baltics, and has tacitly acknowledged
Russian hegemony over some former Soviet satellite states, such as Georgia.
At the same time, Nato's 'partnership for peace' programme has seen the
first joint exercises between Russian and western forces. Last week
President Clinton ruled out further reductions in the US nuclear arsenal
until cuts already agreed with Russia had been implemented, but the US is
likely to remain open to further Russian initiatives.
But, as Mr Bentsen's speech was designed to make clear, the greatest
positive contribution the US believes can be made to Russian domestic
stability is greater integration with western economies.
'The present situation in Russia worries me,' he said, 'and I can't tell you
how this will turn out. But I do know that to avoid slipping backward,
Russia must take a bold step forward.'

FT  27 SEP 94 / Guatemala trade hopes threatened by labour claims

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Brown, the chairman of the Congressional working group on
international labour rights, is opposing a Clinton administration proposal
to ease pressure on Guatemala over its abuse of workers' rights.
Guatemala is a beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences, which
provides duty-free entry of developing country products to the US market. US
law requires that GSP benefits are not extended to countries which show no
progress in improving their workers' rights. Guatemala recently reformed
some labour practices, prompting Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative,
to consider relaxing the US stance on the country.
He is due to make a decision by by Friday.
However, the Organisation of American States last week heard testimony from
three Guatemalan workers, who claimed that violence against trade unionists
had increased in recent months.
In one alleged incident, workers occupied a plantation to draw attention to
the firing of 62 workers who had been demanding the legal minimum wage of
Dollars 2 (Pounds 1.25) a day.
They were forcibly evicted by an anti-riot squad, according to the three,
who testified in Washington. Three workers were killed, 11 were wounded, and
19 have disappeared. Mr Diego Orozco, who led the protest, died; witnesses
claimed he had been hurled from a helicopter.
Labour rights activists say Guatemala has failed some of its reform
promises. 'Not a single case of violence against trade unionists has been
prosecuted since . . . August 1991, let alone resulted in a conviction or
imprisonment,' Congressman Brown said in a letter to be sent to Mr Kantor.
Mr Kantor's decision may be delayed because the GSP programme is due to
lapse the same day the decision is due. Its renewal is attached to
legislation implementing the Uruguay Round.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, settling into its second week of intervention in Haiti, yesterday
outlined a plan to secure political institutions for the transition from
military rule to the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The plan - which includes buying civilian-held weapons from today, a
guarantee to ensure security at the parliament tomorrow, and the
reinstallation of the elected mayor of Port-au-Prince on Thursday - is an
indication of US confidence that, after a week of evolving operational
procedures, it is now in control.
The homecoming of 221 refugees, who had been at the US naval base of
Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, was also seen as an indication that the US presence
had allayed popular fears of political violence in Haiti.
A month-long purchasing of civilian-held weapons was expected to start
today, in an attempt to ensure public safety and to minimise the dangers of
recrimination in a divided society. The US was offering to buy handguns for
Dollars 50, semi-automatic rifles for Dollars 100, automatic rifles for
Dollars 200, machine-guns and artillery for Dollars 300 until October 25.
The US mission in Haiti has set as a priority the disarming of the many
self-appointed police auxiliaries, militia and nationalists who have styled
themselves on the ruthless Tonton Macoutes political force of the Duvalier
dictatorship. US army officials would not comment on whether the voluntary
sale of weapons would be followed by a campaign of force to disarm Haitian
citizens.
US officials yesterday pledged to protect the 24 pro-Aristide
parliamentarians who have been in exile in the US or in hiding in Haiti.
Parliament will reconvene tomorrow, following President Aristide's decision
to convene the assemby so that it mayx draw up and vote on an amnesty law
requested by the transition agreement.
The absence of pro-Aristide deputies, who have feared police violence if
they attend parliament in the capital, has meant the assembly has not
achieved a quorum for months.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Counting on the Americans: James Harding finds Haitian
business nervous about Aristide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Haiti, how you count money depends on who you are.
In the slums of Port-au-Prince, the street vendors tend to give prices in
gourdes, the national currency. At the restaurants and boutiques of
Petionville, the affluent town in the hills above the capital, prices come
in Haitian dollars - a fictional currency but a confusing shorthand for five
gourdes.
The different languages of money are more than just an illustration of the
disparity of wealth in Haiti. The dollar, so called, dates back to the last
US occupation, from 1915 to 1934, when the Americans guaranteed the Haitian
currency at five gourdes to the US dollar. Since then, the gourde has been
devalued and the guarantee has slipped.
But the Haitian business community - whose power is in the hands of a
reclusive, fractious group of commercial families - may be hoping that the
US again takes a position as guarantor of Haiti's economic stability.
The co-operation of these economic barons with US forces and their attitudes
to the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will be critical in the
effort to restore democracy.
Few in the business community relish the prospect of Aristide's return. Many
remember the thousands on the street and the speeches inviting the poor to
take what was rightfully theirs from the wealthy, during the seven months
the elected president inhabited the presidential palace.
Even though Mr Olivier Nadal, secretary-general of the Haitian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and president of his family company Nadalsa, has seen
his turnover contract from Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m) to Dollars 5m and his
workforce shrink from more than 500 to less than 100, he is not sure that
the lifting of the embargo compensates for the restoration of the populist
leader. 'Lifting the embargo is for sure good, but we need security in and
around my factories, security to invest in my land. Aristide never gave us
that.'
While some people may fear President Aristide's populist credentials, many
hope that three years in Washington and a return facilitated by the US will
have tempered his left-wing radicalism.
'The President can do great things for this country,' explains Mr Gregory
Mevs, one of the most powerful businessmen in Haiti. 'He is like Mao
Tse-dong, a great leader, but he needs a good Chou En-lai, a good mandarin
to guide him. Maybe it'll be the US.'
Mr Johnny Brandt, a businessman whose riven family's interests stretch
throughout the Haitian economy, strikes a common note of mea culpa and
acknowledges the responsibility lies with people like him. He is 'scared not
knowing what Aristide is going to do.'
The baronial class is made up of several dozen families, most of them
mulatto. The established grandees are still thought to hold the keys to
stability and development in Haiti. None is more influential than the
Brandts and the Mevs.
The Brandt empire was founded on textile production, after OJ Brandt, an
immigrant from Germany with Jamaican connections, built the first textile
mill in Port-au-Prince in 1946. The family has broken up and its business
has since diversified to include an edible oil refinery, poultry production,
assembly plant leasing, retailing and agricultural production.
The Mevs control another big wedge of the economy, including a monopoly on
sugar trade and production, shoes, plastics and detergents manufacture, a
downtown industrial park and recent infrastructural developments on the
quayside in Port-au-Prince and Gonaves.
Both are engaged in leasing agreements with the US army. Many have pointed
out the irony of such co-operation, whereby the US stations its forces and
supplies in Mevs and Brandt facilities. The families were understood to have
been among the financiers of the 1991 coup which ousted Aristide and have
since been powerful lobbyists in Washington to prevent his return.
However, US commanders have clearly recognised that they would ostracise
such powerful interests at their peril. The Mevs' Terminal Varreux
development, a port facility and 43m-gallon petrol storage station, has
become the third most important stategic position for the US army in a
country where the embargo has forced petrol prices up to nearly Dollars 20
per gallon.
If it is not surprising that the US should do deals with powerful interests,
it is in character for the leading families to link with the ascendant
authority in Haiti. The Brandts and the Mevs built their businesses into
empires during the three decades of Duvalier rule and have survived the
seven years of turmoil since with delicate and monied diplomacy.
Mr Claude Deschamps, who employs 200 people in his schoolbook and paper
production facility and is related by marriage to the Brandts, believes an
active role and a low profile are the ingredients for commerical longevity
in Haiti's polity. 'The business sector prefers to work in the shadows, in a
place where politics is unstable, if you put your face up front you're going
to get punched in the face,' he says.
The ability to put a positive gloss on all political developments is matched
only by adaptability in business. The Mevs empire moved from import
substitution in the 1970s into export production, and then, when the embargo
cut off their raw materials, they turned their capital to infrastructural
development.
The kilometre stretch from the docks to the Cite Soleil shanty is now a
shipping terminal, shiny and empty, but sitting pretty as the US lifted
unilateral sanctions against Haiti yesterday and the embargo is expected to
follow.
Mr Mevs is very optimistic that, when that happens, not only he but all
Haiti can expect substantial developments. He emphasises the preconditions
for growth: proximity to the US market, preferential access under both the
Caribbean Business Initiative and the EU Lome agreements, cheap land and
labour, and the hefty stake the US has taken in Haitian success.
To make the most of that, the institutions of the state, Mr Mevs argues,
must be made compatible with a civil society.
A civil service of sinecures must be replaced with a functioning
bureaucracy. The economy must be secured to allow for a democratisation of
capital.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Russian budget under fire from military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian budget, its income cut almost in half because of a huge
shortfall in tax revenues, came under attack yesterday from two of the
strongest lobbies in Russia: the military and the Energy Ministry.
According to one senior official, lack of money is causing Russia to default
on its commitments to disarm - a subject now being discussed between
Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in Washington.
The ferocity of the attack, coming as the political season opens once again
with the convening later this week of the two houses of parliament, signals
what will be a sustained effort to break the will of the Finance Ministry
and the prime minister to hold the line on relatively low inflation and a
limited budget deficit.
The attack also coincides with serious discussions with the International
Monetary Fund on further assistance for Russian reforms, in which ministers
will make a strong pitch for assistance based on their performance in
bringing down inflation to 4 per cent a month.
The Ministry of Defence, already smarting from receiving a little over half
of what it said was essential for minimum performance, yesterday said even
that had not been delivered and the Finance Ministry was 'discrediting
itself' in holding down spending.
Colonel General Alexander Kuznetsov, first deputy head of the department of
the budget and finance in the Defence Ministry, told the defence committee
of the State Duma (lower house) yesterday that in the first nine months of
this year, the ministry had received only Rbs14,600bn, or 53 per cent of the
Rbs27,200bn it should have received.
Mr Vyacheslav Mozgalev, a senior official in the Economic Ministry, told the
defence committee the situation in defence industries was 'catastrophic' as
'95 per cent of defence plants have stopped working, no new weapons research
work is being financed and the Defence Ministry will not receive a newly
developed piece of equipment until 2000.'
He also claimed that 'because of the lack of funds, Russia is not fulfilling
one of its international agreements to reduce its armaments'. He said only
22 per cent of the planned budget for disarmament had been received.
At the same time, the Ministry of Energy and Heating has claimed that
supplies of heating fuel for winter are in an 'extraordinarily bad'
situation. On September 1 only 5.4m tonnes of coal and 2m tonnes of heating
oil were stored - compared to 33.5m tonnes and 7.2m tonnes last year.
According to the RIA news agency, ministry officials are particularly
concerned about supplies, especially of coal, to the far east and extreme
north of the country. Nuclear power stations are also in crisis.
The Energy Ministry with the Ministry of the Economy is preparing a
government announcement on supplying the economy with fuel for the autumn
and winter period 1994-95, a decision which seems to mean further pressure
on the Finance Ministry to open the coffers or consign millions of Russians
to a cold winter.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Germany plans to rebuild its navy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German armed forces are planning a new troop transporter and floating
headquarters which would, for the first time since the second world war,
give them a naval presence worldwide, Michael Lindemann writes from Bonn.
Since 1945 the navy, which is much smaller than the army or air force, has
had the capacity to operate mainly in territorial waters and has had to make
do with equipment which dates from the war.
Plans for the new ship, referred to by the defence ministry as the All
Purpose Ship, were drawn up after the embarrassing situation last year when
Germany did not have suitable ships to withdraw its troops from Somalia,
where they were part of the United Nations forces.
It has also been suggested that the vessel is designed to show that Germany
is taking its new international responsibilities seriously, following a
decision by the constitutional court in July allowing German troops to be
deployed on missions worldwide.
The ship would be able to transport up to 700 soldiers, lighter combat
vehicles and about six helicopters. It will be large enough to be used as a
floating command centre for operations overseas and will also have hospital
facilities.
'We are trying with as few ships as possible to create as many options as
possible,' the Defence Ministry said.
The ministry would not confirm how much the ship will cost but an article in
Der Spiegel magazine suggested that about DM500m (Pounds 205m) would be
spent, involving a variety of unspecified savings to keep within the overall
defence budget, which has been set at DM47.9bn for the next four years.
Sources indicate the ship would have a displacement of around 20,000 tonnes
and would be operational by the year 2000.
The navy will also order build 15 new corvettes which could be used
alongside the All Purpose Ship.
However, the ministry emphasised that the corvettes, which will come into
service around 2005, would replace the 38 torpedo boats now in use:
'Altogether we will be a smaller but more modern navy,' a spokesman said.

More than 200 people have died in eastern Turkey since government security
forces began a 'final push' late last week against mountain strongholds of
separatist Kurdish guerrillas, according to diplomats in Ankara. Government
officials say that 16 Kurdish fighters died in the eastern province of
Tunceli and that the operations ended at the weekend. But a European
diplomat put the death toll among the guerrillas alone at 200 and said
security forces would continue their sweep to Turkey's borders with Iran and
Iraq to stamp out the estimated 3,000 rebels based in the region. The
government has said it will allow six pro-Kurdish former MPs now facing
treason charges to stand for election to parliament again.

Russia yesterday proposed a multinational co-ordinating committee to decide
on exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea, after objections
from Russian ministers to the Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5bn) deal signed last week
between Azerbaijan and foreign oil companies to drill in the Azeri section
of the Caspian. Mr Yuri Shafrannik said that Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan,
two other former Soviet states bordering the Caspian, had already agreed to
establish the committee. Both Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime
minister for the economy, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, have
said the deal must not go ahead because of the ecological damage it would
cause to the Caspian sea - where the best caviar in the world is to be
found. Mr Shokhin has called for the resignation of Russian officials who
agreed to the deal.

Ford, the US carmaker, is to offer cash incentives in Belgium - a discount
of BFr60,000 (Pounds 1,195) - to persuade owners of old cars to trade in
their vehicles for new Ford models. The French and Spanish governments
launched incentive schemes earlier this year to encourage owners of cars 10
years old or more to scrap their vehicles and replace them with new cars,
but Ford is one of the first carmakers to take an independent initiative.
The schemes launched by the French and Spanish governments in the spring
have had an immediate impact in boosting new car sales above last year's
depressed level, and the Spanish motor industry is campaigning to have the
six-month scheme extended beyond October.

Mr Jean-Louis Dutaret yesterday resigned as head of Sofirad, a French state

to investigate his involvement in the Carignon affair. The judge is trying
to establish a possible link between Lyonnaise des Eaux bankrolling a
newspaper supporting Mr Alain Carignon's re-election as mayor of Grenoble
and the utility's subsequent gain of the city's water contract. Before
heading Sofirad last January, Mr Dutaret was a close aide to Mr Carignon,
who resigned as communications minister in July to contest the same charge
of being 'in receipt of misused corporate funds' as levelled against Mr
Dutaret. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mr Gerard Longuet to resign as
trade and industry minister in the row over improper funding of his holiday

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi last night failed to
bridge the gap with the trade unions over reforming Italy's costly pension
scheme as part of the 1995 budget. After more than two hours of late night
talks, it was decided to adjourn until this afternoon. The two sides have
little time left to reach an agreement as the government has to submit the
1995 budget to parliament by Friday. The three main union confederations
have threatened to call a general strike on proposed cuts in the pension
system; but this, the fourth failed meeting, suggests both sides are still
seeking a compromise.
One of the sticking points appears to be the unions' refusal to accept a
change in the number of years' contributions from 35 to 40. They are also
insisting on a clear distinction between the problem of pension payments -
based on contributions - and general welfare payments, which should come
from taxes. At present, both welfare and pension payments are funded from a
mix of contributions, taxes and treasury transfers covering deficits.

Estonia's prime minister, Mr Mart Laar, was swept from office yesterday in a
vote of no-confidence. After an emotional two-hour debate in which Mr Laar
was accused of repeatedly lying to the people, deputies voted by 60-27, with
one abstention, for the radical pro-marketeer to leave office. 'The
credibility of the prime minister has sunk below the critical line,' said Mr
Jaan Kaplinski of the opposition Centrist party.
Deputies accused Mr Laar, a member of the conservative Fatherland party who
has held office since October 1992, of destroying public confidence by
deceit, high-handedness and promoting secrecy in government. Mr Laar had won
the backing of western financial organisations with a tough line on spending
and budget policies. He will remain in office until a new candidate is
chosen in talks among parliamentary parties in the next few days. Deputies
made clear that pro-market reform policies would be unchanged.

The British and Russian governments yesterday became 'serious partners',
according to deputy prime minister Mr Alexander Shokhin, writes Liam
Halligan.
Speaking at the Russian embassy in London, Mr Shokhin said bilateral
consultations originally announced in May 1992 had come to fruition in the
form of a Dollars 800m (Pounds 506m) 'credit guarantee'.
Together with the UK president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine,
Mr Shokhin singled out British involvement in the development of Russia's
telecommunications infrastructure, the provision of medical and radiological
equipment and technical support for Russia's petrochemical industry.
Among other developments announced was the possibility of assistance with
the construction of a further international air terminal in Moscow in return
for the granting of extra corridors to British carriers. However, Mr Shokin
said that Aeroflot was not in agreement.
It was also announced that Mr Shokhin yesterday signed a Dollars 100m credit
facility with the EBRD to be followed up with a Dollars 200m package from
the World Bank. The latter will be signed in Washington today.
The Russian delegation also said it was now 'ready to declare repayments' of
some Dollars 600bn of commercial debt, including Dollars 200m owed to UK
companies.

<TEXT>
Portugal forecasts GDP growth of 2.5-3.5 per cent in 1995, marking a firm
recovery from negative growth of 1.0 per cent in 1993 and an expected 1.2
per cent expansion this year. Latest planning ministry projections, drawn up
as a framework for the 1995 budget, foresee growth being led by an increase
of more than 10 per cent in exports and a rise of 4.0 per cent in
investment, thanks to a steep increase in government spending. Government
investment is forecast to increase by 15 per cent to Es702.1bn (Pounds
2.8bn), of which European Union funds will account for 45.4 per cent. Most
government investment will be channelled into in public works, followed by
education, agriculture and health. The government expects inflation in 1995
to be 3.5-4.5 per cent.
EU industrial production in June rose 5.1 per cent from a year earlier, the
EU's statistics office said. In May, industrial production rose 4 per cent
year-on-year. Seasonally adjusted production in the quarter to June was up
2.2 per cent from the first quarter of the year. The rises are mainly a
result of increased demand for capital goods and consumer durables.
The Dutch index of manufacturing orders in hand rose to 104.6 in August from
103.7 in July, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.  Meanwhile, it
reported the Danish August wholesale prices were unchanged from last month
and were up 1.3 per cent from August 1993.
Portugal's industrial production index rose 1.9 per cent in June, after
staying flat in May following a 2.0 per cent fall in April, the National
Statistics Institute said.
Germany's capital account surplus rose to a provisional DM10.1bn in July
from a revised surplus of DM6.1bn in June, the Bundesbank said. A
provisional balance of payments surplus of DM1bn in July was reported
compared to a surplus of DM4.4bn in July.

Portugal's international and high-speed inter-city trains were halted
yesterday as railworkers walked out on a five-day strike over working
conditions. All rail transport between Portugal and Spain will be cancelled
for the week, as well as high-speed service between Portuguese cities, the
state rail company CP said. There are no alternative arrangements.
Inter-city travellers will be rerouted to the regional lines, in many cases
doubling the travel time. The walkout is the third in two months by CP
workers, who are demanding their work week be reduced from 42.5 to 40 hours
and their contract conditions be improved. Some 270 trains scheduled for the
week - including 80 international trains - have been cancelled because of
the strike.

Former President Mr Leonid Kravchuk has won election to parliament, just
three months after being narrowly defeated in his bid for a second term as
Ukraine's leader, election officials said. Mr Kravchuk, a former Communist
party chief, received 87 per cent of the votes cast in Sunday's by-election
in a two-candidate race. His challenger for a seat in the 450-seat
parliament, Mr Nikolai Novosilsky, got only 10 per cent of the votes, said
Mr Valentin Kirnenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission.
Mr Kravchuk, 60, was Ukraine's first president after the former Soviet
republic gained independence in 1991, and was defeated in the presidential
election by former prime minister Leonid Kuchma. He says he intends to
establish his own political party and rebuild his power base.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Belarus looks for a way ahead
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alexander Lukashenko, elected president of Belarus two months ago, has
been furiously rethinking the country's future direction since President
Boris Yeltsin refused to burden Russia with the costs of a new economic and
currency union with the former Soviet republic.
Election promises, including a pledge of full employment and the wholesale
sacking of 'corrupt' officials have been thrown out the window following the
collapse of the main plank in Mr Lukashenko's election campaign, a close
Russian connection. Instead, he has imposed steep rises in the price of
bread, milk and vodka to cut the burden of subsidies and block the
haemorrhage of artificially cheap foodstuffs to Poland and Russia.
This month he announced that the Belarus rouble, called the Zaitsev (hare)
and nicknamed the 'Belarus bunny', would be the sole legal tender,
reinforcing the position of Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, the pro-reform
president of the Belarus central bank who was one of the officials
threatened with dismissal in Mr Lukashenko's election campaign.
Instead of the promised bail-out from Moscow the 'programme of economic
priorities' outlined by the president two weeks ago emphasises self-help and
painful macro-economic stabilisation. The main aim is to reduce monthly
inflation from around 30-40 per cent to 10-11 per cent by the end of the
year and 7 per cent a year later.
Many details still have to be fleshed out in a programme which was put
together mainly by Soviet-era bureaucrats. Mr Vladimir Karyagin, president
of the Belarus Union of Entrepreneurs, complains: 'The programme has no
strategic view with far too much emphasis on controls and not enough on
incentives.'
Mr Karyagin says resolving the country's economic problems requires
encouragement for a private sector which hardly existed four years ago and
remains small.
The advocates of more private enterprise believe they have three cards up
their sleeve. The first is Mr Lukashenko's desperate need to succeed. The
40-year-old former army political commissar and collective farm manager
waged an unashamedly populist election campaign which swept away Mr
Vyacheslav Kebich, an old-style communist apparatchik. But now he has to
deliver higher living standards without the hoped-for Russian economic
assistance.
The second is the presence in Minsk of representatives from the
international financial institutions whose much needed financial assistance
and technical advice is conditional on the government keeping to policy
targets yet to be agreed.
In many ways the most convincing card is the example of its next-door
neighbour - Poland. But Mr Karyagin says: 'We can't just copy the
Balcerowicz plan (the shock therapy stabilisation programme named after the
former Polish finance minister). Poland always had private agriculture and a
large and influential diaspora and Poles always had a few dollars in their
pockets. They also received large-scale western financial aid. But the fact
that the Poles took certain policy decisions and received the results that
we can see helps us enormously in arguing with our bureaucrats.'
Many Belarussians still find it hard to imagine an independent existence for
this flat land of 10m people with no naturally defined borders, which was
totally integrated into the Soviet economy. Most of the big military plants
which produced over 70 per cent of industrial output are now idle, while the
country remains dependent on Russian oil and gas, apart from minimal local
oil production of around 2m tons annually.
In an interview inside the Stalin-era government offices, still graced
outside by an enormous jet-black sculpture of Lenin, Mr Lukashenko put the
emphasise on self-help but also appealed for more foreign investment. He has
chosen Mr Vladimir Sopronov, a young parliamentary deputy, as the head of
foreign economic policy co-ordination, and promised to take personal charge
of land sales to foreign investors 'to protect their interests and make sure
they don't have to pay bribes to corrupt officials'.
The aim now is to profit from the country's skill base and excellent
transport infrastructure by pursuing macro-economic stabilisation policies
which have laid the basis for economic prosperity and national sovereignty
not only in neighbouring Poland but also in Hungary and the Czech Republic.

FT  27 SEP 94 / EU presidency success gave boost to Claes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Willy Claes, who is virtually certain to be the next secretary general of
Nato, is a hard-driving politician with more than 20 years' experience in
the Belgian government, latterly as foreign minister. Though Mr Claes has
little direct experience of military affairs, he probably owes his present
job to a highly effective performance during the Belgian presidency of the
European Union between July and December 1993.
Despite an occasional short fuse, Mr Claes coaxed and cajoled his colleagues
into compromises on trade, budgetary matters and institutional affairs which
reinvigorated the EU after the debilitating debate over ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
'Willy Claes is an exceptionally talented individual. He is open-minded,
efficient and well organised, with strong administrative skills,' says Mr
Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner for competition policy in
Brussels.
Born in Hasselt, in north-east Belgium, Mr Claes was initially torn between
following in his father's foosteps, as a professional musician, and
launching a career in politics.
He entered parliament at the age of 30 and became one of Belgium's youngest
ministers, in 1972, at the age of 34.
Often tipped as a potential prime minister, Mr Claes, 55, would probably
never have made it to the top in Belgium. Like Mr van Miert, he comes from
the Flemish Socialist party, the minority partner in the coalition
government.
Some suspect that Mr Claes's appointment to succeed Mr Manfred Worner was
indirectly boosted after the Belgian prime minister Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the
Franco-German favourite to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
European Commission, fell victim to a British veto last summer.
But other observers believe that Mr Claes stands as a serious contender for
the top Nato post in his own right, having proved to be a 'safe pair of
hands' as foreign minister for the past 2 1/2 years handling many tricky
diplomatic problems not only in Europe but also in the former Belgian
protectorates of Rwanda and Burundi and in the ex-colony of Zaire.
Though a long-standing advocate of deeper European integration, Mr Claes is
also an avowed Atlanticist. As he remarked in a speech to Chatham House in
London last February, Europe's strategic defence 'will remain in Nato'. But
he also noted increasing US enthusiasm for Europe taking greater
responsibility for security issues on the continent.
At one point, he asked: 'Why not make peacekeeping into a common European
policy?'
His initiative stemmed partly from his own disillusionment with the European
Union's failure to deal more decisively with the crisis in former Yugoslavia
in its early stages, though he points to the significant humanitarian aid
effort which the Union has since mounted.
In future, Mr Claes will need all his negotiating skills - as well as his
musical instinct for harmony - to succeed in bringing all of Nato's partners
together.

FT  27 SEP 94 / 'Variable geometry' of measuring up for wider EU: An
emerging strategy for Union enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After several false starts, the European Union is developing a strategy to
incorporate the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe.
A glimpse of the new Ostpolitik appeared last week in Paris when France and
Germany called upon the European Commission to produce a white paper next
spring setting out a plan for enlargement to the east.
The Franco-German proposal borrowed heavily from an existing Commission
paper in Brussels, but the debate about 'widening' the Union is moving away
from theoretical musings to the identification of practical obstacles.
These remain formidable. Even the most advanced candidates - Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - have only a third of the per
capita income of the Twelve. Under current rules, membership for these four
alone would require a 75 per cent increase in EU spending on agricultural
subsidies and aid to poorer regions, according to a recent study by
Professor Richard Baldwin of the Centre for Economic Policy Research.
Brussels has therefore concluded that it is better to defer an acrimonious
debate about farm reform and structural funds. No doubt this will make it
much more difficult to carry out the revolution in EU common agricultural
policy which many believe is the pre-requisite for the next round of
enlargement; but Commission officials favour putting the onus on the east
Europeans to adapt in order to prepare for membership, perhaps around the
turn of the century.
The latest idea is to emulate Lord Cockfield's celebrated 1985 white paper
which set out a list of measures for the (then) European Community to
complete the single market by 1992. Brussels would map out a road for
integration covering, say, the difficulties of adapting its economic,
banking, legal and transport systems to EU norms.
This process is the logical extension of trade liberalisation which began,
grudgingly, in 1991 and has since accelerated. Free trade in industrial
goods will take effect in 1995 (steel in 1996 and textiles in 1997). But
numerous non-tariff barriers continue to exist.
One approach would be to list up to 150 measures for the east Europeans to
adopt to make their legislation EU-compatible. In return, the EU would phase
out anti-dumping measures and thereby extend the single market eastwards, a
Commission official said.
Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, is also pressing to extend
ministerial contacts with the central and eastern Europeans in official
council session. Despite misgivings among some member states that this
amounts to 'membership by the back-door', Germany has persuaded its partners
to hold an important session on October 31 in Luxembourg.
Earlier this year, France warned Germany not to push too fast on
enlargement. French officials were irritated by German pressure tactics to
wrap up accession negotiations with the Nordic countries and Austria; but
their broader concern was that a premature, German-led drive to open the
next round of enlargement to the east would weaken the Union and France's
own position vis-a-vis Germany.
On the surface, the Franco-German tiff has resulted in tighter
co-ordination. Germany, which hands over the presidency to France on January
1, is trying hard to keep its closest ally on board through joint planning
sessions on eastern Europe.
In return, France has quietly accepted that potential EU enlargement must
embrace the EU candidates (Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics,
Bulgaria and Romania) as well as the three Baltic states of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia, and Slovenia.
A French official says France has come round to the view that enlargement to
the east is inevitable; but the question is how to carry it out without
weakening the Union, or diluting it to a free trade area. Hence the recently
launched debate on how best to organise a Union of 16-25 members, and
Franco-German noises in favour of a 'hard-core' of committed
integrationists.
Polish and Hungarian officials say they welcome this debate on 'variable
geometry' because it makes east European aspirations to become members of
the EU more credible. But they are keeping a close eye, too, on their
short-term interests, specifically the package of measures which may emerge
from the EU heads of government summit in Essen in December.
Among the priorities are a firm calendar for starting accession negotiations
and observer status for the inter-governmental conference to review the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Fears grow of hung parliament in Bonn: Chronic weakness of
liberal FDP raises doubts about outcome of federal election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of Germany's general election in less than three weeks still
hangs in the balance, in spite of a clear victory on Sunday for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's closest allies in the state of Bavaria.
The chances of a hung parliament, with a grand coalition between Mr Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the opposition Social Democratic party
(SPD) the only means of forging a clear majority, remain real, according to
most political analysts.
One key element in the calculation is the chronic weakness in the polls of
the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior partner in Mr Kohl's coalition,
which slumped to only 2.8 per cent of the vote in Bavaria, losing all its
seats in the state parliament. The setback was the sixth successive time the
liberal, free-market party has failed to gain the required 5 per cent
support needed to win seats in a state election.
Several recent opinion polls suggest that the recovery of Mr Kohl's CDU and
its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), may have peaked
at a combined vote of around 41 per cent, with the SPD still picking up a
little support at around 35 to 37 per cent.
The other unknown factor is the performance of the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS), the former East German Communist party, which could win
more than 30 places in the German Bundestag and hold the balance of power,
thanks to pockets of strong support in several east German cities.
Leaders of the SPD insisted yesterday that the race remained wide open,
while Mr Kohl himself warned his supporters against any tendency to think it
was already won.
'It would be quite wrong to think that the election is already decided,' he
said after a meeting of his party executive in Bonn. 'We must fight for
every vote. We have no votes to lend or to give away.'
The chancellor remains convinced that the FDP will be represented in the
Bundestag, in spite of repeated weakness in state elections, because of the
long-standing tradition of German voters giving it their decisive second
votes, in favour of a party list rather than an individual candidate.
The latest polls still give the FDP around 8 per cent support on the basis
of second votes, which should be just enough to give the ruling coalition a
majority after October 16.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP party leader and foreign minister, was putting a
determinedly brave face on the party's plight yesterday, before he flew off
to the UN General Assembly. 'We are not giving up,' he said.
The opposition Social Democrats, however, are clearly gunning for the FDP
vote, and hope the series of disastrous defeats will persuade electors that
even a second vote for the FDP is scarcely worthwhile. 'Our aim is to make
ourselves so strong that it will be impossible to rule without us,' Mr
Gunter Verheugen, SPD general secretary, said yesterday.
The final result in Bavaria gave the CSU an absolute majority, with 52.8 per
cent, down from 54.9 per cent in 1990, while the SPD improved its vote by
4.1 points to 30.1 per cent. Apart from the FDP, the main losers were the
far-right Republicans, who scored only 3.9 per cent in the state where they
are supposed to be strongest.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Belgian foreign minister chosen as next Nato chief
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Willy Claes, a Belgian socialist with controversial views on the future
of central and eastern Europe, was endorsed yesterday as the next
secretary-general of Nato by ambassadors of its 16 members.
The new Nato chief, at present Belgian foreign minister, will face the
challenges of easing transatlantic tensions over Bosnia, guiding Nato's
debate on enlargement of its membership and defining a new role for the
military alliance.
The path was cleared for his appointment by the withdrawal of Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, a former Danish foreign minister. Mr Claes, 55, is expected
to be appointed formally at a Nato foreign ministers' meeting within two
weeks.
The danger of a rift in US-European relations eased last night as it emerged
that the US and Bosnian governments were inching back from their commitment
to an early end to the UN arms embargo on Bosnia.
Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic is expected to propose a compromise of
several months' delay in lifting the embargo, when he addresses the UN
today.
That would release the US administration from its promise to Congress that
moves towards lifting the embargo would start on October 15. Nato's European
members say authorising arms supplies to Bosnia would endanger UN ground
forces. However, co-ordination of Bosnian policy will still require deft
diplomacy from Mr Claes. In recent weeks, the alliance's political
leadership has had to work hard behind the scenes to soothe the anger of
senior US military officers over the cautious UN attitude to air strikes
against Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Claes opposed deployment of new US missiles in Europe in the 1980s but
more recently has strongly defended a continuing US role on the continent.
As foreign minister, he irked Turkey, a Nato member, by voicing sympathy for
the country's Kurdish minority while opposing its recourse to separatist
violence.
His views on the prospects for integrating central and eastern Europe into
western institutions are expected to cause continuing controversy.
Mr Claes last year drew a strong distinction between the political outlook
of countries of Protestant or Roman Catholic heritage - such as Poland, the
Baltic states, Hungary and Slovenia - and those of Orthodox Christian
tradition, such as Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Russia.
Among the first group, he said, western influence was stronger, and European
integration was becoming a 'goal within reach'. In the second, which had
more authoritarian traditions, progress towards democracy was much slower
and more difficult.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Yeltsin calls for new N-arms pact: Disarmament proposals
include production ban and missile cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JUREK MARTIN, US Editor

   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday called for a nuclear disarmament
treaty requiring the world's five big nuclear powers to stop production of
nuclear material and cut their arsenals of strategic missiles.
Mr Yeltsin's initiative - which met a cool response from some US officials -
came in a broad-ranging address to heads of government and foreign ministers
at the United Nations General Assembly.
He outlined a sweeping agenda of nuclear disarmament measures, ranging from
completion next year of a nuclear test ban treaty and 'open-ended and
unconditional' extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to a new
'treaty on nuclear security and strategic stability' between the five powers
 -Russia, the US, China, the UK and France.
The proposed treaty could include an end to the production of fissile
material for military use; a ban on the re-use of fissile materials in
weapons; and further cuts in the five nuclear powers' warheads and missiles.
But the US last week said that it did not plan any further near-term cuts in
the number of its nuclear warheads. Pentagon officials said they wanted to
maintain a nuclear 'hedge' because Russia had been slower than they had
hoped to implement cuts already agreed in its nuclear arsenal.
Mr Yeltsin said the extension of the non-proliferation treaty next year
would require 'additional and more precise security guarantees' for the
non-nuclear states, and called for a special meeting of the UN Security
Council at foreign minister level to discuss a resolution on positive
security guarantees.
He also offered Russian troops for a UN stand-by force to be permanently
available for peacekeeping operations, and called for a real role for the
UN's military staff committee.
Earlier in the day President Bill Clinton also promised to work for a
convention to halt production of fissile materials, as well as for test ban
and non-proliferation treaties. But the US president's principal initiative
was to support the efforts of UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali to
limit the use of anti-personnel mines.
Mr Clinton called for the eventual elimination of the 85m such weapons which
are now believed to be scattered in 62 countries, and proposed that
countries reduce the proportion of landmines in their stockpiles that do not
self-destruct or deactivate themselves, as well as banning exports of mines
to countries which have not signed the convention on conventional weapons.
Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington, adds: Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury
secretary, yesterday urged Russia to quicken the pace of economic reform
while taking additional steps to control inflation.
He said adoption of a tougher fiscal budget could release Dollars 8bn to
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) in western assistance already promised at the G7
summits. Pegging the rouble on the foreign exchange markets 'would bolster
market confidence by delivering an effective Dollars 6bn currency
stabilisation fund'.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Reckitt pays Dollars 1.55bn for household group in US:
Colman's mustard brand goes on sale to finance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reckitt &amp; Colman is breaking with 185 years of history by putting its
mustard business up for sale to help finance its drive to become one of the
world's leading suppliers of lavatory cleaners and other household products.
It announced yesterday its Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 980m) purchase of L&amp;F
Household from Eastman Kodak, and offered for sale Colman's mustard and
other UK food and drink businesses, including Robinson's barley water.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman and last family member in the business founded
five generations ago in a Norwich mill, said it was a difficult decision to
sell Colman's.
He believed, however, that the business would be better run by a group with
a strong food strategy now that Reckitt was concentrating on disinfectants,
cleaners, air fresheners and insecticides.
The acquisition of L&amp;F, a big US household product supplier, will be
part-financed by a one-for-eight rights issue at 500p a share to raise
Pounds 230m. It will enhance Reckitt's position in the US with leading
brands such as Lysol, the disinfectant.
Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said: 'We will have the capacity to
compete globally against the majors and more effectively in the US.'
Reckitt will rise from about eighth to the top four in the US and global
household products markets, he added. In its product categories, it will be
on a par with companies such as Colgate-Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble and
Unilever.
The City welcomed the purchase for its strategic value, given Reckitt's
second-string status in the US. Its shares closed 43p down at 555p because
of the deeply discounted rights issue price and some doubts over Reckitt's
assertion that the deal would enhance its earnings in its first year.
With the sale of L&amp;F, Kodak has almost completed the Dollars 7bn disposal
programme launched in May by Mr George Fisher, its new chairman. L&amp;F's other
arm - manufacturing do-it-yourself products such as wood finishes - is the
last main asset to go.
To pay for L&amp;F, Reckitt is increasing its debt from about Pounds 300m,
including a convertible capital bond, to Pounds 1.1bn, which will raise
gearing from about 50 per cent to 160 per cent. It emphasised, however, that
its interest costs would be covered more than five times by operating
profits.
Moreover, it expected to bring debt back down to pre-deal levels within
three years, thanks to some Pounds 400m from piecemeal disposal of the UK
food and drink businesses and Pounds 400m of cashflow.
Sir Michael said likely buyers for Colman's and the other UK activities were
companies with a strong European food business but keen to increase their UK
presence.
The price paid for L&amp;F, at about twice its sales and 20 times pre-tax
profits, broadly matched expectations. But until Reckitt has shown it can
exploit the purchase, it is unlikely to change City perceptions that - in
the words of one analyst - it is a 'slightly stodgy, conservative company in
boring products'.

FT  27 SEP 94 / Blair to unveil radical shift in Labour's economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair will today ceremoniously ditch Labour's traditional approach
to economic management by insisting that the party's social ambitions can be
met only in a dynamic and open market economy.
His commitment to wealth-creation and adequate rewards for individual effort
will be accompanied by a pledge from Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor,
that a future Labour government would retain a formal target to contain
inflation.
But in a carefully co-ordinated effort by the two men to manage an
irreversible shift in the party's approach to economic management, Mr Brown
will announce that Labour would introduce a separate target for economic
growth.
The change in emphasis will provide the backdrop for next week's annual
party conference in Blackpool, by underlining Mr Blair's commitment to
accelerate the process of modernisation begun by his predecessors.
But it is likely further to anger leftwing activists and leftwing trades
union leaders, who have been alarmed at the pace with which Mr Blair has
challenged traditional policies.
The Labour leader will face increasing pressure from the government to spell
out in detail how a Labour government would finance its plans to promote
investment, expand educational opportunities and improve health and other
public services.
Mr Blair, who will set out his message at the opening of a Labour-sponsored
conference on international economic change, will seek to reassure
middle-class voters that Labour has abandoned its traditional tax and
spending instincts.
He is expected to eschew devaluation and other 'short-term fixes' to improve
the economy. Instead he will stress that a long-term strategy to manage the
rapid pace of economic change will be at the centre of Labour's approach.
That message will be reinforced in a separate speech by Mr Brown, who will
call for a revolution in educational provision, new mechanisms to encourage
long-term industrial investment, and a more dynamic public/private sector
partnership.
The joint message will follow a renewed Labour onslaught on the government's
record on taxation and spending.
Pointing out that, at 44 per cent of national income, public spending was
still as high as 15 years ago, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury
secretary, said that the money allocated to 'renewal' areas such as
education and transport had fallen as a share of national income, while
'rescue' spending on the unemployed had risen sharply.

FT  27 SEP 94 / US lifts sanctions against Haiti: Clinton sets out
commitment to helping nations end repression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday announced the lifting of all its unilateral economic
sanctions against Haiti, except those targeting the Haitian military junta
and its supporters.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Bill Clinton
said the US would act as quickly as it could, within the framework of the
UN-ordered embargo, to restore water and power to Haiti.
Leaders scheduled to address the session included Mr Boris Yeltsin of
Russia, who was reported to have brought a new nuclear disarmament proposal
with him to the UN.
Mr Clinton said the US had 'no desire to be the world's policeman, but we
will do what we can to help civil societies emerge from repression'.
Acknowledging reluctance both in the US and elsewhere to get involved in the
world's trouble spots, Mr Clinton said that nevertheless great progress had
been made towards peace in areas such as South Africa, the Middle East and
Northern Ireland.
Speaking as Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, continued his speaking
tour of the US, Mr Clinton claimed some of the credit for advancing the
'earnest search by the people of Northern Ireland and Great Britain and
Ireland to end centuries of division and decades of terror'.
The UN Security Council resolution which imposed general sanctions on Haiti
does not provide for their removal until General Raoul Cedras and the
military leaders who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 have
left power.
That may not be until October 15, under the terms of the agreement that
averted an invasion but led to the current military occupation by the US.
But Mr Clinton urged other countries to follow in lifting unilateral
measures such as a ban on air travel.
In Haiti, he said, a combination of creative diplomacy, the influence of
economic power and the credible threat of military force had brought
success. But Haiti's people must show patience and restraint to make the
transition to a peaceful democracy.
'They have to do this for themselves,' he said.
Mr Clinton warned that the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo 'once again faces the
prospect of strangulation' by Bosnian Serbs and that the UN would have to
show a 'new resolve' to enforce resolutions to protect the city.
'UN actions in Bosnia, as those in Haiti, demonstrate that progress can be
made when a coalition backs up diplomacy with military power.'
He also announced US support for a new multilateral agreement to control the
sale and use of anti-personnel landmines, and called for the eventual
elimination of the 85m such weapons which are now believed to be scattered
in 62 countries.
The US will propose that countries reduce the proportion of landmines in
their stockpiles that do not self-destruct or deactivate themselves, and ban
exports of mines to countries which have not signed the convention on
conventional weapons.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Germany passes law to compensate property owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesrat, upper house of Germany's parliament, has passed a law to
compensate former property owners in eastern Germany. The law, which will
speed up investment decisions in the east, follows three years of wrangling
over terms and funding.
Under the unification treaty, which laid out the settlement of property
rights in eastern Germany, owners are entitled to full compensation or
restitution for property confiscated between 1933 and 1945 by the Nazis, or
by communists between 1949 and 1990.
However, the unification treaty did not say how claimants should be
compensated, at what level, or how this compensation should be financed,
issues which have been the subject of lengthy disputes in the German
parliament.
The law provides compensation based on the valuation of land dating back to
1935. However, assessment will depend on the type of property and whether it
was owned or leased, and a different system will apply for land. For
example, those who had owned family houses and small businesses will receive
compensation, but the 1935 land valuation will be multiplied by seven, the
valuation for those who had rented property will be multipled by 4.8, while
the valuation for those who owned land will be multiplied 20-fold.
The former owners will receive bonds redeemable in 2004.
In addition to those whose land was confiscated by the Nazis and the
communists, the Bundesrat also agreed to grant concessions to those property
owners whose land was expropriated by the Soviet Union which administered
eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949, but who have no right to either
compensation or restitution. These former owners, who owned large estates in
eastern Germany, will now be entitled to buy back a percentage of their
property below the market price, and they will be able to rent their
property, again at a discount.
A further DM3.4bn has been put aside for the 110,000 'settlers', those
Germans who were expelled, or forced to flee eastern Europe but who settled
permanently in eastern Germany after the second world war. In addition,
DM2bn has been allocated to victims of the Nazis in eastern Germany.

<TEXT>
More than half a million people have registered to buy shares through
Slovakia's voucher privatisation programme since its launch three weeks ago
by a government which hopes privatisation will prove a vote winner at next
weekend's general elections. The Slovak coalition parties hope that this
privatisation will take votes away from Mr Vladimir Meciar, the populist
leader of the opposition, who has threatened to scrap the programme if his
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia wins the election.
Fifty thousand books of vouchers, each valued at Kcs1,000 (Pounds 20.50),
are being sold every day, the privatisation minister, Mr Milan Janicina,
said recently. Three quarters of Slovakia's 5.3m people are eligible to take
part in the programme which involves the sale of stakes in 136 state-owned
companies with a total value of Kcs44.8bn. More are expected to be included
before the elections. However, the government's original target of approving
Kcs80bn of assets for voucher privatisation before the election will not be
met.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 1m Lebanese nationals emigrated during the civil war years of
1975-1990, while 450,000 people fled fighting to become internal migrants
during the period, according to the country's first official study into the
demographic consequences of the war, published by the ministry of social
affairs.
By the ministry's estimate, however, some 25 per cent of those who left
Lebanon during the war, as many as 250,000 Lebanese, are expected to seek a
return to their homeland by 1998. The study says 40,000 came home in 1992
and 1993 after the war and these numbers are likely to rise this year and
next.
The figures were prepared for the recent international conference on
population and development in Cairo, which Lebanon decided to boycott only
days before its opening. However, many of the study's findings have been
released in Beirut in the past week.
The Lebanese government says it considers attracting back the expatriates to
be a priority. 'We have lost the greatest part of the middle class in this
country,' Mr Riad Salame, the central bank governor, said in an interview
this week. 'Restoring this class is essential - the only resource Lebanon
has is the skill and education of its people.' While allowing that there are
no precise figures for the war years, the research suggests that fully 7 per
cent of the Lebanese population, which it estimated at between 2.2m and 2.6m
excluding Palestinian refugees in the country, died during the conflict and
10 per cent were injured.

Haiti's military leaders met US officers yesterday after the first deadly

President Bill Clinton, who will address the UN General Assembly today,
regretted any loss of life, but warned that US troops would continue to
respond to hostile action against them.
The conflict on Saturday evening around police offices in Cap Haitien has
highlighted difficulties surrounding the intervention, which has been
carried out like a combat operation in hostile territory, in spite of an
agreement to work with Haitian military authorities.
The incident may also prompt international criticism of the US over what
some might see as an excessive use of force.
However, in the US, Senator Sam Nunn, the chairman of the Senate armed
services committee and a member of former president Jimmy Carter's team
which negotiated the Haitian generals' agreement to leave power, said there
might be more such incidents.
He said yesterday: 'This is the first bad incident we've had involving,
directly, American troops, but it won't be the last . . . It's regrettable,
but remarkable we haven't had more.'
Under an agreement reached last week, hours before a US invasion was due to
hit Haiti's shores, the military government, which seized power in a bloody
coup in September 1991, promised to co-operate with US forces in their
mission to restore elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
General Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader who has agreed to step down by
October 15, was flown to Cap Haitien yesterday with Mr William Swing, the US
ambassador, and General Henry Hugh Shelton, the US commander of the Joint
Task Force in Haiti.
The trio were understood to be meeting Haitian military and police officials
to ensure their co-operation with US forces in the area' and to reduce
tension after Saturday night's killings.
A US marine patrol is understood to have opened fire when Haitians at the
police headquarters apparently fired on their unit, injuring one naval
translator, who suffered a flesh wound to the leg. The marines then 'entered
the first floor of the building and cleared that up', according to US
embassy officials in Port-au-Prince.
Ten Haitians were reported killed and five others detained. US officials
added that they had recovered two .38 revolvers and one M1 rifle from the
dead combatants. They suggested that there may be other weapons in the
building.
In the wake of the shooting, civilians were reported to have ransacked
police stations and military barracks in Cap Haitien as soldiers and police
abandoned their posts.
US embassy officials said the incident was within the rules of engagement
for US military personnel which are that 'if someone shoots, you return
fire'. There will be an investigation into the conflict, although army
officers said said this would 'simply be a fact-finding operation'.

MONDAY 26
Yeltsin addresses the UN
US president Bill Clinton and Russia's president Boris Yeltsin are both due
to address the 49th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New
York. Mr Yeltsin is expected to talk on nuclear arms reductions and the role
of Russia in the world - especially its own part of the world, the former
Soviet Union. He will then meet US business leaders before flying to
Washington.
The European Parliament begins an all-week plenary session, its first since
the Euro-elections in June. Attention will centre on internal reforms to
make the Strasbourg assembly more efficient, now that it has enhanced powers
under the Maastricht treaty.
The main debates will be on: multi-speed Europe; whether the Parliament
should sit in Strasbourg, as France insists, or in Brussels alongside the
Commission and Council of Ministers; and on the confirmation hearings
Euro-MPs plan to hold in November for members of the new Commission, whose
nominations they can veto.
UK-Russian trade: Russia's deputy prime minister for the economy, Alexander
Shokhin, visits London for talks with the Russian-British Committee for
Trade and Investment, of which he is co-chair with Michael Heseltine, the UK
trade and industry secretary. Mr Shokhin will press for more access to the
British market for Russian goods and for work to start on such projects as
the Moscow telephone system, which was agreed with the UK two years ago.
UK telecoms: Energis, the UK's third long-distance telecommunications
company, is launched. Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid, has
erected its network across the Grid's pylons. Its marketing pitch includes
significant discounts on BT tariffs for long-distance calls.
Consumer congress: The International Organisation of Consumers Unions,
representing consumers' groups from 72 countries, begins its 14th world
congress in Montpellier, France (to Sep 30).
Saleroom: Sotheby's opens the art market season with two house sales. Today,
the Corsini family of Florence starts to dispose of some 2,000 objects
culled from the guest suites, library and store-rooms of its 18th century
baroque palazzo, where the auction is being held. The family hopes to raise
Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.58m) for restoration work.
On Wednesday, at Stokesay Court in rural Shropshire in the west of England,
Victorian treasures which had been lost for more than 50 years come under
the hammer in Sotheby's biggest house sale for a decade.

TUESDAY 27
US interest rates in focus
The US Federal Reserve's Open Markets Committee, its policy-making body,
meets in Washington amid signs that demand is still growing steadily,
despite five interest rate increases this year. Most economists expect the
Fed will have to raise rates again before the year is out, although few
believe it will do so at this meeting.
Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, holds talks with US president Bill
Clinton in Washington. Bosnia, nuclear arms reductions, trade and investment
figure on the agenda, with the US pressing for speedier economic reforms.
Japan pitches for UN seat:
Foreign minister Yohei Kono, addressing the United Nations General Assembly
in New York, is expected to make Japan's clearest bid yet for permanent
membership of the security council. He will say Japan is willing to assume
the duties of membership, but cannot take part in military operations
involving force because of its pacifist constitution.
Aid initiative: Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, will launch an initiative
to help ease the debt burden of some of the poorest developing countries
when he meets fellow Commonwealth finance ministers in Malta on the first
day of their two-day annual conference.
The Bank of Italy's governing council holds it first monthly meeting after
the summer recess with the issue pending of nominating a director-general to
succeed Lamberto Dini, who became treasury minister in May. It has become a
sensitive issue in relations between the central bank and the Berlusconi
government, with the Bank of Italy seeking to preserve its autonomy over the
appointment.
Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, on his first state visit to the US, holds
talks with International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials in
Washington. The visit, which includes a meeting with President Bill Clinton,
is being seen as a sign of improved relations, strained by the Iliescu
administration's handling of anti-government demonstrations in 1990 and
1991.
Cleanlier than thou: The Tidy Britain Group will spread anger and delight by
publishing its first cleanliness ranking of British cities.

WENESDAY 28
IMF gives its world outlook
The International Monetary Fund will publish updated forecasts for the world
economy ahead of next week's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in
Madrid. Its latest World Economic Outlook will upgrade the near-term growth
forecast for the Group of Seven leading industrial countries from the annual
rate of 2.5 per cent predicted by the Fund in April.
OECD headship: Ambassadors of the 25 member countries of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development meet in Paris with little hope of
ending the impasse over who should be the next OECD secretary-general.
There is little sign that the OECD's decision-making council can achieve the
consensus needed to choose either present incumbent Jean-Claude Paye or
Canadian challenger Donald Johnston when it meets on Thursday. That would
leave the OECD top job in limbo once Paye's contract expires on Friday.
European Union industry ministers convene in Brussels to discuss the
European Commission's action plan to prepare for the new 'information
society' covering multi-media, telecoms liberalisation and electronic
banking.
The German presidency will also consider latest progress in restructuring
the European steel industry, amid clear evidence of an economic upturn.
Pensions ruling: The European Court of Justice will deliver its opinion in
six separate cases which will determine how European employers equalise
pension benefits for men and women. Pension benefits for part-timers and
single-sex annuity rates are also key issues.
House sale at Stokesay Court:
Sotheby's four-day sale of antiques and treasures at
Stokesay Court, near Ludlow, Shropshire, is expected to raise Pounds 2.5m
(Dollars 3.95m) from 5,000 items. They were locked away for security in 1941
and are wonderfully preserved. The highlight is a Louis XIV boulle commode
of 1710, estimate Pounds 100,000. Among the oddities are suits of 18th
century Japanese armour (one illustrated above), and some Fortnum and Mason
dried turtle - together with instructions for making turtle soup.
Showjumping: The Horse of the Year Show begins at Olympia, London (to Oct
2).
Holidays: Taiwan.
THURSDAY 29
Report due on Berlusconi
Three legal experts, appointed by Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi on
taking office in May to examine if there is a conflict of interest between
his roles of prime minister and owner of the Fininvest media empire, are due
to present their proposals.
The unresolved issue remains a handicap for Mr Berlusconi and is becoming
enmeshed in a controversy over recent appointments at the RAI, the state-run
broadcasting organisation.
Nato defence ministers meet informally in Seville, against a background of
mounting tension in Bosnia and transatlantic strains over military tactics
in former Yugoslavia. France, a rare participant in high-level Nato
discussions, will attend. Germany and the US have signalled they want to
discuss admitting former communist states in central and eastern Europe.
US trade policy: The US International Trade Commission holds a hearing in
Washington on a controversial report to assess the economic effects of US
anti-dumping policies and countervailing duty orders.
Amsterdam's bourse closes at 10am GMT ahead of the introduction of a new
trading system on Friday.
World Maritime Day, declared by the United Nations' International Maritime
Organisation, is devoted to the training and standards of merchant navy
crews.
FRIDAY 30
Slovakia holds election
Two days of voting start in Slovakia in the first general election since
independence last year. The pro-reformers of the outgoing government of
Jozef Moravck are pitted against the strongly nationalist opposition, led by
former prime minister Vladimr Meciar.
US-Japanese trade: A 60-day consultation period expires. It was designed to
settle disputes over cars and car parts, Japanese government procurement in
medical and telecommunications equipment, flat glass and insurance.
Washington has threatened sanctions failing agreement. At least a partial
deal seems to be in the making, with partial sanctions likely for unresolved
issues.
United Nations peace-keeping troops' mandate in former Yugoslavia expires,
but is expected to be renewed for another six months.
UK nuclear power: Deadline for submissions to the government's review of the
industry. The main issue is whether to build more nuclear power stations,
and if so, whether construction can be financed by the private sector.
UK financial regulation: The last day for life insurers and financial
advisers to apply to be regulated by the Personal Investment Authority, the
new watchdog to protect private investors.
FT Survey: World Economy and Finance.
WEEKEND 1-2
IMF meetings in Madrid
Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven countries meet
in Madrid on Saturday ahead of the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank to discuss strengthening world output, recent
turbulence on financial markets, and how best to help Russia and Ukraine.
On Sunday, the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee tries to break the
deadlock on issuing new special drawing rights or SDRs, the IMF's reserve
asset, aided by joint proposals from the British and US treasuries.
Palau ends its status as the last United Nations trust territory in the
Pacific on Saturday and becomes formally linked to the US.
Nelson Mandela, South African president, begins the first state visit by a
South African leader to the US on Saturday (to Oct 6).
Milan's spring and summer ready-to-wear fashion shows start on Sunday (to
Oct 6).
The Asian Games open on Sunday in Hiroshima, western Japan, bringing
together more than 7,200 athletes from 42 countries (to Oct 16). The
possible attendance of Taiwanese government officials is annoying China,
which has spoken of boycotting the event.
