</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sifis Valyrakis, Greece's new undersecretary for public order, is causing
quite a stir in Brussels.
He is terribly popular on his native island of Crete, where he has been
elected to parliament at every election since 1977. But he does have a
rather unusual pedigree.
He was arrested twice in the mid-1970s, first for smuggling a boat load of
weapons through the Aegean, then for organising armed groups in Greece who
were reportedly trained by Palestinian guerrillas.
Unkind mutterings within the government suggest he was given a junior
minister's job in order to make up the numbers of Cretan deputies - the
island being more solidly socialist than anywhere else in the land.
Which does nothing to quiet some in Brussels who wonder whether Valyrakis
should be allowed to participate in meetings of the Trevi group. Composed of
EU interior and public order ministers, it deals with immigration, border
security and counter-terrorism matters. At least Valyrakis would know what
he was talking about.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Observer: Lady Bradbury's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A question for banking history buffs. Is the Darcy Bradbury, who is doing
all the borrowing for the US Treasury, any relation to the late Sir John
Bradbury, the former UK Treasury chief whose main claim to fame is that he
signed a series of Britain's bank notes which came to be known as
'Bradburys'?
The normally helpful Bank of England is strangely quiet about this episode
in its history which dates back to the outbreak of the first world war in
August 1914, when there was a run on gold coin in circulation. Why the
Treasury felt it had to issue its own notes is glossed over in the Bank of
England's voluminous history books. Surely, the Bank did not refuse?
Whatever the reason, the Treasury had to print its notes on postage stamp
paper because the Bank of England owned the only supply of banknote paper.
The US Treasury, by contrast, has never had to put up with such tomfoolery
since its Treasury secretary insists on signing his country's bank notes.
Who knows, if Darcy gets promotion she may be able to carry on the fine
Bradbury tradition one day.

Shame. Japanese bureaucrats have been receiving nuisance telephone calls at

Japan's Ministry of Finance says some senior officials have recently
received so many rude calls that their numbers may be deleted from the
ministerial directory, which oddly enough seems a national best-seller.
The ministry won't elaborate further. More tantalisingly, neither will it
point a finger of blame.
Cynics suggest listening to the accents of the callers. Are they heavily
US-inclined? Maybe Washington's trade negotiators have alighted on new

Remember the end of the 1980s, when the investment banking boutiques were
meant to be the way of the future on Wall Street? Well, it didn't turn out
that way. The tide of deals ebbed, and most companies showed a preference
for the big Wall Street houses, which can finance as well as advise on a
deal.
Now a new wave of mega-deals in the US is bringing some of the boutiques
back into the limelight.
This week it was the turn of Eric Gleacher, a former head of takeovers at
Morgan Stanley and, before that, Lehman Brothers. Gleacher went out on his
own four years ago, and has barely been heard of since.
Gleacher is the mastermind behind American Home Products' hostile run at
American Cyanamid. The folks at Morgan Grenfell in London are pretty chuffed
by this, since Gleacher is their main corporate finance outlet on Wall
Street.
But with Dollars 8.5bn of cash to raise to back the bid, the betting is that
a bigger Wall Street firm, with underwriting and distribution power, will
soon get in on the act too. Could this be the cue for Morgan Grenfell's
parent, Deutsche Bank, to throw its hat in the ring?

Shenzhen, one of China's leading showcases of economic reform, has a

Beijing, which boasts on average four more public loos per sq km.
Help is at hand, partly stimulated by a sympathetic China News Agency
report, which passionately pleaded that 'tourists in Shenzhen, especially
the very desperate, cannot help but burst into hotels and restaurants, where
they are looked on with disdain'.
Relief beckons. For Shenzhen is to build 15 new public toilets, at a total

internal rate of return is?

FT  05 AUG 94 / Routes to the bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts to curb proliferation of nuclear weapons focus on ways of
preventing or discouraging countries from acquiring weapons-grade uranium or
plutonium, the key elements needed for nuclear explosions, writes Bronwen
Maddox. If a country already has a supply of fissile material, construction
of a crude bomb is relatively straightforward. Producing fissile material of
weapons-grade, however, is much more difficult.
While uranium exists naturally, the form (or 'isotope') needed for a nuclear
reaction makes up less than 1 per cent of uranium ore. The concentration of
this isotope in the fissile material needs to be raised to about 4 per cent
for uranium to be used to fuel a nuclear reactor, a process called
'enrichment', and increased still further to more than 90 per cent for use
in weapons. Plutonium, a man-made element, is derived from other fissile
material. It is produced by nuclear reactions in, for example, uranium
reactor fuel rods, from which it is extracted and purified.
There are, at present, four main routes by which countries can obtain
material for nuclear weapons.
Abuse of civil nuclear programmes:
Of the four routes, diversion of material from nuclear power plants is one
of the easiest technologically, although it is among the most likely to be
detected. In this instance, fissile material is obtained from the core of a
nuclear reactor. This is the route believed to be pursued by North Korea,
and the one International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of civil reactors
are designed to detect.
Given the widespread use of nuclear power, particularly in Asia, monitoring
the location of civil nuclear material could become increasingly difficult.
Enrichment of natural uranium:
This route was pursued by the US in the Manhattan Project's race to be first
with the bomb during the second world war, and was mimicked by Iraq at
hidden desert sites.
Countries with large civil or military nuclear programmes are likely already
to have invested in technology needed to enrich uranium. Otherwise,
developing the technology is laborious and expensive.
But clandestine attempts, such as Iraq's, can be hard to detect. It is
increasingly difficult to control or monitor trade in components for uranium
enrichment plants, which can have a wide range of industrial applications.
Trade in plutonium or enriched uranium:
Last month's discovery in Germany of 6 grammes of weapons-grade plutonium,
believed to have been smuggled from Russia, has increased fears of nuclear
material from the former Soviet republics falling into unauthorised hands. A
supply of plutonium would be one of the fastest ways of acquiring a nuclear
weapons capability, short of actually buying weapons.
A leading US nuclear proliferation expert, Dr William Potter, has warned the
find could be the 'tip of the iceberg' of illegally traded Soviet nuclear
material. But there is no evidence at present that such material can be
easily acquired by rogue regimes or organisations.
Western intelligence experts, who have investigated thousands of reports of
such trades, suggest that - so far - fears of widespread illegal dealings in
fissile materials may be unfounded. Many cases investigated have involved
people misrepresenting the material for sale to make money.
The world's increasing non-military stockpile of plutonium, much of it in
Japan, is another cause for concern. But, at present the destinations of
this material, produced by reprocessing used reactor fuel rods, are closely
monitored under international agreements.
Trade in weapons:
This is probably the hardest route to a nuclear capability for a rogue
regime, given close surveillance by western governments of the former Soviet
Union's missiles.
Some claim that, whichever route is pursued, countries could gain
considerable advantage by hiring nuclear weapons scientists, notably from
the former Soviet Union. But others, such as Mr David Kay, a former IAEA
inspector, say this risk is exaggerated.
'Everyone makes too much of the idea of Russian scientists. If you dropped
20kg of plutonium into Tripoli, you would have a weapons problem within
weeks. I could drop 10 Russian scientists into downtown Tripoli and you
would not have a weapons programme for 10 years. What you would have is 10
Russian scientists gone mad.'

FT  05 AUG 94 / Leading Article: MMM fall-out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimists would see the collapse of the Russian investment fund, MMM, as
something of a landmark. Russia is now enough of a market economy to have an
old-fashioned financial scandal. As the British government's move to wind up
similar companies in the UK confirms, get-rich-quick schemes find many
takers in the west. In Russia, however, the stakes are a lot higher.
Yesterday's raid on the head of MMM was the most aggressive move yet by the
Russian authorities against the large investment fund, which has teetered on
the brink of bankruptcy for the past 10 days. The Russian prime minister
last week stated that there would be no bail-out for MMM's investors in the
event of a collapse, but tighter financial sector regulation is being
considered.
Inexperienced investors everywhere have to learn that prices can go down as
well as up. If the Russians who gambled money on the strength of MMM's
boastful advertising are not compensated by the government, it will send an
important message that people should demand more information about a
company's activities before risking their money.
Just now, however, this is very hard for an individual Russian to do,
without access to informed insiders. Only a small proportion of privatised
companies is listed on the official stock exchange and, for most companies,
disclosure requirements are very selectively observed. Actually trading
shares is made arduous by the fact that shareholder registration generally
occurs at the company level, so investors often have to travel to the
company headquarters to establish proof of share ownership.
It will doubtless take years for reasonably transparent and effective
securities markets to develop in Russia. In the meantime, companies, like
MMM, that simply sell shares over the counter at proprietary branches might
continue to attract investors who cannot otherwise play the system. The
threat of an anti-reform backlash in reaction to this and similar scandals
means the government could feel forced to impose much stricter legal
controls.
A vigorous regulatory response would carry two dangers. The first is that
the market might become over-regulated, without the fluidity which it needs
for domestic and foreign capital to reach the companies that must be
restructured. But the second, more likely, outcome is that more laws would
be passed which have no chance of being enforced.
This would further debase the commodity which is currently scarcest in
Russia: the rule of law. The fact that MMM was able to last this long, while
violating a number of existing tax and advertising codes, only shows how
weak the hold of the authorities has become. The best course for Russia's
reformers is to foster the growing constituency which sees the benefits of
an orderly market, and not cede to a backlash against disorderly ones.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Gravy cools as appetites fade: British MPs' opportunities
for boosting their earnings may soon be curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are the brakes being applied to a gravy train long enjoyed by British
politicians?
The question, at first sight, seems premature. Few MPs can resist the
temptation to profit from their privileged access to government information
and to decision-makers by selling their services to companies, trade
associations and pressure groups.
Of 651 MPs, less than 10 per cent had nothing to declare in the 1994
register of members' interests, in which MPs are required to list details of
directorships, consultancies and other interests such as land, property and
large shareholdings. Many whose entries are blank are ministers, who are
subject to strict rules intended to prevent a conflict of interest with
their official duties.
Many Labour MPs would protest that the links they declare with trade unions
or lobby groups bring little or no personal gain. But other MPs, mostly
Conservatives, have corporate directorships and consultancies, often worth
thousands of pounds a year.
Now, however, their ability to supplement their backbench MPs' salaries of
Pounds 31,687 a year is under threat. The House of Commons privileges
committee is investigating the issues raised by MPs' lengthy lists of
outside interests. This follows the controversy over The Sunday Times
newspaper's recent revelations that two MPs were willing to put
parliamentary questions to ministers in return for payments of Pounds 1,000.
Few expect the committee, composed of senior MPs from the main political
parties, to recommend banning directorships and consultancies. This would
have expensive consequences: MPs estimate their salaries would have to be
doubled or tripled to make up for the loss of this de facto subsidy from the
private sector.
But Tory backbenchers' doleful expressions and comments during recent
Commons debates on members' interests indicate they fear the inquiry may
lead to new rules limiting the scope for outside earnings.
Rule changes agreed by MPs themselves are only one threat. There are
increasing signs that other pressures are reducing the opportunities for
politicians to benefit from the lucrative market for information and insight
into Whitehall decision-making.
Two broad, overlapping trends are apparent. First, the rapid growth of
professional lobbying organisations - with an estimated annual turnover in
the UK of about Pounds 20m - has created a rival source for the information
and ministerial access that MPs can provide.
Professional lobbyists can be more effective. 'We have seen some MPs become
jealous of us,' says one leading lobbyist. 'We are doing a lot of things
they should be doing. How many MPs are prepared to get up early and scour
House of Commons documents for parliamentary questions and motions which are
relevant to the company that pays them?'
Second, the buyers of the information are becoming more careful about how
they spend their money. Rather than hiring an MP as a consultant, for
example, some organisations run their own in-house parliamentary services
departments or employ a Westminster-based liaison officer.
'The trend is towards much more in-house management,' says Mr Ian Greer,
chairman of Ian Greer Associates, the political lobbying group. 'Large
companies do not spend money recklessly; they evaluate very carefully what
their political needs are.'
Mr Chris Austin, British Rail's director of policy and parliamentary
affairs, offers two explanations for this trend. First, there are 'so many
consultancies in the business now' with a broad range of expertise. Second,
'the whole business of financial involvement with MPs has come under
scrutiny and been to some extent discredited'.
Mr Austin adds: 'I wouldn't advise any of the emerging train operating
companies to have an MP as an adviser or a director.'
Another reason for not using an MP to lobby the government, says Mr Bob
Lloyd-Jones, director-general of the Brick Development Association, is that
'ministers react more favourably to direct contact with the industry than to
an approach through an MP. That certainly wasn't the case 30 years ago.'
A sign that companies themselves see less value in having an MP on their
books is the increasing scepticism about the value of a politician on the
board. 'I think the days are gone when a company purely wanted an MP or peer
on the board to have the name on the letterhead,' says Mr Gordon Leak,
public relations director at the Institute of Directors.
For example, Tarmac, the construction group which in the 1980s had the then
Mr Cecil Parkinson, former Tory party chairman, as a director, now says it
is 'not into MPs at the moment on the board'.
Only 10 per cent of City opinion formers regard a governmental career as
suitable background for a non-executive director, according to a recent
survey commissioned by chartered accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn.
British Steel, whose board includes Sir Giles Shaw, Tory MP for Pudsey and
member of the privileges committee, says there is 'no particular
significance' in Sir Giles being an MP. 'We choose non-executive directors
for their wide experience in industry and the City,' the company says.
The trend by companies away from using MPs may accelerate. If MPs agree to
impose stricter rules on outside interests, they will give a boost to the
professional lobbyists - and expose the practice of employing MPs to further
unfavourable publicity.
Until now, MPs have managed to exploit the growth of professional lobbyists
by joining them as directors or consultants. But the inquiry is widely
expected to make it harder for them to do this.
Mr Richard Faulkner, joint managing director of political consultancy
Westminster Communications, thinks the privileges committee will
'inevitably' scrutinise such links.
His firm has applied to join the Association of Professional Political
Consultants, which does not allow companies with MPs on the board to be
members. Explaining these rules, Mr Andrew Gifford, chairman of the
association, says: 'We wanted to be ahead of the game. We felt it was
difficult to see how you could very easily have MPs on the board or retained
and not have some perceived conflict of interest.'
If Westminster Communications succeeds in its application to join, it will
have to lose the services of Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee
of Tory MPs and another privileges committee member.
One comfort for MPs is that it will be many years, if ever, before demand
for their services disappears completely. Mr Michael Sara, managing director
of Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, which manufacturers motorway barriers, says Mr
Patrick Nicholls, Tory MP for Teignbridge and consultant to the company,
performs a useful role. He breaks down 'civil servants' lethargy and
inertia,' says Mr Sara. 'He has only to ask a question or write a letter and
they jump to attention and run all over the place. If we ask the department
something, nobody does anything.'
Similarly, Mr John Maples, former Treasury minister and now chairman of
Saatchi and Saatchi Government Communications, the political consultancy,
still sees value in retaining an MP on the books. If you are a large company
and they 'tell you something once every five years, they have probably paid
you back a hundred times over', he says.
Those who think that demand from companies for good information will remain
strong are almost certainly right. But as competition intensifies to supply
political intelligence, and the Commons moves closer to tightening its
rules, MPs will find it harder to keep their share of the market.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Bretton Woods (50 Years): Guide-posts along the eastern
route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESZEK BALCEROWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The breakdown of communism presented the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank with an unprecedented challenge. For me, charged in 1989 with the
daunting task of designing Poland's transition from failed socialism to the
market economy, their help proved invaluable. Particularly important was
their insistence that Poland meet strict fiscal and monetary conditions.
These institutions are right to be tough, which is in the best interests of
their clients.
The legacy of communism was far from uniform. The economic structure was
worse in Slovakia, for example, than in the Czech Republic. Poland,
Bulgaria, Hungary and the former Soviet Union were burdened by large foreign
debts, but Czechoslovakia and Romania owed relatively little. The most
important differences, however, were macro-economic. Poland, in 1989, and
the Soviet Union, in 1991, were afflicted by macro-economic imbalances.
Czechoslovakia had the most stable economy, followed by Hungary. Bulgaria
and Romania were in an intermediate situation, but closer to the Polish than
to the Czechoslovak extreme.
Nobody was fully intellectually equipped to deal with the post-communist
transition. But some guide-posts were available. The first was the kind of
economy to be reached at the end of the transition. It was natural to assume
that it should be an economy capable of rapid and sustained economic growth.
This criterion explained the reformers' vision of a stable,
outward-oriented, market-based and mostly private economy.
By comparing this goal with initial conditions, it was possible to derive
the direction to be taken during the transition. This was towards
macro-economic stabilisation, liberalisation, privatisation and related
institutional reforms.
This vision coincided with the views of the Bretton Woods institutions. The
World Bank was helped by its own previous shift from project-lending towards
lending for policy reform aimed at creating a stable, market-friendly
economic environment. With its focus on the private sector, the
International Finance Corporation was well placed to participate in
privatisation and capital market development in post-socialist economies.
The IMF's traditional preoccupation has been with macro-economic imbalances,
a serious problem in most of these countries. It had also broadened its
interests in the late 1980s, by introducing extended fund facilities, which
were focused on the structural determinants of macro-economic disequilibria.
It was also necessary to specify the timing, phasing and speed of reform.
These were trickier questions, with less firm empirical and theoretical
foundations for the answers. To this day they give rise to emotional debate
and misunderstanding. Yet here, too, guide-posts were available.
One was that high inflation calls for radical and sustained macro-economic
stabilisation, because this approach offers the greatest chance of breaking
inflationary expectations. Another, less frequently recognised one was that
links exist among the various aspects of reform. Comprehensive price
liberalisation is necessary, for example, if shortages are to be eliminated
and relative prices adjusted, but this also demands comprehensive
liberalisation of foreign trade. Price liberalisation must be safeguarded by
a tough macro-economic policy. Comprehensive liberalisation is, in turn,
necessary for sustained stabilisation. Otherwise, loss-making enterprises
press government for fiscally ruinous assistance.
All this argued for comprehensive and radical reform, launched without
delay, partly to profit from the favourable initial political conditions
after the great upheaval. Thereafter, the reform had to be sustained,
despite unavoidable social and political complications. Social problems had
to be mitigated by developing a safety net that would be compatible with the
basic goals of the reform.
This was the basic strategy of the Polish economic team between 1989 and
1991, one that was broadly shared by the Bretton Woods institutions. The
fact that it was shared greatly facilitated the discussions that led to the
historic IMF-supported programme of December 1989.
Inevitably, there were controversies on some technical issues: the form of
wage control, for example, and the path of disinflation.
There were also shared mistakes. The size of the decline in output was one
and the extent of the initial price jump was another. Given the extent of
the ignorance, such forecasting errors were unavoidable. What mattered was
that they were not allowed to derail the transition. The shared vision acted
as a powerful safeguard.
Such a vision was not equally present in all transition economies. The
political position of the reformers may also not have been as strong as in
Poland. Agreement with the Bretton Woods institutions was then not so easy
to achieve, while conditionality became much more contentious. Nevertheless,
linking agreement to a strong domestic programme must remain a fundamental
principle of the Bretton Woods institutions. It should not be sacrificed for
political expedience.
Reforms often have great importance for the stability of the world, with
Russia the main case in point. Even in this situation, however, IMF and
World Bank conditionality should not be impaired. Western governments should
come up with assistance themselves, instead. A small part of the 'peace
dividend' is not a high price to pay for increasing the chances of enjoying
the rest of it.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nigerian election was not 'deeply
flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM ROBBINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Time to help Nigeria' (August 3), is well-meaning, but
rather confused.
On the one hand, you acknowledge that the general strike is backed by 'many
Nigerians driven to despair by mismanagement, corruption and falling real
incomes'. Yet you insist that General Sani Abacha, who has been a principal
actor in the military governments that have brought this situation about,
must be a part of any new dispensation aimed at solving the current
political crisis.
What the protesting Nigerians are saying to the world is that arbitrary
military rule, which they have been unfortunate enough to endure for 24 out
of their 34 years of independence, has done their economy irreparable harm
and they want none of it.
Contrary to your belief, the election of June 12 1993 was not 'deeply
flawed'. It was hailed by both international and foreign observers as free
and fair. That earlier candidates had been disqualified was not the fault of
Moshood Abiola or his opponent, Bashir Tofa, but of the military. The
candidature of the final two was approved under the existing electoral laws.
Having gone that far, it was morally, politically and legally wrong for the
military then to 'annul' the result of the election and give no reason.
A lot of southern Nigerians think that, if Tofa, a northerner, had won, no
annulment would have taken place. If you dismiss the bitterness created by
this, you can never understand why the current situation is so dangerous and
could tear the country apart.
You are entitled to your view that Abiola's qualifications for the
presidency are 'dubious'. But don't you think it is patronising to suggest
that you can determine better than the huge Nigerian electorate who is
qualified to rule them?
Abiola is a chartered accountant who graduated with honours from the
University of Glasgow. What are the qualifications of the British prime
minister, for instance?
In a democracy, the final word lies with the electorate and that is why John
Major is prime minister. Nigerian voters are saying that their votes must be
equally respected. As they have proved, they are prepared to back that right
with action, even if some of them die in the process. It is a noble struggle
to enthrone 'people's power' and deserves the support of all democrats.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Richardson made some useful observations on the qualities needed
by our new agriculture minister ('Waldegrave has the right pedigree', August
2).
I would have thought the best quality would be insomnia - all the most
crucial decisions that affect UK farmers are made during all-night sessions
of the council of European Union agriculture ministers, and invariably the
country that has the minister with the greatest stamina wins the best
concessions during these discussions. I wonder whether Mr Waldegrave has
this in his armoury.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to put a price on gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN RYDING and Ms MELANIE HARDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We want to correct a point made by Richard Waters on the subject of
gold and inflation (Global Investor, August 1). The column summarised some
of the results of our gold price/future inflation model presented in Bear
Stearns' Global Spectator, The Golden Challenge, July 26.
Waters writes that Bear Stearns' chief economist, Wayne Angell, argues that
'for a stable price environment, the Federal Reserve would have to target a
(gold) price of Dollars 220 an ounce'. This is not true. The Dollars 220 an
ounce price is derived from our inflation-gold price regression, assuming a
zero per cent inflation rate. However, we clearly said 'this is not to say
that the Fed should target Dollars 220 gold' because:
index number problems could mean that price stability is associated with
1/2 per cent to 1 1/2 per cent inflation;
there is uncertainty over the statistical relationship, especially at low
inflation rates; and
the disinflation path should be gradual.
We do not take our regression results seriously enough to suppose that they
can tell us the price of gold that is consistent with price stability.
What is clear, however, is that the current price of gold is too high. Not
only is Dollars 380 an ounce inconsistent with price stability but actually
signals a rising inflation rate to the 3 1/2 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent area
in 1995. A good first step for policy, however, would be for the Fed to get
the price of gold back into the Dollars 320 to Dollars 340 an ounce area,
signalling that the US economy is back on the disinflation path.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good prospects behind the French
financial 'facade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KIT JUCKES and Mr ALAIN GALIBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While we would seldom disagree with so eminent an 'international
opinion leader', Barry Riley's dim view of France's financial reputation
('Airline cracks in the French financial facade', August 3) warrants a
riposte.
First, French reliance on foreign funding of its budget deficit has fallen,
as net sales of some FFr104bn in the first five months of this year (twice
the outflow seen from the German bond market) have reduced foreign ownership
of the French bond market from more than 40 per cent to about 30 per cent.
This exodus weighed on the market all the more because the French Treasury
(tortoise to the German hare) has maintained its regular funding programme
through thick and thin while a flood of bond issuance was stored up for the
second half of the year in Germany.
Second, while no one would pretend that the French authorities have been
quick to reverse the fiscal deterioration of the last few years, the outlook
is improving as the economy recovers. The 1995 presidential election should,
furthermore, bring an end to government inaction, spurring the authorities
to bring welfare spending into line and speeding up the reform of the tax
system.
Third, it is unclear that Germany's export-led recovery will be any more
impressive than France's performance over the next few years. With German
consumers hamstrung by falling real wages and rising taxes, exporters will
have to do much of the running. In France, exports are on an upwards trend,
unemployment is stabilising and may decline next year, and capital spending
is recovering on the back of a healthy financial balance of the corporate
sector and rising profits.
Finally, we doubt that there is a great deal of political risk that needs to
be priced into French assets. In part because unemployment will fall
further, franc fort is effectively unquestioned and fiscal retrenchment
accepted as unavoidable.
Whoever wins the election, be it Mr Jacques Delors, Mr Edouard Balladur or
Mr Jacques Chirac, a rebalancing of the monetary and fiscal policies is now
unlikely. Without major political risk or strong signs of divergence between
the French and German economies, it is hard to see why the French franc or
bond market should weaken from here relative to Germany.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: A 'Ring' on the light side - The new Bayreuth cycle is
all image, no substance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So The Ring has come full circle, and the designer has ended up wearing the
trousers. Rosalie (real name Gudrun Muller), the first woman to design
Wagner's tetralogy, set the agenda for Bayreuth's new production from start
to finish, decorating it according to her own whim and fancy. The result was
a designer-Ring - all image and no substance. Perhaps she should be
congratulated for such an apt sign of our times.
Siegfried and Gotterdammerung were a marginal improvement on the first two
evenings, on which I reported last Friday. The costumes for Siegfried seemed
less pushy, and the forest murmurs were memorably re-created on stage and in
the pit. John Tomlinson answered his opening-night critics with a glorious
performance as the Wanderer, for which he won the biggest ovation of all.
The new Siegfried, Wolfgang Schmidt, was as likable as he was dependable.
And by softening her stage personality, Deborah Polaski emerged as a
commanding Brunnhilde. The festival orchestra continued to play for James
Levine with virtuoso, singer-friendly transparence - enough to silence those
who insist that the covered pit at Bayreuth prevents Wagner's
Ring-orchestration from being properly heard.
But this has been Rosalie's Ring. It was she who provided the ideas,
stepping into the interpretative void left by the stage director, Alfred
Kirchner. Had anyone ever seen a giant, a dragon or a god, she asked during
press interviews? No, so she would invent her own, selected from 2000
colour-coded costume-sketches: blue for purity, green for nature, red for
blood-and-aggression, black for death. And yet she failed to come up with
anything more original for the Rhinemaidens than bikers' outfits, or a vast
decollete gown for Gutrune. Like many a static art installation, her designs
were an expensive and circuitous way of stating the obvious - dressing up
The Ring, and simultaneously trivialising it.
Siegfried was the high point of the cycle, largely because Rosalie's
futuristic fantasy found a home in the fairy-tale world of forest, Fafner
and magic fire circle. The settings drifted towards naturalistic illusion:
best of all was the leafy canopy for Act 2, an overhead sea of undulating
green umbrellas. Kirchner also found the right context for his satirical
touches - the sight of a 'real' bear careering onto the stage on a swing was
genuinely funny, like a children's cartoon. And the Siegfried-Brunnhilde
scene made an exhilarating climax, because of its restraint and tenderness,
and the way the stage direction was a purposeful match for the music.
For most of Gotterdammerung, we were back where we started, shifting around
the surface of The Ring without penetrating its centre. The opening
benefited from scenic minimalism, with the Norns shrouded in amorphous
cloaks and the Gibichungs perched on stylised thrones. But Siegfried's
arrival had a whiff of knockabout comedy, and just why the Gibichung women
were dressed in orange masks was anyone's guess. With the trio of vengeance
and Siegfried's dying aria, the production dissolved into grand opera.
Nothing symbolised Kirchner's approach better than the final tableau - the
same bare, convex platform that had been there from the start, now
illuminated by a quiet pool of light. End of one world and the foundation
for a better one? It was a tame ending to a tame production, giving the
audience nothing to take home and chew. Even Peter Hall's Ring stirred more
discussion than this.
But we certainly heard more of The Ring than before. Kirchner obligingly
lowered the curtain at every opportunity, including the whole of Siegfried's
Rhine journey and funeral march. Levine and the orchestra responded with
cleanly-sculpted playing and a lilting lyricism which brought Weber to mind.
But the price for such musicality was high. Long stretches of Die Walkure
and Siegfried were just too slow (though not the Siegfried finale, which had
a beautifully-sustained spaciousness). Levine's refined sound-concept made
you feel good, but missed the darker drama of Wagner. In this, his
interpretation was at one with the staging.
No-one can have been more heartened by Tomlinson's comeback than the singer
himself. His Wanderer was less inhibited than the opening two nights, and
more conventionally dressed. In a sense he was the victim of his success in
the Kupfer Ring, and will forever be identified with that production's
extremes. For the Kirchner Ring he had to suppress his natural stage
expressionism, and we must hope that in time he succeeds. A blander singer
like James Morris would have found this production easier to swallow.
Schmidt's Siegfried was sunny-faced, cuddly and tireless. His intonation may
have been variable, but he was never less than sensitive, delivering 'Ein
wonniges Weib' with the grace of a Lieder singer. Polaski's Brunnhilde has
at last learned how to express love and compassion. Tall, handsome and
dignified, she moved and sang well, without ever quite touching the heart.
Manfred Jung's Mime was more comic than characterful, while Birgitta Svenden
made an ethereal Erda. Falk Struckmann was the virile Gunther, Eric
Halfvarson a charcoal-voiced Fafner and Hagen. Everyone had been well
schooled by Levine.
New Ring productions at Bayreuth always need time to settle, so perhaps this
one will yield more over the next four summers. The 1995 festival will open
with Wolfgang Wagner's ten-year old Tannhauser production, and 1996 will see
a new Meistersinger, conducted by Daniel Barenboim and again produced by
Wolfgang. With the honourable exception of Heiner Muller's staging of
Tristan und Isolde (new last year), it looks as if Bayreuth has already run
out of ideas for the 1990s.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: Help in kind reaps reward - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts hands out its
annual awards on November 21 to companies that have supported the arts
beyond the call of duty during 1994 there will be one new prize category -
'sponsorship in kind'.
And about time too, you may think. This activity is growing in importance,
building on a long history of business giving its expertise and products to
the arts. It goes back to the days when regional Rep props were manned with
products from local manufacturers and retailers. It can be a modest expense
for a company compared with handing over cash and also there is an obvious
promotional advantage. ABSA in Scotland has already added this category to
its annual awards list, and these days it is a naive arts organisation which
does not look to companies for aid in kind.
The most obvious examples are in transportation. American Airlines made
possible the American Festival in London last year by providing tickets for
the artists, and United Airlines is currently supporting the ENO. At ground
level BMW loaned cars to the recent Aldeburgh Festival and Hertz will
service Edinburgh this month.
Behind the scenes, Digital has taken its obsession with the arts as far as
giving computerised box office systems to the National Theatre, ENO, and
Sadler's Wells; while IBM provided the computer graphics for the Leonardo
exhibition at the Hayward on the South Bank.
Perhaps the most useful form of aid in kind is brain power. Business In The
Arts was set up to lend managers; WH Smith, Marks &amp; Spencer and Arthur
Anderson are among the most enthusiastic companies to give staff time off to
take their accounting, marketing, or computer skills to the aid of
idealistic, if less business like, arts companies.
There is tremendous scope for imaginative relationships: in Northern
Ireland, Duds and Suds, a launderette, offered to wash the costumes of the
cast of the Arts Theatre in Belfast when it was performing The Steamie,
while in Scotland Millhouse Design provided the posters, programme,
merchandise and signing for the Edinburgh International Children's Festival
while training its new personnel through work on the project.
Currently at the Serpentine Gallery in London, Helen Chadwick's
controversial show Effluvia is enhanced by the fact that Trafford Carpets
has provided the artificial green grass to show off her 'Piss Sculptures',
while the Royal Exchange in Manchester was provided with a new corporate bar
by Charles Heidseick, the champagne house.
Arts organisations in the north of England have been helped by BT laying on
free phones and faxes and ABSA itself benefits from free office
accommodation in Manchester provided by P&amp;O Properties. The National Freight
Corporation has given the touring troupe Energy Exit Arts a van to transport
its props while Scottish Ballet's tour of Russia was made much easier by
Safeway providing the pantechnicons which carried its gear.
And so it goes on - Ibstock Building Projects supplied the clay, and then
fired the thousands of small figurines which made up sculptor Antony
Gormley's work 'Field'; Kingfisher, the retail group, has suggested that its
B&amp;Q and Comet subsidiaries bolstered the Hay-on-Wye Festival by laying on
floor and pathways, plus an audio system; while Becks Bier, the Scottish and
Newcastle subsidiary, regularly provides free drinks at the launch parties
of contemporary artists.
At least some of these companies can expect to be short-listed when ABSA
prepares for its prize giving.
All good sponsorships come to an end and what better way to part friends
than by holding a celebratory gala? That is what BT is doing for The Stables
at Milton Keynes, the country home of John Dankworth and Cleo Laine and the
venue for music festivals, courses, and jazz workshops. BT has put up Pounds
30,000 over the past three years, mainly to fund musical education, and on
September 10 at London's Festival Hall it is backing an all star concert to
mark the end of the deal.
BT has also just said goodbye to its New Contemporaries visual art
sponsorship, but has taken on board BT National Connections, a youth theatre
scheme which culminates with performances at the Royal National Theatre.
Both show the main characteristics of a BT sponsorship - they cover the
country; they are youth-orientated; and they encourage participation in the
arts by non-professionals.
Rodger Broad, who controls an annual arts sponsorship budget of around
Pounds 1.8m, the largest in the UK, has set aside around Pounds 250,000 for
a new, yet to be determined, project to be running by next year. He is
currently examining the dance field, but no decisions have been made. BT
already sponsors Northern Ballet Theatre with Pounds 500,000 over three
years.
Next month professional drama returns to Huddersfield after a gap of 40
years with the opening of the Lawrence Batley Theatre. Batley, now in his
80s, is credited with bringing cash and carry wholesaling to the UK, and his
contribution of around Pounds 300,000 to the project, almost matching local
authority grants, has immortalised his name. There are two auditoria, a 447
seat theatre and a 150 seat studio, in the complex. With lottery funding for
new arts buildings dependent on matching contribution from arts
organisations it is likely that more generous citizens will be commemorated
in this way over the next few years.

John Major's recent cabinet re-shuffle was a pathetic non event when
compared with Harold Macmillan's Night of the Long Knives in August 1962
when he summarily sacked a third of his cabinet. Timewatch (BBC 2 at 8pm)
examines this cathartic event, mixing rare archive footage and interviews
with some of the ministers involved. Michael Cockerell's documentary airs
the idea that Macmillan was launching a pre-emptive strike to thwart a plot
to overthrow him.
Just how big a disaster The Living Soap (BBC 2 at midnight) has turned out
to be is indicated by this late slot for the final two episodes. The idea of
filming a group of Manchester students as they shared a house, and their
lives, came up against some unmanageable egos. The problem was that none of
the participants could be other than extroverts who saw taking part in the
project as the first step towards a career in the media.
Richard Littlejohn - Live and Uncut (ITV at 10.30) is determined to make
this as controversial as his tabloid newspaper column and his radio
programme.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: Magical 'Dream' is a bit low on humanity - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just about everything in the Royal Shakespeare Company's new production of A
Midsummer Night's Dream is mint-fresh. Every line seems to have been newly
considered, so that you never feel, in this most familiar of Shakespeare
plays, that you know how the rest of a speech or scene will go. The director
is Adrian Noble and this spontaneity is perhaps the hallmark of his
Shakespearian work. His designer, Anthony Ward, has some peculiar colour
schemes but achieves some breathtaking effects of magic with his decor.
Fairyland is a hanging forest of lightbulbs; Titania's bower is a vast
bed-sized upside-down umbrella that lifts her and Bottom into the ether; and
characters enter the wood through doors at the back, as if they were
stepping into another world through CS Lewis's wardrobe. Chris Parry's
lighting and Sue Lefton's choreography add further magic.
Yet, especially when you look at its individual characters, this is a callow
account of the play. Noble has assembled the best possible cast from current
Stratford performers, and yet he elicits performances no better than might
be achieved by actors far less illustrious. This is especially true of the
four mortal lovers, who are played without pathos, dignity, or depth. Why
cast Toby Stephens (the RSC's current Coriolanus) as Lysander, Emma Fielding
(its current Viola) as Hermia, or Haydn Gwynne (its Olivia and, in Peer
Gynt, both Aase and Solveig) as Helena, when these roles - and Demetrius
(Kevin Doyle) - are conceived as two-dimensional? Puck may say 'what fools
these mortals be', but we need not.
The fact that love's unfairness and Puck's mistakes hurl these four people
into dismay never becomes serious. Sure, we should find their situation
absurd. Now and then, however, as when Helena reminds Hermia of 'the hours
that we have spent when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us',
we should see them as having some depth of feeling. When Hermia asks her
ex-lover Lysander what greater harm than hate can he do her, we should see
intelligence within misery. Lysander and Demetrius are clever enough to poke
witty fun at Pyramus &amp; Co. Not so here. Gwynne and Fielding perform Helena
and Hermia neither impetuously enough to be particularly funny nor dignified
enough to be poignant. Stephens and Doyle scarper about like buffoons. If A
Midsummer Night's Dream takes so low a view of human beings, it is a
remarkably un-Shakespearian play.
But Shakespeare's plasticity of characterisation is never apparent in this
staging. Noble goes in for the double-casting whereby the same actors play
Oberon and Theseus, Titania and Hippolyta, Puck and Philostrate. Alex
Jennings wields a nice vein of pixie-like malice as Oberon, but cannot hold
our attention with the role's flights of lyrical description; he plays
Theseus much the same way, but since this role has little lyricism, it
succeeds more easily. Stella Gonet floods the theatre with wanton, elfin
charm as Titania and Hippolyta: ravishing but not really persuasive. Barry
Lynch's lithe Puck comes off better.
There are many fresh strokes - such as Oberon's way of tripping up both
Demetrius and Puck or how he and Puck survey the mortals' confusions from on
top of doorways - but these are incidental. The massive scale of Oberon's
and Titania's power-games, which affects the whole cycle of the seasons,
does not become interesting. Instead, Theseus and Hippolyta heavily hint
that they know what they were doing as Oberon and Titania, which leaves an
unpleasant aftertaste.
Desmond Barrit does some marvellous things with sweet bully Bottom -
overwhelming the rustics' rehearsal with his am-dram ambitions, equipped
with not only donkey-ears but also massive donkey-teeth when transformed by
Puck, and surprisingly quiet in Pyramus's grief. But I was surprised to see
him mugging sometimes at the audience; and the role's humanity - Bottom's
beautiful bewilderment on awakening, and his life-enhancing immediacy on
returning to the rehearsals - does not quicken the pulse. Indeed, the finest
performance in the whole cast is Philip Voss as Peter Quince; the patient
way he deals with Bottom and his helpless delivery of his prologue have the
funny and touching humanity that is too seldom in evidence elsewhere. Kenn
Sabberton's Snug/Lion has it too; and Daniel Evans's Flute, beaming his way
feyly through Thisbe, is the funniest of all. Moment by moment, this Dream
is absolutely vivid; but Noble has wasted an illustrious cast and has given
the play vigour at the expense of human variety.
In RSC repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until
January 19.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Property: Turnround down under - Australia's improving
commercial market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wander through the heart of Sydney's business district, and you will notice
an elegant, refurbished deco property, known as the Grace Building.
Encompassing some 21,500 square metres of empty office space, it was sold by
Japan's Shimizu corporation to the Malaysian Low Yat group for ADollars
16.5m (Pounds 7.8m) earlier this year.
Given that the Japanese had bought the property for more than twice this
amount, the sale would not seem to be the brightest harbinger for the
Australian property market. Yet the fact that it took place at all, and that
properties are finally changing hands, is interpreted as a healthy
development.
Agents and investors generally agree that the commercial property market,
which collapsed in 1989, turned a corner in the latter half of 1993.
Initially, they say, there was a marked 'bounce-back' in values, followed by
a more recent period of consolidation. What happens next, says a senior
property manager with one of the country's largest institutions, will depend
upon the pace and sustainability of the current economic upturn.
'What had occurred in the commercial property market was an overreaction,'
he says. 'There's been a significant spring in values over the past 12
months. Now it's a question of waiting for the fundamentals, such as an
expansion of tenants, to gather strength.'
The peaking-out of the commercial property market in 1989 came at the end of
a 19-year cycle, and was triggered by a combination of debt-financed,
speculative overbuilding and crumbling demand as the business sector
contracted and the economy went into recession.
The result was predictable. Vacancy rates soared in the early 1990s as a
backlog of newly-built offices emerged in the main urban centres - Sydney,
Melbourne, Perth and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane. In Melbourne alone
available office space increased by almost 40 per cent between 1990 and
1994, a net addition of about 900,000 sq m. Almost half of this increase was
accounted for by new 'landmark' towers, according to Graham Strachan,
research director at Richard Ellis, surveyors.
The result was a buyers' market. Efforts to woo tenants intensified, and
incentives ate up an increasing proportion of the face-value of new lease
agreements.
The number of commercial property transactions, meanwhile, nose-dived as
institutional investors wound down their property portfolio weightings and
big foreign investors, such as the Japanese, retrenched. In broad terms,
institutional exposure to property halved between early 1988 and 1993,
reaching 6-7 per cent of total portfolio weightings by the end of that year.
Many of the market's problems have been little different to those of the US
or UK sectors, which both experienced bruising property downturns in the
late 1980s. However, the Australian market's turning-point came somewhat
later, perhaps six months behind that of Britain's in early 1993. Some
Sydney residents think that the decision to award the 2000 Olympics Games to
their city, announced in late-September last year, marked the start of the
upturn - although they admit that the effect was primarily on sentiment. The
net impact of the Games on construction activity nationwide was put at only
ADollars 373m, while peak demand for extra office space was estimated at
75,000 sq m, or less than 2 per cent of Sydney's current 'central business
district' market.
What has occured since the end of 1993 is a selective recovery. In terms of
rental demand, most of the leading cities have seen a flurry of activity at
the top end of the office market. According to Philip Lees, associate
director at Knight Frank Hooker, office vacancies in Sydney topped out at
23-24 per cent in the first quarter of this year and are now 'rapidly
diminishing' for prime or A-grade properties.
Much of this, he admits, is due to tenants trading into more favourable
locations. The use of incentives to woo new clients is still widespread but
has at least fallen from a peak of 45 per cent of the face-value of the
lease. Rent reviews, he says, are now being introduced from year six of an
agreement.
In Melbourne, Mr Strachan of Richard Ellis sees a similar situation, but
stresses that it is only the top end of the market which is benefiting.
Vacancy rates in the 'top 20' business locations have fallen from about 30
per cent in 1991, to about 11 per cent at present. But this improvement has
been at the expense of second-grade properties. The vacancy rate overall is
still about 24 per cent.
One outcome of these still-patchy conditions has been the much-publicised
trend towards converting commercial properties to residential use - with the
end-result usually billed to home-buyers as trendy 'Manhattan-style',
warehouse living. But at least some property companies think the vogue may
have attracted more attention than it deserves.
'These conversions happened because of the poor state of the office market,
and were led by developers not customers,' says one agent. 'The banks are
now more stringent, and demanding that 80 per cent of units are pre-sold.
The market is correcting itself.'
On the sales side, meanwhile, the feeling among agents and investors that
the commercial property market has passed its nadir is growing, and that
there is evidence that buyers are returning. This is partly a domestic
trend: several institutions - such as the National Mutual, the Australian
Mutual Provident and Bankers Trust Australia - are thought to be back in the
market, and fund managers privately confirm this.
More marked, however, is the overseas interest. South-east Asian investors -
notably from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong - have been prominent, seeing
Australia, with its stable political system, as a 'safe haven'. Some agents
report that these investors tend to prefer good, second-tier properties, and
have thus helped to underpin the lower end of the market.
The increase in buyer interest, meanwhile, has allowed some Japanese
investors to liquidate holdings - a process which is still continuing. This
week, for example, the Park Grand hotel, in central Sydney, was sold for an
undisclosed sum, thought to be in excess of ADollars 300m, by Kajima
Properties, which had placed the property in receivership in February. In
this instance, the buyer was American - ITT Sheraton, the hotels group.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology: Calling time on Wall Street - The move to a
three-day settlement period is a technological nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When US regulators studied the stock market crash of 1987, they agreed that
one factor had a pervasive, negative impact - time. Trades were taking so
long to settle that it took days before investors had an exact idea of their
losses. 'Time equals risk' became a maxim of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the US securities market watchdog. As a result, the agency
mandated a June 1995 deadline for Wall Street to move from five-day to
three-day settlement of stocks and bonds.
The change, dubbed 'T plus Three' (trade-plus-three), represents a big step
in improved efficiency in the US markets, but a technological nightmare for
Wall Street. Every computer instruction for five-day settlement must now be
changed to three.
'We process 160,000 trades a day, and each trade generates several
confirmations,' says Bruce Garland, vice-president of the Depository Trust
Company, a US settlement and clearing house. 'That means an awful lot of
changes in computer entries.' Everyone acknowledges that the price tag will
be hefty. Hopes that the SEC would push back the deadline have been dashed
and firms are beginning to scramble in order to be ready in time.
Regulators hope the industry will face lower risk under the T plus Three
system. As things stand now, a full five days lapse before trades are
confirmed and paid for. This leaves ample time for misunderstandings and
credit failures.
Under three-day settlement, all parties will be sure where they stand within
three days of the trade date. 'No one wants to wait five days to find out
their trading tickets are wrong,' says Garland. 'The whole system needs to
move faster.' Despite its cost and challenge, the new T plus Three rule
represents a significant opportunity for the US securities industry to
reassess its technological capacity and adapt to current needs and future
demands.
'Since companies have to re-evaluate their technology anyway, it makes sense
to use this opportunity to re-engineer their entire work flow and prepare
themselves technologically for the future,' says Michael Reddy, chairman of
FACS Corporation, the consultancy which is advising companies on the T plus
Three change.
Under three-day settlement, speed will become vital, and companies are
likely to rely increasingly on electronic communication to quicken the pace.
By encouraging computerised confirmation, clearing and delivery, the new
system will help push Wall Street towards paperless trading.
Some changes may also be in store for retail customers, as placing buy and
sell orders from home computers becomes easier. In the near future,
purchases may even be electronically debited to customers' credit cards or
bank accounts.
One of the key systems allowing for rapid settlement is the Depository Trust
Company's 'interactive institutional delivery', nicknamed interactive ID,
which allows firms to confirm trades in real time. In the past, firms filed
all their transactions together at the end of the day with the DTC. However,
regulators fear that with settlement dates moved up, the system would
overload with the entire industry reporting at the same time.
'If firms don't start to use interactive ID regularly, the system will break
down,' says Reddy. The SEC is even considering making the use of interactive
ID mandatory for certain trades. Under the interactive ID system, a broker
sends information back to the institutional investor through electronic DTC
hookup. The institution confirms in a matter of minutes. DTC then sends
confirmation to the institution, broker and the institution's agent.
The system could be adapted to send confirmation to personal computers
linked to the DTC network or even to faxes. Although the ultimate goal is
for firms to report and confirm trades within minutes of their execution,
many companies still do not have the ability to do so. DTC says it is
therefore encouraging firms to report several times a day, referred to as
'multi-batch', in order to prepare for a shift to real time.
'Technology is only as good as its weakest link,' says Stuart Goldstein, a
spokesman for the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a Wall Street
clearing house. 'To really move to real time, the entire industry has to do
so, not just a few players.'
The NSCC is trying to speed up settlement by reducing the number of physical
certificates that must change hands. The company plans to operate a vault to
be shared by all clients. When the certificates change hands, it is simply
noted by computer entry at the NSCC. The NSCC is also working with the SEC
to replace physical securities now required for certain commercial paper and
initial public offerings with electronic certificates.
One of the main concerns on Wall Street is to build flexibility into any new
technologies to facilitate modifications later on. 'We need a technological
platform from which to grow. Volume levels continue to grow, and we'll need
to be able to handle that. Rules might change too, and we need to meet those
new demands,' says Goldstein.
One rule that may change before the end of the decade is a further
tightening of settlement time. 'T plus One is not that far away,' says
Reddy. Crucial to ensuring flexibility are 'relationship databases'. In the
past, most Wall Street firms wrote computer programs on a step-by-step
basis. One step would affect another, but the computer could not see how by
itself. Any change in the system, therefore, would require a programmer to
rewrite each step individually.
Under the increasingly used relationship databases, the computer program is
built around functions. Change one step and the computer automatically does
the rest. As Wall Street sheds its reliance on paper, demand for
certificates continues to fall.
The SEC has launched an educational campaign to convince brokers and
investors that in most cases, electronic confirmation is as good as a
physical document.

   CRYSTAL CLEAR DATA STORAGE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holographic crystals have the potential to store large amounts of
information more efficiently than any existing information storage system.
Scientists at Stanford University report in this week's issue of Science, a
US journal, that they have developed a fully automated digital holographic
data storage system with a total useful data capacity of 163,000 bytes.
The technique involves converting data to an optical signal which is then
recorded in a holographic crystal. The information can be retrieved by
illuminating the crystal and converting the optical signal back into an
electronic signal. Potentially, this technique could be used to store
trillions of bytes of information.

<TEXT>
Computer systems capable of recognising the spoken word have found uses in a
range of telephone-based applications, such as call-answering sys-tems and
automated information lines.
But these systems, which have to recognise a variety of voices and accents,
have a very small vocabulary. This is because speech recognisers usually
work by collecting vocabularies and downloading them on to proprietary
hardware, which limits the system to the vocabulary on the hardware.
Computer &amp; Communications Company, a Cambridge-based business, has developed
a vocabulary collection and storage technique which does not use special
speech recognition hardware.
Its WordCraft software, used with a voice processing system, allows
developers to build large vocabulary speech recognition systems that can
cope with different voices.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Genetically disabling the virus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The human immune system can, given time, fight off just about any
microscopic invader. But the body is sometimes overwhelmed by an invader
before it can muster its defences, writes Daniel Green.
At a conference in Vancouver, Canada, yesterday, UK biotechnology company
Cantab presented the results of animal experiments that promise to overcome
this problem: it has developed a way of genetically disabling a virus so
that it stimulates the immune system but does not reproduce and cause
illness.
The Disabled Infectious Single Cycle virus seems to work by preventing and
curing herpes in mice and guinea pigs.
Cantab's manufacturing plant should be ready by the end of the year.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): A model approach to close-up
pictures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pilotless helicopter, fitted with a video camera, has been developed to
take high-quality, close-up pictures in inaccessible or hazardous
situations, writes Andrew Derrington.
The system, available from Cunningham Aerial Inspection Services, has
applications in loss adjusting and has already been used to inspect
fire-damaged buildings and forests.
The model's small size and the fact that it is pilotless allows it to go
where conventional helicopters cannot. It is controlled by two operators on
the ground, linked by radio. One watches the video pictures while the other
pilots the helicopter under visual control.
The new system is based on a light-weight airframe (10oz). Camera vibration
has been reduced by a mechano-electric mounting that enables close
inspection of the finest details.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Sieff, 81, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer and one of the
grand old names of British retailing, has retired after nearly 11 years as
chairman of FIBI Bank (UK), the London arm of the First International Bank
of Israel, one of Israel's top five banks.
However, the family link between Marks and Spencer and one of Israel's most
profitable banks, is continuing. David Sieff, 55, Lord Sieff's son and an
executive director of M &amp; S, has joined the board of the small City-based
bank and has taken over as chairman. Last year FIBI Bank (UK) made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.0m on shareholders funds of Pounds 19.6m. Its total
assets grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 75.6m.
The Israeli parent of FIBI Bank (UK) is unusual in that it is privately
owned. In November 1990 it was bought by two Brazil-based bankers, Yosef and
Moise Safra, brothers of Edmond Safra who controls one of the world's
biggest private banking empires.

</HEADLINE>

Ian Buckley, 39, former joint head of corporate finance at Carr Kitcat and
Aitken, is going to work for one of his old clients.
He is taking over as finance director of SelecTV, the independent television
production company behind comedy and drama series such as Birds of a Feather
and Lovejoy.
Buckley, who has known SelecTV's chief executive Allan McKeown for some
time, was appointed a non-executive director in May.
Buckley had lost his job at Carr Kitcat following Banque Indosuez's decision
to close down his part of the business. Rather than go to work for yet
another broker he decided that he wanted to try something else.
Nicola Egerton-King, SelecTV's current finance director, has handed in her
notice and Buckley, a chartered accountant, will take over responsibility
for the group's financial affairs from September 5.
SelecTV, currently capitalised at Pounds 37m, increased its pre-tax profits
by 14 per cent to Pounds 926,000 on a 19 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds
23.8m in the year to end-March.
Ian Buckley is not related to Michael Buckley, one of the company's
founders, ousted as SelecTV's chairman last year following a boardroom row
over payments to McKeown.

FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Pentos books Perlin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the struggling specialty retailer, is rebuilding its board which
currently lacks a finance director as well as sufficient weight of
non-executives. Howard Perlin, director of acquisitions and disposals at
Sears until March, was yesterday appointed to the board as the first of two
or three new non-executive directors, according to chairman Sir Kit McMahon.
Perlin, below, who left Sears saying he wanted to set up in consultancy and
build up a portfolio of non-executive directorhsips, explained that one of
his main reasons for accepting had been McMahon himself. 'I admire his
willingness to be frank about what happened. He didn't want to be chairman;
I am impressed by what he has faced up to.'
Pentos founder Terry Maher, who had been both chairman and chief executive,
was ousted towards the end of 1993, when the company reported losses of
Pounds 70.6m for the twelve months to December 31.
While Perlin was introduced by headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles, Sir Kit was
easily able to check him out. Perlin had joined Sears as personal assistant
to Geoffrey Maitland Smith, who now chairs the retail group, and who is well
known to McMahon, as they sat together for several years on the board of
Midland Bank.
McMahon says that while Pentos has 'not got the plate out', Perlin's
considerable experience of company disposals may come in useful, in due
course.

FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Greenalls puts greater emphasis on property
management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Longden's appointment as group property director of Warrington-based
Greenalls, which quit brewing to concentrate on its pubs and hotels
operations, is fresh evidence that the right brands and good management are
not the only keys to success in the increasingly specialised pub retailing
business.
Greenalls is believed to be the first major pub retailer to appoint a
property specialist to its main board. Longden, 49, is a chartered surveyor,
who has more than 20 years experience in the drinks and leisure sector,
having worked for companies ranging from Grand Metropolitan to Trust House
Forte and Samuel Smith. Longden believes that pub retailers need to give the
same attention to managing their property assets as do the big supermarket
chains.
Longden has been headhunted away from Bass, where he was director of
property and deputy chairman of Bass Developments. He had been responsible
for Pounds 3.2bn of properties around the world and also looked after Bass
Developments which made Pounds 3m a year from developing individual
properties and selling them on.
Bass, in common with other brewers, has been forced to rationalise its
public house estate following the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report on the industry. Consequently, Longden has been responsible for
selling over 4,000 properties over the last five years, which he believes is
bigger than the combined transactions of the big banks which have also been
trying to make the best use of their retail outlets by selling off hundreds
of surplus properties.
Greenalls, which has about 2000 outlets, is considerably smaller than Bass.
But Longden was attracted by the promise of a seat on the main board and the
chance to join what he calls a 'very stylish and fast-moving licensed
retailer'.

countries should increase more than five-fold over the next 10 years.
The markets in the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the UK are
presently worth Dollars 264m (Pounds 176m) and could rise to over Dollars
1.4bn by 2003, claims a report* by Pharma Strategy Group, a division of IMS
Global Services. These markets represent about 75 per cent of the global
market for systemic anti-viral drugs for HIV and Aids.
Sales would be highest in the US with 43 per cent of the market, followed by
Italy (19 per cent) and France (17 per cent). The fastest-growing market
would be Japan, up 1,700 per cent, while the slowest would be the UK, up 131
per cent.
Market growth would be driven by an increase in duration of treatment which
could rise from about three years in 1993 to six years by 2003. In addition,
the proportion of HIV-positive individuals without symptoms taking treatment
should rise from about 20 per cent to 60 per cent.
The report argues that the market, presently dominated by Wellcome's AZT, or
Retrovir, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Videx should fragment. This would
partly be due to resistance and partly through the introduction of new
products, such as protease inhibitors, new reverse transcriptase inhibitors
and anti-sense products. In addition, treatment with a single drug would be
replaced by combinations of new and existing therapies.
It was predicted the rate of growth in the incidence of the disease in the
developed world would decline, except in Japan.
The market for anti-virals could collapse if vaccines for HIV become a
reality, but the report argued this was a remote possibility over the next
decade.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Management: Irritable, moody, late and high - Health Check /
The difficulties of detecting drug abuse in the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although many of us have images of manic currency dealers who use cocaine
recreationally, or of criminals addicted to heroin, drug abusers rarely
conform to neat stereotypes. They are found across the spectrum, some of
them in jobs which appear responsible and even staid.
In the UK there are thought to be more than 100,000 regular users of hard
drugs such as heroin and cocaine, and an unknown number who use cannabis and
other drugs generally considered 'soft'. However, the distinction may be
academic - what counts is the effect on performance.
Drugs have obvious dangers in areas such as the transport industry. But drug
use also poses more subtle hazards, such as inaccuracies, poor attendance
and petty theft to support the habit. There can be more sickness leave,
higher staff turnover and economic loss - in the US an estimated Dollars
20bn (Pounds 13bn) is lost in annual productivity because of drug abuse.
For employers, legal repercussions are a possibility. In the event of an
accident, for instance, charges could be brought under the Health and Safety
at Work Act 1974 (which obliges employers to ensure, as far as is reasonably
practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of employees and others
who may be affected by the work).
Symptoms which raise suspicions of drug use in a colleague or employee
include moodiness, irritability, erratic output, mistakes and bad
timekeeping. But these can be caused by fatigue, stress or physical illness.
One cannot know without testing.
In Britain the basic drug screening menu covers amphetamines, cannabis,
cocaine and opiates (such as heroin and morphine), and one can test for many
others, such as barbiturates and bensodiazepines (diazepam and other
tranquillisers).
Some organisations test 'with cause' - when there is some reason to suspect
drug use. Others may test all their employees and prospective employees. In
the transport industry, much testing is related to the Transport and Works
Act (Alcohol and Drug section) 1992. The act came into effect after the
Cannon Street crash of 1991 when the train driver tested positive for
cannabis.
Oil companies such as Texaco, Shell and Esso have screening programmes which
are especially relevant to offshore work. In one study of platform workers,
9.2 per cent tested positive for cannabis. Hilary Goodwin, a specialist
occupational health physician, points out that several weeks' worth of drugs
are easier to conceal on a rig than several weeks' worth of alcohol.
Nowadays, many medium-sized enterprises are also taking up screening. In
these businesses, drugs may pose no obvious physical danger, but users can
still be a liability. Lindsay Hadfield of Medscreen, a company which
conducts drug testing programmes, has noticed increasing awareness of the
effects on office-based staff.
'Lapses in concentration can be crucial if, for instance, they result in a
contract containing a figure with the wrong number of noughts'.
Testing is far from simple. There may be false positives (cough mixtures and
poppy seeds can give positive tests for opiates) and false negatives, in
that cocaine and heroin only persist for 12 to 48 hours in the body, while
cannabis can last weeks.
Acquiring the sample is problematical. The urine sample must come from the
individual who is being tested, without adulteration or substitution, and
must be sent to the lab in a tamper-proof container. Throughout the
procedure tight controls and documentary evidence are needed.
Screening is obviously costly for a business and there has to be a reason
for it. In particular, there is no point testing for drugs unless it is
clear what to do
next.
Goodwin, who has particular expertise in policy development and in testing
for alcohol and drug abuse in the workplace, says: 'It's crucial to have a
company policy setting out the purpose of testing - and the action to be
taken in the case of a positive test - before any testing begins. Company
policy influences the way tests are interpreted, so test results should be
interpreted by a doctor with a special interest in drug misuse at work.'
Increasingly, organisations perceive drug use to be a matter for
confidential counselling and treatment of an individual as much as for
disciplinary action. Some companies, such as London Underground and Shell,
have their own in-house counselling units.
Those which do not have to turn elsewhere. The charity Turning Point offers
an advice service for organisations, and training for personnel staff and
supervisors. John Marsden of Turning Point says: 'We would always encourage
an employer to survey local treatment services in their area. It's often
possible to network into what's available'. He adds that a number of
treatment providers will co-operate by confirming that an employee who has
been referred has in fact attended.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Management: Empty room at the top - Leeds Permanent's long
quest for a chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday was an important anniversary for Britain's fifth largest building
society, Leeds Permanent. But there were no celebrations. A year ago it
announced plans to merge with a rival, National &amp; Provincial, in a deal
which would have created the UK's third largest society and given Leeds a
much-needed chief executive.
But the post-announcement merger talks came unstuck, and they called the
whole thing off in October. Since then Leeds has remained without a chief
executive, as headhunters have scoured the globe in search of anyone
remotely qualified who wanted the job.
The room at the top had been caused by Mike Blackburn's decision the
previous February to leave Leeds to run Halifax Building Society, the UK's
largest mortgage lender. Roger Boyes, Leeds' finance director, stepped into
the breach to become acting chief executive, and has been there ever since.
The months of waiting have thrown up two broad issues: the management of the
society during the interregnum, and the poor handling of the search for a
new leader.
The vacancy has overshadowed whatever Leeds has done since October. Whether
it was announcing a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992-93 last
November; publishing a 37 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits in April;
or giving details of Leeds Life, its new life insurance subsidiary, the
recurrent question was whether it had found anyone to lead the society.
It has become clear that the person will come from outside: an insider would
have been appointed long ago. At least two senior executives from other
societies - many more, according to gossip within the sector - have been
canvassed about the post. The affair has become almost a standing joke and
in time could affect the society's credit ratings.
'Eighteen months without a chief executive is too long, and the blame for
this failure to make an appointment must rest squarely on the shoulders of
the board,' says John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at the banking group
UBS.
The delay has added to the difficulties in finding a new chief executive.
Blackburn's successor will be under no illusions about having been the first
choice and may well wonder what deterred earlier candidates from taking the
post. It has also added to the obstacles which the appointee will have to
overcome.
This is not because the organisation has been poorly run over the past one
and a half years, but because the existing management has acquired a
better-than-adequate track record. The longer this has continued, the more
Leeds executives may question what even a paragon will bring to the
organisation.
The triumvirate who have been most responsible for running Leeds since
February last year were all appointed by Blackburn and are all from outside
the societies sector: Boyes joined the society from a background in
engineering; Chris Chadwick, commercial director, from American Express; and
John Miller, information systems director, from manufacturing.
Boyes is careful to emphasise the contribution of the broader executive
team, through the 10-strong management committee, which he describes as the
'bedrock' of the society.
The past 18 months have also put a spotlight on the role of the chairman,
Malcolm Barr. His involvement in the running of the organisation has been
seen by some other societies as well beyond that of their chairmen, and
potentially cramping for any potential chief executive considering the post
since October.
Boyes says simply that the chairman of a society falls into one of two
categories, and unless he is merely a titular head, then he would be
expected to be around a couple of days a week at least.
At any rate, Barr's role is no longer a factor in the quest for a chief
executive: he will retire in January at 68, and last month John King, an
existing non-executive director, was appointed chairman-elect.
Competitors accept that Boyes and his team have done a competent job and
have the backing of Leeds' staff, but there remains a question about
strategic issues.
The need for a long view is particularly pressing when, as a result of the
Treasury review of the sector's legislation, societies will have access to
new powers. They are already facing intensified competition in high street
financial services.
The approach of Leeds, the UK's fifth largest society, has been based on its
position as a large but not dominant organisation in the retail financial
services market.
In order to make effective use of its branch network, while recognising that
it cannot offer every service in competition with the clearing banks, it
offers a broader range of facilities to customers than some of its rivals.
Boyes describes the strategy as 'ever-evolving', but it is hard to escape
the conclusion that at some point it will need fresh impetus as well as
fine-tuning.
Future planning is where the continued uncertainty has been a problem, with
executives questioning what would happen if an incoming chief executive took
a totally different view of the way forward.
Boyes' answer underlines the organisation's continued confidence: 'I say to
them that if we have forged a robust strategy, then the case for any U-turn
would need to be substantiated.'
Leeds accepts it needs a more conventional management structure, and would
benefit from the higher profile a new chief executive would give it. 'The
current arrangement cannot be tenable in the long haul,' says Boyes.
The long haul may almost be over. Fresh rumours suggest Leeds is nearing the
end of its quest. It is both a good and bad comment on the society that 18
months ago finding a chief executive should have been straightforward;
finding one now looks like an achievement.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Halifax knocks C&amp;G off top of league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax, the UK's biggest building society, has for the first time taken top
position in the annual analysis of performance of the 20 biggest societies
by Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS.
The league table assesses societies on the basis of 12 ratios, which reflect
aspects of performance such as management expenses, capital strength and
market share. While there has been some criticism of the table, it is
watched closely by society executives.
It was noticeable yesterday that Halifax, for example, sounded less
dismissive of the analysis than has sometimes been the case.
Given the recent interest by banks and other financial organisations in
societies as potential acquisitions, the report may have a wider audience
than usual.
In joint second place for 1993 were Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the
sixth-largest society which topped the table last year, and Yorkshire, the
12th-largest. In April Lloyds Bank offered Pounds 1.8bn cash for C&amp;G.
The two worst performers on the UBS analysis stayed in the same positions as
last year - Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-biggest society which took the 19th
slot, and Skipton, which took 20th place.
Mr Wriglesworth said that Skipton had suffered sustained high levels of bad
debt losses, particularly from its non-residential mortgage book. B&amp;W's
performance had been hampered by high costs, relatively poor capital
strength and high levels of arrears.
The biggest improvement in position came from Birmingham Midshires, the
13th-largest society, which rose from 15th place to eighth.
The sharpest fall came from North of England, which is to merge with
Northern Rock under an arrangement approved by members of both societies
earlier this week. North of England fell eight places to 15th. Northern Rock
slipped to take fourth place, having come third last year on restated league
results.
Abbey National, the home loans and banking group that was formerly a
society, was not included in the report, but UBS said its business was still
close enough to that of a building society to make a comparison. Had it been
included in the league table it would have taken 10th place.
Mr Wriglesworth contrasted the position of Abbey, the UK's second-biggest
mortgage lender, which has been slipping in terms of relative performance on
the basis of the UBS ratios, with that of Halifax, which has been rising in
the league table since 1990.
On Monday Abbey reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
423m for the first half of this year compared with the first six months of
last year.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Profits of Pounds 62m for MoD agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Defence Research Agency, the science arm of the Ministry of Defence,
yesterday reported an operating profit of Pounds 62m for the year to March
31, up from Pounds 39m last year. This was in spite of a fall in turnover
from Pounds 796m to Pounds 771m.
Redundancy costs of Pounds 40m and other restructuring charges meant that
overall profits were only Pounds 2.6m, however.
The workforce fell to 10,004 from 11,094 in the year with the bulk of
redundancies in the engineering services and quality assurance departments.
These lost business because the MoD stopped buying some services from the
DRA. Up to 1,000 further redundancies are likely this year.
The agency was converted into a quasi-autonomous trading fund in April last
year as part of the government's market reforms of the civil service. As a
result it now produces annual audited accounts as though it were a
private-sector company.
More than 90 per cent of its work comes from the MoD, although the agency is
trying to increase the proportion of commercial work and to develop 'dual
use' technologies which have both civil and military applications.
Work from the MoD will decline further as a result of the 'front-line first'
defence review, with Pounds 50m being cut from the agency's long-term
research effort.
The MoD will no longer fund work which is unlikely to lead to practical
weapons in the next 20 years.
Mr John Chisholm, the agency's chief executive, said that the first year's
operations as a trading fund had been a success. Productivity had improved
and the agency had cut its fixed costs to combat the decline in research
income.
Mr Chisholm said that the agency was meeting 85 per cent of its deadlines
compared with 50 per cent three years ago.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Miners win rethink on pay-off deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal is to give 2,700 miners and pit officials a second chance to
agree a job-flexibility and redundancy-terms package. This follows a judge's
ruling that their decision to reject it may have been influenced by union
advice and 'an element of confusion at the time'.
The corporation had previously refused to re-offer the package in spite of
strong pleas from some of the miners.
Yesterday's decision to do so was viewed with mixed feelings by
private-sector companies considering bids for British Coal at privatisation
later this year.
Although they welcomed the possibility of the 2,700 miners joining the 9,600
who accepted the agreement to work longer shifts, there was concern that
they would have to pay more redundancy money in future.
British Coal's package provides for payments of up to Pounds 27,000 for
employees made redundant before March 1998. This compares with less than
Pounds 7,000 available to miners who have not signed the deal.
One prospective bidder said: 'It runs into tens of millions of pounds. Nor
will we be able simply to end the scheme in 1998. We will have to either buy
it out or continue it.
'All of this will have to be taken into account in the amount of money we
bid for British Coal.'
The package provides one-off sums of Pounds 6,000 to be paid immediately. In
return for this and the redundancy terms miners must agree to work rostered
shifts of up to 12 hours, compared with the current limit of seven and a
half.
British Coal's decision to reopen the offer follows a ruling by Judge
Patrick Medd, adjudicating in a corporation disputes procedure, that members
of the Nacods deputies union should be given until August 31 to sign up.
The corporation said it wanted to be even-handed with employees, all of whom
would now have until the end of August to sign up.
Nacods said its members had been placed under duress to agree the package.
The judge's tribunal ruled that there was no duress because the corporation
had been trying to spell out the advantages of the package against the
disadvantages.
However, it ruled that it would be unfair to penalise the Nacods members who
did not accept the package because of union advice.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Northern families warmer than southern counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northerners are the most likely to own central heating and microwave ovens
while those in the East Midlands have the greatest penchant for
refrigerators and video recorders.
These facts emerge from the Central Statistical Office's latest family
expenditure survey, conducted last year and published today. It examines the
patterns of spending of nearly 7,000 households.
The survey finds that average weekly spending per household rose 1.8 per
cent to Pounds 277 in 1993 from Pounds 272 in 1992. Average gross household
weekly income increased 2.9 per cent to Pounds 353 from Pounds 343 in the
same period.
Food was the single largest item of spending, with the average household
paying Pounds 50 a week, up from Pounds 47.66 in 1992. Lower mortgage rates
meant that the amount spent on housing fell to Pounds 44.80 a week last year
from Pounds 47.36 in 1992.
The pattern of spending is broken down by deciles (10 per cent bands) of
households in the survey, ranging from the lowest decile, spending an
average Pounds 80.35 a week, to the highest, spending an average Pounds
614.21.
One of the few items of spending where the absolute level of consumption
does not rise with income is tobacco. The third decile (households earning
between Pounds 74 and Pounds 110 a week) spend an average Pounds 5.73 a week
on tobacco, while the highest 10 per cent of earners spend just Pounds 4.87.
The poorest decile of households spend 3.6 per cent of their income on
tobacco, the richest 0.8 per cent.
The survey shows a continued steady increase in the number of households
owning consumer durables. The percentage of households with a car has edged
up to 68.6 per cent, from 67.6 per cent in 1992.
Those with central heating have risen from 81.8 per cent to 82.5 per cent.
There is a small dip in those owning a refrigerator, but only from 99.2 per
cent in 1992 to 99.1 per cent last year.
According to the survey 48.6 per cent of households owned a tumble dryer in
1993, 61.8 per cent a microwave, 16.3 per cent a dishwasher and 38.5 per
cent a CD player.
The survey has been conducted since 1957 and is used in policy areas such as
calculating the weights for the retail prices index.
Going back 25 years, the survey published in 1969 shows how radically the
patterns of spending have changed.
In 1968 the average household spent about Pounds 6.68 a week on food, or

FT  05 AUG 94 / PIA presses advisers to announce ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to ensure that consumers are more aware of whether they can expect to
receive independent financial advice - including the placing of large signs
in banks and building societies and more information in advertisements -
were published yesterday.
The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private
investor, issued a consultation paper to the organisations it regulates on
how to make clear to customers whether they give independent advice or only
advice on a particular company's range of products.
Under the previous regulatory system independent financial advisers had a
separate regulator from organisations which sold only their own products or
were linked to just one life company. The PIA now regulates both types.
In spite of opposition from banks and building societies to the proposals
that they should have to disclose the limits of their advice in posters or
signs in branches, the authority is intending to press ahead.
Plans to extend the disclosure requirements to broadcast advertisements as
well as printed advertisements for mortgages - unless these refer only to
repayment mortgages - will also create antagonism among banks and building
societies.
The plans would add to the length of broadcast advertisements, making them
more expensive. Some estimates put the cost to mortgage lenders at millions
of pounds a year.
Another suggested change would slightly reduce the cost for independent
financial advisers - many of whom are very small organisations - of telling
the consumer the status of the advice being given.
Under previous arrangements they had to give customers a letter setting out
the terms of business and a separate 'buyer's guide'. The authority proposes
that in future they would simply have to hand over a 'terms of business'
letter. It estimates this could save organisations about Pounds 900,000 a
year.
Comments have been requested by late September. Subject to views received,
the authority hopes to introduce the new regime at the start of April next
year.

Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection, yesterday
launched a drive to combat city pollution and increase active public
interest in the issue, David Lascelles and James Blitz write.
Mr Smith, launching Labour's Airwatch campaign, urged the government and
local authorities to take steps to improve the monitoring of pollution
levels.
He called for a statutory obligation on local authorities to collect
information on regional air quality and inform schools and other local
bodies of the results.
He encouraged individuals to test the amount of nitrogen dioxide, a toxic
pollutant, in the air, using a simple diffusion tube.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Whitehall 'could save Pounds 130m' on consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government could save Pounds 130m in three years if Whitehall
departments adopted better methods of using external consultants, says a
report published yesterday by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit.
The report, an earlier version of which was leaked to the FT in April, says
that departments use expensive consultants to do jobs that civil servants
could do just as well. It says they commission consultants on 'rather too
many projects' without inviting competitive bids, and duplicate work already
done for other departments.
The report makes 34 recommendations for getting better value for money out
of consultants, including making greater use of civil servants to do the
work.
It also sets out a list of nine 'critical success factors' for getting the
best out of consultancy. These include selecting the right consultants at
the right price and following through the results of projects.
The unit found savings of Pounds 12.2m a year from spending on external
consultants which totalled Pounds 508m in 1992-93.
But the report says that consultancy does make a contribution to policies
which save large amounts. The size of the consultants' contribution is hard
to apportion, however.
The report says the biggest element of traditional management consultancy
work for the civil service has gone into advice on the market-testing
programme. Annual savings from this amount to at least Pounds 135m.
It says: 'All one can really say with confidence is that external
consultancy advice has been an important element in securing substantial
quantifiable benefits for government, and that these benefits have been many
times greater than the cost of the consultancy itself.'
The unit calculates that the report's recommendations would save Pounds 65m
a year in payments to consultants and add just Pounds 22m to staff costs.
This would make a saving of Pounds 130m in the next three-year public
expenditure period.
These figures were greeted with scepticism yesterday by leading management
consultants.
Mr Julian Bagwell, a partner in Touche Ross Management Consultants, said:
'We are not sure that the sort of savings they are talking about can be
achieved.'
Mr Brian O'Rorke, director of the Management Consultancies Association,
said: 'We would question their figures.' He agreed, however, with the
majority of the report's practical recommendations.
The largest single saving identified by the report was an estimated Pounds
27m from the creation of a central database of previous consultancy projects
to prevent duplication. Consultants said, however, that the resemblance
between projects was often superficial, meaning that duplication was not as
common as the unit believed.
Consultants also doubted the scope for civil servants to negotiate large
cuts in fees on consultancy projects. Mr David Clinton, a partner of
Andersen Consulting, said: 'In my experience the public sector is a pretty
good negotiator. You can only negotiate so far.'
Mr David Hunt, public service minister, promised that the government would
consider the recommendations carefully and draw up plans to take them
forward.
But he said that the report recorded 'the positive contribution that
external consultants have made and can continue to make to the achievement
of important government objectives'.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Departments show sharp spending rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government spending on external consultants has increased sharply in recent
years, the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit report says.
Spending rose nearly fourfold between 1985 and 1990, although it has
stabilised at about Pounds 500m a year since then. The report says that it
was Pounds 508m in 1992-1993.
Whitehall quangos, the non-departmental public bodies such as the British
Library and English Heritage, spent another Pounds 149m in that year. A
further Pounds 70m was spent in 1992-93 on internal consultancy such as
management services, internal audit, staff inspection and information
systems support.
Much of the spending on external consultancy goes on support for
departmental programmes, such as assistance in developing defence equipment,
projects to improve the competitiveness of industry and training projects.
Just more than half of the money spent on external consultancy in 1992-93
went on this form of advice.
Almost 30 per cent of the 1992-93 total went on information systems
consultancy, helping Whitehall departments and agencies in computer
projects.
The remaining fifth was spent on traditional management consultancy, buying
advice on organisation and structure, running market-testing programmes and
providing specialist services such as legal advice.
Two-thirds of external consultancy projects cost less than Pounds 20,000,
while 9 per cent cost more than Pounds 100,000. The latter accounted for
more than two-thirds of the spending, while projects costing less than
Pounds 20,000 consumed 10 per cent of the total.
A third of the management consultancy spending on projects costing more than
Pounds 20,000 was to buy advice on market-testing and purchasing. Assistance
on finance and accountancy issues took 17 per cent and advice on management
issues almost a quarter.
Seven departments and their agencies accounted for 85 per cent of spending
on external consultants. The largest spender by far was the Ministry of
Defence, with more than a quarter of the total.
The spending on external consultancy was shared among 1,900 different firms
or individual consultants. But 30 per cent of the total went to the 10
consultancies with the biggest share of government work.
The two largest beneficiaries are both US information technology firms, CSC
Computer Sciences and EDS-Scicon. This reflects the large computerisation
projects under way in departments such as defence and social security. Other
IT companies in the top 20 include Sema and Hoskyns.
Seven of the world's biggest consultancies are represented in the top 20,
with PA Consulting and Andersen Consulting at numbers three and four
respectively. The global accountancy-related consultancies received 16 per
cent of the spending.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Scottish water schemes attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was accused yesterday of privatising Scotland's water
industry through the back door by urging local authorities to engage
private-sector companies to build, operate and own water and sewerage
installations.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, a Liberal Democrat MP, said the use of build, own and
operate schemes, known as BOO, was 'virtual privatisation'. It would negate
the government's promise that Scotland's water and sewerage industry would
not be privatised, unlike the industry in England and Wales.
It is believed the first BOO scheme for a Scottish water or sewerage project
could go to tender in the autumn, following the drafting of specimen tenders
by a team involving the Scottish Office, the private sector and a regional
council.
The use of BOO schemes is favoured by the Scottish Office as a way of
financing the upgrading of Scotland's water and sewerage industry in the
next 15 years to bring it into line with European Union standards.
Under a BOO scheme a private consortium of banks and construction companies
contracts with a local authority to build a sewerage plant. It would then
own it and operate it under contract with the regional council or, after
1996, the three new publicly owned water authorities.
From the government's point of view the advantage of BOO schemes is that
they allow the public sector to undertake large capital spending projects
without increasing the public sector borrowing requirement, because councils
do not have to borrow to finance them.
A list of 14 Scottish water and sewerage projects worth about Pounds 1bn
suitable for BOO financing was published by the Treasury last November.
A project team - including the construction company Balfour Beatty, the
French-owned water company Degremont, two banks and Lothian regional council
 -has been studying the technicalities of BOO schemes in Scotland.
Although the Scottish Office said yesterday that it was up to regional
councils whether they went ahead with BOO schemes it is understood that it
is unwilling to give councils permission to borrow to finance them.
They could, however, finance smaller schemes out of their current budget.
Lothian region has allowed its officials to consider the BOO system but
other councils, such as Strathclyde, have refused to get involved.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Tyneside aid move 'hinders recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposal for an enterprise zone to help Tyneside recover
from shipyard job losses has blighted development of a key economic
regeneration site, it was alleged yesterday.
Local urban-regeneration leaders, MPs and councillors agree that the
activities of government-funded North Tyneside City Challenge were seriously
hampered by the enterprise zone announcement in May last year.
The five-year City Challenge initiative began operating just a month before
the government said a Tyneside enterprise zone might be declared. It had
focused its Pounds 37.5m programme on the economic spin-off from developing
the Silverlink business park beside the A19 corridor, with the aim of
attracting up to Pounds 100m of inward investment.
But the possibility that part of this 200-acre site might win enterprise
zone status, bringing a decade of capital allowances and exemption from
business rates, has deterred the private sector from making commitments.
The government is unlikely to come to a final view on a zone until it is
clear whether Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, can be
sold as a going concern. If it does then specify sites for the proposed
250-acre zone, it will need approval from the European Community, a process
taking up to 18 months.
Mr David Clouston, chairman of North Tyneside City Challenge and chairman
and managing director of Silverlink Properties, the site's developer, said
yesterday: 'It's a damn stupid thing to have announced. The government
preaches the market but they don't appear to have a feel for how it works.'
Mr Clouston said that because of the uncertainty, multi-million pound
developments due to start on the site were on hold, as was the City
Challenge marketing programme.
A decision may now have to be taken on changing the entire thrust of the
City Challenge programme away from economic activity.
Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, whose constituency includes Swan
Hunter's main yard, said: 'What this shows is the need for some proper
strategic planning in the whole area of economic regeneration and
development.'
Mr John Foster, executive director of North Tyneside council, said the
uncertainty about the zone meant the City Challenge A19 corridor site was
being 'blighted'.
The Department of the Environment, which is responsible for enterprise
zones, said the offer was part of a package of aid measures for Tyneside.
There had since been discussions with North Tyneside, South Tyneside and
Newcastle councils to determine whether they wanted the zone and which sites
might be included. It added: 'If people think an enterprise zone may be
designated they may well hold off.'
North Tyneside council yesterday wrote to Swan Hunter receivers Price
Waterhouse urging them to finance the cost of Swans' tendering for a
Ministry of Defence ocean survey ship.
The council, which said it was a 'significant creditor' of Swans, said it
believed other creditors would share its view.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Drop in new-car sales causes little concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New-car sales fell by 2.5 per cent last month to 34,489, from 35,376 in the
same month last year, the first monthly decline this year.
July is the slowest month of the year for new-car sales as buyers postpone
purchases until August to take advantage of the change in the registration
prefix. The August sales period accounts for about a quarter of UK new-car
sales.
The small fall last month caused little concern among manufacturers, who
forecast that sales this month would rise by between 13 per cent and 14 per
cent year-on-year.
Ford, UK market leader, said August registrations could total 500,000,
challenging the August 1989 record of 500,112. In contrast to the decline in
new-car sales, registrations of new commercial vehicles increased in July by
24.2 per cent to 8,739, from 7,038 a year ago - one of the biggest monthly
rises this year.
The UK has led the European new-vehicle market out of recession. In the
first seven months of the year new-car sales rose 13.3 per cent to 990,752,
while new commercial vehicle registrations increased by 15.2 per cent to
120,109.
Ford, Vauxhall and Rover, the three leaders in the UK market, all suffered
significant falls in registration volumes last month, with Ford sales
falling 11 per cent year-on-year and Vauxhall sales falling 12.3 per cent.
Vauxhall took over temporarily as market leader from Ford, with a market
share of 20.9 per cent compared with Ford's 18.7 per cent. However, overall
it lost ground in the first seven months, its share falling to 17.1 per cent
from 17.3 per cent in the same period a year earlier. Ford raised its share
from 21.7 per cent to 22 per cent.
Rover also lost market share in the UK, in contrast to its success in
continental Europe.
The biggest gains among leading manufacturers were by Mercedes-Benz and
Volkswagen of Germany, the Italian Fiat group and Renault, the French
state-owned company.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Level of R &amp; D assistance criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two-thirds of small companies believe the European Commission and foreign
governments provide more help than the British government with research and
development and innovation, a survey says today.
Research by the British Chambers of Commerce and Alex Lawrie, the business
finance specialist, found that the UK's small businesses want more
information and advice from the government about current R &amp; D/innovation
schemes, finance and best practice.
The findings will add to the debate over the government's role in industry.
Consultancy for small companies was one of the areas named by Mr Michael
Portillo, the new employment secretary, in his leaked letter urging big cuts
in the Department of Trade and Industry's aid for industry.
The survey of 394 companies with fewer than 50 employees found that the
DTI's various innovation-related schemes, as well as European Union schemes,
were not well known to small companies.
The most widely known were regional information grants. But well over half
the sample were unaware of any of the schemes open to them.
The chambers said: 'This is an extremely unsatisfactory situation, and one
which needs to be rectified by the DTI and the European Commission's
information services as a matter of urgency.'
The survey found that 38 per cent of small companies wanted the DTI to
introduce innovation and technology counsellors in its Business Links
programme.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Slaughters heads takeover league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slaughter and May has been the leading law firm advising in public takeovers
in the first half of this year, it emerged yesterday.
The firm advised companies or financial advisers in five deals worth Pounds
1.63bn, according to Acquisitions Monthly magazine, which ranks law firms by
the value of the takeovers in which they have acted as advisers.
Among the deals which enabled Slaughters to top the league table was the
Granada Group's Pounds 766m takeover of London Weekend Television, when the
law firm acted for LWT. Slaughter's also represented Westland in its
acquisition by GKN.
Ashurst Morris Crisp took second place in the table, having worked on three
deals worth Pounds 1.1bn. These included acting for MAI in its takeover of
Anglia Television. The firm has worked closely with the banking world and
two deals worth Pounds 780m pushed it to the top of the table of legal
advisers acting for financial advisers.
The statistics again show the continued domination of the leading national
law firms. The strength of regional firms is demonstrated by
Birmingham-based Wragge &amp; Co appearing in the table for the first time,
ranked tenth. The firm participated in two deals worth Pounds 92m.
Slaughters was also the leading adviser on private takeovers in the January
to June period. It acted in 24 deals worth Pounds 2.87bn. Among these were
the Pounds 1.5bn sale of the Rover Group to BMW.
Linklaters &amp; Paines was second in the private takeovers table, advising in
16 bids which were worth Pounds 2.1bn. Norton Rose was third with six deals
totalling Pounds 1.6bn.
According to the magazine most lawyers in the mergers and acquisitions
market are quietly confident that the level of business will be sustained
for the rest of the year.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Poll gives Labour biggest ever lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's new-style Labour party receives a significant boost today
with the publication of an opinion poll suggesting that his election as
leader last month has propelled the party into its largest ever lead over
the Tories.
The poll, the first of its kind since Mr Blair's victory on July 21, puts
Labour's lead over the Conservatives at 33 1/2 percentage points - 9
percentage points higher than a month ago.
According to Gallup, which conducted the poll, this is the biggest lead
either of the two biggest parties has ever enjoyed over the other - and by a
wide margin.
Gallup said that only the Labour government under the then Mr Harold Wilson
in May 1968 was in nearly the electoral trouble that Mr John Major's
government is in today.
The survey, published in today's Daily Telegraph, puts Labour on 56 1/2 per
cent - up 5 1/2 percentage points from a month earlier - against 23 per cent
(down 3 1/2 ) for the Conservatives and 14 1/2 per cent (down 3) for the
Liberal Democrats.
It provides a stark warning for the Conservative party, suggesting that Mr
Blair's decision to take on the Tories in the centre-ground of British
politics may finally make his party electable.
There is a strong personal endorsement for Mr Blair, indicating that 45 per
cent of voters thought he would make the best prime minister of the three
main party leaders.
This gives him a 30 percentage-point lead in personal popularity over both
Mr Major and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and was a much
better result than was ever achieved by John Smith.
Questioned about their reaction to the formation of a Labour government
under Mr Blair, only 14 per cent say they would be dismayed, against 34 per
cent who would be delighted and 52 per cent who would not mind.
The personal popularity ratings will come as a particular disappointment to
Mr Ashdown, whose party is struggling to find a role for itself in the new
political environment. Mr Ashdown's rating has fallen by 7 percentage points
since early May.
Gallup interviewed 1,161 electors between July 27 and August 1.
A much broader survey of more than 10,000 electors interviewed between June
30 and August 2 put Labour's lead over the Tories at 32.7 percentage points
 -54.7 per cent to 22 per cent. Liberal Democrat support was significantly
higher than in the smaller poll at 17.4 per cent.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Straw snubs gang of four pact hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday scotched any hope of an electoral pact with the Liberal
Democrats following recent calls from members of Britain's third party for
closer co-operation.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, rejected any hope of a deal in
spite of indications that Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader had
attracted strong support among the Liberal Democrats.
In the last week three of the 'gang of four' who founded the Social
Democratic party in 1981 - Lord Jenkins, Baroness Williams and Lord Rodgers
 -have welcomed Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader and said that his
party is now a natural ally for the Liberal Democrats.
But Mr Straw said that there was still plenty to choose between the two
parties, and that Labour's ascendancy in the polls did not warrant any
alliance with other parties.
Mr Straw told BBC radio: 'It is a bit rich for the people who left the
Labour party and then waged war on it for 12 years . . . to say 'the Labour
party has changed and we would like to be welcomed back with open arms'.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, expressed concern earlier
this week that the SDP's founders were starting a rapprochement with Labour.
He refused to entertain any suggestion of a pact.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Tesco is called on to increase local sourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco was urged yesterday to make its takeover of William Low, the
Dundee-based supermarket chain, more acceptable to Scottish public opinion
by obtaining more of its goods from Scotland.
The battle for Wm Low - won by Tesco over J. Sainsbury - has caused dismay
in Scotland because of the disappearance of another of Scotland's small
number of quoted companies and because of the intended closure of Wm Low's
headquarters in Dundee, which employs 300 people.
Few Wm Low stores in Scotland or northern England are likely to close
because of Tesco's small presence north of the border, while Scottish food
and drink suppliers could gain a larger market.
Dr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for Motherwell South, yesterday wrote to Sir Ian
MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, saying that it would be 'a material factor'
with Scots if he were able to say Tesco would increase the sourcing of its
products in Scotland for sale throughout Britain.
In its original offer in July Tesco said it 'intended to continue Wm Low's
policy of encouraging Scottish suppliers and to offer them the potential to
benefit from the wider market served by Tesco'.
Tesco has since said it plans to set up an office in Scotland to handle the
buying of goods and the marketing of the company in Scotland. Yesterday it
said its existing 16 Scottish stores would be given 'a Scottish flavour'.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Beer price war hits brewery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An independent Cornish brewery has become a victim of the fierce price
competition in the take-home beer market which has been intensified by
personal imports from the Continent.
Redruth Brewery has gone into administrative receivership and 42 of the 140
staff have been made redundant. It owes more than Pounds 4m to two debenture
holders, JA Devenish, part of the Greenall Group, and Nacanco, the US can
suppliers. It is owed an export debt of more than Pounds 1m.
The brewery has no tied houses but cans and bottles for national
distribution to supermarkets and independent off-licences. Much of its
output is for own-labels, but its own brands include 93 Limited Edition and
John Davey's bitter. It is one of the UK's largest independents, with a
capacity of 500,000 barrels a year. In the year to February it had a
turnover of Pounds 24m, net of value added tax and duty, and made a marginal
loss.
Mr Keith Morgan, joint receiver for the accountancy firm Pannell Kerr
Forster, said: 'We are trading on for the foreseeable future while we find a
buyer. It is a good core business with short-term cashflow problems.' More
than 100 inquiries had been made by potential purchasers.
Mr Nigel Bibby, who became chief executive four months ago, said profit
margins had suffered because the industry's excess capacity had encouraged
big brewers to compete more aggressively in take-home sales. These had a
rising share of the market.
He added: 'The World Cup meant there was a lot of jostling to get your
brands on the supermarket shelves, with promotion which led to lower
prices.'

FT  05 AUG 94 / Cost of rail sell-off advice criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has squan-dered enough money to settle the rail dispute on
payments for advice on rail privatisation to a single firm of City
solicitors, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said a total of Pounds 16.8m
had been spent on privatisation advice. One-third of this - Pounds 5.6m -
had gone to solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines. This sum would 'easily settle
the present signalling dispute'.
Mr Dobson published a list of 12 firms to which the Pounds 16.8m had been
paid. He said two firms - Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Putnam Hayes &amp; Bartlett -
received Pounds 2.5m between them for advice on access charging. The outcome
had been 'so unsatisfactory' that the regulator had commissioned new
studies. Dewe Rogerson had been paid Pounds 700,000 for advice on marketing
but the company had 'since been replaced'.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Lloyd's outlines outsider reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday unveiled proposals to expand the membership of
outsiders on its ruling council and to change the voting structure of the
insurance market.
It will ensure that there are six working, six external and six nominated
members of the insurance market on the council from the start of next year.
It will also change from the current position of 'one member, one vote' to a
weighted system. Allocation of votes will be based on the overall
underwriting capacity of each Name, the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the market.
The changes are among the 18 recommendations approved in full by the council
on Wednesday which were made in a report, co-ordinated by Mr Mark Sheldon, a
former president of the Law Society, and completed in June.
The Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names group, gave a 'qualified
welcome' to the proposals, saying that the change to voting rights would
help give a say to Names regardless of their outstanding liabilities.
Separately, the Lloyd's council said yesterday that it was investigating
ways to close off underwriting syndicates that remain 'open' in years since
1985 as a result of outstanding liabilities. Open years cause considerable
uncertainty to Names and make it impossible for them to cease being members
of the market.
The new initiative - if implemented - would extend the principle to more
recent years, covering such liabilities as catastrophe reinsurance.
Lloyd's also said yesterday that the council had invited Mr David Rowland,
the chairman, to extend his term for a year beyond the three years expiring
at the end of next year.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Cable TV deal must be rewritten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Justice Department yesterday flexed its antitrust muscles by forcing
changes in deals in the telecommunications and chemicals sectors.
Officials said BellSouth, the US's largest local telephone company, had
agreed to restructure its Dollars 250m deal to take a 22.5 per cent stake in
Prime Cable, a cable TV operator, so that it would exclude any share of
cable systems in markets where it already provides telephone service.
At the same time, the department said it had agreed a settlement with Bayer,
the German chemicals company, and S C Johnson, the US household products
group, blocking an exclusive licensing deal for a Bayer insecticide that
government lawyers feared would hurt competition in the insecticide market.
Johnson, which has a 45-60 per cent share of the household insecticide
market, had persuaded Bayer in 1988 not to enter the US market but instead
to license cyfluthrin, a new insecticide ingredient that lasted much longer
than previously available compounds, exclusively to them.
Under a consent decree filed yesterday in Rockford, Illinois, Johnson and
Bayer agreed to refrain from dividing up territories for insecticides. Bayer
is required to license cyfluthrin to competing manufacturers on reasonable
terms.
'The cozy arrangement that Bayer and Johnson maintained is unacceptable in a
highly concentrated market such as the one for household insecticides,' said
Mrs Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust
division.
The action echoes the Justice Department's recent moves against Pilkington,
the UK plate glass company, for licensing arrangements that it found to be
anticompetitive.
Under the restructured cable deal Prime will drop cable systems in Atlanta
and in Hickory, North Carolina, from its arrangement with BellSouth. The
latter will be able to own cable systems in Las Vegas, Chicago and some
areas of Texas and Alaska, outside its telephone service area.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Mercosur four limp to customs union
signing - Bruising talks on the South American trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of the four South American countries in the Mercosur trade pact
will today put their names to an agreement removing the remaining obstacles
to the implementation of a customs union on January 1 next year.
Officials have worked all week to iron out the sometimes daunting
differences between them in time for the summit conference in Buenos Aires
today. Although it is only three years since the presidents of Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed a treaty calling for the creation of a
common market by January 1995, reaching this objective has proved a long and
arduous undertaking.
More than once, negotiators threatened to derail the talks, with delegations
threatening to walk out unless their demands were met. When Uruguay
unexpectedly demanded more trade concessions from its partners this week, Mr
Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's outspoken economy minister, retorted: 'Mercosur
is Argentina and Brazil. Mercosur will happen with or without Uruguay.'
The four have failed to attain the aims stated in 1991 - when they signed
the original treaty - of creating a single market in which goods, capital
and people circulate freely. The inability to harmonise their chaotic
economies or compromise over trade and industrial policy has forced them to
adopt less ambitious objectives.
Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of Brazil, Juan Carlos
Wasmosy of Paraguay and Luis Lacalle of Uruguay will today agree to a
mechanism in which all tariff barriers to about 85 per cent of their trade
will be fully lifted on January 1. They will also adopt a common tariff
structure on imports from outside the region for these products.
Argentina and Brazil - which together account for 90 per cent of Mercosur's
gross domestic product and whose trade with each other more than doubled
between 1991 and 1993 from Dollars 3.02bn to Dollars 6.36bn - could not
agree on a similar arrangement for a range of high technology goods, mainly
computers, telecommunications equipment and capital goods. They agreed more
than a year ago that these goods - which account for 15 per cent of their
trade - would receive separate treatment.
However, they could not agree on how this would work. Argentina has
abandoned attempts to build a high-technology industry behind tariff walls.
Instead, it is encouraging its industries to import advanced equipment from
the US and Japan by abolishing all import duties. The Brazilians have a
larger intermediate-technology sector which they wish to build up, and
refused to lower tariffs significantly.
In the end, Argentina has had to bow to the Brazilians' superior bargaining
power and accepted a deal in which high-technology goods are to receive
tariff protection of 14-16 per cent up to 2005. Tariffs for other products
will range from 0 to 20 per cent.
Argentina realises that Brazil holds the key to Mercosur's future. It is by
far the largest economy in the region. Access to its large market is vital
for Argentina's manufacturing industry to gain economies of scale it needs
to survive in international markets. For 60 years, industry has gradually
atrophied since it was sealed off from international competition by trade
barriers.
In exchange, Argentina is understood to have gained concessions from Brazil
which is granting exceptions from Mercosur's free trade rules for large
parts of Argentina's manufacturing industry. Thus, Argentina's struggling
steel, paper, textile, sugar and petrochemicals industries will all be
protected from the full onslaught of larger and more efficient Brazilian
competition. Brazilian imports will receive the same treatment as imports
from outside the Mercosur area for five years.
However, progress over integration has come faster than many had expected.
For two years, headway was nearly impossible as Argentina adopted aggressive
free market policies to stabilise its economy. This unleashed rapid growth
while Brazil sank into hyperinflation and economic depression.
Argentina imposed import restrictions to reduce Brazil's rising trade
surplus. President Menem began flirting with the possibility of joining the
North American Free Trade Agreement. US President Bill Clinton politely
turned him down.
This, plus Brazil's decision to reduce its trade surplus with Argentina by
buying crude oil and wheat, its advance in trade liberalisation and apparent
conversion to free market economics have all cleared the air. Relations
which last year were tense, have relaxed, in spite of personal tension
between Mr Menem and Mr Franco.
The four have also agreed on a controversial accord over the treatment of
free trade zones. Argentina and Brazil have imposed an apparently one-sided
settlement on Paraguay and Uruguay in which their zones will not receive the
same privileges as those in Argentina and Brazil.
This has angered Paraguay and Uruguay, which as junior partners have always
felt at the mercy of the other two. However, as Mr Cavallo crudely reminded
Uruguay, they have little choice but to swallow their pride and accept their
neighbours' decisions.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Germany blocks Astra ulcer drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German drug regulators yesterday decided to ban for a year injectable
versions of Losec, the top-selling anti-ulcer drug of the Swedish
pharmaceuticals group Astra, despite endorsement of the drug's safety by a
European Union expert committee last week.
It was the latest move in a six-month battle which has caused sharp
fluctuations in the share price of Sweden's biggest company by market
capitalisation. Losec is one of the world's top-selling drugs, with 1993
sales of more than Dollars 1.6bn.
The German federal regulatory authority, the BAM, has imposed the ban
because of worries that Losec can cause blindness. It does not apply to
tablet or drip (infusion) versions of Losec.
Astra said it was disappointed with the ruling, but noted that German
doctors would still be able to give critically ill patients intravenous
versions of Losec. The BAM believes infusion treatment by Losec carries less
risk of an overdose than injected forms.
The company gave figures for injectable sales of Losec in Germany last year
at SKr50m (Dollars 6.4m), against total German Losec sales of nearly SKr1bn,
and worldwide sales of SKr12.7bn. Germany is Astra's single largest market.
Astra said German sales of Losec had not been affected by the scare, which
first came to the fore in March. The injectable version of the drug is given
only to extremely sick patients unable to take the drug by any other means.
This adds to the difficulty of ascertaining whether a patient whose
condition worsens is being affected by the drug or by the illness.
According to Astra, no other regulatory authority had expressed any concern
about the drug. 'We will stand behind the very firm opinion issued by the
EU's committee for proprietary medicinal products last week,' it said.
The CPMP said no causal link between the intravenous use of Losec and the
reported side-effects had been established and there was no case for
recommending restrictions on the drug's use.
Losec has been the subject of scrutiny by regulatory authorities around the
world as a result of evidence suggesting there might be some problems with
it. In the UK, for example, it has a 'black triangle' warning doctors to be
especially alert for adverse reactions to the drug from patients.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Mexican growth expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's economy will probably expand by between 2 and 3 per cent this year,
without any additional government measures to stimulate growth, according to
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister.
'The economy is moving,' said Mr Aspe in an interview on Wednesday. 'It
really wants to grow despite the worst possible supply shocks, the worst
political events.' He said figures showing industrial output rose 3.1 per
cent in May indicated recovery was well under way, boosted by rapid
expansion in construction and electricity sectors.
Mexico's economy grew just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, after
contracting in the second half of last year. Mr Aspe blamed low growth last
year on uncertainty over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
and this year on the political instability that culminated in the
assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the
ruling party.
He welcomed recent falls in interest rates, saying market sentiment had
turned in favour of the country. On Wednesday interest rates fell for the
second consecutive week, with investors apparently confident that the
governing party will comfortably win the August 21 presidential election.
The sharp fall in interest rates and strengthening of the peso has led to a
surge in the stock market.
The minister said further reductions in interest rates would be driven by
market conditions, and promised no modification in economic policy until
December, when the new administration takes over. Exchange rate, price and
wage policy would, he indicated, remain unaltered at least until the end of
the year.
'We have an economic policy which is set for good times or bad times,' said
Mr Aspe. 'For this year we will not change.' He appeared to be ruling out a
devaluation of the currency soon after the election, which some have urged
as a way of boosting growth.
Mr Aspe said economic activity was being driven by foreign direct
investment, which was 'growing tremendously', and public investment, which
was higher than in any other year of this government. Despite rising public
spending, he said, the government would meet its target of a balanced budget
this year, and might run a small surplus as a result of higher oil prices.
The Finance Ministry expects to give approval to foreign financial
institutions which applied to open up subsidiaries in Mexico in September or
October, Mr Aspe said.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US unions bring first charges under Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US National Administrative Office, established to handle labour
complaints under the North American Free Trade Agreement, has scheduled its
first hearings on two complaints that US companies are violating Mexican
workers' rights.
Both complaints relate to alleged company attempts to obstruct the
organisation of unions independent of Mexico's governing party. United
Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America has lodged a complaint
against General Electric of the US, and the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters has accused Honeywell, the electronics manufacturer.
US labour unions have considered the cases a test of administration resolve
to deal with examples of worker abuse in Mexico since Nafta was created.
President Bill Clinton has been a vocal advocate of tying workers' rights
and the environment to trade liberalisation agreements.
The unions are now concerned that the hearings, to be held this month,
threaten to become 'mere political window dressing' and claim that the NAO
is making it 'as costly as possible for Mexican workers and their
representatives' to testify.
The Honeywell complaint dates back to late November. Just days after
Congress ratified Nafta. Honeywell sacked 21 production workers from its
electronics parts plant in Chihuahua, Mexico.
According to the complaint, 'Honeywell is part of an employers' association,
which uses spying, electronic surveillance, locked-door interrogations,
threats and firings to keep out independent union groups.' The workers are
paid the minimum Mexican wage of 15 pesos a day - about Pounds 29 a week.
In its response, Honeywell did not deny the charges but argued against the
hearings on technical grounds. The complaint is not covered by Nafta, which
requires hearings only on 'a pattern of non-enforcement by Mexico of Mexican
Labour law'. Furthermore, the actions predate January 1 1994, the effective
date of Nafta.
Mr Ron Carey, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, has
implied that the NAO is trying to avoid adverse publicity for the companies
by holding the hearings at the end of August when 'members of Congress are
vacationing along with many representatives of the media'.
Mr John Hovis, president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers
of America, also said: 'We are extremely disturbed about the location and
manner in which the hearing will be conducted. . . Simply stated, it appears
intentionally designed to be as ineffective as possible.'
A third complaint, against Sony Electronics, is to be filed next week. It
alleges 'persistent violations of workers' rights particularly in the area
of freedom of association'. It says Sony has violated Mexican labour law,
and Mexico has persistently failed to enforce it.

<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia
are today expected to sign protocol agreements leading to their countries'
eventual incorporation as 'associate' members of the four-nation Mercosur
free trade area. Negotiations are expected to be conducted with Mercosur as
a whole, rather than, as Chile earlier proposed, bilaterally with individual
members.
Chile's priority, according to Mr Carlos Figueroa, foreign minister, will be
to ensure the continuation of preferential tariffs from which Chilean
exports to the four Mercosur states - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay - currently benefit. Otherwise, such preferential treatment would
end from next January when Mercosur establishes its external tariff barrier.
Chile and Bolivia, which until recently had watched nervously as Mercosur
took shape, appear to have come to the conclusion that the bloc is too
important to ignore. Latin America is Chile's most dynamic trading partner,
especially in manufactured goods. Last year, Chilean exports to Mercosur
states were worth Dollars 1.1bn, 12 per cent of exports worldwide. Exports
to the bloc have risen by two-thirds since 1991, while those to Argentina
alone leapt last year by 27.6 per cent to Dollars 589m.
Barriers to markets as big as those of Brazil and Argentina, Chile's third
and fourth most important trading partners respectively, could harm Chilean
manufacturing industry, the sector it is most keen to see expand. Most of
Chile's regional investment, especially in the electrical sector, has been
in Argentina.
'As a market, Mercosur could not be more important,' said Mr Figueroa.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Altman clings on after hearings: Deputy Treasury secretary
defies demands that he be sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Altman's position as deputy secretary of the Treasury may best be
described as shaky but not stirred. That, if anything, is an improvement on
the start of this week, when the main question in Washington was not whether
he would resign but how soon.
In over 15 hours of testimony covering two days, he frequently said he would
not resign because he had misled Congress or for any actions concerning the
investigation of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas savings bank owned by a
partner of the Clinton family in the Whitewater land development.
On Wednesday night he heard President Bill Clinton express confidence,
though the president conceded has was 'upset' to discover that Mr Altman had
removed himself from overseeing the Madison case. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
Treasury secretary, also found 'no intent to harm' though, with hindsight,
he would have preferred Mr Altman to have excused himself because of his
friendship with the Clintons.
On the other hand, two Democratic senators - Don Riegle of Michigan and
Richard Shelby of Alabama - have as good as joined the Republican chorus
demanding his resignation. Senator Kit Bond of Missouri came very close on
Wednesday to accusing Mr Altman of perjury in front of Congress.
The thrust of Republican questioning at committee hearings late Wednesday
and yesterday remained to try to find harder evidence of Mr Altman's
intervention in the Madison case. In grilling Ms Margaret Williams, chief of
staff to Mrs Hillary Clinton, they also sought to implicate the first lady.
But, in the absence of damaging revelations, it may make more political
sense for the White House to stick with Mr Altman in spite of his tarnished
credibility with Congress. This is because the presidential record of not
standing by those he has nominated or appointed is already too long for
comfort.
The most prominent case was that of Ms Lani Guinier, dropped last summer as
nominee to run the civil rights division of the Justice Department. Little
inclination to fight for Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, under consideration to be
attorney general, was shown when their 'nannygate' problems emerged.
Some Washington experts think Mr Altman was aware of this factor and that
his defiance was, if only in part, calculated to dare the White House to
pull the plug. But his presumed goal of succeeding Mr Bentsen is long
abandoned.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Gore to rescue of ethanol policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vice President Al Gore has been forced to rescue a key administration
environmental policy advocating the use of grain alcohol as a cleaner
burning petrol additive.
Mr Gore cast his tie-breaking vote in the Senate on Wednesday to defeat a
bill that would have stopped the US Environmental Protection Agency
requiring that one-third of petrol sold in big cities contain ethanol - a
grain alcohol - or other renewable additives.
The bill produced a tumultuous five-hour debate between farm-state senators,
backed by the agricultural lobby, and senators from oil-producing states and
the north-east, supported by the oil industry.
President Bill Clinton personally lobbied members to defeat the bill, but in
the end the Senate deadlocked 50-50, requiring Mr Gore's rare action.
Mr J. Bennet Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who proposed the bill, claimed
ethanol was not efficient and the EPA policy amounted to a hand-out to the
corn industry and 'gigantic flim-flam to the American people'.
Mr Bob Kerry, a Nebraska Democrat, responded that requiring ethanol
additives would 'create American jobs' and boost the economy.
The debate over ethanol has been raging for years as the EPA sought to
determine which oxygenates - oxygen-bearing additives that burn cleaner -
should be used in petrol to improve air quality in big cities. Two of the
most common oxygenates are ethanol, produced from corn, and methanol, a wood
alcohol most commonly extracted from natural gas.
Mr Clinton, siding with the farm lobby, said during his election campaign
that he favoured the use of ethanol and the EPA's ruling in June sought to
make good on Mr Clinton's promise.
EPA officials have been forced to admit ethanol may not reduce greenhouse
gas emissions in the short term, because producing ethanol from corn
requires large amounts of energy and releases greenhouse gases.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Business bankrolls Zedillo: As the PRI embraces free trade,
the rich have endorsed its candidate - Mexican Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The head of Mexico's largest bank recently issued a stark warning: political
stability and lower interest rates could only be achieved with a victory of
the governing Institutional Revolutionary party in the presidential election
on August 21. Mr Roberto Hernandez, head of Grupo Financiero
Banamex-Accival, was attacked for his assertion that Mexico was not ready
for a change of government. But he was unrepentant, repeating the same
message a few days later to a group of reporters.
Once unwilling to participate openly in politics, Mexico's wealthiest
businessmen have shed their inhibitions in this presidential campaign. They
have come out strongly in favour of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the governing party
candidate, offering him tens of millions of dollars in contributions, and in
some cases campaigning on his behalf around the country.
Businessmen from medium-sized and small companies, many of whom have
suffered from the trade liberalisation of the past decade, are generally
divided between the PRI and the pro-business National Action party. But
those who back the ruling party have played a much bigger part in its
campaign than in previous elections, joining 40 odd PRI 'business cells'
around the country, collecting economic proposals for the party platform.
'When business supported us before, it was very secret, with private dinners
and so on,' says Mr Antonio Arguelles, in charge of PRI campaign spending.
'This is the first ever the private sector has come out openly and
campaigned for us.'
The new influence of the business community is largely a consequence of the
economic and social reforms of the past decade. As the PRI has buried its
statist, interventionist past, and embraced private enterprise and free
trade, the private sector has become a more natural ideological ally than
the labour unions and peasant organisations that once dominated the party.
Likewise, as the government has withdrawn from the economy, the private
sector's power has increased, and the need to take its view into account has
grown. 'We are seeing our influence climb as the economy and the political
system opens up,' says Mr Victor Manuel Terrones, head of Canacintra, the
small business chamber.
Mr Terrones says Mr Zedillo's economic proposals drew heavily on suggestions
by members of his organisation, many of whom say the government has been
indifferent to their problems. Some of the Zedillo economic proposals - such
as tax breaks for the industrial sector, greater government involvement in
worker training, and subsidised interest rates - read like a charter for
small business.
Recent political reforms making it difficult for the government to finance
the PRI at former levels have raised business's influence still further, as
the party has had to seek private contributions to replace state funding.
The cosy relationship is not to everyone's liking. Peasant and workers'
sectors in the PRI resent losing power to a group which is not formally
affiliated to the party, and which supports policies - such as overturning
the federal labour law - that would reduce their influence.
Opposition parties complain that the PRI attracts private sector support by
offering businessmen lucrative contracts or restricting competition. Last
year the PRI asked 30 of the country's richest businessmen to donate Dollars
25m (Pounds 16m) each to the party at a dinner in which President Carlos
Salinas was the guest of honour.
'The leading businessmen - most, not all - have grown rich in the shadow of
the political system,' says Mr Juan Sanchez Navarro, an executive with Grupo
Modelo, Mexico's largest beer company. 'This will likely continue with
Zedillo. In this sense support for the ruling party reflects their economic
interests.'
The key link between Mr Zedillo and the business sector is Mr Gilberto
Borja, head of ICA, Mexico's largest construction company. Mr Borja has held
more than 50 pro-Zedillo meetings in his house in recent months, and become
a central official in the party's campaign team.
The PRI had raised Dollars 220m by the end of June, according to a party
official. Legislative provisions limiting individual contributions have been
circumvented with contributions in cash, in kind or by giving through third
parties.
The money is vital to the PRI machinery. While there is a supposed spending
limit of about Dollars 40m in the campaign, party officials say this is in
practice side-stepped. Many campaign workers, including those at the highest
levels, are paid part or all of their salary in cash; others are paid for
directly by businessmen, which would not count as a campaign expenditure;
gifts in kind are not properly accounted; and suspiciously large discounts
are earned on media advertising.

FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: White House plan to revive fast-track
negotiating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration will next week seek to include a fast-track
negotiating authority in the Uruguay Round implementing legislation so it
can negotiate additional free trade agreements with Chile and other eligible
trading partners. Fast-track authority allows the executive branch to
negotiate trade agreements which Congress promises not to amend.
The administration's request for a seven-year fast-track negotiating
authority has been in trouble for weeks, and a compromise proposal to a
joint committee is seen as its last hope of resurrecting the authority.
Senator Daniel Moynihan, the committee chairman, on Tuesday stunned the
Washington trade establishment when he pronounced the renewal of the
negotiating authority 'dead' for this year. Republicans oppose
administration plans to include environmental and labour provisions in
future free trade pacts. Many Democrats are refusing to agree to a
fast-track authority without inclusion of labour and environment language.
The Senate finance committee, writing the implementing legislation, has
refused to approve a compromise 2 1/2 -year fast-track authority.
But administration officials said they would seek to insert it when
representatives of the finance committee and the House ways and means
committee meet to work out final implementation of Uruguay Round
legislation. There is concern that a failure to get fast-track will damage
the administration's credibility.
The finance committee also refused to go along with an administration plan,
supported by the textile and apparel industries, to alter the way rules of
origin are calculated. It rejected a proposal to revise current rules to
designate the place of origin as the place where a product is sewn rather
than cut.
The committee extended for five years the Super 301 law, which permits the
US to list unfair trade practices with the objective of erasing trade
barriers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Peng, a Chinese-Australian businessman, was charged with corruption
at a Shenzhen court yesterday, nine months after he was detained, the Hong
Kong China News Agency said. If found guilty, he faces a minimum prison term
of 10 years and possibly the death penalty.
'The people's procuratorate of Shenzhen City has finished the investigation
of Peng Jiandong (his Chinese name), the former chairman of Shenzhen Yuan Ye
Company,' the Beijing-controlled agency said.
The charges stated that between February and June 1989 Mr Peng embezzled
Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 915,000) in loans from a Chinese bank.
He is accused of switching the funds, apparently borrowed to finance
corporate investments in Australia, to his personal account, using part to
pay for his family's emigration to Australia.
His wife, Mrs Lina Peng, says the Dollars 1.4m was spent on investment in
Australia on behalf of Champaign Industrial Holdings. A textiles, property
and trading group and the first Sino-foreign joint venture listed on a
Chinese stock exchange, it was formed by converting Shenzhen Yuan Ye into a
joint venture controlled by Mr Peng's Panco Industrial, a Hong
Kong-registered private company.
'The investment made on behalf of Champaign had nothing to do with the Peng
family emigration to Australia, which took place subsequently. Mr Peng
emigrated on the strength of his personal funds and these were not part of
the Dollars 1.4m,' Mrs Peng added.
She has urged the Australian government to ensure her husband (who has not
been allowed to hire a lawyer nor been given any opportunity to defend
himself) has a fair trial in China.
Mr Peng's plight began last October, when he was picked up from the Mandarin
Oriental Hotel in Macao by police and handed over to the Chinese police.
Canberra has raised the case with Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister,
and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.
Mr Peng appears to have attracted government attention through his business
dealings. In early 1992, after an abortive attempt to sell Panco (then the
owner of about 51 per cent of Champaign), Mr Peng was negotiating with the
Shenzhen office of the People's Bank over the sale of nearly half of Panco's
interest in Champaign. Mr Peng says these talks were called off by the
Shenzhen government and, subsequently, the central bank.
Champaign's bank accounts were frozen and the People's Bank stated no bank
would be allowed to realise its security against Panco's mortgaged Champaign
shares, rendering previously secured loans unsecured and prompting the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to sue Champaign for recovery
of a Yn20m (Pounds 1.5m) loan.
Last September a meeting of Champaign shareholders, alleged by Mr Peng to be
inquorate, voted to confiscate Panco's shareholding in the company and
divide it between Shenzhen Municipal Development (Holdings) and Hong Kong
China Project.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Nigerian general strike suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday suspended its general strike to
enable the military government to negotiate with union leaders without
duress but will resume its action on Monday if opposition leader Moshood
Abiola is not released.
Oil workers, however, who have forced a 20 per cent cut in Nigerian
production over the past week, are set to continue their strike.
The NLC has been reluctant to confront the government in the past 12 months.
But last week it decided to call the general strike - which started on
Wednesday - in protest at the arrest of Mr Abiola, who faces treason charges
after declaring himself president on the strength of his presumed victory in
last year's annulled general election.
NLC leaders said that they would re-convene tomorrow but that if the
negotiations with the government in Abuja had not secured Mr Abiola's
release, the strike would be resumed.
The core of anti-government protest, which is strongest among members of Mr
Abiola's Yoruba tribe in the south-west, has been the crippling strike by
the two oil workers' unions and this is set to continue.
Nupeng, the blue collar union, was the only one of the 41 unions of the NLC
to strike a month ago, backed up by the senior staff association, Pengassan,
made up of managers and engineers. Their strike is to press demands not only
for elected civilian rule but also for a fairer share of national wealth in
the oil-producing areas and an end to government under-investment in the oil
industry, which has led to thousands of job losses.
Both Nupeng and Pengassan have made clear that they will not end their
strike until the government meets their main demands, which go much further
than the NLC's position.
The stoppage has almost halted fuel distribution in the south-west, which
accounts for 50 per cent of industrial and domestic demand, and has
disrupted production of crude oil, Nigeria's major export, cutting output by
about 25 per cent. Staff at Brass River oil terminal operated by Agip were
evacuated from the facility yesterday in apparent compliance with the
strike.
The NLC's general strike has had vastly differing support across the
country. It has brought a total stoppage in Lagos and the other cities of
the south-west, where factories, petrol stations and banks were already shut
due to earlier strikes. In the east and in north of the country, most areas
are working normally. In the south-west, suspension of the NLC strike is
unlikely to have much effect today because it is a half-day for Moslems,
transport to work is scarce, many plants are idle due to lack of power or
spare parts, and workers may fear going out in the streets after recent
violence.
The test of the NLC will be on Monday. If it secures Mr Abiola's release,
some unions in the south could break away from the NLC and continue to
strike for an early end to military rule. If Mr Abiola is not released, the
NLC will be seen as stooges manipulated by the government.

France yesterday accused Britain, Germany and the US of failing to crack
down on fundamentalist opponents of the Algiers government on their soil.
The Dutch, meanwhile, closed their Algiers embassy and Belgium urged its
nationals to leave the country after the killing of five French police and
consular officials on Wednesday.
As the bodies of the French victims were returned home, Mr Charles Pasqua,
interior minister, said Britain, Germany and the US had failed to act when
tipped off about the activities of fundamentalists.
'They have within their borders people who claim to be official
representatives of the FIS (Islamic Salvation Front),' he said. 'We have
already made diplomatic representations to these countries and we will make
more.'
Mr Pasqua said seven Moslem militants in France had been moved to a remote
eastern village. The seven are reported to have been brought together in the
village of Folembray, after having been under house arrest in various parts
of France.
In The Hague, the foreign ministry said the Dutch embassy in Algiers, where
staff had already been reduced to three, would close temporarily because of
fears for their safety.
Belgium strongly advised its nationals to leave the former French territory
and said all travel there should be postponed because of the worsening
security situation.
Violence has grown since the Algerian authorities in January 1992 suspended
elections that the FIS was poised to win. More than 50 foreigners and
thousands of Algerians have been killed since then.
Mr Anwar Haddam, a FIS representative in Washington, yesterday denounced
France's support of Algeria's 'military regime'.
Mr Pasqua said the Algerian government was 'not a model of democracy', but
said that France would help it in its fight against 'terrorism' and that
there was no such thing as 'good and bad terrorists'.
The US State Department said the latest killings 'only reinforce the concern
we have that the (Algerian) government should broaden its political
dialogue' to opposition groups that reject violence.
France, like the US, has been urging Algeria's military-led government into
dialogue with its moderate opponents. But France has found itself sucked
further into the crisis in its former colony than the US and less able to
articulate its policy of reluctant and conditional support for the Algerian
government as a 'lesser evil' than emergence of a fundamentalist Islamic
state.
Le Monde newspaper yesterday suggested that France and the west use economic
aid as a lever to force the Algiers government into political concessions.
But the IMF, which gave Algeria a standby credit in May, and the Paris Club,
which rescheduled its official debt in June, are not readily suited to such
political bargaining.

FT  05 AUG 94 / US and N Korea climb back in the ring: Resumption of talks
today in Geneva on nuclear issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and North Korea will resume high-level talks in Geneva today on full
inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear programme in return for possible US
diplomatic ties and economic aid. However, new uncertainties will cloud the
negotiations, , suspended on July 8 after only one day because of the death
of North Korea's President Kim Il-sung.
The main question is whether North Korea has changed its basic policy on the
nuclear issue under its new leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, the late president's
son. The talks are expected provide the first significant indication of Mr
Kim's willingness to solve the nuclear dispute and proceed with economic
reforms opening the country to foreign investment.
'Our policy remains consistent,' said Mr Ho Jong, former North Korean
ambassador to the United Nations and a member of the Geneva delegation led
by Mr Kang Sok-ju, the first vice foreign minister. But there is still
concern that Mr Kim may adopt a hard line in order to win the backing of
military for his assumption of power which has not yet been completed.
Moreover, the one month delay in the talks occasioned by the president's
death has increased pressure to find a quick solution. North Korea has
threatened to start reprocessing spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade
plutonium at the end of the month if an accord is not achieved soon.
Pyongyang claims that the spent fuel rods, which are being stored in a
cooling tank under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, must be reprocessed soon for safety reasons.
But the reprocessing of the fuel, which could produce plutonium for four or
five nuclear bombs, would break North Korea's promise to freeze its nuclear
activities. The US has threatened to break off the talks in response and
seek UN economic sanctions, an action Pyongyang has said amounts to an act
of war.
The US has disputed the urgency of reprocessing the spent fuel rods,
believing that North Korea is using the issue as a negotiating tactic.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state and chief US delegate at
the Geneva talks, said: 'The first order of business for us with the (North
Korean) representatives on Friday will be to address that issue of time and
push it aside for a number of months.'
The US has suggested that North Korea transport the nuclear fuel to a third
country for processing, but Pyongyang opposes the idea.
Washington appears willing to grant several concessions to North Korea if it
agrees to full nuclear inspections. These could include the establishment of
liaison offices as a first step to full diplomatic relations, which
Pyongyang regards as a guarantee of US non-aggression. It has also suggested
that it would support the replacement of North Korea's plutonium-producing
graphite reactors with safer light water ones that would be supplied by
Russia, Japan or South Korea at a cost of at least Dollars 1bn.
Several other problems remain in concluding a comprehensive agreement,
including procedural issues on how actions by both sides would be
co-ordinated.
North Korea is also refusing a demand by the International Atomic Energy
Agency to be allowed to make special inspections of two suspected nuclear
waste dump sites to determine if Pyongyang has previously withdrawn
plutonium from its 5MW reactor to make at least one nuclear bomb.
The US has stipulated that North Korea must accept the special inspections
in return for concessions. The IAEA request triggered the nuclear dispute 16
months ago, prompting North Korea to threaten to withdraw from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
Another potential source of trouble is the expected US insistence that
diplomatic ties between Washington and Pyongyang be linked to progress on
relations between North and South Korea. A proposed summit between the two
Koreas was postponed following President Kim's death and tensions have
increased in recent weeks as the two countries have engaged in a fierce
propaganda war.
The linkage between North-South Korean relations and US-North Korea ties is
meant to prevent Pyongyang from using the nuclear issue to drive a wedge
between Washington and Seoul over the future defence of South Korea.
Pyongyang has repeatedly claimed that the solution to the nuclear dispute
lies in an agreement with the US, since it regards South Korea as being an
American 'puppet state'.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Food crisis for 34m Africans: UN body blames civil strife
for continent's famine and shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Famine and severe food shortages threaten more than 34m people in
sub-Saharan Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warns today in
a report which blames civil strife rather than bad weather for the
continent's hunger.
Intractable wars plague Liberia, Angola, Sudan and Somalia. In Zaire the
government has all but collapsed. The fragile agricultural economies of
Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya are buckling under the pressure of millions of
refugees, while Rwanda has given the world the worst humanitarian
catastrophe of modern times.
The FAO says Africa is submerged in a 'perpetual food crisis'. Twenty-five
years ago the region needed less than 5 per cent of the world's food aid;
today 47 per cent of global famine relief is channelled to sub-Saharan
Africa. It is a region that cannot afford the cost of commercial food
imports at a time when global surpluses earmarked for food aid are also
diminishing.
'Latest estimates show some 25 per cent of food-aid needs of the affected
African countries are not yet covered by pledges, and deliveries fall
seriously short of the pledged assistance,' the report warns.
But the FAO says food aid is not a long-term solution for Africa. It
emphasises the need for increased agricultural productivity which, it
admits, is impossible to implement in the growing number of countries
consumed by civil strife.
An exodus of 2.5m Hutus following the victory of Tutsi-led guerrillas in
Rwanda's civil war has created a refugee population entirely dependent on
food hand-outs for survival.
Inside Rwanda, unharvested crops are rotting in the fields. Aid workers fear
that if refugees do not return by September they will miss planting next
year's crop.
'Without an adequate and timely response to relief needs, a large section of
the Rwandan population will face starvation in the coming months,' the
report says.
The Rwandan crisis has increased the number of refugees and displaced
populations in sub-Saharan Africa to about 22m people. Most of these huge
migrations, the FAO says, have been caused by civil strife.
The uprooting of entire communities disrupts food production; creates
long-term dependence on food aid; and destabilises food markets in the areas
where refugees settle, by increasing demand and prices for local produce.
Those who can return home often remain dependent on food aid before they can
resume normal farming activities.

Taiwan and China resolved a long-standing fishery dispute yesterday as
supporters of Taiwanese independence burnt a Chinese flag (right) outside
the building where the agreement was reached, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The two rivals could sign their first accord in six rounds of talks when the
meetings end next week.
The breakthrough came on the first of four days' talks. China conceded
Taiwan's demand that fishing disputes involving intrusions into each other's
territorial waters should be handled by agencies with law enforcement
powers, officials said.
On Tuesday, China sent a letter to Taiwan, complaining that Taipei's
military had opened fire on Chinese fishing boats when they entered waters
around the Taiwan-held island of Quemoy, killing or injuring mainland
fishermen. Talks over the next three days are expected to focus on
repatriation of hijackers and illegal immigrants.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Indonesian journalists lament brief life of Suharto's
political openness: Continued protests at the recent banning of three
publications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 100 Indonesian journalists demonstrated in Jakarta yesterday against
the continued ban on three prominent publications, including the country's
respected current affairs magazine, Tempo.
The protest was one of a number of small but vociferous demonstrations that
have taken place since the clampdown six weeks ago on freedom of expression.
Letters to editors deploring the forced closure of Tempo, Editor, another
magazine, and DeTik, a weekly tabloid, appear regularly in much of the
Indonesian press.
Complaints have even come from China and Japan, where Tempo, which was
enjoyed for its innovative use of language, was an important tool in
teaching Indonesian language.
Tempo, Editor and DeTik had their publishing licences revoked after their
critical reporting of the government's planned Dollars 1.1bn acquisition of
a fleet of former East German warships.
Although the government never said as much, it is generally accepted that
the publications lost their licences because they exposed high-level
political wrangling over the cost and efficiency of the warships.
Although it had a circulation of only 200,000, the 23-year-old Tempo was
widely respected as Indonesia's equivalent of Time magazine. It suffered a
temporary ban in 1982 for its reporting on the controversies surrounding
that year's election campaign. Tempo's latest ban came as a surprise
because, comparatively speaking, it tended to toe the government line,
although it had of late become more daring.
The much younger tabloid DeTik had a subscription base of 400,000 and
growing when it was banned. Much of its appeal lay in reporting that tested
the limits of President's Suharto's promises of political openness.
With the ministry of information continuing to issue threats of closure to
other publications, Indonesians are now re-evaluating the future of their
country's era of fledgling political openness.
An atmosphere conducive to open political debate was initiated by President
Suharto himself after he was re-elected to his sixth five-year term in
office last year. In speeches after his re-election, he called for the
'democratisation' of the country. Magazines and newspapers immediately
picked up on this by reporting on subjects such as human rights in East
Timor, the president's succession and ethnic Chinese domination of the
economy, all previously taboo.
The most recent threats were received last week by the leading daily
newspaper Kompas and Sinar Pagi, Sinar magazine, the English-language daily
The Jakarta Post and Indonesia Business Weekly, a two-year-old
English-language business magazine.
They were ticked off for their frank reporting of the media bans and for
articles on military violence against protesters in the East Timorese
capital of Dili.
While many Indonesians regard the bans as a sign that political openness has
ended, others are less pessimistic.
'These kinds of threats and bans are a cyclical thing,' said an editor of
one of the recently threatened publications. 'We seem to go forward one step
and then two steps backward as far as political openness is concerned. For
the time being we just have to lie low.'
The crux of the problem appears to lie in President Suharto's vagueness
about what the government would tolerate from the domestic media. While
President Suharto may have encouraged political openness and a more 'open'
society in his speeches last year, what he says these days is also peppered
with subtle warnings that openness should be accompanied by a sense of
responsibility.
'In an effort to open ourselves, we want our national press to enjoy freedom
but at the same time shoulder responsibility,' Mr Suharto said at the
opening ceremony of the Indonesian Newspaper Publishers Association held
soon after the bans. Press freedom 'should be aimed at improving the quality
of life for Indonesians, both individually and collectively', he said.
As long as guidelines are cloaked in such vague terminology, press bans and
a self-imposed restraint on political and social debate can be expected to
be a regular feature of Indonesian life.
'If this continues we don't know what kind of a press we will have to match
the demands of society,' said Eros Jarot, editor of DeTik. 'Indonesia's
economic policies are very liberal but anything to do with politics appears
to be going in the opposite direction.'

<TEXT>
The Law Reform Commission in Hong Kong is urging the government to adopt
legal controls on collection and use of information about individuals,
arguing that failure to do so could cripple the colony's status as an
international trading centre. The government, is examining the Commission's
proposals and expects to decide in the next two months.
Although some protection is offered by existing legislation and a voluntary
code, the Commission believes the absence of comprehensive legal protection
could prove a handicap from 1996, when it is expected the European Union
will require its member states to control transfer of personal data.
Mr Stuart Stoker, secretary of the Law Reform Commission (a body chaired by
the attorney-general), said anecdotal evidence exists of UK companies being
prohibited by data protection regulations from transferring data overseas
because the specified country lacked protection. The Commission is
recommending:
The appointment of a privacy commissioner to oversee the proposed scheme;
Legal regulation of all data relating to the individual; all such data to be
protected by reasonable security safeguards;
The right of individuals to obtain and, where necessary, correct personal
data. Where damage has ensued, individuals may be entitled to compensation;
a ban on passing such data to a third party.
The proposals would stop data holders passing lists to direct marketing
companies, and would allow redress to those penalised by inaccurate or
information. The government is one of the biggest holders of personal data,
but substantial banks are held by insurance companies and financial houses.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Scotland Yard probe into Gibraltar 'fraud'

<TEXT>
Britain's Scotland Yard and Danish police are investigating allegations of a
Pounds 5.4m fraud linked to a large property development in Gibraltar.
Mr John Blackburn Gittings, the colony's attorney-general, resigned on
Wednesday night, 11 months before completion of his three-year term in
office, citing difference of views between himself and the governor of
Gibraltar, Sir John Chapple. It is understood the resignation follows
growing differences of opinion between Mr Blackburn Gittings and the British
government. For example, Mr Blackburn Gittings was opposed to the
continuation of the fraud investigation, it emerged yesterday.
Although appointed by London, Mr Blackburn Gittings had also acted as legal
adviser to ministers in Gibraltar during a period of growing tension between
the local government and London.
A criminal lawyer who is unaccustomed to the complexities of colonial
politics, Mr Blackburn Gittings is thought to have concluded that conflicts
of interest had left him with no alternative but to resign.
There has been a long-running police investigation into alleged
irregularities arising out of the multi-million property development
financed by Baltica Finans, the Danish finance company. It is understood
that the attorney-general had come to the view that police should be told by
the British government to call off their investigation because of
insufficient evidence.
This is not a view shared by British and Danish police, who have uncovered a
series of unusual money transactions and taken evidence from former Baltica
employees alleging payments to Gibraltarian ministers.
Britain is meanwhile anxious to be seen within the EU to be adequately
supervising the colony's affairs by pursuing any allegations of corruption.
The Swiss Justice Ministry said yesterday it had received requests for legal
assistance from the Danish government and the attorney-general of Gibraltar
relating to the Baltica affair in the spring of 1993.
The Swiss authorities agreed to provide documentation on accounts held in
banks in the northern Swiss towns of Soluthurn, Grenchen and Bern.
Police are investigating whether there are any links between the accounts
and a trust in Liechtenstein called the GDP Foundation, which is alleged to
have held monies on behalf of the Gibraltar government.
Four Danes, including a former employee of Baltica, are standing trial in
Denmark after being charged with defrauding a local construction company,
JPC, which was involved in the Gibraltar property development. The charges
relate to payments totalling Pounds 5.4m.
The former employee has testified that a payment of Pounds 250,000 was made
to a Gibraltar minister in connection with the property development. A
former JPC employees has testified that a further payment of Pounds 400,000
was made to the minister.
The Gibraltar government has refused to answer questions relating to the
Baltica affair. But the chief minister, Mr Joe Bossano, said: 'There are
allegations of fraud perpetrated by Danes against Danes involving Danish
money. There is no Gibraltarian money involved.'

Greek air traffic controllers, whose five-month go-slow has caused long
delays in aircraft arrivals and departures, have said they cannot guarantee
the safety of flights. After a union meeting, at which the controllers voted
to continue with their work-to-rule protest in pursuit of higher pay and a
more modern air traffic control system, an official said 'the safety level
of flights is at a critical point' and that employees were not responsible
for this. However, a Transport Ministry official warned the government could
force the controllers to return to their normal work rate. News reports have
speculated that this might mean putting them under Defence Ministry
jurisdiction, which makes it illegal for them to strike.

A senior Russian general who supports military dictatorship and backs a
muscular role for the Russian army in the former Soviet republics is set to
lose his job, military officials said yesterday. The predicted removal of
Gen Alexander Lebed, commander of Russian forces in the break-away
Transdnestr region of Moldova, suggests the Kremlin is seeking to remove
hardliners from the military. However, other Russian military officers
denied Gen Lebed was being forced out. Relations between Gen Lebed, who has
said he will not stay in the military if he is removed from his post, and
the Kremlin reached a nadir last month after the general told Izvestia, the
Russian daily newspaper, that Russia invited attack through its military
weakness and described all Russian politicians, including President Boris
Yeltsin, as 'minuses'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican politician and intellectual who was a
leading figure in post-war Italy, died in Rome yesterday aged 69. He was a
contemporary historian, newspaper editor and latterly bon vivant elder
statesman. His body was brought to lie in state in the Senate, where he was
a life senator and speaker from 1987 until this year. Mr Spadolini, the
first prime minister from outside the Christian Democrat party under the
post-war republic, was appointed in 1981 to head a five-party coalition when
Italy's political establishment had been shaken by the scandal of the P2
secret masonic lodge, a parallel power structure. His strong personality
held the coalition together for 405 days before being reshuffled. It then
lasted another 82 days. Three times a minister in different governments, he
latterly played an important role as speaker of the Senate, enlivening
debate with his erudition and crusty humour. He challenged the new
Berlusconi government to retain the speaker's post and lost by a single
vote. Mr Spadolini was born in Florence and began his public life teaching
history. He switched to journalism, eventually becoming editor of the
prestigious Corriere della Sera, and entered politics comparatively late, in
1972, on being elected as an independent senator in the Republican lists. He
took on the leadership of the Republican party in 1979 on the death of Mr
Ugo La Malfa and held the post for eight years.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary has abandoned its policy of gradual currency depreciation by
ordering an 8 per cent devaluation of the forint, effective today. The
authorities said the devaluation, the largest in more than three years, was
to compensate for the loss of competitiveness. The central bank had
maintained a policy of appreciation in real terms of the forint to damp
inflation but the strong currency, compounded by drought and west European
recession, led to an export drop of 17 per cent in 1993 and a current
account deficit of Dollars 3.46bn (Pounds 2.23bn), or 10 per cent of GDP.
Many banks, particularly western-owned ones, have braved out the central
bank's increase of the key overnight repo rate to 31 per cent. Foreign
exchange dealers estimate that banks maintained open positions of about
Ft20bn-Ft25bn (Pounds 127.5m-Pounds 159.4m) on which they now stand to make
windfall profits at the expense of the central bank. Western joint ventures
which swapped hard-currency into forint borrowings and advanced imports are
also well-placed to gain.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday withdrew permission for Russia to post a military attache
in Stockholm and protested strongly to Moscow for continuing to employ a
Swedish spy originally recruited by the Soviet intelligence services. Senior
officials said Mr Stig Bergling, a Soviet double agent who escaped from a
Swedish jail in 1987 but who returned home unexpectedly this week, had
served as an officer in the GRU military intelligence services in Lebanon
until recently. They accused the Russian authorities of denying knowledge of
Mr Bergling to Swedish officials - including Mr Carl Bildt, the prime
minister.
'This shows that the structures and thinking of the old era are still alive
in Russia,' Mr Bildt said. 'They ought to have admitted what happened in a
democratic spirit.' The prime minister added, however, that the case posed
no threat to links between Sweden and Russia. Mr Bergling's sudden
reappearance revived Sweden's most serious cold war spy scandal. Although
neutral, Sweden has always had a strong military which, recent revelations
show, has had contacts with US and Nato forces. As a senior security
services officer, Mr Bergling apparently passed on information on Sweden's
military planning. He was jailed for life in 1979 after being caught by
Israeli agents but escaped.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Pressure mounts on Irish coalition: Labour says beef probe
has 'serious implications' for partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on Ireland's coalition government continues to mount after comments
by the chairman of the junior coalition partner that there are 'serious
implications for the coalition' in the findings of an inquiry into
irregularities in the Irish beef industry.
The remarks by Mr Jim Kemmy, the Labour chairman, have frustrated attempts
by Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the deputy
prime minister and leader of the Labour party, to play down the importance
of the report.
Mr Reynolds, who leads the Fianna Fail half of the coalition, is criticised
in the report for his handling of the granting of IPounds 100m (Pounds 99m)
of export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq six years ago. Much of
the cover went to the Goodman Group, Ireland's biggest beef processor.
The question of Labour remaining in coalition will be discussed this month
at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, said Mr Kemmy. The Labour
chairman added that the assertion by Mr Reynolds that he had been 'totally
vindicated' by the report 'insulted the intelligence of the public'.
The inquiry found that Mr Reynolds had the right to grant the credits if he
believed it was in the national interest, but also pointed out that 'the
national interest would also appear to require that before exposing the
state to a potential liability in excess of IPounds 100m, a more detailed
investigation or analysis of the benefits to the economy of such decisions .
. . should have been carried out.'
Such an investigation might have found that much of the beef which was to be
exported under the credit insurance was either not Irish or came from
European Union intervention stocks, according to the report. 'The benefits
to the Irish economy arriving from such exports were illusory rather than
real,' concluded the chairman of the inquiry, Mr Justice Liam Hamilton.
However, Mr Justice Hamilton concluded there was no evidence that the export
credit insurance was granted because of political favouritism. 'There is no
evidence to suggest that either the Taoiseach (prime minister, Mr Charles
Haughey) at the time or the minister for industry and commerce (Mr Reynolds)
was personally close to Mr Larry Goodman, chairman of the Goodman Group, or
that Mr Goodman had any political association with either of them or the
party they represented.'
Mr Spring has adopted a conciliatory approach after at first issuing a
response that implicitly criticised Mr Reynolds. Mr Spring called the whole
export credit insurance affair 'a major failure of public policy'.
But he subsequently identified 'the government of the day' as being
responsible rather than singling out Mr Reynolds, who was minister for
industry and commerce at the time and approved the granting of the export
credit insurance. Mr Spring also denied that his criticism of Mr Reynolds
would damage the coalition and said that the coalition 'has a serious agenda
of work . . . .'
Mr Reynolds said he accepted the findings of the inquiry and looked forward
enthusiastically to dealing with them when the Irish parliament was recalled
at the end of the month, specifically to discuss the report.
But publication of the report comes at a time when the Labour party is still
licking its wounds after a poor showing in the European elections and in
opinion polls and many Labour MPs who gained seats in the wave of
anti-Fianna Fail sentiments in the 1991 elections are increasingly
uncomfortable. The party is also being attacked for supporting the hard line
being taken by the management of Team Aer Lingus, the state-owned aircraft
maintenance company, with its unions.
Last month, the coalition was embarrassed by revelations that Irish
passports were granted to the family of a Palestinian businessman who
invested Pounds 1m in Mr Reynolds' family business.
The next real test of the coalition's cohesion will be its handling of
attempts by the Goodman group to avail of a tax amnesty to settle
liabilities uncovered during the tribunal investigations. In the course of
the inquiry it was discovered that the Goodman group made tax repayments of
more than IPounds 8.5m to its employees between 1983 and 1990.
The company is now trying to settle the liability under a general tax
amnesty announced in 1993. The government has chosen to leave it to the
revenue commissioners to decide if Goodman qualifies for the amnesty but
there is growing public and political pressure on Labour to oppose the
granting of the amnesty.
It will not be forgotten that the setting up of the inquiry in 1991 followed
the collapse into examinership (administration) of the Goodman Group, when
allegations of irregularities by Goodman companies were made in the media
and the Irish parliament, including by Mr Spring.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Yeltsin dismisses draft law to build up oil investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ponderous Russian efforts to write a law to create a transparent legal basis
for foreign investment in the oil sector received a setback yesterday when
President Boris Yeltsin made clear he would oppose a draft law being
prepared by parliament.
Mr Yeltsin told the state duma, or lower house of parliament, that the oil
and gas law due to pass through the house after the recess contravened the
constitution and showed an 'anti-reform approach'.
His objections - though aimed at making the law more liberal and welcoming
to investment by foreign oil companies - is likely to stall the legislation.
Major oil companies see a clear legal basis as critically important for
their investments - and for the Russian oil industry, whose output is
declining rapidly. One senior oil industry executive in Moscow said
yesterday: 'We must have an oil and gas law. Individual production sharing
agreements are not enough.'
There are signs of Russia's energy resources being opened up to foreign
companies, notably in the signing of an agreement with a
US-Japanese-Anglo/Dutch consortium to prospect a block of oil and gas
reserves off Sakhalin in the Far East. But adoption of a reliable framework
and smoothing of bureaucratic obstacles are still fraught with problems.
Different layers of government and the various oil-producing enterprises
differ among themselves on the desirability of foreign investment and the
terms on which it could be accepted.
Mr Yeltsin's objections, backed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister,
were sent to the chairman of the duma, Mr Ivan Rybkin, a month ago. The four
pages of objections amount to a rejection of the draft law as a whole. Mr
Yeltsin says 'the contents of the draft law cannot be improved in quality by
the adoption of certain amendments to it'.
The president's letter focuses on clauses in the law which attempt to
prescribe actions for, or restrict the rights of, already privatised
companies in the energy field - such as the gas monopoly, Gasprom - or which
interfere with the rights of the licensees, including foreign licensees. Mr
Yeltsin argues that existing legislation, especially a law on subsoil,
specifies rights and obligations clearly enough to make new laws redundant.
Mr Yeltsin's dismissal of the draft law, and his evident reluctance to
propose an alternative, suggests he would prefer this area, as others, to be
regulated by his decree.

Mr Justice Liam Hamilton's report into the Irish beef processing industry

Agriculture.
The report criticised lax controls imposed by the agriculture department on
the intervention system for buying up beef from farmers, and recommended
that responsibility for managing it be placed with an independent body.
However, the Irish government said that changes introduced in recent years
to the way intervention is run would address some of the weaknesses cited in
the report.
The EU's system of intervention was set up as a safety net for farmers by
guaranteeing minimum prices for meat and other farm commodities. The system
became deeply embedded in the Irish farming economy, which produces seven
times more beef than it consumes, with, until recently, 75 per cent placed
in intervention stores.
Beef bought into intervention is kept in cold storage until it can be sold
in the EU or exported to third countries - often with the help of export
refunds to cover any discrepancy in price.
But the system is open to abuse as it is managed in many countries at a
local level with ad hoc inspections. The Irish beef tribunal found that
officials from the Goodman group's international arm consistently
misreported weights of beef used at boning plants in Dublin and Waterford.
By reporting higher weights than were actually used, the group was able to
claim substantially higher export refunds. On one occasion in 1986, the
report cites the advancement of IPounds 2.3m (Pounds 2.27m) in export
refunds for 70,000 cartons of beef, while it was found that part of the meat
did not exist and that 6,800 cartons had had their weight increased by 3.8kg
each.
At the same time, Goodman had been able to export significant amounts of
non-Irish beef from intervention stores to Iraq in return for export credit
guarantees from the Irish government.
Mr John Donelly, president of the Irish Farmers' Association, said the beef
industry had worked hard at developing markets overseas and that not a pound
of beef had been placed in intervention for the past year.
Irish farmers are hoping to exploit openings left by the additional
restrictions placed on British beef exports because of mad cow disease.
Reforms of the common agricultural policy have aimed to curtail the growth
of intervention by reducing minimum prices.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Spanish fishermen attack British ships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID, LONDON

<TEXT>
Spain's tuna fishermen appeared set yesterday to drag the Madrid government
into a confrontation with its European Union partners by vowing to continue
their hit and run tactics against rival EU fleets allegedly using illegal,
oversized drift nets to land their catch.
'It's like starting a war,' said Mr David Scott, president of Britain's
National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations.
For much of yesterday navy patrol boats from Spain, the UK and Ireland
seemed to be bobbing on the swell of the Bay of Biscay powerless to prevent
the Spanish fisherman 'taking the law into their own hands,' as one EU
diplomat in Madrid said.
Ship to shore radio reports from the Spanish vessels, as well as from the
British and Irish ones that they had attacked, indicated that the Spaniards
had cut drift nets that they judged to be longer than the 2.5km limits
imposed by Brussels and drawn close to other offending EU trawlers,
threatening hostile action.
Recalling the violence at the end of last month when Spanish fishermen
boarded a French tuna trawler and towed it to a Spanish harbour, two British
vessels and an Irish one were said at the end of yesterday's confused high
sea clashes to be limping back to their home ports. A British fisherman
compared the attacking Spaniards to a 'wolf pack'.
The British fishermen stress they are not breaking EU rules. 'It's totally
unacceptable. Tuna presents a tremendous opportunity for our fishermen and
we want to hold on to it,' said Mr Scott.
The Spanish fishermen seem equally determined. 'Our navy boats threaten to
machine gun us, which of course they daren't do,' said Mr Anton Garay, a
Spanish tuna fleet spokesman. 'What they should be doing is defending our
livelihood. Our government is doing nothing and forcing us to act.'
The Spanish fishing boats, which make up by far the largest fleet in Europe,
use rods and lines to catch tuna, unlike the larger vessels of other EU
nations which are adapted to use long drift nets to land bigger catches.
British fishermen are angry with the confusion they say has arisen because
some nets have lines longer than 2.5km. This is because they are constructed
with 'dolphin doors' to enable dolphins to escape through large holes in the
nets.
The British have only pursued tuna fishing since 1990, as quotas for
catching other white fish in EU waters have been tightened. The EU imposes
no quota on tuna.
The Spanish Agriculture and Fisheries ministry appealed for calm and said
that EU inspectors aboard Spanish patrol boats would report oversize nets.
'We cannot confirm that violent incidents have occured and we are doing
everything possible to ensure that everybody abides by EU rules,' said a
spokesman.
The UK government said that 'appropriate action' would be taken against any
British vessel found to be using oversized nets.
Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said he insisted, in a message to the
Spanish government, that they ensure their fishermen do not take the law
into their own hands. He said he would pursue claims for compensation by
fishermen.
Representatives of Spain, France, Ireland and the UK were meeting yesterday
in Brussels in an attempt to resolve the conflict.
The Spanish tuna fleet warned that any reprisals by the Madrid government or
by Brussels could lead to renewed use of the blockade tactic that last week
sealed off Spain's northern ports for three days.

FT  05 AUG 94 / SPD calls for speed limit on autobahns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spurred on by fears of smog in the current heatwave, Germany's opposition
Social Democrats have executed a complete U-turn on environmental policy by
calling for a strict national speed limit on the roads.
The issue, always regarded as a red rag to speeding road-hogs on the
country's unrestricted autobahns, has immediately been taken up as the top
theme in the current general election campaign.
The decision to reverse SPD policy was taken at a meeting of state
environment ministers with the party leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, barely two
months after he had vetoed an earlier move as electoral dynamite.
In the meantime, the heatwave has caused a series of 'ozone alarms' in
several federal states because of rising levels of summer smog pollution,
and several are planning local speed restrictions to counter the danger.
The SPD is calling for a universal 130km per hour (80mph) maximum speed on
all autobahns and country roads, and a limit of just 30km per hour (18mph)
in built-up areas.
'We need a speed limit 365 days of the year,' Mr Scharping said after his
meeting with the SPD environment experts in the Bavarian mountain resort of
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where the temperature topped 30 degrees Celsius. Any
other policy would be a 'petty patchwork solution'.
His personal U-turn caused consternation and amazement among his
conservative and liberal opponents, fierce defenders of the theory that the
German motor industry produces the best fast cars in the world thanks to
their own motorway speed fanatics.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the liberal Free
Democrats, called the decision an over-reaction. The SPD was using the ozone
issue as an excuse to promote 'total regulation on German roads', he said.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the Christian Democrat environment minister, said speed
limits did not have a significant effect on ozone levels.
Yet the indication that German opposition to any form of speed limit on the
autobahns is weakening will certainly be welcomed in Brussels, and among
other EU member states. They have long been baffled by Germany's ability to
demand tough limits on exhaust emissions, and yet refuse flatly to impose
any speed limits on the autobahns, which the European Commission says would
make a big contribution to cutting car pollution.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Ballot deals blow to rail strikers: Third of network likely
to remain open as supervisors vote not to join dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A severe blow was dealt last night to the strike strategy of the RMT
transport union when its rail supervisors voted decisively against joining
the signalling staff's dispute.
The 225-157 result, announced after a postal ballot with a high turnout of
72 per cent, will please ministers and Railtrack, the state-owned company
responsible for running the network. They had feared that involvement by the
supervisors and managers in the eight-week-old dispute would have led to a
serious intensification of the conflict.
The firm rejection by the supervisors and managers means that Railtrack will
be able to keep at least a third of the network open for normal business
over the 72 hours of stoppages planned around next weekend.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said: 'The result is an obvious
disappointment to the union but in some respects was not a total surprise.'
He blamed what he called 'interference in the balloting process' by
Railtrack through its attempts to put pressure on the supervisors and
managers into voting against industrial action.
However, Mr Knapp added that the result was 'not critical to the conduct of
the dispute'.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said last night he was 'very pleased'
with the outcome of the supervisors' ballot.
'Clearly RMT members are very dispirited with this futile and unnecessary
action by the signalling staff,' he said. 'It is time that the RMT ended
this charade, listened to their members and worked to resolve the dispute.'
Mr Knapp also announced that the RMT union executive had decided to ballot
500 level-crossing keepers who belong to the RMT union, calling on them to
support the signalling staff. However, any such ballot would take at least
three weeks and it would be unlikely to make any important difference to the
outcome of the dispute.
The rejection by the signal box supervisors is bound to increase the
pressure on the RMT union as it tries to find ways of returning to the
negotiating table with Railtrack.
Yesterday Mr Knapp wrote to Mr Horton asking for clarification of the
company's letter to signalling staff, in which it said it was ready to
reshape the pay productivity package to meet the union's concerns about the
level of basic pay rates.
Railtrack added it was prepared to consolidate half a 6 per cent
unconsolidated supplement that is part of its offer to the union which would
ensure an immediate increase in earnings for the signalling staff of 4.7 per
cent. This is only 1 percentage point less than the union alleged Railtrack
had offered on June 8 before the government stepped in to veto it.
Meanwhile, Mr David Matthew, head of the Freight Transport Federation's rail
freight division, warned that many companies were likely to no longer use
the railway network because of uncertainty about the reliability of the
service.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, said he believed that the
ingredients for a settlement of the dispute were in place and that a deal
could be reached.

FT  05 AUG 94 / DTI clampdown on 'pyramid' schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is clamping down on 'pyramid' companies
supposedly structured in a way to generate money-for-nothing for their
investors.
In an indication that pyramid schemes are not just a feature of economies
where capitalism is a novelty - such as the collapsed MMM in Russia and
Caritas in Romania - the department said it had wound up four such companies
in the past month.
Pyramid schemes operate by recruiting new subscribers in order to provide
the money required to pay off existing investors. The schemes are ultimately
flawed because they require the generation of an infinite number of new
investors.
A team of department investigators has been scrutinising a number of such
companies recently and is believed to be considering further closures.
After a High Court petition on 'public interest' grounds, the official
receiver was yesterday appointed provisional liquidator to Quillpunch, a
company trading as the Alchemy Foundation.
Quillpunch had been created using assets and subscribers transferred from
Alchemy Marketing and Alchemy (UK), two other companies wound up by the DTI
late last month. They had traded as Alchemy UK. The scheme had approximately
8,000 subscribers.
Last month, the department wound up a similar company called 3T
Publications, which offered a scheme known as FPW or Frequency Programming
World. Customers were asked to send up to Pounds 70 a month to the company,
which said it would redistribute the money between existing subscribers.
A consultative document on reforms to the law dealing with pyramid schemes
is being drawn up by the department. This is likely to be issued by
December.
The department said it was responding to complaints about such
organisations, many of which operate under legal loopholes.
'It's a matter of people's judgment whether to join these schemes,' the
department added. It highlighted a recent ruling from Mr Justice Chadwick
that such schemes 'are bound to fail'.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Belgrade to cut ties with Bosnia Serbs over peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, MATTHEW KAMINSKI and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yugoslavia said yesterday it would cut ties with Serb-held Bosnia following
the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to endorse the latest international peace plan.
The move brought a cautious welcome from the western members of the
five-nation group that framed the plan. It is the most determined effort yet
by the leadership of what remains of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - to
force its kin in Bosnia-Hercegovina to end the war and ease the effect of
western sanctions.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, said it was 'senseless and
absurd' to reject the peace plan, which partitions Bosnia. 'They're
rejecting peace at the moment . . . when their acceptance would bring about
the lifting of sanctions against those without whom they cannot exist.'
However, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, told his people to be
ready to fight on alone. 'We are prepared to be hungry, naked and barefoot,
but we must fight for our freedom,' he said on television. 'We have sources
of energy, we have enough food, we have factories for production of weapons
and ammunition.'
The Bosnian Serbs' parliament in Pale rejected the plan which would have
given them 49 per cent of Bosnia against the more than 70 per cent they hold
now. A referendum on the plan is scheduled for August 27 and 28 but this has
been seen as little more than a delaying tactic.
Under the new effort to isolate Bosnian Serbs, especially from arms
supplies, the Belgrade government said it would shut its borders with
Serb-held territory in Bosnia to goods except food, medicine and clothing.
The effectiveness of the closure remains to be seen, however. Similar action
ordered in May last year when the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen
peace plan proved fruitless.
The US yesterday welcomed Serbia's announcement but warned it was still
ready to lift the embargo on arms shipments to the Bosnian Moslem
government, unilaterally if necessary.
White House officials said the Serbian announcement was 'an encouraging
sign, but we will have to see what the ramifications are'. They warned
pressure was growing from the US Congress to supply arms to the Bosnian
Moslems.
Economic sanctions have taken a heavy economic toll in Yugoslavia and a
government statement outlining the moves against the Bosnian Serbs made no
effort to hide Belgrade's bitterness at the rejection of the plan.
Local economists and western diplomats estimate that 5 per cent to 20 per
cent of Yugoslavia's gross domestic product has been spent on military and
financial support for the Bosnian Serbs who depend on Belgrade for arms and
food.
Reuter adds: The Bosnian army yesterday took Pecigrad, a rebel Moslem town
in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac. It was the base of Mr Fikret Abdic, a
business tycoon who prospered by trading with the surrounding Serbs. His
forces have been fighting the Moslem-led government in Sarajevo since a
disagreement last September over whether to accept a UN peace plan.

FT  05 AUG 94 / Russia's MMM fund president arrested in raid: Move to
appease shareholders - UK targets similar operations

The conflict between Russian authorities and the shaky MMM investment fund
grew yesterday when police arrested the fund's president, Mr Sergei Mavrodi,
after a dramatic raid on his apartment in central Moscow.
The company froze its operations across Russia after armed tax police broke
into the eighth-floor apartment of the elusive Mr Mavrodi, 38, through a
balcony door after abseiling from an upper floor of the building. Earlier,
he had refused to allow tax authorities into his home and barricaded himself
behind its metal door together with his armed bodyguards.
Russia's chief tax inspector said yesterday that criminal proceedings have
begun against Mr Mavrodi, who is suspected of illegally concealing profits
from the state. The dramatic raid on his home was the first legal action
against the MMM pyramid fund, which began to topple 10 days ago after a
government warning triggered a run by investors.
'The government has declared a war on us,' Mr Mavrodi was reported to have
told the Interfax news agency. A crowd gathered outside his apartment
building last night, with calls of 'hands off Mavrodi', while police
searched his home. Television commercials for his fund were still being
aired last night.
Yesterday's public show of state force is an apparent effort by the
government to appease the millions of MMM shareholders who have seen the
value of their holdings plunge over the past two weeks.
But Russian financiers fear that the state's strong-arm tactics will extend
to tightening regulation of the stockmarket, a measure which western and
Russian bankers say could thwart the growth of the country's immature, but
developing, financial system.
Shares are avidly traded in Russia and domestic capital is rapidly
accumulating, but the country has no central stock exchange and government
legislation is erratically enforced, as has been highlighted by the MMM
case.
'I am very afraid that in the wake of the MMM crisis there will be a
movement toward strict state regulation of the stockmarket,' said Mr Andrei
Volgin, president of Adamant, one of Russia's leading financial companies.
Mr Volgin said there was a 'battle' in Russia between supporters of tighter
state regulation and financiers who wanted a self-regulating network of
stockbrokers who would trade on an electronic system.
A leading reformer in the Russian government, Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy
head of the Russian state privatisation body, yesterday also spoke out
against stricter government regulation.
He said one way to reduce the popularity of pyramid schemes was to offer
pent-up Russian capital more sound investment opportunities by speeding up
privatisation. 'People have money and are looking for a place to invest it,'
Mr Vasiliev said.
Russia's small but increasingly sophisticated banking elite argues that the
MMM scandal was one of the inevitable growing pains of the transition to a
market economy.
'The MMM scandal will not be the last one in Russia,' Mr Volgin said.
'Russian investors must suffer painful personal setbacks before they learn
you can't spin money out of air. You can't fight this sort of ignorance with
laws.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trencherwood margins ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trencherwood, the Newbury-based housebuilder, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 859,000 for the six months to April 30 on turnover of Pounds 9.74m.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 1.8m on turnover of Pounds
4.78m, although there were exceptional credits last time of Pounds 3.45m.
'This heralds the return of the company to real profitability,' said Mr John
Norgate, chairman of this USM-quoted company.
Sales from residential activities totalled Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 4.8m),
including Pounds 2.8m related to land trading activities.
The group sold 95 units during the period, an increase of some 36 per cent,
at an average price of Pounds 72,500 (Pounds 67,000).
The policy of working through sites acquired during the recession and
subsequent reinvestment in new sites at lower prices helped gross margins
improve from 15.8 per cent to 25 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
At the period end the land bank stood at 6,558 plots, 2,305 of which have
planning consent or are zoned for development.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.03p (3.74p) basic or 0.55p (2.11p) fully
diluted.

<TEXT>
The Bulgarian government is to sell off Balkantourist, the largest
state-owned tour operator, with a stake of at least 51 per cent being
offered to a single investor.
The remainder will be split between employees and domestic investors, with
employees offered 20 per cent.
'We will secure equal terms for foreign and local investors to participate
in the privatisation of the company,' said Mr Bonka Hinkova, first
vice-president of the Committee of Tourism in Sofia.
Tui of Germany, Inghams of the UK - a member of the Hotelplan multinational
concern - and the Louis Organisation, a Cyprus-based holding comprising
hotels, tour operators, cruise lines and airport shops, are interested in
acquiring a majority stake in the company.
Local investors are also lining up to buy a stake.
Private airlines and several of Bulgaria's most powerful private financial
groups, including Multigroup, Tourist-Sport Holding, Tron and Bulvar
Holidays, are reported to be discussing the opportunity.
Balkantourist, the former tourism monopoly, was founded 47 years ago. Until
1990 the company administered all tourist facilities in the country.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Taiwan split over China links: Beijing negotiator misses
boos and bouquets as talks begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's chief Taiwan negotiator narrowly escaped being pelted with eggs by
independence activists chanting 'Chinese bandits go home' and burning
People's Republic of China flags on his arrival at Taipei's international
airport yesterday.
But Mr Tang Shubei, the most senior Chinese official to set foot on the
island which Beijing has regarded as a renegade province since 1949, also
missed a crowd of supporters who had come to welcome him when he was whisked
out of the airport through a secret exit.
As four days of talks begin today between Mr Tang and his Taiwanese
counterpart, Mr Chiao Jen-ho, Taiwanese remain divided and uncertain over
the pace and direction of the island's uneasy relations with its giant
neighbour.
Many people in Taiwan are suspicious of the motives of both governments, in
the talks, designed to resolve issues such as maritime rights and the
repatriation of hijackers, of which there have been many from the mainland
in the past year.
A government-commissioned poll, the results of which were released
yesterday, found 42.2 per cent of those surveyed supported neither
reunification with China nor Taiwanese independence. Nearly 21 per cent of
respondents backed reunification, while 11.6 per cent advocated
independence.
The passion of the protests against Mr Tang's arrival yesterday highlighted
the sensitivity of China policy for the Taiwanese, who have been taught to
regard the mainland as territory occupied temporarily by the Communist
government and to be retaken eventually by the Taiwanese nationalists.
Pro-independence protesters burnt the Chinese flag and urged Mr Tang to
return to the mainland. He suggested that 'talks are talks' and conceded
that 'we have to raise differing opinions', though Beijing has not ruled out
the possibility of using force to retake the island if it drifts too close
to independence.
As for the boisterous reception in Taipei, Mr Tang said: 'This is not the
way Chinese people should treat their guests. I hope to see some improvement
in this.'
Mr Eric Ni, a stockbroker at a Taiwanese securities firm, said he hoped that
Beijing and Taipei could adopt a more pragmatic approach in the cross-strait
talks, which began in April 1993. The previous five rounds have been mired
in legalistic issues.
'Both sides are basically just playing games,' Mr Ni said. 'But it's better
than not talking at all; otherwise there would be more tension.' He
supported resumption of direct shipping and air links as mutually
beneficial.
While in favour of improved relations, Mr Ni, a native Taiwanese in his late
20s, firmly rejects reunification.
'It is good to maintain an older brother-younger brother relationship with
China, but Taiwan should be independent,' he argues. 'There is no need for
reunification, even though we share the same blood. For example, the US
became independent from England over 200 years ago.
'Should Taiwan declare independence? 'Why not? There's no way China can
attack Taiwan. They can't because they would lose all their foreign
investment.'
Building manager Mr Wang, who came to Taiwan from China's Shandong Province
in 1949, fears closer ties with the mainland. 'Direct links are no good;
it's too dangerous for Taiwan. You can't trust the Communists.
'There's no way these talks can come to anything,' Mr Wang said 'Nobody
wants to see any progress. Reunification is not possible. Independence is
not possible either.'
Mr Chen Hsin-rong, an electrician said: 'It's good to hold talks, but
relations between the two sides should not develop too fast. Very, very
slowly is the best way. China refuses to recognise us on an equal basis, so
how can we even begin to agree on anything? Besides, Taiwan is a democracy
now. I visited China last year and there's no way that place can ever become
democratic.'
'Talks and friendly relations are good, but we must maintain at a distance,'
said Mr Chen Tung-chiang, a taxi driver.

A bitter 24-day strike over wages by workers at South Africa's Pick'n Pay
supermarket chain ended yesterday but strikes in other sectors of the
economy continued to hit production, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Walkouts in the motor, metal, paper and oil industries and the public sector
hit the country's fragile economy amid government fears that labour unrest
could frighten off investors.
Pick'n Pay, with 350 stores across the country, signed an agreement with the
South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers' Union giving employees
a 180 rand (Dollars 40) increase and a 1,110 (Dollars 308) minimum wage.
But there was no sign of progress in negotiations over a strike by 25,000
car workers that has brought seven big plants to a halt. 'There was no
substantial progress in our negotiations and therefore we have nothing to
say at this stage,' an official of the National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Riots erupted in the Iranian city of Qazvin yesterday after parliament voted
down a bill to turn it into a province, residents said, Reuter reports from
Tehran.
'People have set tyres on fire in the streets. Windows of banks and
government buildings are smashed,' said a man at a Qazvin hotel reached by
telephone. 'I can hear shooting. It's very chaotic. People have gathered in
streets and mosques and there are clashes in the streets. The police cannot
do anything,' he said.
Another resident said rioters had burned down the finance department
building.
Police in the city, 90 miles north-west of Tehran, the capital, said the
roads were closed into Qazvin, through which hundreds of trucks bringing
goods from Turkey and Europe to Tehran and beyond pass every day.
The riots broke out after parliament voted 105-103 against a bill to
separate Qazvin from Zanjan province. Parliament's deputy speaker, Mr Hassan
Rowhani, said after the vote that the people of Qazvin should not take it as
a sign of bias by parliament and urged the Zanjan governor-general to pay
more attention to the city which was the 16th century capital of Persia
under the Safavid dynasty.
Several Iranian cities have ambitions of becoming centres of new provinces,
mainly to get more money directly from the central government for
development. Located in a fertile plain, Qazvin has been turned into one of
Iran's biggest industrial centres since the 1970s.
The interior ministry, seeking to defuse the tension, announced it would
send an envoy to Qazvin to hear people's grievances, Iran's official news
agency IRNA said.
Iran's worst riots since the early turbulent years after the 1979 Islamic
revolution occurred in the north-eastern city of Mashhad in 1992. Two people
were killed and 300 banks and government offices were gutted during the
rampage in Mashhad which started from a dispute over illegal buildings. Four
men were hanged for inciting to riot.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Zaire's inflation hits 93% in month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zaire's monthly inflation hit 93 per cent in July as millions of banknotes
flooded on to the black market, triggering the collapse of the zaire, the
national currency, Reuter reports from Kinshasa.
The rate, calculated by US embassy economists, was almost five times June's
21 per cent and the worst recorded for the past seven months. Annual
inflation is estimated at 12,500 per cent. The rocketing prices highlighted
a decline in living standards for Zaireans accustomed to years of privation.
In Kinshasa's central market, shoppers are buying ever -smaller quantities
of manioc, bread, palm oil and dried fish, as these staples double and
triple in price.
The number of beggars at the capital's junctions has grown and as petrol
prices soar, the streets are packed with hundreds of people who can no
longer afford public transport and spend up to eight hours a day walking to
and from work.
Despite an attempt by the new prime minister, Mr Kengo Wa Dondo, to bring
the country's security forces under control, underpaid policemen, gendarmes
and soldiers are becoming ever more blatant in their demands for bribes.
Mr Kengo's new government has cited the flood of notes onto the market,
which pushed the currency to a low of 1,400 against the US dollar from 710
in just 10 days, as the reason for suspending the central bank governor, Mr
Ndiang Kaboul, last month.
Officials allege Mr Ndiang, sensing he was about to be dismissed, printed
money to cover clandestine payments to friends, influential politicians and
army generals.
Mr Ndiang insists the currency's collapse was triggered by pay-outs Mr Kengo
ordered to cover army and civil servants' salaries. The stand-off between Mr
Ndiang and the government continues as a central bank audit begins.
In the past few days, the zaire has recovered slightly, touching 1,250 to
the dollar, but economists said this was due to the bank running out of
notes rather than a recovery of confidence in the currency.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Lagos comes to a halt as strikers challenge regime: Bid to
force release of opposition leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government offices, banks and factories in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos,
were deserted yesterday on the first day of an indefinite general strike
called to force the military government to release the detained opposition
leader, Mr Moshood Abiola.
There were outbreaks of violence in the city, as police attempted to
dismantle barricades and disperse protesters. Three people were reported
killed.
In Abuja, the capital, the trial of Mr Abiola, the unofficial winner of last
year's presidential election, was adjourned again, this time until August
16. He is being tried for treason after he declared himself president on
June 12, the anniversary of last year's vote.
The judge said he needed time to decide whether his court had jurisdiction.
At last week's hearing, the prosecution was forced to admit that it lied to
the court when denying that it had received the defence's petition.
As the prosecution case falters, Gen Sani Abacha's government seems unsure
how to end the deadlock. It appears to have rejected a strategy whereby Mr
Abiola could be released and installed as head of a government of national
unity.
Mr Abiola's family, who are allowed access to him in detention in Abuja, say
that he has twice refused release on condition that he keep silent about
claims to the presidency.
Support for the strike is strongest in the south-west, where members of Mr
Abiola's Yoruba tribe see a chance to wrest political power from the north
Hausas and Fulanis who have dominated government. Northern branches of the
National Labour Congress are disregarding the strike, which they say is not
in the national interest.
The shutdown has completed a process begun over a month ago. A combination
of fuel shortages, lack of transport, and earlier political strikes have
been gradually bringing the commercial capital of Lagos to a halt.
People going to work risk intimidation from street gangs or being caught in
sporadic violence, as anti-government protesters become more mobile to elude
armed police. A strike by air traffic controllers, and lack of aviation fuel
in the south, has grounded domestic flights but military air traffic
controllers have kept the international airport open.
Labour representatives are due to hold talks with the military government
today. Central to discussions will be the disruption to oil production,
which is down by at least 20 per cent.
The oil workers, who went on strike a month ago, say the release of Mr
Abiola will not get them back to work. They want the regime to make way for
elected civilian rule. And they want it to pay arrears to the oil companies,
estimated at Dollars 800m, which have led to job losses and recession in the
industry.
'Abiola's following is growing among people who were marginalised,' a
businessman from the eastern city of Port Harcourt said yesterday. 'Some do
not like to see a big man brought low, and others feel a sense of outrage at
the government which has far less mandate to rule than he has. But people
are also impressed that Abiola is going through a spell in jail and is not
doing it just for himself.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / Rumours work all year round in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one thing continental Europeans can teach their British
colleagues, it is the importance of les grandes vacances.
On August 1 somebody pulls a plug in Europe's administrative centre.
Overnight Brussels empties; the concept of staggered holidays scathingly
dismissed by officials, restaurants, lobbyists and translators.
Even the tramp who plays an electric organ outside the city's main metro
station has taken his leave for the month.
All that are left are a duty press officer, a duty commissioner, and a few
hard-working officials - mainly from the competition directorate who have to
be here when merger cases are notified.
'It's as if there is a big party somewhere else to which I have not been
invited,' said a senior competition official yesterday.
This time, though, some of the hard core left behind believe colleagues
settling down on Mediterranean beaches to read the latest Brussels-based
thriller - Cartel, by Derek Fee - may be missing the action.
With a new president - Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister -
due to take office in four months, and a whole new set of commissioners and
chefs de cabinet yet to be appointed, the somewhat empty corridors are alive
with rumor and speculation.
'Everyone is asking who Santer will appoint, how he will organise the
portfolios, and what consequences this might have for the allocation of
services,' said one senior official. 'People are thinking about how they
will respond over the next two to three months which is when the rumours
will really take off.'
'A great rumour doing the rounds at the moment is that the UK will pay a
heavy price for using their veto (of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
leader) at Corfu,' said another observer. 'The question is how big a price?'
Still smarting from seeing Mr Dehaene vetoed by the UK, the French are
rumoured to be angling to secure the external economic relations portfolio
from Sir Leon Brittan.
Even more mischievous is a rumour that those governments still sulking over
the UK veto will work hard to see that Mr Neil Kinnock, former UK Labour
party leader and newly appointed commissioner, is awarded the social affairs
portfolio. With his declaration to end the UK's opt-out of the social
chapter, such an appointment could cause havoc at home.
Next is the question of who will staff the office of Mr Santer. It has
already been confirmed that Mr Jim Cloos, currently chef de cabinet for Mr
Rene Steichen, the Luxembourg commissioner, will become Mr Santer's chef,
and beyond that the gossip centres on how many more Luxembourgers he will be
able to fill his posts with. Most, cruelly, suggest three as the total.
Meanwhile, officials are reflecting on the European parliament's display of
muscle last month, over the allegedly under-hand appointment of the new
Commission president. The parliament has said it would like to vet all
commissioners individually before Mr Santer takes over next year, a prospect
which is prompting a mixture of mirth and nervousness among the top echelons
still languishing in Brussels.

FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU call hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurer Commercial Union sparked increasing tension in the market as the
deadline for the group's long awaited cash- raising issue became a matter of
ever closer scrutiny.
CU is scheduled to report figures on August 10 and is expected to announce
the details of its Pounds 1.46bn acquisition of Groupe Victoire, the
insurance arm of Compagnie de Suez. CU needs to acquire Pounds 500m of new
equity, some two-thirds of which is expected to be raised through the
market.
It is believed CU will bring its figures forward to pre-empt its rivals in
the sector - General Accident is the first to report on August 9. Mr Roman
Cizdyn of Smith New Court said: 'Any horrible surprises from the other
composites could spoil the ground.'
CU was up 11 at 550p yesterday, although General Accident fell 10 to 594p as
investors wanting to maintain their sector weightings sold stock elsewhere
in preparation to take advantage of the CU cash call.
The regional electricity companies (recs) powered ahead as strong rumours
swept the market that next week's regulatory review would turn out highly
favourable for the industry.
The speculation suggested that Offer, the industry watchdog, would deliver a
downward price rebasing of 14 per cent - against market fears of 20 per cent
 -and an annual price increase of two points below the rate of inflation,
against worries of a figure of RPI minus four. Mr Andrew Wheeler at NatWest
Securities said: 'While not subscribing to these rumours, if true, the
sector represents outrageously good value.'
Among the recs, Northern closed 16 ahead at 705p, East Midlands 23 up at
658p and South West 18 higher at 656p. Meanwhile, PowerGen announced that it
was buying in 2.5m of its own shares at 527p apiece. The stock shot forward
on the news, adding 25 1/2 at 545 1/2 p. PowerGen has shareholder approval
to buy in a further 75m shares.
Shares in British Airways advanced 9 to 430p after the airline reported an
8.1 per cent year-on-year increase in traffic figures for the month of July.
Nervous trading ahead of the figures held the stock back from fully
participating in Tuesday's strong advance in the market. The figures for
June beat market expectations, but those for April and May were a
disappointment.
There was strong demand for conglomerate Tomkins as the market came to the
view that the stock had been left behind. The shares advanced 8 to 233 1/2 p
in trade of 6.6m. Williams Holdings eased 5 to 367p as some dealers switched
out of the stock and into Tomkins.
Engineering group Glynwed International closed 3 firmer at 385p ahead of
today's interim figures.
Oil leaders were weak on profit-taking, particularly in the US, and a dull
oil price. Those two factors managed to offset a tentative buy note on
British Petroleum from Mr John Toalster of SGST. The long-time bear moved
from hold to undervalued and upgraded his 1994 replacememnt cost forecast to
Pounds 1.48bn from Pounds 1.4bn. BP dropped 8 to 410 1/2 p and Shell
Transport slipped 6 to 740p.
Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi surged 9 1/2 to 159p after winning the
Qantas airline and Compaq computer accounts, which are expected to bring
billings of more than Pounds 60m. The news comes ahead of figures on Tuesday
which are expected to show full-year profits of about Pounds 13.3m.
Paper and packaging group Jefferson Smurfit jumped 18 to 396p after
acquiring the paper interests of French glassmaker St Gobain for IPounds
683.8m.

FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low in demand
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury's refusal to respond to the much-anticipated increased offer by
Tesco for Scottish retailer William Low led to some investors getting caught
short.
Tesco's new bid of 360p a share, trumping Sainsbury's 305p offer, was
announced before the market opened, and as the session got under way one US
investment house was said to be predicting a rapid Sainsbury response in
excess of 400p a share.
The broker was not alone, and the Low stock price immediately surged from
the opening of 336p, passing the new Tesco offer price, to 368p within
minutes - before halting abruptly as a stunned market heard the news shortly
before 9am that Sainsbury was pulling out of the fray.
The shares eventually ended a hectic session 23 ahead at 359p after record
turnover of 14m. Dealers said that much of the buying had been undertaken by
one of the big US brokers which was aiming to convert into Tesco, which was
offering a share alternative to the cash offer, at a profitable price.
Turnover in Tesco hit 19m as some investors worried over the effect of the
deal on short-term earnings and the shares dipped 5 1/2 to 237 1/2 p.
Sainsbury was steady at 419p.
The speed of Sainsbury's withdrawal prompted some food analysts to question
whether Tesco had come back at too high a price. However, the consensus was
that both companies had emerged from the battle for Low with credibility
intact: Tesco for paying a reasonable if full price, and Sainsbury for not
becoming further embroiled in a damaging bidding war.

FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talk returns to Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shock news of an unsolicited bid in the pharmaceuticals sector sent shares
in several leading UK groups, particularly Wellcome, up sharply as investors
scouted around for the next candidate.
The Dollars 8.5bn bid from US drugs group American Home Products for
American Cyanamid is the first unsolicited takeover attempt since Roche
launched an attack on Sterling six years ago. It reminded pharmaceuticals
analysts of a piece of research produced by Wertheim Schroder just over a
month ago. In that research Dr Jonathan Gelles suggested that Wellcome was a
candidate for takeover or merger and in that event would be worth around
900p a share.
Dr Gelles reiterated his belief yesterday: 'I do not think by any means that
900p is an outrageous figure. I believe we will see at least Dollars 40bn of
mergers in the industry in the next six to 18 months.'
Wellcome shares, which were still benefiting from rejection of a rival's
product by the US Food and Drug Administration a few days ago, jumped 17 to
676p. Also, Zeneca, which currently has a share value of just above Pounds
7bn, strengthened 13 to 771p.

FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share gains consolidated in modest
turnover - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market consolidated its gains yesterday as closer reading of the
Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin reinforced confidence that the
threatened rise in domestic base rates will not happen before next month, at
the earliest. Disappointment with a sluggish lead from Wall Street kept
London subdued in the second half of the session and share prices ended with
only narrow changes from the previous day.
The FT-SE 100 Index showed a gain of 2.9 at 3,160.4 at the close of trading,
but had moved through a range of 17 points during the day as traders tidied
up their books in the wake of Tuesday's strong advance. In early deals, the
Footsie was down 8.8 points and then up 8.7 points before the market settled
down. Dealers commented that many securities houses had been caught
wrong-footed, first by Friday's sudden base rate worries and then by
yesterday's strong rise in the equity market.
Trading opened to a burst of excitement in the supermarkets sector when
Tesco effectively captured William Low, the Scottish food retailer, with a
knockout cash bid of 360p a share, valuing the group at a total of Pounds
248m. Within half an hour, J. Sainsbury had ceded defeat, saying that it
would not increase its previous 305p a share offer for Low, and thereby
surprising many market specialists and investors who had convinced
themselves that Sainsbury would go much higher - as high as 450p a share,
according to some sources.
Market confidence also took on board without difficulty the rumour that
Commercial Union might this morning announce the big rights issue which has
been widely predicted as part of the financing for the acquisition of
Victoire, the insurance arm of Compagnie de Suez, of France. Traders said
that only the timing of such a move by Commercial Union could surprise the
stock market.
Trading volume was moderate, with 710.3m shares moving through the Seaq
electronic network, compared with 810.3m on Wednesday, when retail business
in equities rose to a worth of Pounds 1.51bn, reflecting the increasing
signs of economic recovery and the fading of market fears that a base rate
increase was imminent.
Stock index futures trading again played a role in leading the underlying
equity market yesterday. But there were clear signs that investors were
turning their attention to the second line stocks which had been left behind
when the blue chips raced ahead in the previous session.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index advanced 16.2 yesterday to finish at 3,689.6,
although trading in these non-Footsie stocks made up only about 51 per cent
of the day's total volume - below average daily percentages.
US dollar stocks were generally firmer, but failed to extend early gains
when the Dow Industrial Average performed disappointingly in the new
session, showing a fall of 12 points as the London market closed. Oil shares
gave back a few pence of their recent gains as investors began to question
the longer term outlook for crude oil prices.
Once again, there were buyers for UK construction stocks with interests in
Europe, encouraged by the increase in industrial output in Germany announced
on the previous day.
With the exception of the excitement among the food retailers, consumer and
retail stocks had a fairly calm session. The uncertainty over near term base
rate prospects which began towards the end of last week when the Bank of
England accepted unexpectedly high bids for Treasury bills appeared to have
died away.
Some insurance stocks moved nervously after market hints that Commercial
Union planned to bring forward its interim statement from next week to
today, but trading volumes were modest.

FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a dull but volatile session as the market paused for
breath following Tuesday's strong showing, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at
3,177, some 6 points below its previous close but at a healthy premium to
cash.
Strong profit-taking in the first hour of trading saw the contract retreat
to 3,164, the day's low, for the first of two occasions before bargain
hunting stopped the slide.
The rally that followed took the contract to a peak of 3,184 before another
bout of selling once again sent it to the day's low. The weak opening on
Wall Street only encouraged further selling of September.
It finished at 3,175, down 8 from its previous session but at a 16-point
premium to cash. Volume was very poor at 8,149 lots.
Dealers said the December contract had been trading a point above its fair
value premium of 12 points, an indication of confidence in the contract.
Active dealing in the stock options brought improved turnover in the traded
options sector. Volume at the close was 36,649 contracts, of which 10,584
were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,155 in the Euro FT-SE option. Tesco
was the busiest stock option with 3,370 lots dealt. National power and
Argyll Group were also active.

FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Focus on drugs sector while
blue chips drift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks drifted slightly easier yesterday in a cautious session
highlighted by news of takeover activity in the pharmaceuticals sector,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.56 off at 3,792.66, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged ahead 0.89 to 461.45. Volume
on the Big Board came to 282.4m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up a scant 0.85 at
440.59 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 1.11 to 723.69.
At the opening, the market picked up where it left off at Tuesday's close.
In the final minutes of the previous session, American Home Products
surprised Wall Street by announcing an offer to acquire American Cyanamid
for Dollars 8.5bn, or Dollars 95 a share. Trading in both issues was halted
on the news.
When it resumed yesterday, Cyanamid jumped by 43 per cent, or Dollars 27, to
Dollars 90 3/4 and it was the most heavily traded NYSE issue with 7.2m
shares dealt. SmithKline Beecham, which had been discussing an asset swap
with Cyanamid before the bid surfaced, firmed Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 28 1/2
. AHP gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 57 3/8 .
Signs of further consolidation in the healthcare industry inspired heavy
activity in other drugs stocks. Warner Lambert jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to
Dollars 72 1/2 on volume of 2.4m shares, while Schering Plough climbed
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 . But Bristol Myers Squibb lost Dollars 1
1/2 at Dollars 53 1/2 .
The enthusiasm, however, never spilled over into other sectors, as investors
continued to tread water ahead of Friday's crucial report on July employment
conditions.
Yesterday's economic news mostly conformed to the expectations of analysts.
The Commerce Department reported a 0.2 per cent gain in its June index of
leading economic indicators, mostly because of rising prices for raw
materials. The data presaged a moderating growth trend in the second half.
New orders of factory goods, up 0.8 per cent last month, came in a shade
under the consensus forecast. Factory inventories edged higher for the fifth
time in six months, but economists had expected as much.
Since the reports held no surprises, they were ignored by investors, who
were still looking to confirm suspicions that the Federal Reserve would
delay its next move to tighten credit.
In the meantime, share prices tended to drift lower. Among the Dow
industrials, United Technologies, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 62 1/8 , was
hit by profit-taking. Caterpillar eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 108 5/8 but
International Paper added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 76 3/8 .
A second hostile takeover announced just after Tuesday's close raised a
ripple of excitement yesterday. Unitrin surged 24 per cent, or Dollars 9, to
Dollars 49 3/8 on news of American General's offer to pay Dollars 50 3/8 for
each share. The suitor's shares added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28 1/2 . Other
insurance issues held fairly steady.
On the Nasdaq, Snapple Beverage was marked down Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 15
1/4 after the company posted second-quarter net income of 19 cents a share,
two cents less than analysts had expected.

Africa
</HEADLINE>

Bargain hunters lifted shares off the day's lows, but the market remained
wary of the gold price after its fall on Tuesday. The overall index rose 12
to 5,696, the industrial index gained 11 at 6,448 and golds slid 16 to
2,127.
Aggressive buying saw De Beers climb during the session to match its year's
high of R119 set in June, before easing to close at R116.50. Anglos, which
rose in tandem, fell back R1 to R252, while Johnnies appreciated R4 to R105.
Pick 'n Pay advanced 50 cents, or 4 per cent, to R12.50 on reports that its
labour strike was to end.
Among golds, Joel rose 45 cents to R6.50 after falling on Tuesday, and
Freegold put on 50 cents at R63.50 while Kloof declined 43 cents to R57.32.
Lonrho relinquished 30 cents to R9.65, Highveld Steel finished R1 down at
R30.50 and Iscor ended 1 cent softer at R4.17.

FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Cote D'Ivoire attracting attention in
markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the lesser known of the world's emerging markets, the Cote D'Ivoire
has begun to attract attention following on from the devaluation of the CFA
Franc at the start of the year. According to Blakeney Management, the
devaluation set the scene for renewed economic growth, while Kleiman
International notes that the Finance Ministry of the West African nation has
forecast growth of 2 per cent in 1994 and 5 per cent in 1995.
However, this has to be set against inflation, presently at 30 per cent and
likely to rise to 35 per cent by the year-end. A new export tax on cocoa and
coffee, and the discovery of offshore oil fields which could make the
country self-sufficient, will help, says Kleiman, particularly as debts to
international commercial bank creditors total in excess of Dollars 5.5bn, or
85 per cent of GDP.
Blakeney Management observes that the Abidjan bourse is reviving - turnover
is still only Dollars 1m a month but four times last year's level. Kleiman
states that privatisation issues are coming through, the government having
announced its intention to divest itself of stakes in the local affiliates
of Elf, Shell and Michelin before September.

FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Consolidation pattern in
senior bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses consolidated after Tuesday's excitement, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT subsided a little after hours, but stayed happy, the Dax index
closing 12.53 higher at 2,198.92, after 2,200.34, and ending the afternoon
2.80 lower over 24 hours at an Ibis-indicated 2,190.83.
There was some profit-taking in chemicals and weakness in banks. But the
broad market, again, was led higher on the session by strength in blue
chips, noted Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, and
turnover stayed high at DM8.8bn against DM8.5bn on Tuesday.
Daimler rose another DM17.80 on the session to DM834 ahead of a Kleinwort
Benson upgrade in New York. Preussag put on DM10 more at DM476, and Thyssen
DM7.50 at DM313 after hitting a new 1994 high in Tuesday's post-bourse.
Banks reflected the interim report from Bayernverein, a worse performance
than that from Bayernhypo earlier in the week. Over the full day, the
Bavarian banks fell by DM15 to DM418 and DM10.50 to DM422.50 respectively.
AMSTERDAM took profits in the chemicals groups DSM and Akzo Nobel as
second-quarter results came in at the top end of expectations. DSM eased Fl
1.70 to Fl 145.70, having risen by almost 20 per cent since the end of June,
while Akzo Nobel was steady at Fl 219.50 after a gain of 16.5 per cent over
the same period.
The AEX index, however, rose 1.64 to 420.88 as investors switched to other
stocks. Heineken, in particular, performed well with a rise of Fl 4.70 to Fl
238.50. Kleinwort Benson issued a buy note on the brewer ahead of, it
forecast, unexciting first-half results early next month: 'The summer
weather arrived very late in Europe, and while this will be compensated by
advances in the US and Asia/Pacific region, overall sales growth should be
modest.' The broker raised its 1995 forecast for the group, based on growth
in Asia.
PARIS took a breather after Tuesday's strong performance and the CAC-40
index softened 2.16 to 2,115.07.
St Gobain slipped FFr5 to FFr694 on news that it was to sell its paper
division to Jefferson Smurfit, while Docks de France was lifted FFr33, or
4.8 per cent, to FFr726 on rumours that J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket
chain, could launch a takeover bid.
ZURICH was unable to maintain its upward momentum, and prices eased when
Wall Street opened lower. The SMI index gave up 9.0 to 2,620.7 in quiet
trade.
Pharmaceuticals found demand on the view that they were undervalued. Roche
certificates picked up SFr35 to SFr5,525. Banks were weak ahead of UBS's
first-half figures tomorrow. UBS dipped SFr9 to SFr1,187 and CS Holding lost
SFr6 to SFr576.
Holderbank moved forward SFr15 to SFr979 following several analysts'
recommendations. Bank Sal Oppenheim commented that the cement and aggregates
group's European markets were recovering more rapidly than expected and that
the US was performing well above budget.
MILAN was unconvinced by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's parliamentary performance on
Tuesday night, taking the view that the prime minister had not resolved the
conflicts between his parliamentary and political interests.
The Comit index finished 3.14 ahead at 718.47, reflecting some early
enthusiasm, but the real-time Mibtel index finished 110, or 1 per cent,
lower at 11,352 as the more negative view took hold later in the day.
However, Mr William Cowan at James Capel expected political worries to
subside in coming weeks after parliament broke for the summer next week.
'The main issue that the market will be focusing on is how tough the deficit
package will be in September,' he said.
Losses among telecommunications issues were contained amid continuing
interest ahead of the launch of Telecom Italia on August 18. Sip lost L19 to
L4,589 and Stet was L35 lower at L5,390.
MADRID saw profit-taking, arbitrage and some stronger buying after the Bank
of Spain had announced an interest rate cut of 15 basis points.
However, the positive trend did not last, and the general index eased 0.55
to 320.25, analysts blaming losses in the New York bond market.
DUBLIN enthused over the paper and board manufacturer Jefferson Smurfit's
acquisition of La Cellulose du Pin, the paper and packaging arm of the
French St Gobain giant. Smurfit rose a further 25 to 405p after a 20p
advance on Tuesday.
The ISEQ general index rose 21.90 to 1,866.93. Mr Robbie Kelleher of Davy
Stockbrokers in Dublin said that Tuesday's gain, after an Irish bank holiday
on Monday, followed a strong overnight performance by Smurfit's US
affiliate, JSC, in New York.

FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Shanghai
A index adds 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cautious trading around the 20,600 level limited activity and the Nikkei 225
average lost moderate ground after fluctuating within a narrow range, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 27.40 easier at 20,632.73 after a day's low of 20,592.22 in
the morning session and a high of 20,729.25 in the afternoon. Profit-taking
orders around the 20,800 mark discouraged active buying, although some
individual investors, encouraged by the dollar's rise above Y100 since June
28, bought speculative favourites.
Volume rose from 259m shares to 308m. Foreign investors, sellers during the
past few weeks, were net buyers but domestic institutions were seen on the
selling side.
In spite of the decline in the Nikkei 225, the Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 0.71 at 1,653.31 and the Nikkei 300 was 0.19 firmer at
300.35. Rises led falls by 523 to 452, with 195 issues unchanged. In London,
later, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.46 at 1,343.71.
Overseas investors joined in the buying in Mitsubishi Oil shares, which have
been actively traded recently by speculative individuals on the company's
discovery of two oil wells off the coast of Vietnam. The issue was the day's
most active and rose Y30 to Y1,200.
Nippon Steel also gained on foreign buying, adding Y8 at Y353. Other steels
were also firm, with Sumitomo Metal Industries rising Y7 to Y310 and NKK Y5
to Y266.
Profit-taking depressed some high-technology and export-orientated stocks
which saw bargain hunting earlier in the week. Fujitsu slipped Y10 to Y1,060
and Sony Y60 to Y5,940, while Toyota Motor lost Y10 at Y2,140.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ended Y1,000 down at Y861,000 on
profit-taking. The issue rose earlier in the day on reports that the
government would create a task force on high-technology and
telecommunications infrastructure.
East Japan Railway moved ahead on hopes of higher profits due to the
reported listing of Japan Telecom, in which it has a leading stake, but met
profit-taking later. It finished a net Y2,000 lower at Y525,000 after
peaking at Y533,000, a high for the year.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 81.88 at 22,993.18 in volume of 70m shares.
Export-orientated issues rose on the higher dollar against the yen.
Roundup
Profit-taking was a theme common to many regional markets.
SHANGHAI's A share index, however, resumed its advance, adding 20.2 per cent
and prompting expectations of further strong rises in coming days. The
index, which had paused on Tuesday after Monday's 36.1 per cent jump, broke
through the psychological 500-point barrier to close 96.39 higher at 529.80.
The Shenzhen A index rose 20.61, or 16.4 per cent, to 146.41. China's B
shares, available to foreigners, also benefited from the improved sentiment.
Shanghai's B index gained 0.47 at 73.83 and its Shenzhen counterpart rose
1.17 to 101.31.
SEOUL remained concerned about the central bank's tight monetary policy, and
institutional inactivity left share prices lower in extremely thin trade.
The composite index ended 4.08 off at 923.47.
HONG KONG extended losses during an afternoon of profit-taking after prices
encountered strong technical resistance around the 9,750 Hang Seng index
level. It lost 109.14, or 1.1 per cent, at 9,585.89. Turnover came to
HKDollars 4.3bn, against HKDollars 5.6bn on Tuesday.
SYDNEY's three-day rally came to an end on a fall in the price of bullion.
The All Ordinaries index shed 14.6 to 2,072.3. Turnover was ADollars 327m.
Brokers remarked that a Dollars 4 fall in the gold bullion price had
coincided with a correction on the bourse after its 45-point gain over the
past three trading days. In the golds sector, Poseidon Gold dipped 10 cents
to ADollars 3.35 and Plutonic stood at a three-week low, down 25 cents at
ADollars 6.15.
SINGAPORE was higher, although some late profit-taking had emerged to take
prices off their best levels.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.83 up at 2,267.13 in volume of
198.3m shares.
BOMBAY ended lower, though above the day's worst levels, which were
triggered by political uncertainty following reports that the finance
minister had threatened to resign. The BSE 30-share index closed 28.29 down
at 4,281.64, having recovered from a midsession low of 4,265.
KUALA LUMPUR saw buyers return after an early bout of profit-taking, and the
composite index finished 3.87 points up at 1,079.06.
TAIPEI was sharply lower on a bout of heavy profit-taking. However, many
brokers remained optimistic about the market's short-term direction,
although they agreed that it could enter a consolidation phase.
The weighted index lost 156.00, or 2.3 per cent, at 6,723.56, after touching
6,711.93. Turnover was TDollars 129.7bn.
MANILA recovered from an early fall to close higher, helped by strong buying
of blue chips and second-line issues. The composite index added 17.75 at
2,884.28 in turnover of 1.7bn pesos.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Lira gains on D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strengthening Italian lira yesterday breached the L1,000 level against
the D-Mark as fears of political instability receded, writes Philip Gawith.
Although the conflict of interest arising from Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi's interest in the Fininvest media group remains unresolved, the
market appears to have been comforted by his public address on Tuesday.
The pledge by Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern league leader, that he would
not bring down the government also bolstered sentiment.
The lira closed in London at L998.8 per D-Mark from L1,003 on Tuesday.
Elsewhere in Europe, the peseta slipped slightly to Pta102.1 against the
D-Mark, from Pta101.8, after the Bank of Spain cut its key money rate by 15
basis points to 7.35 per cent.
Amid generally quiet trading conditions on the foreign exchanges, the dollar
continued its firmer showing against the yen, again finishing above Y100 in
London. It closed at Y100.175 from Y100.415, and in New York it ended at
Y100.275.
The pound was little affected by the Bank of England's latest inflation
report. The trade weighted sterling index was unchanged at 79.3, with the
pound closing at DM2.4317 from DM2.4346.
The Australian dollar came under pressure after it became clear that a near
term rise in interest rates was unlikely. It ended at USDollars 0.732 from
Dollars 0.7357, but remains above its 1994 upper trading range of Dollars
0.73.
It looks possible that the worst may be over for the lira in the short term
with both houses of parliament due to go on holiday at the weekend.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London,
said the August-September period should be a better one for Italian assets.
'The absence of potential political setbacks improves the chances of lira
assets doing well because the fundamentals are very good by pan-European
standards,' he added.
Recent history, said Mr Radaelli, shows that the third quarter of the year
tends to be the best for lira assets. Strong tourism receipts is the main
reason for this.
Commenting on the lowering of rates in Spain, Mr Radaelli said it was not
unexpected. The Bank of Spain showed in the first quarter that it was
prepared to lower rates faster than the Bundesbank.
The poor economic situation in the country, where unemployment is over 20
per cent, is also a stimulus to ease policy.
The government still maintains a say in the setting of rates, and the high
level of private sector debt in the country means that a rate cut move has
wide repercussions.
Mr Radaelli said the central bank's willingness to lower rates had probably
also been encouraged by recent evidence of increased wage flexibility.
Improved labour market efficiency provided greater leeway in monetary
policy.
The Lehman analyst said that the likelihood of further opportunistic rate
cuts led him to predict a 3 to 5 per cent fall in the value of the peseta
over the next 6 to 12 months.
The dollar ignored reports of a 0.2 per cent rise in the US government's
June index of leading economic indicators and a 0.8 per cent gain in July
factory orders.
It firmed slightly in New York after the release of the Federal Reserve's
beige book, which reported solid economic growth, with scattered signs of
growth slowing.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said one factor accounting for
renewed dollar strength was changes in hedging ratios. For those Japanese
investors who felt that the dollar might have bottomed out, it made sense to
unwind hedging positions taken out as a precaution against a rising yen.
In the period August - December 1993, the yen fell by about 14 per cent
against the dollar, despite no big changes in the trade surplus or capital
flows. Changes in hedging strategies lay behind this move.
UK money market rates maintained their steady tone, with three-month LIBOR
trading again at 5 9/16 per cent. Although interest rate sentiment is more
positive than at the end of last week, the market remains nervous.
This was encouraged by the slightly bearish tone of media coverage of the
Bank's quarterly inflation report. Although many analysts found the report
encouraging, most newspaper headlines predicted that rates would rise within
the next few months.
A further hint that no rate rise is imminent came with the Bank's
announcement that the interest rate on two and five-week repo and secured
loan facilities, commencing today, would be unchanged at 5 5/32 per cent.
The total amount to be provided to the market will be Pounds 3.682bn.
In its daily operations the Bank gave late assistance of about Pounds 455m.
Earlier it had provided Pounds 86m assistance at established rates, compared
to a forecast Pounds 950m shortage.
Short sterling futures traded reasonable volumes, but price movements were
fairly small. The December contract saw 38,622 lots dealt to finish
unchanged at 93.43. Overnight money traded in the 4 3/4 to 7 per cent range.

price increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LOME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Togo has increased its producer price for top grade cocoa to CFA Fr550
(Dollars 1.02) a kilogram from CFR Fr300, an 83 per cent rise, according to
a government decree published in the official daily Togo-Presse, reports
Reuter from Lome.
Lower grade cocoa would be bought at a substantial discount, Tuesday's
edition of the paper added. Farmers would be paid only CFA Fr175 a kilogram
for grade one cocoa and CFA Fr150 for grade two, it said.
The farmer price was raised to CFA Fr300 a kilogram from CFA Fr225 soon
after last January's 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc.
The latest rise for superior grade cocoa was in response to the sharp
increase in the cost of living since then, the paper said.
Analysts said Togo's annual (apparent) cocoa output had fallen to about
4,000 tonnes from over 10,000 tonnes in the late 1980s, mainly because less
was being smuggled in from Ghana.
The decree said the 1993-94 Togolese cocoa marketing season would close on
September 30.
At the London Commodity Exchange yesterday the second position cocoa futures
price closed at Pounds 1,072 a tonne, equivalent to about Dollars 1.64 a
kilogram, up about Pounds 140 since the beginning of this year and Pounds
300 from 12 months ago.

<TEXT>
The 11 people missing following major explosions at the large Porgera gold
mine, in Papua New Guinea's remote Enga province, were yesterday presumed
dead.
All were employees of Dyno Wesfarmers, which operates the explosives
facility close to the mine site, where the blasts occurred on Tuesday
morning. Five were Australian and the remainder were PNG nationals.
The Porgera mine remained closed and all its milling operations suspended
yesterday while damage assessment continued. No date has yet been given for
its reopening. The four joint venture partners in the mine - Placer Pacific,
Renison Goldfields, Highlands Gold, and the PNG government - said there had
been 'surface damage to sheeting and building claddings of support
infrastructure. They added that some accommodation and messing facilities
were also damaged.
More information on when operations might restart may be released this
morning.
Porgera is one of the world's largest gold mines, with annual production of
over 1m ounces.
It is also a major source of the revenue for the Papua New Guinea
government: 'All I want to say as a government is that we are concerned
because it's a major project that is of a lot of benefit to PNG,' commented
Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, yesterday.
News of the explosion and the mine's closure affected share prices of all
three corporate partners. Renison's dropped by 15 cents in early trading to
ADollars 4.45 while Highlands' were down 5 cents, to ADollars 1.45. Those of
Placer Pacific, which manages the mine, suffered worst with a 20 cents drop
to ADollars 3.20.

report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE traders at the London Commodity Exchange said supply worries and a
Brazilian meteorology institute forecast of frost today in Parana state
helped keep sellers mostly away, on a day when futures see-sawed in a
Dollars 99 range.
The November delivery position ended the day Dollars 18 lower at Dollars
3,555 a tonne after reaching a high of Dollars 3,625 and touching a low of
Dollars 3,533.
COCOA futures slid in late trade on a wave of speculative selling encouraged
by technical factors. The December position ended Pounds 24 down at Pounds
1,072 a tonne.
London Metal Exchange contracts were generally lower at the close, as a
wide-ranging and volatile COPPER market continued to pull the strings.
The three months copper price almost hit both ends of the current Dollars 50
trading range, before closing at Dollars 2,415 a tonne, Dollars 6 below
Tuesday's kerb close.
ALUMINIUM was a partial exception to the general trend, as late speculative
buying lifted the three months price to a close of Dollars 1,472 a tonne, up
Dollars 3 on the day. However, the market mostly reacted to copper's
movements, and was still some way off hitting a Dollars 1,485 upside target,
traders said.
LEAD rallied slightly from mid-afternoon lows, but remained easier after
falling conclusively below Dollars 600 a tonne when stop-loss selling orders
were triggered.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price falls for fifth day
in succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold prices yesterday fell for the fifth successive day and analysts
suggested they might have further to fall before staging a recovery in the
final quarter of 1994.
The precious metal tested a critical technical support level - Dollars 378 a
troy ounce - but remained just above it at the close in London at Dollars
378.70, down Dollars 1.75 from Tuesday's close. Gold has slipped by Dollars
9.70 an ounce or 2.5 per cent in the past week.
Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, suggested
the usual northern hemisphere summer 'lull' was causing gold's downward
drift. He said gold was likely to remain under pressure for the rest of
August and might fall another Dollars 4 or Dollars 5 an ounce. Nevertheless,
for the fourth quarter he forecast gold would trade between Dollars 370 and
Dollars 405 an ounce, compared with an average price of Dollars 383 for the
first nine months of this year.
He said some pressure on gold was coming from disillusioned US hedge funds,
which had expected the metal to go to Dollars 400 an ounce. Now they were
selling and putting their money elsewhere.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that
gold's Dollars 5 fall so far this week contrasted with the 'tramline
trading' of recent weeks when the price was often seemed trapped in a
Dollars 2 range.
He said that there had been a good deal of selling by producers recently,
which had been soaked up by some physical demand. And, while speculative
funds had helped to drive down the gold price this week, there was another
element at work in the market that was hard to identify. 'Something subtle
is going on. It is hard to say what,' he added.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenyan tea output down by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Output of Kenyan tea, the country's main commodity export, fell by about a
fifth in the first half of 1994 compared with the same period in the
previous year, a leading brokerage firm said yesterday, reports Reuters from
Nairobi.
African Tea Brokers said the crop figure for June was posted at 16.12m kg, a
decline of 929,766 kg from June 1993.
'The cumulative figure now stands at 91.58m kg, a fall of 21.85m kg over
last year,' ATB said. The firm is based in Mombasa, where east Africa's
weekly tea export auctions are held.
Temperatures in Kenya's tea growing areas had been low with intermittent
rain, farmers in growing areas said. Growth had been restricted and crop
levels were generally at a seasonal low.
'West of the Rift (Valley), Kericho has been cold and fairly dry apart from
some rain towards the end of July. Leaf intake has shown a slight decline,'
said one farmer at Kericho, a key growing belt 300 km north-west of Nairobi.
'In Nandi conditions remain wet with cold early morning temperatures. Slight
hail has had no effect on crops with levels now rising,' he added.
'Areas east of the Rift have experienced cold mornings with sunny intervals
in the afternoons and well distributed showers. Crop intake is maintained.'
Britain and Pakistan were the main buyers of Kenyan tea in June, while Egypt
bought lower grades. Sudan, North America and South Africa also increased
their buying, ATB said.
The firm said there was continued good demand for all Malawian primary
grades, with prices firm to dearer.
'Night temperatures there were cold with patches of early morning fog and
leaf intake continued to decline,' ATB said. Malawi produced 27.15m kg of
tea in the January-June period of 1994 compared with 26.73m kg in same
period a year earlier.
ATB put Uganda's tea output in January-March at 2.7m kg, up from 2.5m kg the
first three months of 1993, and Tanzania's at 7.1m kg, unchanged from
January-March last year. In Zimbabwe 6.7m kg was produced in the first three
months, compared with 5.3m kg last year, the firm said.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diplomatic offensive planned to
end banana war - The latest Caribbean move in the dispute over EU imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year after the European Union imposed its new banana import regime, its
traditional suppliers are to launch a diplomatic offensive aimed at ending
continuing criticism from some EU members and Latin American fruit producers
who feel the arrangement is unfair.
Caribbean leaders plan to visit Europe later this year to argue for their
bananas, and will ask friendly Latin American countries to suggest to others
that they moderate their criticism of the import regime.
Caribbean leaders meeting in Barbados last month agreed that there was still
a threat to the banana regime, and that although some Latin American
countries had mended fences with the European Union, the market for fruit
from the Caribbean and other members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific
group was still in danger from continuing attempts to increase the access
for cheaper Latin American 'dollar' bananas.
The EU import regime, which became effective in July of last year, allows
the union's traditional suppliers in the ACP group access for 30 per cent of
Europe's demand for bananas. Imports from Latin America are limited and
attract import duties.
ACP producers, mainly those in the Caribbean, have argued that their
industry, on which some national economies depend, would be devastated if
they were denied these preferences. Latin American producers, who are more
price competitive, have countered that the import regime contravenes the
spirit of free trade.
The region's fears were fuelled by the recent decision of Germany to
approach the European Court for a second time to try to end the EU's banana
import quotas. Germany has consistently argued that the system is unfair and
discriminates against German importers and consumers. 'Germany, the
strongest opponent of the EU's banana import regime within the Union, is now
the president of the European Council,' the Caricom leaders noted.
The EU's import regime has also been challenged in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, with a panel determining that it is discriminatory. The
panel's report, however, has not been adopted, and the Caribbean producers
are keen that it should not be.
The Caribbean leaders' conclusion that there is a need for increased efforts
to resolve the matter was influenced by what they saw as 'continuing
pressure' by some Latin producers and some 'friendly' countries such as the
US, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Australia to have the second panel report
adopted.
A key part of the planned diplomatic battle is to get these countries to
relent in their pressure to have the Gatt panel's findings adopted. The ACP
producers will also try to enlist the support of Costa Rica, Colombia,
Venezuela and Nicaragua in persuading other Latin exporters to seek a
negotiated solution with the EU.
The ACP producers have been buoyed, none the less, by compromises reached
between the EU and four Latin American countries - Costa Rica, Colombia,
Nicaragua and Venezuela - 'and the confirmation to maintain the overall
quota limit and allocations by the EU with reductions of the in-quota duty
from Ecu100 (Pounds 78.60) to Ecu75 a tonne and the advanced application
from 1994 to 1995,' the Caribbean leaders said after their meeting.
In March, Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela accepted the EU's
increased quota offer, and agreed to drop their complaint to the Gatt over
the import regime.
Under the agreement, the EU will increase the annual quota for Latin
American bananas from 2m tonnes to 2.1m tonnes this year, and to 2.2m tonnes
next year. Costa Rica's quota is 23.4 per cent, Colombia's 21 per cent,
Nicaragua's 3 per cent and Venezuela's 2 per cent. Ecuador, Guatemala
Honduras and Panama will share 46.3 per cent, with the Dominican Republic
getting the remaining 4.3 per cent.
The mission led by the prime ministers, which is expected to visit Europe in
late September and early October, 'will seek discussions with the states of
the Troika (France, Germany and Greece) and the United Kingdom, the
president of the Commission and the president of the European parliament,'
the Caribbean leaders agreed.
One technical issue that the Caribbean leaders will want clarified when they
visit Europe is the transfer of quotas among ACP exporters. Countries with
higher than normal production have not been able to use the quota for others
who may have suffered a shortfall.
'Transferability of quotas has been allowed for the Latin producers and the
ACP has had undertakings that this will be done for them,' says an official
of the Caribbean Community secretariat. 'We would like to see this
implemented.'
They will also raise the delicate matter of financial assistance to banana
producers affected by the imposition of the EU's import regime. The UK
originally objected to this aspect of the plan, which proposes a fund of
Ecu60m a year over three years to cover loss of income and to aid
agricultural diversification. But it subsequently withdrew its objection.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries rally after late buying
spree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds regained their stride yesterday afternoon after data on
July car sales proved to be weaker than expected.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 higher
at 86 1/2 , with the yield slipping to 7.379 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/16 , to yield 5.939 per cent.
The softer tone in early trading gave way to an afternoon burst of buying on
news that sales of US-made cars had slowed for the fourth consecutive month.
Prices across the board slipped in the morning after the Commerce Department
said its index of leading economic indicators was up 0.2 per cent from the
previous month, against forecasts centred on a 0.1 per cent gain. Later, the
government announced that new orders for factory goods in June had risen 0.8
per cent, in line with expectations.
By holding its losses to modest levels, the market signalled its inclination
to pause ahead of Friday's more crucial employment data.
Traders were also taking a breather ahead of the details of the Treasury's
quarterly refunding operation. When the afternoon announcement brought no
surprises, bonds moved higher. As expected, the Treasury next week will
offer Dollars 17bn in three-year notes, Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes and
Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds.
Italian bonds put on one of the strongest performances as political tensions
appeared to subside after members of the coalition government indicated on
Tuesday that they did not want a government crisis.
In largely futures-led trading, the September BTP future on Liffe rose 0.70
point to 103.25.
However, the issue over the division of the prime minister's business and
political interests remains unresolved and could drag on, weighing on
markets in weeks to come.
Moreover, observers fear the government may run into problems when it seeks
to implement some of its planned budget cuts later this year.
'We still have the possibility of negative news in September,' said Mr Marco
Pianelli, southern Europe economist at Nomura Research Institute in London.
'Cuts in the pensions and health sector will be a true test of the
government's credibility in stabilising Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio.'
Spanish bonds lagged Italy in spite of the Bank of Spain's unexpected cut in
its key money rate by 15 basis points to 7.35 per cent.
However, the move triggered little follow-through buying, partly because the
Spanish market has outperformed other high-yielding markets in recent weeks,
benefiting from financial and political woes in other countries such as
Sweden and Italy. The Spanish September bond future rose 0.18 point to
92.13.
Long-dated UK government bonds ended a volatile day little changed,
outperformed by the shorter maturities. The short end of the yield curve had
sold off sharply in recent sessions on fears of near-term base-rate
increases, but increasing confidence that the Bank of England is not about
to lift rates supported the shorter maturities yesterday.
The September long gilt future on Liffe ended at 103 3/16 , unchanged on the
day.
German bonds had another range-bound day dominated largely by futures as
investors kept a low profile. The September bund futures contract closed at
94.01, down 0.05 point on the day.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Bonds: IFC brings CDollars 300m zero coupon
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent spate of Canadian dollar bond offerings continued yesterday, with
deals for the International Finance Corporation and Canadian Global Funding,
a special purpose vehicle.
The heavy schedule of Canadian dollar eurobond redemptions, totalling
CDollars 1.8bn in August, has prompted a steady flow of reinvestment into
the Canadian market.
European retail investors are replacing maturing bonds with new Canadian
dollar bonds because they do not want to realise losses incurred on the
currency.
In addition, the high yields available in the Canadian market, which has
sold off sharply this year, has attracted some new money to the market. With
10-year Canadian government bonds yielding nearly 200 basis points more than
US Treasuries, investors are starting to look again at the market.
IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, brought the first zero coupon
deal in Canadian dollars for about a year, a CDollars 300m six-year deal
arranged by Daiwa Europe.
'The market has sold off so much that zero coupon bonds now look quite
attractive,' said a manager at the London arm of one Canadian house. 'It's a
leveraged play on a positive outcome for the Canadian market,' he added.
Also in the Canadian sector, Canadian Global Funding, a vehicle guaranteed
by Financial Security Assurance, a specialist insurance company, added a
further CDollars 100m to its CDollars 150m 10-year deal launched last week
via Hambros.
The combination of a 10 per cent coupon and a triple-A rating proved
enticing for retail investors, who do not normally venture so far along the
yield curve, and also attracted some institutions.
The original deal was launched at a spread of 70 basis points over the
curve, but had tightened to 68 basis points yesterday, the spread at which
the new tranche was priced.
British Telecommunications plans to set up a Dollars 1.5bn multi-currency
Euro-commercial paper programme, arranged by NatWest Capital Markets, with a
total of six dealers. The programme will be used, in conjunction with BT's
existing Dollars 1bn US commercial programme, to finance the company's
investment in a 20 per cent interest in MCI Communications.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Equity futures trading dreams
begin to fade - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dream of expanding equity derivatives trading in London through the
introduction of mid-250 index futures appears to have turned sour.
The first futures contract on the FT-SE mid-250 index - the 250 biggest
stocks below the FT-SE 100 - was launched at the begining of February on the
OMLX exchange, a screen-based securities and derivatives exchange started in
Sweden.
Liffe's mid-250 product started trading three weeks later.
But six months on, some market participants have not only started
questioning the usefulness of the mid-250 futures contract as a product but
suggest the OMLX should throw in the towel.
Volumes on that exchange have continued to slide from a peak of 5,778 in the
first month to no contracts in July.
Liffe's contract has performed with an average of 3,500 contracts in each of
the last three months. By comparison, the FT-SE 100 contract traded an
average of 342,000 contracts a month over the same period.
Several reasons are cited for the the failure of the new contract.
Chief among these is the unfortunate timing of the launch. US interest rates
were raised the day the OMLX started trading. This not only triggered a
large correction in the stock market but also inspired a move by
institutional investors back to FT-SE 100 equities.
Products associated with the 250 thus fell out of favour.
Dealers also point to a lack of liquidity in the 250 stocks. Stocks in this
group are by nature much less liquid than FT-SE 100 constituents. Traders
therefore have less scope to arbitrage.
Some market participants describe the launch as premature. Mr Barry
Marshall, head of derivatives investment at the Gartmore fund management
group said: 'It was introduced a little too early. We still haven't managed
to persuade all our clients to use the FT-SE 100 future.
'More effort should have gone into helping clients understand the benefits
of futures rather than introduce new products.'
Mr Nigel Croft, derivatives analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believes there is a
market for the mid-250 index future but not as it is presently used: 'I
think there will be demand for it as a tool for asset allocation,
particularly as more people get used to asset allocation in one country and
between sectors.'
However, the general problems that confront the mid-250 futures contract as
a product cannot mask the specific failure of trading on the OMLX exchange
which seems to have been severely squeezed by Liffe.
Many dealers say they prefer the face-to-face dealing and the geographical
proximity offered on the Liffe. Institutions that have used the 250 contract
have also indicated a preference for dealing through Liffe. A trader at BZW
said: 'They tend to see Liffe as more creditworthy even though the risk is
with us when we take on the deal.'
Independent traders known as locals, a mainstay of the Liffe trading system,
have also shyed away from the OMLX system.
'We prefer to just walk over to the mid-250 pitch and deal. With OMLX we
have to phone the order through, fiddle about and so forth. . . it just
takes more time to deal,' said one local.
The lack of liquidity in the sector as a whole has also prevented the OMLX
from benefitting from the only advantage it appears to have over Liffe, that
of offering traded options in the mid-250 index. Liffe has yet to introduce
mid-250 traded options.
As one trader put it: 'You need liquidity in the futures to get into the
traded options. Without that there is no reason for us to be involved.'
Directors at the OMLX, acknowledging the less than impressive performance,
introduced in June 'flex' future and options which allow dealers to adjust
the strike prices and expiry dates of contracts like over-the-counter
products. The move was designed to inject liquidity into the market and to
attract any OTC mid 250 business.
But for some it was already too late, and they were not prepared to try
anything new offered by the OMLX exchange.
A manager at derivatives traders Tullet &amp; Tokyo said: 'As far as I am
concerned that product on the OMLX is dead. It just doesn't work.'
But Mr David Courtney, marketing director at the OMLX refuses to concede
defeat. He said: 'Our members recently decided that we there was still a
need for us and decided we should continue. We plan to do so.'
But so too does Liffe. This week it announced its contract had received
clearence from US authorities to be sold to US customers.

The French government yesterday granted formal recognition to Germany's DTB
futures exchange, clearing the way for the implementation of a co-operation
deal with Matif, its French counterpart.
France's economics ministry said in a statement that the first of two phases
of the July 1993 deal between the DTB and Matif would involve the French
futures exchange supervising the installation and operation of DTB trading
screens in the offices of Matif members.
This phase will be implemented after France's summer holidays.
The second phase of the agreement, which allows for the entry of Matif
products on the DTB exchange, is ex-pected to take place during 1995.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Upbeat forecast from
Saint-Gobain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, should raise
profits this year even without the impact of capital gains due to be earned
from the sale of its paper and packaging activities, according to Mr
Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman.
In an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial daily, Mr
Beffa said the group could count on satisfactory growth this year and
improve on 1993, when group profits fell by 45 per cent to FFr1.31bn
(Dollars 245m).
He cited strategic factors behind the FFr5.6bn sale of its paper and
packaging activities, mostly held by its Cellulose du Pin division, to
Jefferson Smurfit of Ireland.
'A group like ours has to develop its activities with the aim of being among
the leaders in each area. The wood and paper businesses lacked this
dimension,' Mr Beffa said. Cellulose du Pin, he said, was 'too small and too
French' and would have stronger prospects as part of a larger international
group.
The disposal will also remove a source of losses for the French group.
Last year, Cellulose du Pin lost FFr1.1bn, as the sector reeled under the
impact of a severe recession. Recovery is under way, however, and
rationalisation measures prompt industry analysts to predict an improved
performance this year.
The sale should also help reduce Saint-Gobain's debts, already trimmed from
the FFr15bn at the end of 1993 by a FFr3.6bn capital increase launched in
March. After that, the debt to equity ratio was reduced from almost 40 per
cent to about 28 per cent.
Most important, however, the sale of the paper and packaging operations will
allow Saint-Gobain to focus its management and financial resources on its
core activities - glass, building materials and ceramics.
Mr Beffa said the group was entering a new phase of industrial investments.
Next year, he said, would see a clear increase above the FFr4.2bn of
investments already made.
All core businesses would benefit, according to Saint-Gobain, but particular
emphasis would be given to its flat glass activities.
Expansion would be achieved through direct investments and possibly
acquisitions in emerging markets, such as eastern Europe and Asia, and in
areas where the company is not already present.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney says rights issue
80% subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the French theme park and resorts operator, said last night its
rights issue to raise FFr5.95bn (Dollars 1.11bn) was 80 per cent subscribed
by the public and its parent company, Walt Disney of the US, AP-DJ reports
from Paris.
'Given the current market conditions and the timing of the rights issue, the
company is pleased with the level of subscription and the confidence
expressed by its shareholders,' Euro Disney said in a brief statement.
In one of the biggest capital raising operations seen on the Paris bourse,
Euro Disney created almost 600m new shares at FFr10 each.
The issue allowed existing shareholders - including Walt Disney, which has
49 per cent - to subscribe to seven new shares for every two held.
The operation resulted, however, in a huge dilution of the previously
existing 170m shares and cut Euro Disney's market share price to one-third
of its pre-rights level.
A syndicate of creditor banks led by Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque
Indosuez and state-controlled Caisse des Depots &amp; Consignations is
underwriting the issue and presumably would take up the remaining 20 per
cent.
However, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz, a nephew of King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia, agreed in June to act as a 'back-up underwriter' to the rights
issue by buying unsubscribed shares.
At that time, Euro Disney had said that Prince Al-Waleed would acquire up to
a 24 per cent stake in the company.
Euro Disney last night declined to say what stake the Saudi prince would
hold at this point.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Chase pays Dollars 348m for
mortgage bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan yesterday announced an agreement to pay Dollars 348m for
American Residential, a California-based mortgage bank, in a move that it
said would make Chase one of the top five US home loan institutions.
The deal marks a continuation of Chase's ambition to grow specialised
nationwide financial services units, for instance in home mortgages and
credit cards. It is also likely to prompt an acceleration in the takeover of
mortgage lenders, given the declared intention of some of the country's
biggest commercial banks to expand their involvement in the business.
In recent days, NationsBank had also been talked of as a possible bidder for
American Residential, helping to push up the company's share price ahead of
the Chase announcement. In May, Chemical Banking announced a Dollars 330m
purchase of Margaretten, a New Jersey-based institution.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive of BankAmerica, said
before the Chase announcement that the California-based bank was more likely
to expand through the acquisition of specialised institutions such as
mortgage banks than through purchases of full-scale commercial banks.
Although mortgage banks in the US have suffered from rising interest rates
which have brought an end to last year's record refinancing and new loan
business, they remain attractive sources of fee income for banks.
In addition to fees for originating loans, which they then sell on, the
lenders generate income from servicing portfolios of mortgage loans.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Smurfit plays catalyst for
change - Takeover could spark further consolidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit's takeover of Cellulose du Pin, the paper and packaging
activities of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building
materials group, could start a ripple of consolidation in the highly
fragmented European packaging industry.
'The industry needs more consolidation to be healthy and I hope we can be
something of a catalyst in that,' said Mr Howard Kilroy, Smurfit's president
and chief operations director.
Although Jefferson will become the largest producer of corrugated board in
Europe and one of the largest packaging companies after the merger, it will
hold only a 10 per cent market share. Industry leaders command a share of 20
to 30 per cent of sales in other sectors.
Smurfit is still looking for further expansion in the paper and packaging
business as the industry emerges from its worst recession.
Mr Kilroy believes Smurfit can turn round Cellulose du Pin's loss-making
activities quickly on the back of the industry upturn which started this
year, and the rationalisation effort which has gone into the French group's
operations in recent years.
'They are some good assets which have been well-invested and are just coming
out of some historical problems,' says Mr Kilroy.
The packaging arm made a loss of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 204m) last year, but Mr
Kilroy says that much of that can be accounted for by a fluff pulp plant and
a wood business which are not included in the takeover deal. In addition,
the French group had incurred restructuring costs in making the operations
more efficient.
The company reckons that the takeover will enhance its earnings per share in
1996.
The merger of Smurfit's European operations with the French company will
pivot Jefferson into the market leader for corrugated board, with production
overtaking the Swedish company, SCA, by 200,000 tonnes.
Corrugated board, used predominantly in the manufacture of cardboard boxes,
is a leading indicator of economic recovery as it is such a widely used
packaging material. Industry watchers say demand is picking up fast in
Europe.
Mr Tim Rothwell, packaging analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London
securities house, says demand is up by 12 per cent in Italy and between 3
per cent and 5 per cent in Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK.
At the same time, raw materials costs are increasing - waste paper prices
have risen by up to 50 per cent following a 30 per cent upturn in virgin
pulp prices this year.
In some areas, waste paper which is used for making corrugated board is not
available. Two German mills have been forced to suspend operations this year
for lack of raw materials. Smurfit is well equipped to provide waste paper
to Cellulose du Pin's French corrugated business, which Mr Kilroy describes
as a 'jewel'. Smurfit runs the second largest waste paper recycling business
in France.
Some analysts are sceptical that the company will be able to make the
savings it says it will to turn the business round. Mr Dennis Christie,
packaging analyst at James Capel, the London brokerage, notes that
corrugated paper producers are finding it hard to pass on higher raw
materials costs to their customers.
'The company might suffer a short-term margin squeeze, but it is a good time
in the cycle to purchase, and over the longer term it is probably a good
thing,' says Mr Christie.
He says the purchase price paid by Smurfit for the French company is
relatively cheap compared with other companies in the sector. He points out
that Smurfit is paying a price equal to 70 per cent of the turnover of
Cellulose du Pin, whereas similar companies have a market capitalisation
equal to 120 per cent to 130 per cent of sales on European stock markets.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: American General pins hopes for
Unitrin bid on shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American General, the US insurance and consumer finance group, yesterday
indicated that it did not plan to intensify its Dollars 2.6bn battle for
control of Unitrin, a smaller financial group, but was hoping pressure from
that company's shareholders would lead to a quick deal.
The Texas-based company's bid, first made to Unitrin's board in early July
and revealed on Tuesday, has been rejected by the Unitrin board.
A takeover would add to American General's home-sales force, which
specialises in selling insurance and other financial products to mostly
blue-collar households in the US.
Mr Harold Hook, American General's chairman and chief executive, said the
announcement had been made to encourage Unitrin's shareholders to put
pressure on the company to accept a deal. 'If the shareholders don't bring
the pressure, we probably wouldn't bring a siege approach,' he said. 'This
isn't the opening shot in a long war.'
An important part of American General's campaign involves the 17 per cent of
Unitrin's shares held by Mr Henry Singleton, who until earlier this year was
the company's chairman. Mr Singleton, 78, was instrumental in building up
Unitrin and is believed to retain considerable influence.
A successful American General bid would throw into question three large
equity stakes in US companies held by Unitrin, worth around Dollars 1bn.
These are a 28 per cent interest in Litton Industries, the defence
electronics company; 28 per cent of Western Atlas, an oil services company
spun off by Litton earlier this year; and 43 per cent of Curtiss-Wright, an
aerospace components maker.
American General said it believes that Unitrin, with shareholders' funds of
Dollars 2bn, has Dollars 1.4bn too much capital. If successful in the bid,
it would be likely to sell the assets.

<TEXT>
Pohang Iron &amp; Steel (Posco), South Korea's largest steel-maker, reported an
8.2 per cent increase in net profits to Won145bn (Dollars 181m) for the
first half of 1994.
It lowered its profit forecast for the year to Won331bn from Won344bn in the
expectation of further foreign exchange losses on yen-denominated debt,
which curbed earnings during the first half.
Posco, the world's second largest steel company, had a 5.6 per cent rise in
sales to Won3,630bn.
It expects sales of Won7,240bn for the full year.
Increased demand from Korea's main industries helped maintain Posco's
position as one of the world's most profitable steel companies.
Profits rose due to higher steel prices and the declining cost of raw
materials. But earnings fell slightly below market expectations due to the
foreign exchange losses resulting from the strong yen.

Hitachi, the Japanese electronics group, is offering seven of its own shares
for every 10 held by outside investors in Hitachi Sales Corporation, its
distribution offshoot.
The parent already has a 59 per cent stake in Hitachi Sales and the offer
values the rest at some Y39.85bn (Dollars 398m).
Shares in the subsidiary have fallen by Y95 since Hitachi announced its
intentions last week, including a Y5 dip to Y625 yesterday.
With Hitachi's own shares up Y51 since last Thursday's announcement and
unchanged on the day at Y1,010, the all-scrip offer implies a bid premium of
some 13 per cent.
Hitachi Sales, with revenues of Y433bn in its latest year, operates a chain
of retail outlets. These have been hit by the downturn in Japanese consumer
spending, and profitability for the past two years has been marginal.
The deal, says Hitachi, will streamline product development and marketing.

values the rest at some Y39.85bn (Dollars 398m).
Shares in the subsidiary have fallen by Y95 since Hitachi announced its
intentions last week, including a Y5 dip to Y625 yesterday.
With Hitachi's own shares up Y51 since last Thursday's announcement and
unchanged on the day at Y1,010, the all-scrip offer implies a bid premium of
some 13 per cent.
Hitachi Sales, with revenues of Y433bn in its latest year, operates a chain
of retail outlets. These have been hit by the downturn in Japanese consumer
spending, and profitability for the past two years has been marginal.
The deal, says Hitachi, will streamline product development and marketing
and rationalise management resources. Officials deny suggestions that the
move may be a precursor to a withdrawal from consumer electronics, which
represents about 10 per cent of its business.
New lines are being sought for its stores. The company yesterday joined Sega
Enterprises to market the Sega Saturn, a video-game machine to be launched
in November.

Rodamco, the international property arm of Robeco Group, the Dutch pension
fund, has acquired two of Spain's largest shopping centres in a Pta12bn
(Dollars 92m) deal, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The Dutch group bought Parque Sur, a 110 sq metre complex in Madrid, and
Bahia Sur, a 57 sq metre retail area outside Cadiz. The price could rise to
Pta15bn if post-purchase financial criteria are met. The centres were
launched by Parques Urbanos, a domestic developer that collapsed last year,
and were owned by Banco Exterior, part of the Argentaria banking group.
Spain's biggest shopping centre, La Vaguada in north Madrid, valued at close
to Pta12bn, is poised to change hands under the terms of a pre-contract
signed between its owners, Compagnie Financiere de Suez, and Arc
Union-Unibail, the French investment group.

Baer Holding, the Zurich-based private banking and asset management group,
has reported a 24 per cent slide in first-half net income to SFr54.2m
(Dollars 42m) after sharply reduced profits from trading.
Baer said trading income tumbled 68 per cent to SFr36m 'owing to the
unfavourable developments on the financial markets'.
Foreign exchange and precious metals trading profits were off by a third to
SFr40m, while trading on the bank's own portfolio resulted in a SFr4m loss
compared with a profit of SFr55m in the extremely favourable conditions
prevailing in the first half of 1993.
Net interest income was flat at SFr60.5m while net commission income rose 28
per cent to SFr144.9m.
At June 30, total assets stood at SFr7.46bn, 3 per cent lower than at the
end of 1993, due to the weaker US dollar. Shareholders' equity, on the other
hand, was up 3 per cent to SFr947.6m.
Assets under management, excluding global custody business, stood at
SFr43.6bn, down 3 per cent since the end of 1993.

<TEXT>
Mexico's finance ministry is expected to give approval soon to more than 100
applications from foreign financial institutions to open up subsidiaries
this year.
The institutions, which include banks, brokerages, 'non-banks', insurance,
factoring and leasing firms, are allowed into Mexico under the terms of the
North America Free Trade Agreement, which opens up gradually Mexico's
financial sector. Non-US and Canadian banks have to apply through their
North American subsidiaries.
The finance ministry said it had received applications for 20 banks, 17
brokerages, 13 insurance companies, 17 non-banks, 12 leasing companies, and
four factoring businesses, among others, before the July 31 deadline.
Officials said barring unforeseen problems, all applications would be given
authorisation, and should be operating by the end of the year.
The foreign groups will initially invest about 9.329bn pesos (Dollars
2.74bn), and lend in the first year 11.024bn pesos, according to the
government.
In the brokerage sector, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan,
Citibank, Chemical Bank, Morgan Stanley, Bankers Trust, Lehman Brothers,
Deutsche Bank, Continental Bank, ING Capital Holdings, Indosuez, Santander,
Swiss Bank, James Capel and Baring Brothers have applied.
Some, such as J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Santander, ING, and
Chemical bank also applied for banks.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel figures beat
forecasts with 33% gain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Economic recovery in Europe helped Akzo Nobel, the Dutch-based chemicals
group, to lift net profit by nearly 33 per cent in the second quarter,
exceeding most analysts' forecasts.
The company, which said the results were better than it had expected,
attributed part of the gains to synergy created by Akzo's acquisition last
year of Nobel, the Swedish chemicals and coatings group.
Group net profit surged to Fl 288m (Dollars 162.26m) from a pro forma Fl
217m in the same period of 1993.
When Fl 75m in extraordinary charges for reorganisation in the fibres
division are subtracted, the rate of growth in net profit was 48 per cent.
Operating profit rose by 52 per cent to Fl 547m, on turnover up 5.5 per cent
at Fl 5.56bn.
'Results were better almost across the board, both for the former Akzo
businesses and for the former Nobel ones,' said Mr Syb Bergsma, finance
director.
The chemicals sector saw the biggest increase in operating profit, up 88 per
cent at Fl 173m, but coatings and pharmaceuticals also posted large gains of
41 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.
Fibres, traditionally the weakest of the group's four businesses, saw
operating profit improve to Fl 30m from Fl 7m, but Mr Bergsma said this was
still unsatisfactory.
Demand for fibres was higher in the latest quarter, but this positive note
was largely offset by strong downward pressure on prices, particularly for
textile fibres such as polyester.
The company said it was studying a range of options, including strategic
alliances and business swaps with other companies, to bolster the fibres
division, but declined to give details.
Mr Bergsma said Akzo Nobel expected its second-half results to be higher
than in the same period of 1993, reflecting economic recovery in Europe and
continuing economic growth in the US.
However, he noted that the group also faced uncertain factors, such as the
direction of the dollar and raw material prices. A weaker dollar is, on
balance, negative for Akzo Nobel.
In the second quarter, currency movements had little effect on results, but
since then the dollar has dropped against the guilder.

<TEXT>
Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest operator of cable systems in the US,
and Viacom, the entertainment group, yesterday confirmed that they were in
talks about a strategic pact between some of their businesses.
TCI said yesterday it had been in conversations for some time with Viacom as
well as other companies, but declined to comment on reports that the Viacom
talks focused on a potential merger of cable and programming operations and
on the sale of Viacom's Madison Square Garden division.
Viacom, which earlier this year succeeded in its long struggle to take over
Paramount Communications, has been looking for ways to rationalise its huge
portfolio.
The attraction of an alliance between the two groups, according to
investment analysts, would be to link Viacom's Showtime pay-cable operations
with TCI's Encore service. TCI could also add value to Viacom's cable
television operations, they said.
However, any talks would have to address the antitrust suit filed by Viacom
against TCI last year during the tussle over Paramount. TCI threw its weight
behind QVC, a rival bidder for Paramount.
Viacom is known to be keen to sell Madison Square Garden, which it bought
from Paramount. The division includes the New York Rangers hockey team and
the New York Knicks basketball team.
Viacom said yesterday it had been discussing a number of initiatives, but
would not comment on speculation.

First-half operating profits at the Bayerische Vereinsbank group rose 8.7
per cent to DM574m (Dollars 365.6m) compared with the first six months of
last year, in spite of losses on own-account trading and sharply increased
capital spending.
The main force behind the result was the Bavarian institution's strength in
the busy German mortgage market, which helped bolster interest income by
17.5 per cent to just over DM2bn.
This strength - the bank is believed to control more than 20 per cent of
domestic mortgage business - showed in a 36.5 per cent surge in total
operating profits at the German holding company. Net interest income surged
almost 26 per cent to DM1.47bn.
While the recent volatility in securities markets led to higher write-downs
for bonds and a loss of DM7.9m on its own-account business after a profit of
DM150m in the first half of 1993, commission income rose almost 8 per cent
to DM543m.
Partial operating income, excluding own-account trading results and before
risk provisions, rose almost 21 per cent to DM956.5m.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were some 12 per cent lower at DM376m.
In common with other banks reporting recently - excluding Deutsche -
Bayerische has this year started publishing half-time figures in direct
comparison with the first half of the previous accounting period.
. Bayerische said the German practice of comparing an interim figure with
the relevant proportion of the previous year's full results would continue
in parallel until agreement had been reached on a common domestic standard.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Portugal's banks take their
corners - The battle for market share is warming up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloves are off in the normally sedate world of Portuguese banking. Banco
Comercial Portugues's hostile bid for Banco Portugues do Atlantico is the
opening bout of what is expected to be a fierce contest for market share.
BCP's cash offer of Es132bn (Dollars 819m) for a controlling stake of 40 per
cent of BPA, a rival almost twice its size, has important implications for a
financial system where state control has long held aggressive instincts in
check and most banks are just beginning to find their feet after
privatisation.
The takeover would make BCP so much bigger than its main competitors that
other large acquisitions or mergers would almost certainly follow. If the
bid is successful, BCP will move to second position, from fifth, in the
ranking of Portuguese banks by total assets.
Less than a decade after BCP was founded by a small group of Portuguese
businessmen, it is bidding to become the country's largest private-sector
banking group. The new group would be almost as big as Caixa Geral de
Depositos, which dominates Portuguese banking with a 28 per cent market
share. CGD is now the only state-owned institution among Portugal's top five
banks.
'BCP's competitors will all be forced to rethink their strategies if the
takeover goes ahead,' says Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, of Banco Espirito Santo.
BES, for example, has an 11 per cent share of the market, compared with 9.5
per cent for BCP. But control of BPA would more than double BCP's share to
24 per cent.
BCP's pugnacious move has taken Portugal by surprise. But concentrations of
banking power had been forecast. 'Portuguese banks are too small to compete
internationally and there is big potential for rationalisation,' says Mr
Joao Rendeiro, a Lisbon fund manager. 'BCP is taking the first step in an
inevitable reshaping of the sector.'
On one level, the outcome of the bid depends on the solidarity of BPA's core
shareholders. BCP is only likely to be successful if one of the Portuguese
businesses that together own a controlling stake of 27 per cent of BPA -
which they are now seeking to enlarge - abandons an agreement not to sell
outside the group. The offer of Es3,000 a share is 14 times 1993 earnings.
But BCP must also win the approval of the finance ministry, the stock
exchange commission and the central bank. The government's commitment to
liberalising the financial sector, which was almost totally nationalised
after Portugal's left-wing revolution in 1974, would appear be in BCP's
favour. Blocking the bid could be viewed as interference in the market.
Analysts say BCP's offer, the equivalent of 2.3 times BPA's 1993 book value,
also sets an attractive price level for future bank privatisations. The sale
of sixth-ranked Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor and the state's remaining 25 per
cent holding in BPA will virtually complete bank re-privatisations, which
began in 1989.
BCP's move would also seem to be towards creating a strong Portuguese group
equipped to compete on a European level - a trend eagerly advocated by Mr
Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister. But although Portuguese businesses
control BCP, the bank's largest single shareholder is Banco Central Hispano,
the Spanish banking group. BCH owns 20 per cent but its voting rights are
limited to 10 per cent.
Official espousal of a traditional Portuguese aversion to economic dominance
by Spanish companies is only thinly veiled. Banesto, another Spanish bank,
is under pressure to reduce its direct and indirect holding of about 50 per
cent in Banco Totta e Acores, Portugal's third-ranked banking group.
On the surface, BCP control of BPA would increase Spanish influence in
Portuguese banking. But some analysts see the takeover bid partly as a
defensive move that would create a large group over which it would be much
harder for BCH to gain control.
Lisbon also has to consider whether BCP's proposed purchase would distort
competition. The takeover would mean that two banking groups, BCP and CGD,
dominated more than 50 per cent of the market.
The government gives an indication of its current thinking in the
privatisation terms for BPSM. These state that acquisition of BPSM should
not give rise to a group whose size could lead to 'significant imbalances'
in the financial market.
The battle for control of BPA is unlikely to be resolved for three or four
months. Whatever the outcome, the competitive climate in Portugal's
newly-privatised banking sector will have been irrevocably changed.

FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: DSM posts surge in profits to Fl
98m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit rose more than 20-fold in
the second quarter of 1994 compared with the same quarter of 1993.
Net profit jumped to Fl 98m (Dollars 55m) from just Fl 4m, on turnover up
slightly more than 8 per cent at Fl 2.27bn. The latest figures take net
profit for the first half to Fl 181m, a significant improvement from the Fl
10m posted in the first six months of 1993.
The company said it had profited from its continuing cost-cutting drive and
from a strong 12 per cent rise in sales by volume in the first half.
This, in turn, reflected economic recovery in Europe and resurgent demand
from important customers, such as the European vehicle industry.
Demand for caprolactum, a raw material used in making nylon, was also on the
increase in east Asia and western Europe.
At the same time, the flow of cheap, competitive supplies of the feed stock
from central and eastern Europe had slowed.
'The improvement in results is first and foremost due to higher sales
volumes,' Mr Ad Timmermans, a DSM board member, said. 'Selling prices are
still low, but show an upward trend.'
DSM gave no definitive forecast for the rest of the year but the company
said that the traditional 'summer dip' in the current third quarter would
probably be less pronounced than in previous years.
Sales by volume are expected to remain high in the second half, while a
slight recovery in prices should set in for some products.
Mr Timmermans said the surge in profit was 'gratifying', but added that
profit levels were still too low.
DSM will pay an interim dividend of Fl 0.50, representing one-third of its
sharply reduced total dividend of Fl 1.50 in 1993.
The company cautioned, however, that the interim dividend did not give any
indication of the full-year dividend.

Wienerberger Baustoff-industrie, the Austrian building materials group, said
its pre-tax profit on ordinary activities jumped 53 per cent to Sch633m
(Dollars 56.87m) in the first half, due to the home-building boom in Austria
and in some neighbouring countries.
The directors expect business to remain brisk in the second half, and have
forecast that ordinary pre-tax profits for the year will rise to Sch1.1bn
from last year's Sch938m.
Group sales dropped 20 per cent in the first half to Sch4.7bn reflecting the
sale of the sanitary fittings subsidiary to Wolseley of the UK. The group
posted extraordinary profits of Sch215m in the period, virtually all of it
coming from this sale.
Pre-tax profits of the wall, ceiling and roofing systems division soared
45.8 per cent to Sch402.5m. Profits of the pipe systems and sewage
technology division advanced 34.3 per cent to Sch79.4m. The property and
investment division more than doubled its pre-tax profits from Sch73.4m to
Sch168.7m, as the group realised its investment in a large development and
made good progress in renting its Business Park Vienna.
The troubled Treibacher ferro-alloys division reduced its loss to SFr17.2m
(Dollars 13m) from SFr21.9m after more rationalisation and a slight
improvement in markets.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: In the right shape to float with ease - The
approach which achieved a coherent whole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dan Sullivan, chairman and architect of the modern-day Chamberlain
Phipps, is unperturbed about the setback to his ambitions for the company's
share price.
'We wanted to get the transaction completed and get back to business.' In
his eyes, the setback is only temporary.
US-born Mr Sullivan seems to have the experience to take a long-term view.
He boasts a track record of more than 30 buy-ins and flotations, including
Tyco Toys.
From his strategic level, Chamberlain Phipps seems another success story: 'I
look for companies that need something correcting other than just capital.
Then I feel I can buy them at a reasonable price because they won't be as
attractive to other people who aren't set up to work on the management
issues, people who are looking merely to be financial investors.'
Mr Sullivan came to Chamberlain in 1992, when its parent Evode had run into
difficulties and was looking to make disposals. After having paid Pounds 88m
for the then-quoted business in 1989, Evode sold the shoe components
division to Mr Sullivan and Legal &amp; General Ventures for just Pounds 11.9m.
Evode retained Chamberlain's adhesives and related businesses.
The tasks facing the new owners were vast and Chamberlain Phipps' problems
were long-standing.
Founded in 1912, it had grown during the 1960s and '70s by ad hoc
acquisition, with little attempt made to meld the divergent sites and
businesses into a coherent whole.
By the time Mr Sullivan came along, Chamberlain had drifted into some very
costly activities.
These included an unnecessarily large transport fleet of 40 juggernauts,
single-skilled shopfloor workers and a centralised sales force touting
almost 50 different product lines, with little emphasis on exporting and no
targets set. In addition there were 15 different buying points in some areas
of the group, hand-written sales ledgers and a centralised communications
division. It was 'an administrative albatross,' according to Mr Jim Dale,
Chamberlain Phipps' group financial director, who acted as Mr Sullivan's
scout for management buy-in opportunities in the UK.
The new owners set about creating what Mr Dale calls 'a more planned
environment, in which people know what they are accountable for, not
operating as before, in a reactive, day-to-day fashion.'
Mr Garry Goodwin, managing director, puts it differently: 'We believed that
if the managers already in place saw that they owned the problem, we had
confidence they would help solve it.'
The truck fleet has been reduced considerably and deliveries are now geared
to customer needs, as well as the group's production schedules. The
communications division was shorn of virtually all staff, computerised, and
now contributes pre-tax annual profits of Pounds 100,000, against costs
before acquisition of Pounds 600,000.
Loss-making product lines were closed, and a decentralised sales force now
has to deal with just 25 core lines. The workforce has shrunk by a net 20
per cent (to about 1,000 in total), with those remaining on the shop floor
trained in three different skills. Each individual plant manager has also
become a profit centre manager.
The 'rag-bag' of 10 UK companies has been scaled down to three core
divisions: components, polymers, and vinyls. Operating margins for the UK
group have improved from 5.2 per cent pre-Sullivan to 8.4 per cent now.
Productivity has increased by 10 per cent, and shopfloor pay packets are on
average 10 per cent fatter.
The company is also expanding internationally, via the recent acquisitions
of French footwear companies. Mr Sullivan is planning more bolt-on purchases
and is confident that he can do so without shareholders' help for at least a
year or so.
His strategy on acquisitions is unlikely to change. 'Companies with problems
like Chamberlain Phipps don't respond to massaging of a consultancy nature,'
says Mr Sullivan. 'They need to be refocused. It's not just about cutting
costs, but re-orienting the company in the changed market-place in which it
finds itself.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CRT to acquire Systems Resources for Pounds
6.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRT, the recruitment and training group, yesterday announced it was to
expand its information technology recruitment business with the acquisition
of Systems Resources.
The consideration, excluding fees and expenses, is Pounds 6.35m. Of this,
Pounds 1.5m will be satisfied by the allotment to the vendors of 1.52m
ordinary shares in CRT, the issue of Pounds 2.36m of guaranteed unsecured
loan notes, with the balance of Pounds 2.49m in cash.
CRT also announced it was to raise Pounds 9.5m net of expenses via an issue
of 11.9m new ordinary shares on a 2-for-9 basis at 85p apiece. The rights
issue has been fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities which, together
with James Capel, will act as broker.
Some Pounds 4.85m of the funds raised will be used to finance the cash and
loan note element of the acquisition. The balance will fund the integration
and working capital requirements of the enlarged business.
Systems Resources made Pounds 65,000 (Pounds 175,000) pre-tax on turnover of
Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 10.1m) in the year to September 30 1993.
The announcement came as CRT reported its results for the year to April 30.
On turnover up from Pounds 47m to Pounds 47.4m, which included Pounds 4.39m
(Pounds 11.8m) from discontinued operations, pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 532,000.
However, stripping out losses and closure costs of discontinued activities,
continuing operations showed a 25 per cent advance from Pounds 3.9m to
Pounds 4.9m.
The group has withdrawn from its consultancy activities and repositioned
Pitman Training by replacing the traditional college-based activities with
new training centres.
Losses per share emerged at 0.13p (4.22p earnings). A recommended final
dividend of 2.5p makes 3.25p (2.8p) for the year.
The shares closed down 4p to 101p.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: H&amp;C 24% higher at midway - Industry growth
driven by housing starts not maintenance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday voiced concern
over prospects for the housing market as it unveiled a better than expected
24 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 59.9m.
Mr Bill Turcan, chief executive, said industry growth in the first six
months had been driven by new housing starts rather than repairs and
maintenance, where most of H&amp;C's business in the UK arose.
His caution led H&amp;C to hold the interim dividend for the fourth successive
year at 3.6p. Earnings rose 12 per cent to 4.6p.
Mr Turcan was optimistic about the company's prospects for the rest of the
year. Sales in the first half were flat at Pounds 1.1bn, but trading in
H&amp;C's building and timber supplies business remained strong. This division
had returned the fastest growth in the six months with operating profits
ahead by 27 per cent to Pounds 13.5m.
The chemicals business remained competitive, while food and agriculture had
been hit by price pressure. BOCM Pauls, the agriculture and animal feeds
business purchased in 1992, was expected to 'begin to realise its potential
for higher profits', he said.
The group's overall profits included net disposal proceeds of Pounds 6.3m,
but still compared favourably with market expectations of between Pounds 45m
and Pounds 55m.
Mr Turcan said H&amp;C, which has streamlined its diversified portfolio of
businesses, was now ready to strengthen two divisions through acquisition -
timber and building supplies, and the speciality chemicals operation.
H&amp;C last week raised Dollars 273m from the disposal of its Indonesian
plantations, leaving it with debt of Pounds 59m, against Pounds 221m at the
end of the half. The group intends to take advantage of the fragmented UK
building supplies market - where it claims a 5 per cent share - and moves by
global chemicals companies to withdraw from niche markets.
Mr Turcan said H&amp;C was in no rush to spend the money. It would be deposited
to offset tax losses around the world, leaving H&amp;C free to take its time on
acquisitions. He added that H&amp;C had no immediate intention of selling its
remaining plantations in Papua New Guinea. The most likely route was a local
flotation. See Lex

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlain issue price set at 165p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe components and footwear manufacturer which is
about to float on the stock market has been forced to rein in its ambitions
by a cautious market.
The group said yesterday it would offer institutions and brokers shares at
165p, against expectations of between 230p and 240p.
The price values the group at Pounds 73.6m, compared with expectations in
May of more than Pounds 90m. Mr Dan Sullivan, chairman, said the placing had
been substantially oversubscribed.
The issue will raise Pounds 37.7m, of which Pounds 6.8m will go to existing
shareholders. Chamberlain will receive Pounds 27.2m net of expenses to
reduce debt and buy out Pounds 5.4m of preference shares owned by Mr
Sullivan and Legal &amp; General Ventures.
Mr Sullivan, an American investor, formed the group in 1992 by acquiring the
footwear materials businesses of Evode Group for Pounds 12m, with the
backing of Legal &amp; General Ventures.
Mr Sullivan said the company would not be affected by the decision to come
to the market at a sharply reduced price. Existing investors had decided to
sell fewer shares, leaving the company with the planned amount of net
proceeds. Dealings are expected to begin on August 15.
After the flotation, debt will represent some 65 per cent of shareholders'
funds.
Mr Sullivan is selling 1m of his 12.5m shares, leaving him with a 25 per
cent stake. Legal &amp; General is selling only about half the number of shares
originally envisaged and will retain a 21 per cent holding.
The group recorded operating profits of Pounds 11.6m on sales of Pounds
118.3m for the year to April 2. This compared with profits of Pounds 12.4m
and sales of Pounds 186.9m for the previous 18 months.
The notional net dividend for the year was 7.3p. Historic earnings per share
were 10.1p.
Of the 22.9m shares being placed with institutions, some 7.7m will be
subject to clawback for applications from brokers.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BCE turns in Pounds 0.8m deficit after
exceptionals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BCE Holdings, the USM-traded distributor of snooker and pool products and
amusement arcade operator, reported a deficit of Pounds 796,000 before and
after tax for the 12 months to March 31.
The outcome, on turnover of Pounds 3.73m, took in exceptional charges
totalling Pounds 203,000, largely comprising a capital loss on the disposal
of four amusement arcades in the Bristol area last December.
The group made stock provisions of Pounds 200,000. Mr John Roberts,
appointed chairman at the end of last year, stressed that the figures were
not comparable with the previous year when losses amounted to Pounds 56,000
on turnover of Pounds 4.27m.
Losses per share emerged at 2.9p (0.2p). Following the capital
reorganisation, directors intend to declare a dividend for the current year;
the last distribution was in 1989.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Blue Circle sells New World for Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Circle Industries, the UK's largest cement company, has sold its
lossmaking New World Domestic Appliances subsidiary to a management buy-in
team for Pounds 5.5m.
The maker of gas cookers and ovens was part of Birmid Qualcast, which Blue
Circle bought in a hostile Pounds 330m bid in 1988.
The Warrington-based company incurred a Pounds 2.2m operating loss in 1993
on sales of Pounds 39.6m.
Blue Circle will incur a write-off on the value of New World's net assets of
Pounds 8.7m. The total write-off in the accounts to June 1994, after
recognising Pounds 35.1m of goodwill written off against reserves at
acquisition, will therefore be Pounds 43.8m.
Murray Johnstone Private Equity Limited, the venture capital group, funded
the Pounds 5.5m equity portion of the management buy-in and Nat West
Acquisition Finance is providing Pounds 5m of senior debt.
The buy-in is being led by Mr Mike Hassall, and the new company will be
chaired by Mr Jeoff Samson, former chief executive of Yale &amp; Valor and
chairman of Hunterprint, the struggling specialist printer.
Blue Circle said the sale was consistent with its strategy to concentrate on
heavy building materials, heating and bathrooms.

The issue is of 15.9m new ordinary 2p shares at par.
The USM-quoted group also announced a substantial fall in pre-tax profit
from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 8,000 for the six months to April 30. The fall,
on turnover down from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 1.25m, was because of an
exceptional credit of Pounds 1.49m the previous year, arising from group

Earnings per share were 0.01p (9.47p); excluding exceptionals, the previous

Fairway Group, the USM-quoted provider of print facilities and distributor

Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said remedial action had already been taken at

Kembrey
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof
clothes, has made a recommended offer for Kembrey valuing the group at
Pounds 4.8m or 17.6p per share.
Irrevocable undertakings have been received by directors of Kembrey,
representing about 27.5 per cent of the share capital.
As a consequence of its acquisition policy and through developing core
activities, Chemring's indebtedness at July 15 1994 stood at some Pounds
4.4m. Consequently it plans to raise about Pounds 5.4m before expenses, via
a placing of 1.97m new ordinary shares at 272p each, subject to a 1-for-10
open offer to shareholders.
Chemring yesterday also forecast that it would pay a final dividend of 6.56p
for the year to September 30, making a total of 9.8p (9p).
Kembrey is principally engaged in the manufacture of marine survivor
location products, as well as consumable refractory materials and precision
components.
Kembrey shares added 4p to 16p. Chemring shares were unchanged at 299p.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Placing values AromaScan at Pounds 27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AromaScan, the developer of an 'electronic nose' - a new technology to
detect odours - yesterday announced a placing price of 100p to raise Pounds
12m from its forthcoming flo-tation.
Although the placing was originally expected to value the company at about
Pounds 35m, yesterday's pricing gave it a market capitalisation of Pounds
27m.
Mr Fred Worth, finance and operations director, said he was delighted with
the value put on the company and described earlier estimates as an 'inexact
science'.
After expenses, the placing of 12m new ordinary shares will leave the
company with Pounds 11.2m to invest in a new plant and develop industrial
applications for the technology.
The electronic nose system, pioneered and developed at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), relies on a large
library of polymers to identify smells and produce digital print-outs.
Mr Worth said the company was negotiating joint venture arrangements with a
number of international groups which are keen to exploit the technology in
areas such as air management, purification systems and wound dress-ings.
Existing shareholders have agreed to retain their stakes for at least two
years following the placing, handled by NM Rothschild with Peel Hunt acting
as broker.
Meanwhile, Neotronics Technology - AromaScan's main rival - yesterday
announced a new marketing initiative to promote its own electronic nose to
potential joint venture partners and new clients.
The maker of gas analysis equipment said it was setting up a new subsidiary
 -Neotronics Scientific - which will develop and sell its equipment around
the world.
Mr Stephen Collins, a former international marketing manager at Fisons, is
to join the group later this month and will be targeting some 800 companies
which have expressed an interest in the system.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Wyefield shows 28% advance to Pounds 131,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Wyefield Group, the home furnishings manufacturer, rose
28 per cent to Pounds 131,000 for the six months to end-June, despite a poor
second quarter.
Turnover at the USM-quoted company, which changed its name from Lincoln
House after the Pounds 8.2m purchase earlier this month of Medallion
Upholstery, rose 6 per cent to Pounds 4.42m.
Mr David Harland, chairman, said the difficulties in the second quarter were
largely due to moving the manufacturing base to a modern factory and
installing computerised cost analysis systems. Operating profit was cut from
Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 134,000.
Earnings per share were 0.5p (0.6p).

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes shares rise 12p on sharp advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ransomes rose 12p to 42p yesterday as strong US sales helped the
manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment and specialist industrial trucks
lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 6.71m in the half year
ended July 2.
Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 102m (Pounds 89.7m).
Ransomes also announced the departure of Mr Geoffrey Comer, the financial
director. The company has undergone extensive management changes since the
arrival of Mr John Clement as chairman in October 1993.
There is no ordinary interim dividend although the company will pay its
April 1994 convertible preference dividend at the end of October. Steinhardt
Partners, a US hedge fund manager which holds 30 per cent of Ransomes'
preference shares, almost gained 15 per cent of votes in Ransomes earlier
this year because of preference dividend payment arrears. Preference
shareholders become enfranchised if arrears are not paid within six months
of their due date.
The company has reduced its net borrowings to Pounds 72.5m (Pounds
85m)leaving it with gearing of 400 per cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.5p against losses of 4.4p.
The boost in turnover came primarily from north America where sales rose
from Pounds 34m to Pounds 43m. Total operating profits more than doubled
from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 11m, the largest contribution coming from the
commercial sector with profits of Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 2.4m) on turnover of
Pounds 68.1m (Pounds 56.5m). Lossmaking operations in France and Germany
returned to profit.
Mr Clement said the company had 'exercised tighter control over cash with
stocks and borrowings significantly improved'. Existing stock had been
reduced from Pounds 51.9m to Pounds 42.4m while more machines were being
sold straight off the production line.
He said a top tier of 'expensive management' had been removed and the
workforce worldwide had been cut by 12 per cent. No new staff had been
recruited and sales per employee had increased from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds
59,000.
Operating margins improved to 10.8 per cent (6 per cent) .
Mr Peter Wilson, chief executive, said the order book looked promising and
future sales would be boosted by new products. The company's aim was to
increase its penetration of the US fairways market where it had only 5-8 per
cent of market share.
Mr Clement said the debt burden would be reduced partly by the sale of
surplus land. Ransomes has 150 acres available for disposal, valued at
Pounds 27.6m. In the balance sheet the company has reclassified surplus land
and buildings in current assets as property for disposal.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: PowerGen buys back 2.5m shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the electricity sector moved ahead strongly after PowerGen, the
power generation company, said it had repurchased for cancellation 2.5m of
its own equity.
The market welcomed PowerGen's purchase, which represents 0.3 per cent of
the total shares in issue, on the grounds that it will boost earnings per
share and is likely to lift dividend payments.
Shares in other companies in the sector were affected by the positive
sentiment. All of them have taken powers at recent annual general meetings
to buy back shares.
PowerGen is only the second electricity company to do so, the other being
Eastern Electricity.
PowerGen has shareholder approval to buy back 10 per cent of its equity. The
company said yesterday it would consider further repurchases in the coming
months as market circumstances permitted.
Analysts calculated that if it repurchased the full 10 per cent, earnings
could be increased by between 5 and 6.5 per cent within a year.
PowerGen has low gearing, with net debt at the end of last year at Pounds
282m and likely to fall this year unless the company spends significant
amounts of money on acquisitions.
Some brokers saw yesterday's purchases, made at 527p, as a signal to the
market that the company does not see opportunities for large acquisitions.
Others felt that it was a possible precursor for the company seeking an
American Depositary Receipts listing in the US to enhance the marketability
of its shares.
Yesterday's buybacks will please the Treasury since the possibility of
further buybacks is likely to provide support for PowerGen's shares in the
run-up to the government's sale of its remaining 40 per cent in the company,
probably in October.
Shares in the regional electricity companies were also lifted yesterday by
hopes that the review of their distribution businesses by the industry
regulatory may be less severe than was previously feared.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Low-down on Low bid - Appearances could be
deceptive in Tesco's victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight it might appear that the takeover battle for William Low, the
struggling Scottish food retailer, has been resolved with winners all round.
Shareholders in the Dundee-based group will receive Pounds 247m from Tesco,
compared with the Pounds 154m which the retailer offered only 18 days
earlier. Tesco was still confident it would obtain a good return from the Wm
Low stores - in spite of having been forced to increase its first bid by
Pounds 93m.
Even J Sainsbury, which intervened with a Pounds 210m offer and thus forced
Tesco to pay more, has laid to rest its reputation as the retailing giant
which would never become involved in a hostile takeover battle.
But some hard questions remain. How could the board of Wm Low and its
merchant bank advisers, Baring Brothers, have recommended the original bid
as 'full and fair' - particularly since Tesco reckons it can still make
money from the deal, even after increasing its offer by 60 per cent?
How could retailing analysts and the market have so undervalued Wm Low's
shares, which in April touched 138p - 222p less than Tesco's latest offer of
360p?
Advisers to Wm Low said their hand had been forced by the rapid
deterioration in the Dundee group's trading position this summer.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, first approached Wm Low in April, and
discussions resulted in a cash bid of 180p per share being mooted - a figure
which was later increased to 200p. The Wm Low board checked with their store
managers, heard that trading conditions were stabilising, and decided to sit
tight.
But when Tesco returned in July, with a firm offer of 225p, trading had
worsened markedly. Like-for-like sales, the life-blood of any retailer, were
down 12 per cent. Sir Ian made his offer conditional on a recommendation by
Wm Low.
The recommendation was not over-enthusiastic. Mr James Millar, chairman of
the Scottish group, said merely that the Tesco offer represented 'better
value for shareholders than the value Wm Low could achieve as an independent
retailer, as the harsher retail food market and our lack of scale limit our
prospects for profit growth over the next few years.'
Barings said that - given the deterioration in Wm Low's trading position,
and Tesco's insistence on the bid being recommended - the only way to test
whether more could be obtained for shareholders was by making the offer
public, and letting the market decide.
There was real concern that analysts would get wind of the drop in sales and
start raising concerns about the group's dividend - pushing the shares even
lower.
Analysts concede they made a mistake in focusing on Wm Low's poor profits
performance, rather than the underlying value of its bricks and mortar to
competitors. But few could have foreseen that Tesco and Sainsbury would be
prepared to bid against each other for the 57-store chain.
Tesco was confident that Sainsbury would not become involved in a contested
bid - even although Wm Low warned Sir Ian in writing that it did not
consider his Pounds 247m offer would necessarily be a knockout blow.
Perhaps the biggest winner is the empty-handed Sainsbury. It has has shown
the City it is prepared to become involved in a contested bid and stop a
rival gaining market share on the cheap - but not pay over the odds.
A Sainsbury adviser said: 'We know the value of the business and were not
prepared to pay a penny more. If a rival has been forced to pay more for it,
that's no bad thing.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax bid for UAPT challenged by Trans
Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UAPT-Infolink, one of the UK's leading credit referencing companies, was
yesterday caught in a bidding war between North America's two major credit
assessment groups, with two consecutive offers for the group announced in
one day.
Equifax had announced a 500p recommended offer on July 26, and its offer
document was due today. It was pre-empted by a rival 550p bid yesterday from
Trans Union, another North American credit information business.
Equifax responded by offering 600p. But despite UAPT board support for the
500p bid, the higher bid has not been recommended.
A spokesman for UAPT said it had explained its reasons to Equifax, and the
board will today consider its response to the new bid.
The cash offers compare with a UAPT share price as low as 75p earlier this
year, but reflect the value of UAPT's substantial consumer and business data
base.
Equifax already has a similar share of the UK consumer credit referencing
market to UAPT's Infolink, but this is loss-making. It would be able to
reduce costs and increase customers through a link-up with UAPT.
Trans Union, which is a subsidiary of the Marmon Group and made an unaudited
pre-tax profit of Dollars 65m (Pounds 42m) in 1993, has no experience of the
UK market. It is looking to retain UAPT as an independent business,
providing a toe hold in Europe.
The assurance of independence is likely to appeal to UAPT's management, and
the board unanimously recommended Trans Union's 550p offer, which values the
company at Pounds 43m.
The board has also secured irrevocable indications of support from
shareholders representing 12.1 per cent of its shares.
By comparison, the rationale behind the Equifax bid is to add value to the
business through the merger of the two UK consumer credit businesses, which
would inevitably mean job losses and substantial cost cutting.
UAPT has suffered a substantial loss of market share in its core consumer
credit business in recent years, primarily to CCN Systems, a subsidiary of
Great Universal Stores, which has built up an estimated 60 per cent market
share.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Halkin returns to black with
Pounds 1.25m at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halkin Holdings, the accessories and brewing group, announced a profit for
its first six months as a restructured company.
Pre-tax profits at the group, bought by Mr Howard Hodgson, the former
funeral director, in August 1993, were Pounds 1.25m on turnover of Pounds
11.4m for the six months to July 2.
The year-end was changed from March 31 to end-December; for the nine months
to December 31 the group incurred a loss of Pounds 998,000 on turnover of
Pounds 478,000.
The group has ungone a radical restructuring in the past year, acquiring
Ronson, the lighter and aerosol group, for Pounds 10m and LGW, a gift
company now trading as Clifford International, for Pounds 9.5m.
The purchases were funded partly by a Pounds 15m rights issue, and Halkin
said both were performing well.
The company said it was beginning an 'international brand-building
programme' to re-establish the Ronson name. Three new collections of
lighters, pens and watches were being launched.
Clifford International has strengthened its product range, with airline
listings up on the previous year, and the brewery has returned to profits.
Earnings per share were 2.46p, against losses of 17.2p. No interim dividend
is declared, but the board said it intends to recommend a full-year
distribution.

Arthur Shaw &amp; Company has announced the sale and leaseback of premises in
the West Midlands to Stepvale.
Shaw's chief executive and chairman have connections with Stepvale.
Accordingly shareholders' approval will be sought at an extraordinary
meeting on August 24, when a capital reorganisation will be considered.
The sale has been agreed at Pounds 525,000 cash, and is expected to enable
Shaw to repay more than Pounds 500,000 to Midland Bank.
The plans to reorganise the share capital, which is currently 8.76m ordinary
shares at 10p each, consist of a 2-for-1 subdivision and a 2-for-1
capitalisation issue. This would result in 35m ordinary shares of 5p each in

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wickes doubles to Pounds 8.76m - Expansion
plan could treble number of stores over next few years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, yesterday announced details of an
ambitious expansion plan that could treble the size of its store portfolio
over the next few years.
Encouraged by buoyant trading, which more than doubled half-year pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 8.76m, the group said it hoped to be
operating 200 stores in the UK and 100 in continental Europe within five
years.
Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the group had launched nine new stores in
the six months to June 30 and planned to open 10 more by the year-end -
taking the total to 97.
He said the group had been persuaded to accelerate the pace of expansion by
a sharp upturn in operating profits and an 11 per cent increase in
like-for-like sales at its existing stores.
The pre-tax figures, however, were flattered by reduced interest payments of
Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 5.23m), which fell sharply after the group used funds
from last year's Pounds 58.1m rights issue to reduce net debts from Pounds
72.9m to Pounds 16.3m - equivalent to gearing of 11 per cent.
At the operating level, profits rose from Pounds 10m to Pounds 12.5m on
increased turnover of Pounds 355.2m (Pounds 294m).
'The recession has turned into a recovery and we have outperformed our
competitors in the sector,' said Mr Sweetbaum.
He also hailed an improved performance from Hunter Timber, which moved into
the black for the first time in several years with an Pounds 800,000 profit.
Although Malden Timber - the merchanting business - continued to operate at
a loss following flat first quarter sales, Mr Sweetbaum predicted its losses
would decline following a wide-ranging structural review.
Under the reorganisation, costing Pounds 1.9m in the first half and Pounds
1.4m over the next six months, Malden's management will be integrated into
Hunter Timber.
Earnings per share rose from 1p to 1.6p and an interim dividend of 0.5p
(0.2p) is declared.
COMMENT
Despite the robust upturn in operating profits, Mr Sweetbaum was
sufficiently concerned about interest rate rises to sound a note of caution
on the likely strength of the recovery. Nevertheless, Wickes has tailored
recent price cuts to demand and won the volume growth to pay for it. It also
expects to generate enough cash to open 29 new stores next year, six of them
on the continent. That optimism, despite recent planning setbacks in France,
prompted a 2p rise in the shares to 97p. Full-year profit forecasts have
been clipped to Pounds 30m to take account of further reorganisation in the
timber business, leaving the shares on a forward multiple of 18. Although
that looks top heavy, the p/e is likely to fall to a more attractive 12 next
year if profits reach forecast levels of Pounds 45m.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Members back merger of northern building
societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned merger between Northern Rock Building Society, the UK's 11th
largest, and North of England Building Society, its smaller neighbour, has
been approved overwhelmingly by members of both organisations.
The approvals - reflecting the consent of more than 90 per cent of members
voting - mean that the merger is on course to go ahead on October 1.
While the percentages of approvals were impressive, the turnout figures were
rather less so.
Only about 10 per cent of North of England's 330,000 or so potential votes
were cast. And just 1 or 2 per cent of Northern Rock's 764,405 investing
members and 186,917 borrowers took part.
Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock managing director, was unapologetic about the
low proportion of voting.
He said there was no reason to suppose that those who did not vote were
unhappy with the merger plans.
Yesterday's special general meeting of Northern Rock - only the second since
the society was formed in 1965 - offered a vivid illustration of how even a
small amount of member participation can put society directors on the spot.
Though little more than a hundred members attended the meeting, this did not
guarantee a trouble-free ride for Mr Robert Dickinson, chairman.
A series of waspish questions - delivered by apparently benign senior
citizens - aired several prickly issues, including directors' pay and the
bonus offered as part of the deal to North of England, but not Northern
Rock, members.
Silver-haired retired head teacher Miss Marguerite Maxwell weighed in first.
She had been a Northern Rock investor for 30 years, she said, while a friend
had moved her account to the North of England.
'She who deserted the Northern Rock gets a bonus and I who have been a loyal
member do not. I don't agree with that and I think it most unfair.'
Mr Dickinson gave the standard response: North of England's reserves were
larger and that society would disappear, whereas Northern Rock would remain.
Miss Maxwell, unimpressed, was supported by another rebel who asked
plaintively: 'Couldn't you give a sweetener to Northern Rock members?'
Later, and marginally less diplomatically, Mr Sharp said that people stayed
with Northern Rock and with some other societies because they knew that in
the longer-term that was where their best interests lay.
'There is no way I would have attempted to persuade my board to pay a bonus
to Northern Rock members at this time,' he said. 'We are a dynamic and
ongoing outfit.'
The 1.4m members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society will get a
similar opportunity to cross-question their directors at the special general
meeting which must be held to seek their approval for the Pounds 1.8bn cash
offer from Lloyds Bank.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Warburg settles SBC dispute with charity donation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
S. G. Warburg yesterday settled a 'dealing dispute' between itself and Swiss
Bank Corp by agreeing to make a charitable donation on Swiss Bank's behalf.
The London Stock Exchange, which had been asked by SBC to consider whether
Warburg had broken exchange rules, said yesterday it was 'satisfied that no
further action is required'.
The exchange declined to say whether or not its domestic equity rules
committee had decided that Warburg had actually broken the rules, nor did it
state that it was Warburg which had been required to make the charitable
payment.
An earlier sub-committee of that group had determined that Warburg had
violated a rule obliging a marketmaker to fill a 'firm limit order' from a
client when the marketmaker had the opportunity to do so.
Yesterday, Warburg declined to comment on the matter while SBC said it was
happy that the dispute had been settled to the benefit of charity.
The exchange said that the issue which SBC presented 'raised unprecedented
and complex issues in connection with the interpretation of the exchange's
rules'.
In particular, it said there was a need to consult with the Takeover Panel
on rules about firm orders to buy shares during takeover situations.
The dispute stemmed from an unusual offer by Warburg during Enterprise Oil's
contested bid for Lasmo when, days before the offer was to close, it - as
broker to Enterprise - offered a select group of institutional investors in
Lasmo the opportunity to sell their shares at a price well above the market.
SBC is said to have complained that although it had left a firm order to
sell its Lasmo shares, Warburg failed to meet its obligation to do so.
Warburg, in turn, is said to have argued that SBC had left no such order,
and that in any event, marketmakers have an option, but not an obligation,
to fill those orders before offering to buy shares from elsewhere.
It is understood that the exchange's Rules Committee ruled that while the
wording of its rule 4.24(b) is unclear, market convention and practice have
required marketmakers to fill client limit orders such as that placed by
SBC.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Hostile bid starts a drugs re-evaluation - Paul Abrahams and
Richard Waters size up AHP's unthinkable move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.55bn) bid by American Home Products, the
secretive US healthcare and consumer group, for American Cyanamid, sent a
shiver through the boardrooms of medium-sized drugs' companies.
If successful, the purchase of the US drugs, agrochemicals and consumer
products company would be the largest outright acquisition in the
pharmaceuticals industry. It is also the first unsolicited bid in the sector
since Roche offered Dollars 4.7bn for Sterling in January 1988.
Hostile bids in the sector had been viewed as inconceivable: but the rapid
deceleration of growth in the pharmaceuticals industry, and the consequent
collapse in drugs companies' price/earnings ratios, have made the
unthinkable thinkable.
This is not the first bid since the slowdown in the sector. In May, Roche
made an agreed Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, but the target was in deep
difficulties. Quarterly sales of Naprosyn, its top-selling product, fell 82
per cent after its US patents expired in December.
In contrast, American Cyanamid is not in more difficulty than half a dozen
others. The 50 per cent premium being offered by AHP sent shares up sharply
in a number of other medium-sized groups.
In the UK, Wellcome's share price rose 17p to close at 676p; Zeneca's 13p to
close at 771p; by lunchtime in New York, Warner-Lambert was trading at
Dollars 71 7/8 , up more than 12 per cent from the bid announcement. Upjohn,
a repeatedly touted takeover candidate, was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 32 7/8 .
Even a comparatively successful mid-sized company such as Schering-Plough
saw its shares rise 6.5 per cent to Dollars 66 7/8 .
Mr Jonathan Gelles, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said: 'Paying 40-50 per
cent premiums is not unreasonable.'
The sector remains curiously fragmented, with the top 10 groups controlling
only 28 per cent of the Dollars 200bn world market, according to brokers
James Capel.
For AHP, the deal's industrial logic seems impeccable. The combined group
would have drugs sales of about Dollars 7bn, making it the world's fourth
largest after Merck, Glaxo and Bristol-Myers Squibb. AHP would be able to
broaden its product range, allowing it to sell more drugs to managed care
customers.
There would be few product overlaps. AHP's drugs arm, Wyeth-Ayerst, is
strong in cardiovascular medicine, osteoporosis, anti-depressants, arthritis
and oral contraceptives. The strengths of Lederle, American Cyanamid's drugs
subsidiary, are antibiotics, cancer and vaccines.
But if the industrial logic makes sense, is the price right? The revelation
that Mr Jack Stafford, AHP's chairman, has not yet full board approval
suggests Tuesday's announcement was rushed. SmithKline Beecham's leaked
interest in an assets swap with American Cyanamid probably precipitated
AHP's statement.
Mr Stafford can partly finance the deal by breaking up American Cyanamid. He
would probably sell the animal health businesses. American Cyanamid's
agricultural business is among the most profitable in the industry with
margins over 17.3 per cent. It is fast-growing, with an niche in soya bean
herbicides,
The agrochemicals business, the seventh largest in the world with annual
sales of about Dollars 1.7bn, could command a premium of one to one and half
times sales, according to brokers Wood Mackenzie. The animal health
operations, with sales of about Dollars 305m would command a lower premium.
A further option is to sell American Cyanamid's generics operations. AHP
already has its own generics arm, ESI-Pharma. Earlier this year it acquired
Siegfried Pharma, a generics group in Germany, and is in the process of
setting up a European generics wing based in the UK.
However, the acquisition only really makes sense if Mr Stafford can slash
costs. He could cut American Cyanamid's marketing force, primarily aimed at
doctors, and rationalise its research and development.
Mr Albert Costello, American Cyanamid chairman, has engaged Morgan Stanley
to help him consider his response and a possible defence. Given the size of
the premium over the market price, the Cyanamid directors would almost
certainly face shareholder lawsuits if they rejected the bid out of hand.
Mr Stafford's bid may prove to be a turning-point for sentiment towards the
pharmaceuticals sector.
Roche's 50 per cent premium for Syntex was widely viewed as an eccentric
move by a cash-rich Swiss company prepared to make long-term strategic
moves. If Mr Stafford has done his sums correctly, AHP's 50 per cent premium
may force analysts to change their valuations.

FT  04 AUG 94 / BA rejects offer by USAir pilots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pilots at USAir, the country's sixth largest carrier, yesterday unveiled a
restructuring plan which would grant employees a 25 per cent stake in the
airline, plus Dollars 700m in preferred stock, in exchange for Dollars 2.5bn
in wage cuts over five years.
The proposal by the Air Lines Pilots' Association also calls for British
Airways to invest an additional Dollars 450m in USAir. BA already owns 24.6
per cent of the US carrier.
However, BA rejected the call for an additional commitment on its part.
'On the basis of the conditions outlined by the USAir pilots, it is clear
that British Airways could not contemplate further investment in USAir,'
said Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of the British carrier.
British Airways has already stated it was freezing further investment in
USAir until USAir has completed its process of restructuring to the
satisfaction of British Airways.
Regarding the pilots' offer, Mr Peter Gauthier, chairman of the
association's USAir master executive council, said: 'This is an offer to
invest, not to buy.
'We are insisting that management share control as we jointly attempt to
restore our airline to profitability.'
The initial response to the plan was not favourable. Mr Seth Schofield,
USAir chairman and chief executive, said it 'raises serious concern with
respect to complex issues'. The company declined further comment until it
had evaluated the proposals.
In presenting its proposals, the pilots revealed the terms under which they
would agree to help USAir trim one of the highest cost structures in the
industry.
Last week, the union had signalled its willingness to make Dollars 750m in
wage concessions over a five years in return for a 'substantial' ownership
position.
Although USAir turned in a small operating profit in the second quarter, its
long-term prospects are uncertain in view of increased competition along its
east coast routes.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Rival may join funeral bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Southern Group, the UK funeral company under siege from Service
Corporation International, of the US, is talking to a potential white knight
 -understood to be one of SCI's US rivals.
Great Southern's share price rose 28p to 708p after it revealed the
discussions. Analysts said a new offer would have to exceed 700p, compared
with SCI's increased bid of 680p.
The potential counter-bidder is one of SCI's two largest competitors in the
US, Vancouver-based Loewen Group and New Orleans-based Stewart Enterprises,
according to sources close to Great Southern. Both are US listed and have
mirrored SCI's acquisitive trail, with Loewen spending Dollars 165m on
purchases last year and Stewart investing close to Dollars 100m.
The latest turn in the battle is a blow to SCI, which yesterday increased
its stake in Great Southern to 30 per cent of the fully diluted share
capital (upon conversion of the preference shares). But SCI is not permitted
to buy at above 680p. In addition, it has been unable to achieve any serious
dialogue with JD Field &amp; Sons, the private company which controls 56 per
cent of Great Southern's ordinary shares.
Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI president, said: 'If there is any real substance
around this statement, then clearly the Field family have decided to sell.
But, as we own 30 per cent of the stock, what sort of credence can be placed
on the offeror.'
Given Great Southern's move to attract a counter bidder, the announcement
appears to herald the end of the Field family's 300-year history of running
an independent funeral group.
SCI has the right to increase its final offer.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Hostile bid starts a drugs re-evaluation: Paul Abrahams and
Richard Waters size up AHP's unthinkable move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.55bn) bid by American Home Products, the
secretive US healthcare and consumer group, for American Cyanamid, sent a
shiver through the boardrooms of medium-sized drugs' companies.
If successful, the purchase of the US drugs, agrochemicals and consumer
products company would be the largest outright acquisition in the
pharmaceuticals industry. It is also the first unsolicited bid in the sector
since Roche offered Dollars 4.7bn for Sterling in January 1988.
Hostile bids in the sector had been viewed as inconceivable: but the rapid
deceleration of growth in the pharmaceuticals industry, and the consequent
collapse in drugs companies' price/earnings ratios, have made the
unthinkable thinkable.
This is not the first bid since the slowdown in the sector. In May, Roche
made an agreed Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, but the target was in deep
difficulties. Quarterly sales of Naprosyn, its top-selling product, fell 82
per cent after its US patents expired in December.
In contrast, American Cyanamid is not in more difficulty than half a dozen
others. The 50 per cent premium being offered by AHP sent shares up sharply
in a number of other medium-sized groups.
In the UK, Wellcome's share price rose 17p to close at 676p; Zeneca's 13p to
close at 771p; by lunchtime in New York, Warner-Lambert was trading at
Dollars 71 7/8 , up more than 12 per cent from the bid announcement. Upjohn,
a repeatedly touted takeover candidate, was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 32 7/8 .
Even a comparatively successful mid-sized company such as Schering-Plough
saw its shares rise 6.5 per cent to Dollars 66 7/8 .
Mr Jonathon Gelles, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said: 'Paying 40-50 per
cent premiums is not unreasonable.'
The sector remains curiously fragmented, with the top 10 groups controlling
only 28 per cent of the Dollars 200bn world market, according to brokers
James Capel.
For AHP, the deal's industrial logic seems impeccable. The combined group
would have drugs sales of about Dollars 6.4bn, making it the world's fourth
largest after Merck, Glaxo and Bristol-Myers Squibb. AHP would be able to
broaden its product range, allowing it to sell more drugs to managed care
customers.
There would be few product overlaps. AHP's drugs arm, Wyeth-Ayerst, is
strong in cardiovascular medicine, osteoporosis, anti-depressants, arthritis
and oral contraceptives. The strengths of Lederle, American Cyanamid's drugs
subsidiary, are antibiotics, cancer and vaccines.
But if the industrial logic makes sense, is the price right? The revelation
that Mr Jack Stafford, AHP's chairman, has not yet full board approval
suggests Tuesday's announcement was rushed. SmithKline Beecham's leaked
interest in an assets swap with American Cyanamid probably precipitated
AHP's statement.
Mr Stafford can partly finance the deal by breaking up American Cyanamid. He
would probably sell the animal health businesses. American Cyanamid's
agricultural business is among the most profitable in the industry with
margins over 17.3 per cent. It is fast-growing, with an niche in soya bean
herbicides,
The agrochemicals business, the seventh largest in the world with annual
sales of about Dollars 1.7bn, could command a premium of one to one and half
times sales, according to brokers Wood Mackenzie. The animal health
operations, with sales of about Dollars 305m would command a lower premium.
A further option is to sell American Cyanamid's generics operations. AHP
already has its own generics arm, ESI-Pharma. Earlier this year it acquired
Siegfried Pharma, a generics group in Germany, and is in the process of
setting up a European generics wing based in the UK.
However, the acquisition only really makes sense if Mr Stafford can slash
costs. He could cut American Cyanamid's marketing force, primarily aimed at
doctors, and rationalise its research and development.
Mr Albert Costello, American Cyanamid chairman, has engaged Morgan Stanley
to help him consider his response and a possible defence. Given the size of
the premium over the market price, the Cyanamid directors would almost
certainly face shareholder lawsuits if they rejected the bid out of hand.
Mr Stafford's bid may prove to be a turning-point for sentiment towards the
pharmaceuticals sector.
Roche's 50 per cent premium for Syntex was widely viewed as an eccentric
move by a cash-rich Swiss company prepared to make long-term strategic
moves. If Mr Stafford has done his sums correctly, AHP's 50 per cent premium
may force analysts to change their valuations.

FT  04 AUG 94 / GKN glee as Westland wins Pounds 190m payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the UK helicopter manufacturer, yesterday settled a 14-year legal
battle with the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation.
The AOI has agreed to pay Westland, now part of the engineering group GKN,
Pounds 190m in compensation for a cancelled helicopter order in the late
1970s. The deal cuts the Pounds 577m GKN paid for Westland earlier this
year.
A settlement was signed in London by Mr Alan Jones, a GKN director and
former Westland chairman, and senior officials from Egypt and members of the
Saudi royal family. It follows a number of court decisions in Westland's
favour, most significantly the enforcement of a Pounds 115m interim payment
by French authorities in June.
The case arose because the AOI dropped an order for 250 Westland Lynx
helicopters after Egypt signed the Camp David peace agreement with Israel.
Analysts yesterday said they were surprised by the speed of the settlement
and suggested that GKN had won control of Westland 'very cheaply'.
GKN's chairman, Sir David Lees, said he was delighted with the settlement
which was more than he had anticipated when he had bid for Westland in
February. 'We bid ex the AOI settlement really, but it has fortunately
worked out cum,' he said.
Sir David also said the bid materially improved Westland's chances of doing
business with the four member states of the AOI - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates.
City analysts think that Saudi Arabia offers the best prospect of export
sales, with the kingdom thought to be interested in the anti-submarine
warfare version of Westland's EH101 helicopter.
When GKN bid for Westland, shareholders were offered 335p a share in cash by
GKN or 290p plus a share in any AOI settlement. So far additional payments
of 60p have been promised, and a final 10p-15p may be possible. Those opting
for the AOI settlement would then receive 360p-365p, rather than the 335p
cash alternative.
However, less than a quarter of 1 per cent of Westland shareholders voted to
accept that offer, and GKN will only have to pay out a total of about Pounds
350,000 of the Pounds 190m settlement to shareholders.
Sir David acknowledged that he had bought Westland for a very reasonable
price and said prospects for other helicopter orders were encouraging. The
Apache, which would be made under licence by Westland, is front-runner in
the competition for a Pounds 2bn attack helicopter for the British Army. The
RAF has shown strong interest in Westland EH101 transport helicopters.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Ricoh launches court battle against Samsung over patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two Asian electronics companies are battling over the rights to the
technology behind the facsimile machine record slips which enable users to
keep track of pages sent and the numbers to which faxes are transmitted.
Many users discard the record slips, but the use of the 'administrant data'
technology has prompted Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment maker, to file
a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against Samsung
Electronics, charging the Korean company with patent infringement and
claiming unspecified damages.
Ricoh contends that Samsung has infringed two facsimile patents and has
asked the ITC to prohibit Samsung from importing, marketing, demonstrating,
distributing or selling in the US, fax machines that infringe the patents.
Most fax machine makers pay royalties to use the Ricoh technology under
licence.
Ricoh said it was forced to take action against Samsung after repeated
negotiations over several years had failed to result in a satisfactory
agreement.
The Japanese company has filed a complaint with the ITC and the New Jersey
district court seeking a permanent injunction against Samsung and claiming
damages. The move by Ricoh illustrates the growing friction between Japanese
and Korean companies in international markets, especially in areas where the
Japanese have long been market leaders.
The two countries agreed last December to resume co-operation on patent
processing issues, after a gap of seven years following Japanese complaints
that Korean companies were infringing on patents.
Japanese electronics makers have dominated the facsimile market, which last
year was worth Y355bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in Japan alone, according to the
Electronic Industries Association of Japan. The biggest seller, Ricoh, also
sold 2.3m fax machines in the US last year, according to BIS Strategic
Decisions, a high technology consultancy, which forecast a rise to 3.9m in
1998.
However, Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers have increasingly eaten into the
Japanese share, particularly at the lower end of the market for thermal
paper faxes. Exports of fax machines from Japan fell 13 per cent to Y227bn
in 1993 from the previous year, according to the EIAJ.
The Japanese dominance is also being threatened by the impact of a high yen
which has eroded the price competitiveness of fax machines made in Japan.
Ms Debra Waggoner, of the American Electronics Association, said yesterday:
'For the electronics industry, protection of intellectual property rights is
crucial.'
Noting that Ricoh has chosen to fight the battle in US courts, she said that
the US had been getting 'signals' from Japanese companies 'that they are
going to be more pro-active in protecting their rights'.

FT  04 AUG 94 / House price rise of 15% needed to end negative equity, says
study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average house prices in England would need to rise by 15 per cent to
eliminate negative equity, says a report published today by the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation.
The report, based on interviews with home owners in Bristol, Luton and
Glasgow, found a quarter of those with negative equity owed more than Pounds
10,000 above the value of their homes.
Most of those with mortgages greater than the value of their homes were
under 40, and many of them were in professional or managerial occupations.
More than a third were buying their second or subsequent homes. Previous
studies have suggested that it is first-time buyers who are largely
afflicted.
The report says that 'mortgage equity withdrawal' - raising cash from the
capital invested in housing - was a significant factor in creating negative
equity. Many homeowners increased their mortgages during the 1980s to buy
furniture, cars or holidays.
A separate report published today by the foundation says that equity
withdrawal will add billions of pounds to consumer spending by the end of
the decade. It predicts that it will boost consumer spending by around 3 per
cent.
Most of the additional spending will come from homeowners taking out
mortgages for more than they need to buy their homes. In some cases this
will be when buying ('over-mortgaging'); in others through secured lending
on second mortgages backed by the security of their home.
However, large injections will also come from the sale of inherited homes,
and from older home owners 'trading down' into smaller homes.
The foundation predicts that the number of houses to be inherited will rise
50 per cent to just over 180,000 a year by the beginning of the next
century. Much of the equity withdrawal from inheritance will not end up as
consumer spending, according to the forecasts. Only a fifth of capital
released goes to boost spending, with the rest re-invested.
The forecasts, prepared by the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, predict that equity withdrawal will return to levels similar to
those of the 1980s as house prices recover during the rest of the decade.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Clinton backs healthcare reform bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night threw his weight behind two bills to
reform the US healthcare system, saying they were less bureaucratic and more
flexible than his original proposals.
He urged the Senate and the House of Representatives not to break up for
their planned August recess until each had passed a reform bill.
Mr Clinton said he could support either of the two bills proposed by the
Democratic leadership in Congress - in the Senate by Mr George Mitchell, the
majority leader, and in the House of Representatives by Congressman Richard
Gephardt.
In an unusual evening news conference Mr Clinton also boasted of the
progress made by the US economy since the passage of his first budget a year
ago, and pushed for a quick vote in favour of the crime legislation which is
still stalled in Congress.
He reiterated his argument that the US has a significant interest in the
return of a democratically elected government to Haiti, but declined to say
whether he would seek approval from Congress before ordering the invasion
that a United Nations resolution last weekend authorised.
Mr Clinton, who had threatened earlier this year to veto any healthcare
reform bill that did not achieve universal coverage, rejected criticisms
that Mr Mitchell's plan, which aims to extend health insurance to only 95
per cent of the population by the year 2000, would fall short of this
condition.
'I believe it does meet the objective I set out in the State of the Union
address and I would sign it,' he told reporters gathered in the White
House's East Room.
Although public opinion in the US firmly backs the broad goals of healthcare
reform, support for the specific reforms proposed by the Democrats remains
lukewarm.
Mr Clinton tried, therefore, to throw some of the burden back on to the
opposition Republican party, which has backed away from some of its earlier
tentative proposals for comprehensive reform and is now working principally
to stop hasty passage of any bill.
'My own view is that the questions should now shift to the other party. We
have reached out to them and every time we have done it they have moved
away,' he said.
Mr Clinton also expressed his support for Mr Roger Altman, the embattled
deputy treasury secretary, who has faced ferocious questioning from
congressional committees for the last two days over his role in the
Whitewater investigation.
'The secretary of the treasury (Lloyd Bentsen) has confidence in him and so
do I,' Mr Clinton said.

SG Warburg's charitable contribution in connection with its controversial
purchase of Lasmo shares during the Enterprise bid is about as unhelpful as
Mr Robert Horton's mooted donation to stop the rail strike. The Lasmo case
reveals a need for transparent rules on handling cash purchases during a
paper bid which should then be enforced without fear or favour. The stock
exchange has come up with an elegant-looking verdict. It is fudge just the
same.

FT  04 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco/Wm Low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three weeks ago the board of William Low, advised by Barings, recommended
its shareholders accept an offer from Tesco of 225p a share which it thought
was 'fair and reasonable'. Yesterday it became clear that Tesco thought the
price to be very reasonable indeed since it is now prepared to offer 60 per
cent more.
There is no question that the strategy adopted by William Low and Barings
has been spectacularly successful at realising value for shareholders. But a
few questions still remain. The William Low camp insist that by declaring it
fair and reasonable they were not suggesting that shareholders could not
hope for more. All they wanted to convey was that, without any bid, the
shares would be worth less than 225p. Since the shares were trading at 169p
before the offer most shareholders could probably work that out for
themselves.
As for the recommendation that was demanded by Tesco, William Low acceded to
it as a mere formality in order to get the bidding going. Still, if advisers
want to maintain their credibility, they should think carefully about
letting their names be used too casually.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield shareholders have been waiting a long time for
something to turn up - the dividend, for example - and have managed to
contain their excitement at recent developments. Since Mr Bill Turcan moved
into the chief executive's chair in May, he has been making all the right
noises. He has announced a sensible removal of divisional management,
declared the company to be focused on chemicals and building supplies and
admitted that it still has a lot to prove. He has also been able to clinch
the sale of the Indonesian plantations at a price which brings minimal
earnings dilution. This means the company is under no pressure to gear up
again quickly with acquisitions in its two core businesses, which may be
just as well given its mixed record.
Not only did it buy its UK building merchant chains at the top of the
market, it also picked up a US chain which has seen half its business
undermined by new competition. The UK business showed a strong improvement
in the first half, largely by addressing management failings in the
south-east, but its margins of 4.7 per cent are still behind the competition
and way short of its target of 7.5 per cent. Its margins in speciality
chemicals are also below the industry leaders.
As always with Harrisons, this means there is plenty of upside if only the
management can deliver. Dividends should at last be covered this year but
the shares are still yielding 6.3 per cent, which suggests that expectations
are not high.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies often fear they will be thought lacking in imagination if they
decide to hand back surplus cash to shareholders. The truth is that
investors would prefer to have their money back rather than see it frittered
away in wasteful ventures. In that sense PowerGen should be applauded for
yesterday's share buy-back. It sets an example that others should follow,
and not just in the electricity industry where buy-backs show signs of
becoming fashionable. Yet PowerGen's move is welcome for more than reasons
of principle.
Having spent just Pounds 13m on its own shares PowerGen was rewarded with a
5 per cent jump in its price. The market reaction is not as disproportionate
as it looks. PowerGen has authority to buy up to 10 per cent of its own
capital and the market is assuming that given its modest 15 per cent gearing
it will make further purchases. Earnings would be enhanced even at
yesterday's higher price.
Indeed earnings could rise by around 5 per cent if the company bought back
10 per cent of its capital. That would help offset a lean period next year
as PowerGen's UK sales decline with its market share. But even having spent
Pounds 400m on its own shares, PowerGen would quickly run up surplus cash
again. It would then have to decide whether to come back for more.

FT  04 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: American Home truths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is so long since the pharmaceuticals industry saw an unsolicited bid that
American Home Products' Dollars 8.5bn offer for American Cyanamid came as
something of a shock. But while the nature of the bid and the whopping 50
per cent premium to the market share price are startling, the trend towards
consolidation was already clear. The mergers which created SmithKline
Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Roche's agreed acquisition of Syntex
in May, were steps in this direction. Since pressure on industry margins
shows no sign of easing, further moves are likely.
But the kind of multiple offered by American Home - 20 times this year's
forecast earnings - only makes sense if costs can be cut without damaging
the acquired business. The marriage of SmithKline and Beecham was successful
in this regard, but neither party was dragged to the alter at gun-point.
Cyanamid has outperformed the US market by 50 per cent from the trough in
March, so management could be more than usually reluctant to surrender. Such
considerations argue against an outbreak of hostile takeovers.
Yet drugs companies which are struggling to deliver volume growth and are
being squeezed on price by their customers may have little alternative but
to look for appropriate partners. If the prices now being paid are any
guide, a restructured drugs industry is worth substantially more than the
current model. Yesterday's rise in the shares of other mid-sized drugs
companies, such as Wellcome and Warner Lambert, is speculative but logical.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Still shopping as the margins drop: Now the battle for Wm
Low is over, where will big UK food retailers find growth opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Scottish supermarket group William Low was the
first bidding war between the UK's two largest grocery retailers - Tesco and
J Sainsbury. It may not be the last.
Tesco won the fight yesterday with a bid of 360p a share, valuing the
57-store Wm Low group at Pounds 247m - some Pounds 93m higher than in its
original bid three weeks ago. Sainsbury, which bid 305p last week, decided
the price was too high and withdrew, saving itself for other fights ahead.
Other contests are almost certain to follow. The two grocers went into
battle for control of Wm Low not just because of the opportunity it offered
to buy market share quickly in one of the few regions in which both are
under-represented. They were also motivated by the changing structure of the
industry, which has raised the question of whether the big groups can
continue to expand by building new superstores. They may have to look
elsewhere - overseas or back in the high street - for earnings growth.
From the mid-1980s until late 1992, profits and share prices of the 'big
three' grocery retailers - Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll (owner of Safeway) -
soared as they moved hundreds of stores from high streets into
purpose-built, retailing palaces on the edge of towns. By getting ever
better deals from suppliers, increasing the proportion of higher-margin
own-label products, and introducing sophisticated computer and distribution
systems, they increased profit margins substantially.
Last year, however, food retailers' shares began to underperform the market
as the City realised that the formula for growth could not continue for much
longer. The Pounds 10bn spent on building new superstores by the big three
in the previous five years had led to a shortage of possible sites in parts
of the country.
Moreover, since 1990 a new breed of foreign discount grocers -
limited-range, low-priced stores - had taken root alongside the established
UK discounter, Kwik Save, and threatened to force superstores to cut prices.
Fears about growth prospects were initially played down by the superstore
groups, but the events of the past year have marked a watershed: May 1993:
Gateway, the UK's sixth-largest supermarket, opened price skirmishing by
permanently reducing the cost of 1,000 products. July 1993: Mr Archie
Norman, chief executive of Asda, the fourth-largest superstore group - which
also cut prices - warned 'halcyon days' were over for food retailers.
August 1993: Intensifying the price war, Tesco launched a 'Tesco Value'
range of cheap own-label products designed to counter the threat from
discounters.
October 1993: Sainsbury cut the price of 300 own-label products
indefinitely.
December 1993: Argyll became the first superstore group to announce it was
reducing its spending on expansion. It also began to depreciate the value of
existing stores in its accounts. Its move was soon followed by Tesco and
Sainsbury. All admit price competition had reduced their gross margins.
April-June 1994: Sainsbury and Tesco reported their smallest profits
increases for a decade; Argyll reported its first profits fall.
The question now is whether price competition will continue to escalate,
leading to a downward spiral in margins. Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, European
retailing analyst at US investment bank Lehman Brothers, points out that the
big three food retailers are still committed to spending more than Pounds
1bn a year until 1997 on new stores. In a saturated market, he argues, they
may be forced to keep cutting prices in an attempt to achieve enough sales
through these stores to earn a return on their investment.
Such an outlook might be too pessimistic. While parts of the UK have little
room for new superstores, some areas are under-provided - most obviously
Scotland.
Moreover, the big grocers argue that, although margins have fallen, they
will not necessarily continue to decline. Both Sir Ian MacLaurin and Mr
David Sainsbury, chairmen of Tesco and Sainsbury respectively, say that
reducing prices on the kind of basic products sold by the discount chains
has neutralised the discounters' threat. 'We have really hurt the
discounters. They have no room to cut prices further,' said Mr Sainsbury
when he unveiled the group's latest results in May.
Discounters are indeed finding life difficult. Shares in Shoprite, the
discount grocer which operates mainly in Scotland, plunged last month after
profits for the six months to May came in well below expectations and the
company warned that full-year profits would be similarly disappointing.
Nevertheless, the continuing price competition from the discounters means
margins are unlikely to creep up again. Moreover, even if there are still
places where the groups can build new superstores, this is unlikely to be
the case by the end of the century. Both factors will make superstore
expansion in the UK less attractive.
How, then, can the superstore groups continue to grow? One possibility is
that they may begin to put stores back into the high street. Tesco and
Sainsbury have developed small town-centre formats, Metro and Central
respectively.
They say increased buying power and efficiency means they can trade more
profitably from small stores than they could 10 years ago. That, combined
with the comparatively low cost of leasehold property for small stores,
means they can earn similar returns from these stores as from freehold
superstores.
Sir Ian MacLaurin said yesterday Tesco had identified 80 potential sites in
the UK for its Metro stores and estimated that, in spite of the superstore
expansion of recent years, 30 per cent of grocery spending was still in
high-street shops. 'That is clearly an opportunity for us. We have the
technical skills to run quite small stores profitably now,' he said.
The battle for Wm Low could thus be followed by further bids from the big
three grocers for smaller supermarket groups with high-street stores, such
as Gateway, Iceland or the Co-operative retailers. But with a typical Tesco
Metro only a quarter the size of a new superstore, moving back into the high
street will not offer the same scope for growth as superstore expansion did
in the 1980s.
Another option for expansion may be to go into other forms of retailing.
Sainsbury has tried this with its Homebase DIY and Savacentre hypermarket
chains. It says these will account for increasing proportions of capital
spending in coming years.
Similarly, the big three, which have long operated petrol stations alongside
their superstores, may become operators of standalone petrol stations. Tesco
is already doing so at three London sites; Sainsbury is considering it.
A final expansion route for UK superstore groups is likely to be
acquisitions abroad. Tesco bought the 92-branch Catteau supermarket group in
France last year, and admits this was a way of gaining overseas experience
with a view to other purchases. In 1987, Sainsbury bought Shaws, the US
supermarket chain of 87 stores, and says it will examine opportunities to
add to that chain.
UK retailers' experience overseas has been mixed. Marks and Spencer, for
instance, has struggled to make north American acquisitions perform well -
though it has had more success in Europe. But as opportunities for building
out-of-town superstores dry up and the limited potential for returning to
the high street is filled, the next wave of expansion may have to be
overseas.

Stephen Dorrell, Britain's new National Heritage supremo, may not know much
about art, but that need not stop him winning the plaudits of the arts
world.
Tomorrow the deadline expires on the attempt to find the Pounds 7.6m needed
to keep Canova's statue of The Three Graces in the UK and out of the
clutches of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California. The cause seems
hopeless. The V&amp;A, which is spearheading the rescue mission, has only
managed to raise Pounds 4.7m.
But now Dorrell wants to re-examine the papers and has postponed an
announcement until Monday. He could delay the export licence for another
three months, but there is also a chance that he has found a white knight
with the necessary millions. One possibility is the incredibly generous
cricket fan, J. Paul Getty Jnr, who has little love for his father's
memorial. But if The Three Graces is saved, some of the kudos will rub off
on Dorrell as well.

Yet another government body has fired a shot across the bows of Michael
Heseltine, Britain's combative president of the board of trade. Worse still
the latest pot shot comes from a minion deep inside the Department of
Environment, one of Hezza's old fiefdoms.
In his spare time Hezza is the squire of Thenford, North-amptonshire, and
had been hoping to put a thatched roof on one of his cottages and install
double glazing. However, the planning inspector has turned him down because
he wanted to use the wrong sort of reed and the windows did not suit a
listed building.
The planning inspector commended Hezza's 'genuine attempt' to restore a
building to its original appearance, but declares that such an effort cannot
succeed if 'compromises on materials or techniques mean that the resulting
appearance would clearly detract . . . from the building's character'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack chairman Bob Horton really must be sensitive about the size of his
Pounds 120,000 a year salary. How else do you explain his odd bet with
signal workers' boss Jimmy Knapp on BBC radio's Today programme yesterday
morning?
Horton promised to give to charity the net difference between his salary and
Knapp's, if it would help break the strike deadlock. Knapp earns Pounds
46,000, so this would mean that Horton would have to hand over Pounds
44,400.
A friendly accountant at Touche Ross calculates that if Horton paid the
Pounds 44,400 over as a net Gift Aid payment, the charity could reclaim tax
of Pounds 14,800 leaving it with a total of Pounds 59,200. Horton would then
receive tax relief at 15 per cent on Pounds 8,800 so the net cost to him
would be Pounds 35,520. Sadly, Knapp declined to call Horton's bluff.

A treat in store for the hard-pressed board members of struggling speciality
retailer Pentos. Terry Maher, their erstwhile boss, rushes into print
recounting his version of events at the company he founded. The charmingly
titled Against my Better Judgment rolls off the presses at Sinclair
Stevenson on September 12.
So will Pentos's bookshops stock it? 'Certainly, we don't draw any lines
like that,' says current chairman Sir Kit McMahon expansively. He admits to
being as curious as anyone as to what Maher has to say for himself, while
adding that he doesn't believe Maher has 'quite taken on board' that he was
chairman of the company for 11 months of a year when it racked up losses of
Pounds 70m.
Sir Kit won't be wasting his own pennies on the tome, though. He plans to
head for a convenient Dillons and look up various salient points in the
index - starting presumably somewhere near the McM's.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Observer: Buck House in battle royal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition between Britain's royal palaces is starting to turn ugly. A
glance at the latest annual report of the Historic Royal Palaces, an
executive agency which controls a number of London piles, shows that the
Tower of London is the only real money spinner.
It accounts for three-quarters of the 3m visitors and its Pounds 4.3m net
operating surplus is more than offset by Hampton Court's Pounds 4.8m
deficit. Kensington and Kew palaces and the Banqueting House all lost money
and the Tower was the only outfit to record an increase in visitor numbers
last year.
Part of the problem was the arrival of a new competitor - Buckingham Palace.
As the Queen's London residence it has not yet been turned into an executive
agency but it is being required to earn its keep at last. It was only open
for business for two months last year, yet its 380,000 visitors spent Pounds
5m. It opens again next week and expects to do even better.
The number of visitors to the Historic Royal Palaces has been stuck at about
the 3m mark for several years and, with Buck House starting to cream off the
top end of the market, HRP's managers are going to be hard-pressed to meet
their target of increasing their income by a quarter this year. If they fail
yet again, then they may have to consider more drastic action. How about
spinning off a bit of Hampton Court for luxury housing or making a bid for
Buckingham Palace?

FT  04 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Strains in the new South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Convention usually allows new governments 100 days before critically
appraising their performance. But South Africa's wave of strikes, together
with signs of tensions in the government of national unity, suggest that
President Nelson Mandela's post-inauguration honeymoon is over before this
traditional period of grace has expired.
Ironically, his most serious challenge is orchestrated by the African
National Congress's long-standing ally, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions (Cosatu). More than 100,000 workers have gone on strike for higher
wages, with Cosatu's blessing. Many of its most experienced leaders, whose
pragmatism contributed greatly to South Africa's remarkable transition, are
now in the national or provincial governments, or hold jobs in the private
sector. Their successors in the union movement have yet to be persuaded that
South Africa needs a social compact which will put job creation before
higher wages that erode its ability to compete in international markets.
The workers' impatience to see the benefits of the post-apartheid era are
understandable. In their view, Mr Mandela has done more to set at rest
whites' fears than he has done to meet black expectations since he was sworn
in on May 10. Fiscal discipline was the watchword in the June budget, which
left many blacks disappointed and dashed trade unions' hopes that
zero-rating on VAT would be extended to a wider range of staples. Yet it
brought a sigh of relief from whites, who regarded a 5 per cent surcharge on
income tax a small price to pay for the successful transition.
Inexperienced team
Since then the government has appeared immobilised, moving painfully slowly
to implement key pledges in its election manifesto. An inexperienced team of
ANC ministers and officials is short of expertise, while the civil service's
middle and upper echelons are dominated by whites who for the most part
support the National party. An ambitious housing programme with the aim of
building 1m units in five years has yet to get under way, as the government
weighs the merits of build-it-yourself schemes against fully developed
housing estates. The former are quickly delivered, but can easily become
urban slums; the latter are more costly but more likely to meet black
expectations.
Reform is proceeding painfully slowly in a second area critical to the ANC's
popularity. Promises to redress inequalities in land distribution, whereby
87 per cent of land remains in white hands, are constrained by provisions in
the bill of rights and by concern not to disrupt commercial agriculture.
Power centres
The government also faces potential problems from an unexpected quarter.
Although seven of the nine provincial governments are controlled by ANC
delegates, they are becoming power centres in their own right.
The list of Mr Mandela's difficulties does not end there. Natal has yet to
find peace, while a proposed investigation into human rights abuses during
the apartheid era - the so-called 'truth commission' - could easily add to
the strains.
Meanwhile the National party, led by deputy president FW de Klerk, is
showing signs of dissatisfaction with the coalition, wondering whether its
chances in the next election might be better served in opposition. Although
a junior partner, its co-operation is essential to the success of the
country's Reconstruction and Development Plan.
These problems need be no more than teething troubles, and they must be
placed alongside what has already been achieved. This is easy to
underestimate. The threat from the right that once appeared capable of
destabilising the entire transition has been defused if not destroyed.
Hundreds of millions of dollars of aid have been promised, and a sensible
plan exists for spending them on tangible improvements in the quality of
life of millions of impoverished blacks. Meanwhile, all over the country the
transformation quietly continues, as residents of white suburbs and black
townships find ways to co-operate in local government and to integrate
state-owned schools and hospitals. The imperative that brought South Africa
through its election holds good in its new era: better a slow start than a
false start.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Paradise lost in housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one of Mr John Major's most successful attempts to set out a vision for
the future, he told the 1991 Conservative party conference of his desire to
see wealth cascading down the generations. The house price rises of the
previous decade made such a dream seem plausible.
Many ordinary people found that the increase in value of their homes had
made them wealthy beyond their dreams - on paper at least. Forecasters
predicted a surge in spending for people in their 50s and 60s, who would
inherit their parents' properties. A golden generation would have money to
burn on their own homes, cars, holidays and personal services.
The vision looks a little less plausible now. For well over a million
householders, owning a home is a net liability - their mortgage is greater
than the current value of their home. Negative equity is largely
concentrated in the south of England, where the housing market enjoyed the
largest rise and suffered the deepest slump. But even here its impact is
uneven: some areas are afflicted much more than others.
Where it coincides with pockets of unemployment in former growth areas such
as Essex and southern Hampshire, it holds back the growth of local
economies.
Negative equity also affects some social groups more than others. A study
published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation finds that it
overwhelmingly hits owners under 40. People in professional and managerial
occupations are most likely to be affected. They are the wealth creators of
the future, but they cannot move house to find better jobs, or easily raise
capital to start a business.
Low inflation
The foundation's study also says that average house prices would have to
rise 15 per cent to eliminate this negative equity. Current trends in the
housing market are hard to read, with monthly house price surveys showing
weak price rises, low activity and little sign of any consistent recovery.
This is not a cause for despair: in an ideal world, house prices would
increase no faster than inflation. But if the chancellor's promise of low
inflation proves true, it could be the end of the decade or beyond before
the blight of negative equity is lifted.
A second study published yesterday by the foundation suggests that the
cascade of wealth may be rather more of a trickle than a torrent. In 1992,
140,000 homes were inherited, and over the next 20 years the number will not
rise much above 200,000 a year. The study predicts that this could release
almost Pounds 15bn in 2000, compared with Pounds 7bn now. But it adds a
warning that most of this money will not find its way into consumption. Only
a fifth will flow into consumer spending while the rest is reinvested. No
cornucopia here.
Ageing population
And it would be unwise to assume that even these more modest amounts will be
available. One consequence of an ageing population is an increasing bill for
the care of the elderly. In the past, such care might have been provided by
the welfare state; increasingly, those with assets are expected to pay some
or all of the cost themselves. As the pressures mount on welfare spending,
elderly home owners will have to sell their assets in order to pay for
long-term care.
This is entirely appropriate. What else, after all, is the point of
acquiring wealth except to pay for the comforts of life? The idea of leaving
assets to your children is an attractive one, and often a strong motive
behind wealth-creation. But it cannot be financed at the expense of the
state. It would be wrong for low-income taxpayers, perhaps working long
hours for low wages, to have their taxes raised to support asset-rich
pensioners.
Many of those who were beguiled by the vision of a cascade of wealth may
feel cheated by these harsh realities. Far from inheriting a pot of gold on
the death of their parents, they may find little left after the bill for
their care has been paid. It may be many years before their own home is
worth more than the money they owe on it. They can console themselves,
however, that one consequence of a saner housing market should be that it
will become that much easier for their own children to find somewhere to
live in the future.

FT  04 AUG 94 / UNloved, UNwanted: A fitting fate for the United Nations
Industrial Development Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may have missed it, but 1980 to 1990 was the Industrial Development
Decade for Africa. It had no impact whatsoever on the continent the first
time round, but the perpetrator of this exercise in wishful thinking, the
United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido), appears to work
on the principle that Pooh Bear applied to his Hums.
Pooh, it will be recalled, managed the first line of Hum without difficulty:
'Sing Ho] for the life of a bear.' It sounded splendid, but what came next?
Pooh got stuck, until he had a brain wave. He would sing it very fast, in
the hope the second line would just pop out.
So will you please welcome the Second Industrial Development Decade for
Africa. There is not quite the same ring to it, for Unido seems to have been
caught napping. The second decade runs from 1993 to 2002.
Enough is enough. It is time to abolish a body whose demise would distress
only its 1,200 employees and the hundreds of experts and consultants who
feed from its Dollars 100m-a-year trough.
Unido was introduced to the world on January 1 1967 through General Assembly
resolution 2152 (XXI) of November 17 1966. From the start it had ideas above
its station, claiming that it had a 'mandate to act as the central
co-ordinating body for industrial activities within the UN system'.
Like many organisations spawned by the United Nations, Unido has been
sustained by pompous jargon and an overriding belief in its own importance.
The concept of an Industrial Decade, whatever that means, is given spurious
authenticity through the language signalling its creation. The general
assembly, we are told, in Resolution 35/668 of December 5 1980, proclaimed
the 1980s as the Industrial Development Decade for Africa 'thus giving
worldwide recognition to the decade'.
Of course, it did nothing of the sort, except for UN bureaucrats.
A welter of documents sustained their fantasies, products of seminars and
special sessions where the delegates draw their per diems and build nothing
more substantial than castles in the air. By 1983 Unido had produced a slim
volume of pensees entitled A Programme for the Industrial Development Decade
for Africa. The reader is warned that this handbook 'differs in many
respects from previous practice, and calls for a firm rejection of isolated
piecemeal planning of the past and a clear shift away from over-occupation
(sic) with foreign exchange problems external to the region'.
So much for Africa's overvalued exchange rates of the era, the single most
serious feature of the already evident economic crisis that was destroying
the continent.
'The new approach,' the guidelines reveal, 'is also predicated on a decisive
move towards the integrated development of the human resources,
institutional mechanisms and technological capacities required to assess and
utilise the natural resources and raw material endowments of the region,
expand local markets, enlarge the range of complementarities and strengthen
links between industry and other sectors of the economy.'
Of course, these banal exhortations did Africa no service. What they did do
was to alert consultants and experts worldwide that here was another UN
gravy train.
Like the 1970s, the 1980s saw a series of Unido country reports,
stupefyingly bland in their analysis, out of date in their statistics, and
deferential to autocratic governments and kleptocratic regimes.
Like all UN organisations, Unido selects its officers more for their country
of origin than their expertise. Thus places were found for assorted
econometricians, agronomists and economists, most with dubious credentials.
They usually owed their jobs to political patronage, and lived in a world of
diplomatic privileges, duty free facilities and hardship allowances.
Unlike the World Bank, no one subjects Unido to scrutiny. If anyone cared to
assess its policies and proposals over the 1970s and the 1980s, the
organisation would emerge deeply discredited.
Today Unido has the chutzpah to claim that it 'assists both governments and
the public and private sector through technical and investment promotion
services, and with policy advice'.
The suggestion that this ineffectual agency might assist the private sector,
or have any insight into investment, is risible.
To be fair, Unido should not be blamed for Africa's crisis. True, it bears
the responsibility that attaches to those who stay silent when they should
be sounding the alarm. But no one took much notice of Unido and its experts.
And that is why no one will miss it.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poverty - a limited truth, but alarm
bells should be ringing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GABRIELLE COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is only limited truth in the assertion by Mary Campbell (Personal
View, August 2) that the government's Households Below Average Income
statistics give an incomplete picture of poverty in the UK. She is right
that to talk of vast increases in people in poverty is unhelpful if the
benchmark has itself risen dramatically, as is the case with average income.
However, she overlooks the fact that more people are now living on income
lower than half the 1979 average. Thus, in 1979, 9 per cent of the
population (5m people) were living on income less than half the average.
If this 1979 income figure is uprated by inflation, we find that 11 per cent
of the population (6m people) have income below this level. There is a
particular impact on children, with rises from 10 to 15 per cent and from
1.4m to 1.9m children.
These figures are after housing costs. Such a measure gives an indication of
the amount of income a family has to live on after the key component of
housing has been accounted for. Before housing costs, income has risen for
many families not because they are better accommodated, but because the
government has forced up both council and housing association rents through
its housing finance policy, leading to increased income in housing benefit.
Mary Campbell calls for statistics which reflect people's needs. She seems
to be unaware that the low income families statistics, which related income
to what a family would get on benefit, were discontinued by the government.
However, a report for the social security committee showed 11.35m people
living on or below income support rates of income in 1989.
Alternatively, the figures for means-tested benefits should sound alarm
bells. In 1979, 7.9 per cent of families with dependent children claimed one
or other of the two key income support benefits, but by 1992 this had risen
to 31.2 per cent.
The debate on what to do about poverty is not helped by suggesting the
problem is not really a very serious one.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Training needs benefit of charitable
status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr F BENISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent comment by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Home Office about the
charitable status of many organisations in the UK may have created the
impression that the only objective of any charity is the relief of poverty.
The argument appears to be that, if poverty does not exist, charities may
not need to exist either. This is clearly a nonsense.
As chairman of the National Training Federation - which has many members
that are registered charities and fulfil a vital role in the education and
training of individuals for employment - my concern is that, in any proposed
clear-out, the baby should not be thrown out with the bath water.
Given acceptance that education can have acceptable charitable status, it is
one thing to criticise a small private school for calling itself a charity
to gain tax and other financial advantages. It is another thing entirely to
knock an organisation which exists to provide training or education for
otherwise disadvantaged people - and help them back into work.
Many people will, I feel sure, see this as an altogether proper use of, and
destination for, such relief as is available for those given charitable
status.
The time may well have come to take a close look at the number of bodies
sheltering beneath the charity umbrella. But, rather than make a blanket
declaration or decision on eligibility, let us have a careful reassessment
of qualifying criteria so that end-users with real needs (which are
currently being met by registered charities) will continue to be well served
under any new regime.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Summertime, and the going is busy: Japanese politicians are
spending August locked in cabals and committees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity Japan's poor politicians.
While their European counterparts head for Tuscany or the beach for their
August break, Japan's politicians will be hard at work, in Tokyo's choking
heat and humidity, for the second summer in a row.
Take the leaders of the fragmented seven parties of the mainstream
opposition. They will spend much of the next few weeks talking - in a
meeting room in the Hotel Okura, an ostentatious 1950s building in central
Tokyo - about how to forge a single grand party.
The hotel is favoured by former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, who defected
from the LDP to the opposition last month, for the discretion of its staff
and its pleasant swimming pool. His chances of becoming prime minister again
will sink or swim on the result of these talks.
This time last year, what is now the opposition was struggling to form a
coalition government after a general election ended nearly four decades of
rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic party. Three governments later,
the LDP has schemed its way back into power by forming a curious partnership
a month ago with its former arch-enemy, the leftwing Social Democratic
party.
The old structure of Japanese politics has been turned upside down in the
past year.
The aim of the Okura talks is to regroup into a single large opposition,
informally christened Shin-shinto or the 'New New party', capable of
challenging the LDP-SDP alliance in a general election. A troika of former
prime ministers, Mr Tsutomu Hata, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Kaifu, met in
the Okura on Thursday, for the second time, in an attempt to get Shin-shinto
moving.
For its part, the new government will be just as busy. Cabinet ministers
will be locked in parliamentary committee meetings churning through the
backlog of urgent legislation, from tax reform to the redrawing of
elec-toral boundaries, delayed by the past year's epic power struggles.
While the politicians toil, the public can look forward to a novel
experience, a return to a period of stability. The heat wave, dog shows and
the import bargains resulting from the high yen have over the past weeks
supplanted politics as the top items on television news.
It is no surprise that politicians have decided to go backstage. Voters have
given up trying to discern the difference between the nascent New New party,
the Japan Renewal party, the Japan New party, the New Harbinger party and
the New Future party. And the likely date of the next election is receding
by the day.
When the LDP-SDP odd couple took power a month ago, it seemed they would
only just manage to suppress their policy differences until the autumn, when
new electoral boundaries are due to be in place. This was generally accepted
as the first opportunity for an election under Japan's recently reformed
political system.
Now politicians in both government and opposition are talking about an
election for the lower house, the more powerful of the two chambers, some
time after the upper house elections next July. Japan's prime minister looks
set to stay in office at least long enough for people to remember his name:
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the first Socialist in the job for 47 years. Both
government and opposition have good reasons, political and financial, to
keep him there.
For one thing, the LDP and SDP are getting on better than either side had
dared hope. The pacifist Mr Murayama, with the tacit support of a majority
in his party, has leaned to the right. He has, for example, dropped the
Socialists' most extreme dogma, which included opposition to the US-Japan
security treaty and a belief that the military is unconstitutional.
In return, the LDP, the coalition's senior partner, has courteously inclined
to the left. It has said it might accept Socialist demands to curb military
spending and has agreed to defer indefinitely a rise on consumption tax - a
nod to almost the only Socialist policy the leaders of Japan's SDP still
uphold.
The opposition, meanwhile, needs several quiet months of backroom bargaining
to create its super-party. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the opposition's strategist,
broke a month-long silence recently when he claimed that the new party would
pull together enough lower house members by the end of next month to outvote
the LDP, with its 206 seats.
He may be too optimistic on the timing, given the reservations held by some
potential Shin-shinto members over working with the accident-prone Mr Ozawa,
who contributed to the demise of the previous government by driving the
Socialists out of the old coalition and into the arms of the LDP.
Yet the incentive to unite is strong. In its present fragmented form, the
opposition will be too poor to compete against the government in the next
election, explains a former cabinet minister. The detail of a new law to
control political funding explains why.
Corporate donations to politics have dried up over the past year, which
means that political parties will have to rely on state subsidies, paid
under the new funding law from next January. One feature of the funding
rules, inserted to win a reluctant LDP's support, is that they favour large
parties such as the LDP.
A Y30.5bn annual subsidy is to be shared out between parties, in proportion
to the number of lower house seats; but the subsidy for any individual party
is subject to an upper limit determined by its annual turnover.
That means the LDP and SDP, with their high spending, qualify for a combined
subsidy of Y20bn next year, while a small new party run on a shoestring,
such as Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party, gets only Y200m, says the former
minister.
If the troika of former prime ministers now in opposition manages to round
up all 220 people who supported Mr Kaifu after he left the LDP to stand
against Mr Murayama last month, it could qualify for as much as Y15bn of
subsidy, he explains. That is a compelling reason for Shin-shinto to come
into being.
Money politics are as present as they were in the old days before political
reform. At least the rules of the game, as it unfolds round the Hotel Okura
swimming pool over the next few weeks, are official. The new funding system
might, despite its imperfections, put pressure on Japan's politicians to
move towards the simple two- or three-party system that the original
reformists had in mind.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      JAPAN'S POLITICAL TREE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
GOVERNMENT: conservatives, for economic growth, deregulation and
low-profile foreign policy.  Liberal Democratic Party (206), composed of
50 or so old guardcaring conservatives; and a minority who might defect
to the opposition.  New Harbinger Party (21), a former LDP splinter
group.  Social Democratic Party (74), the mainstream of which has given
up abandoned most of its many left-wing policies.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPPOSITION: reformists - support deregulation, an overhaul of the tax
system and a higher profile foreign policy.  Troika comprises Tsutomu
Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal Party (62); Toshiki Kaifu (22) an LDP
defector; Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party (33). All
three lead groups of reform-minded former LDP politicians.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTSIDE THE TROIKA:  Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party (52),
latterly close to Mr Hata's JRP but which has doubts over working with
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who is Hata's mentor; and the Democratic Socialist
Party (19) which is wavering for the same reason
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE REST:  independents and vacancies (7), plus the Japan Communist
party (15), which has been untouched by the past year's upheavals.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH FLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is disturbing that such a large company as BT still feels unable to
plan its job reduction programme over a period of time and therefore avoid
any need for the unpleasantness and bad publicity that goes with compulsory
redundancy ('BT plans to shed 50,000 more jobs', August 1). It is
particularly noticeable that while Sir Iain Vallance talks of the need for a
further 50,000 job losses he suggests no valid reason as to why this might
be necessary. One would have thought that with the expansion of
telecommunications more rather than less staff might be a more sensible
forecast for the medium term.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tender process does not lead to best
solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms PAULINE GRANT

<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder if organisations which invite consultants to tender for
business are aware of an increasingly counter-productive trend. Tendering is
becoming more widespread, particularly in the public sector under pressure
to demonstrate that it is able to manage costs in a business-like fashion.
Indeed, increasingly we are being asked not just to tender for work, but to
spend a great deal of time compiling information in order to be placed on
the list of those who might later be invited to tender.
The words 'market testing' might thrill civil servants, but they send a
chill of horror through the hearts of a great many small consultancy
outfits.
There is a strong feeling that responding to tenders in the 'softer' areas
such as management development is in effect giving away free consultancy.
This is very different from tendering to more technical specifications where
it is entirely appropriate to compare costs of using one provider rather
than another. Cost comparison is rarely the best means of evaluating tenders
in non-technical areas.
Tendering takes time, and time is what consultants sell. Time not only to
put the response together, but to hold discussions with the inviting
organisation so that it is offered what is believed to be the best solution.
However, this is not charged to the inviting organisation - even travel
expenses have to be absorbed - and therefore becomes a hidden cost to other
organisations with which they work. This is grossly unfair.
If those who can provide the best solutions are being deterred from offering
them, something is going badly wrong. The original intention is not being
achieved and some more creative thinking is required to provide an effective
alternative that will encourage providers to encourage rather than put them
off.

AMERICAN ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE 1980s
Edited by Martin Feldstein University of Chicago Press Dollars 75, 823 pages
Do exceptional individuals make history or are they the blind instruments of
deeper structural changes? In the case of economic policy in the 1980s, the
personal ideologies of leaders such as Ronald Reagan now seem less important
than pundits once thought.
This, at any rate, is the drift of Professor Martin Feldstein's argument in
this cool appraisal of a still controversial decade. Reagan's push for
sharply lower tax rates, deregulation and smaller government (except
defence) aroused intense opposition, especially among left-wing Democrats.
Yet Feldstein argues convincingly that such reforms were a logical -
probably inevitable - reaction to changed circumstances.
He points out that the postwar Keynesian policies attacked by Reagan had
become anachronistic. They were an emergency response to frighteningly high
levels of unemployment and unused capacity in the Great Depression. The
magnitude of this crisis prompted economists to drop their usual emphasis on
incentives and efficiency and stress instead the importance of demand
management and government intervention.
Yet since demand deficiency was never a serious problem after 1945, at some
point a renewed focus on economic incentives and entrepreneurship was all
but inevitable. Within the economics profession, the shift began in the
1970s as economists such as Feldstein began to emphasise the adverse effects
of high marginal tax rates and generous government transfer programmes.
Meanwhile, the pernicious interplay of high inflation and an unindexed tax
system destroyed returns on many forms of saving and investment, fuelling
popular demands for reform.
The claim that something akin to Reaganomics was inevitable gains
plausibility if you recall that market-friendly reforms were adopted (to a
greater or lesser degree) in nearly all industrial countries in the 1980s,
including nominally socialist regimes. And although enthusiasm for free
markets has waned somewhat since, there has been little backsliding - nobody
seems to want the penal income tax rates of the 1970s.
In Feldstein's view, Reagan was smarter than generally recognised. He
handled meetings adroitly and managed to 'convey a clear sense of policy
direction without limiting his future flexibility'. Unlike George Bush, he
avoided theatrical 'read my lips' type commitments on future policy. He
sincerely believed in low taxes and smaller government, but was not an
extreme supply-sider: in private conversation he showed few signs of
believing that income tax cuts would boost growth sufficiently to be
self-financing.
Feldstein has little doubt that Reagan was a net plus for the US economy. In
the approach to the 1982 congressional elections, with the jobless rate
above 10 per cent, Reagan staunchly supported the Federal Reserve's tight
monetary squeeze, thus ensuring that double-digit inflation would be tamed.
He improved incentives by reducing tax rates at all income levels, by
indexing allowances for inflation and by eliminating many loopholes; the top
rate fell from 70 per cent to 28 per cent, before rising under Bush.
Although he failed to cut overall public expenditure, he did reduce domestic
discretionary spending from 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1980
to 6.1 per cent a decade later, no mean achievement given Democratic
strength in Congress.
There were setbacks. Despite an aversion to high taxes, Reagan signed a tax
bill in 1986 that raised the capital gains tax by 40 per cent. He agreed a
big increase in social security contributions, thus securing the long-term
future of a public pension scheme that he once hoped to privatise.
The biggest irony, of course, was that Reagan, a politician ostensibly
committed to balanced budgets, presided over record federal deficits.
Feldstein does not minimise the damage they did by depressing the US savings
rate. But he does argue, plausibly, that having created deficits, other
much-criticised aspects of policy then made sense. Thus the trade deficit
enabled the US to borrow from abroad and sustain a much higher rate of
investment than would otherwise have been possible. The dollar's volatility,
meanwhile, was the only practical way of resolving the inconsistency between
monetary and fiscal policy.
There is one defence of deficits that Feldstein might have emphasised. This
is that they acted as a crude brake on public spending. Had Republican
presidents raised taxes to keep pace with the spending demands of
congressional Democrats, expenditure would have spiralled upwards even
faster. And if Bill Clinton had inherited a balanced budget, you can be
certain that the US would today be embarked on a far more ambitious
programme of public investment.
Feldstein and other contributors leaven their analysis with vivid personal
recollections, making this a surprisingly readable as well as scholarly
volume. Topics covered include monetary, budget, tax, trade and regulatory
policy. Yet there is one striking omission. Feldstein finds room for a
chapter on health and safety regulation, yet unaccountably ignores the US
labour market.
There is little discussion of the Republican success in creating some 20m
jobs or of its controversial policy changes, such as the phasing out of many
public training programmes. And the book is silent on what has become the
principal criticism of Reaganomics - the fact that stagnant or declining
real wages for many workers led to greater inequality of income and wealth.
Yet it was this shift that created the sour public mood of the early 1990s -
a mood that enabled the Democrats to regain control of the White House.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong chemistry for president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL ALEXANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Democrat Jim Hightower, who described President Clinton as
'thixotropic' (Observer: 'Quality test', August 3), may know his politics
but he doesn't know his chemistry. A thixotropic substance is fluid when it
is stirred and solid when left to stand (not, as he apparently said, solid
until heat is applied).
But his analogy works. The message is: if you want a solid president, stop
stirring.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Arts: Pages's 'Renard' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In this week's triple bill, just as the season ends, the Royal Ballet has
brought Ashley Page's Renard to the Opera House stage. Page created it
earlier this year for the welcome and enterprising Dance Bites tour which
took a group from our national ballet to smaller regional theatres with
newly made choreographies. I reported on the piece at its February showing
in Leicester. It is characteristic of Page's work that he should chose a
fine artist to give the production a vivid painterly image, and Bruce
McLean, who designed Page's Soldat for Rambert, has massed the stage with
bold shapes, bold colours.
Stravinsky's Renard is an awkward score, embedded in Russian peasant
tradition, and nothing Page or McLean do can make it either comprehensible
or very entertaining. (In a Diaghilev staging, the farmyard characters were
performed by acrobats, which suggests a certain despair about the piece).
Page's version looked rather better in the closer confines of the Leicester
stage than at the Opera House, where its faux-naivetes lose some point.
Interpretations at performances on Monday and Tuesday nights were strong,
and I much enjoyed the playing of Jonathan Cope as the Fox, Gary Avis as the
Goat and Matthew Trent as the Cat - big, clear dancing. But Renard is, I
hazard, an impermanency: that cussed score and thin narrative do not invite
repertory life, well played though the music was under Lionel Friend.
Jonathan Cope was also a persuasive Belyayev in A Month in the Country. The
staging is, alas, now looking very mannered. The characters go through their
paces like well-trained circus animals - nipping through various flaming
dramatic hoops; putting not a foot wrong, and not a living emotion right.
Some interpretations are now barnacled, and Ashtonian nuance, and
no-less-necessary Ashtonian chic, are lost in a flurry of silk, lace,
ribbons, and other items of old Russian knick-knackery. There is a good deal
too much semaphoring going on.
Cope takes the stage and we see a young man of undeniable physical allure,
and - rare in this role - potent masculinity, caught up in a turmoil he
cannot properly comprehend. The dance is full in tone, full in meaning. The
character is alive. So, too, is Sarah Wildor's Vera. Miss Wildor has an
inborn sense of how to time and sustain gesture, how to hold emotion on a
broad phrase of dynamics: it is the dance equivalent of bel canto. Her Vera,
like Jane Burn's sweetly vulnerable performance on Monday night, showed us
the girl's heart. Other performances only showed us the clothes. As a
cross-cultural note, I record that the footman, Matvey, is now played as one
of the lads from Takarazuka, with a good deal more maquillage than
credibility.
The bill is completed with David Bintley's Tombeaux, in gleaming condition.
The ensemble is sharp, clear in style; the central performances by Viviana
Durante and Bruce Sansom on Monday night were eloquent, elegant - Miss
Durante beautifully mondaine in manner. The closing moments in which Sansom
circles round his ballerina and sweeps away into the night is a wonderful
choreographic image. I still deplore the men's costumes: funereal long johns
that turn them into neckless monsters. The girls in their amethyst tutus are
beautiful.
The Royal Ballet season ends, with a run of performances of Romeo and
Juliet, on Saturday.

This is to be the year of the Lucan. Twenty years ago come November Lord
Lucan tried to kill his wife and killed his children's nanny instead. He
then disappeared. He is almost certainly dead but the absence of a body, and
the fact that Lucan had rich and influential friends, has given
gossipmongers a field day. True Stories; Dead Lucky (Channel 4 at 9.30) is
the first of an avalanche of speculative programmes.
This is a tabloid kind of evening, with another subject more usually found
in the popular press. In the late 1970s burly George Roberts became Julia
Grant. His sex change operation, and adjustment to his new life, was filmed
by a television crew. Now the cameras return to discover how Julia has fared
during her time as a woman. A Change of Sex (BBC 2 at 9.30) starts
with a repeat of the 1979 programmes.
In its early years there was always one night at the Proms devoted to
Wagner. To celebrate the 100th year this tradition is revived as the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales kicks off with the most performed piece at the
Proms, the overture to Tannhauser (BBC 1 at 10.35).

FT  04 AUG 94 / Arts: Southerne's 'The Wives' Excuse' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a fascinating new old play - one not seen since it was new at Drury
Lane just over 300 years ago; it failed then, but succeeds now. It tells a
new old tale of men working to manipulate women for their own sexual
gratification, and of women resisting those manipulations and exercising
what independence they can.
The title is The Wives' Excuse, the subtitle Cuckolds Make Themselves; and
the author, Thomas Southerne, is better known for his tragedy Oroonoko.
Though parts of the highly complex plot are bewildering, what emerges
powerfully is a vivid, serious Restoration Vanity Fair in which liaisons
dangereuses flourish. The characters repeatedly look vice in the face like
their old familiar, and yet most of them retain a disturbingly sharp moral
sense. And while all too many of the men voice a view of women so narrow as
to be more or less misogynistic, enough of the women - in very different
ways - struggle to maintain their own worth.
While almost all the cream of current Stratford actors are occupied in
Adrian Noble's concurrent production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the
director Max Stafford-Clark has achieved here such excellent ensemble that
not even the weakest individual performances puncture it for an instant. In
this production, he achieves results far finer than in his previous RSC
stagings of A Jovial Crew and The Country Wife (the latter currently playing
at the Pit) - no doubt because he has found a play here that best sparks his
flair for social and sexual criticism.
From the first moment, he creates a convincing and multi-faceted world of
refined manners and crude desires. And, best of all, he makes it fast. True,
details of the plot whirl past so rapidly that we cannot keep up with them,
but this does not matter, for everything shows us a world onstage that
rattles along at its own rate and with its own inner life. He even
transposes the play into Regency costume to good effect, turning its male
rakes into bucks and beaux who play upon its Empire-lined heroines.
One performance stands out: Lesley Manville as Mrs Wittwoud, the most
cynical and least virtuous woman in the play. This performance, a model of
economy, has wit, danger and complexity. It reaches its peak in a brief
soliloquy in which Mrs Wittwoud reflects on the dilemma of being known for
wit rather than virtue. ''Tis not enough for a woman to be handsome; there
must be a probability of making that handsome woman kind, to make a man in
love with her . . . Now, from one of my character, who have impertinently
prated away so much of my time - in setting up for a wit, to the ruin of
other people's pleasure and loss of my own - what encouragement for
probability can there be, but that, as I have lived a fool, I ought to die
repenting, unpitied, and a maid? If I had died a maid, 'tis but what I
deserved for laughing off their charitable design of making me otherwise.'
What a speech] - and how freshly delivered. Without any sacrifice of period
style, Manville makes us see Wittwoud as clearly as if she lived today, and
makes her a study in the perils of feminine wit to be set beside those in
Congreve, Austen, Trollope, or Wilde.
The cast is large. It would be easy to pick at flaws in various other
performances - some of the better-behaved female characters should have as
much force, intelligence and inner conflict as Mrs Wittwoud - but one's main
sensation is of excitement in following so lively and serious a sexual
comedy. Purcell songs are sung, albeit with too little confidence or grace,
before and during the play, and they beautifully heighten its elegant
climate. Julian McGowan's set marvellously looks as if it were built into
the Swan Theatre. And the action is so well focused that it reminds me again
that of the RSC's five regular theatres the Swan is the most actor- and
audience-friendly.
In RSC repertory at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

<TEXT>
THE LAST SEDUCTION (18) John Dahl
WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT (PG) Maria Luisa Bemberg
ZERO PATIENCE (18) John Greyson
THE EMAGINATOR
A great many women today are involved in dreadful crimes. We only just
recover from knife-wielding Glenn Close when along comes ice-pick murderess
Sharon Stone. A little later, Nicole Kidman and Kim Basinger join the
roguesses' gallery. And last week a lustful, power-crazed woman known simply
as 'Queen' abandoned her step-daughter in a forest, causing the girl to fall
prey to mineworking dwarfs.
Yes, we know, that last incident actually took place 50 years ago and has
been 'revived' for modern filmgoers. But that only makes our point for us.
Terrifying women - call them femmes fatales or vindictive queens, call them
Joan Crawford or Sharon Stone or Snow White's step-mother - pop up in
history whenever men feel nervous about a changing power balance in the sex
war.
Such films have the label 'noir' attached to them, being sinister, paranoiac
and lit with the single flickering flame of the director's misogyny. The
style is common to the 1990s and the 1940s, since both eras rejoice(d) in a
Hollywood patriarchy living in terror of women taking power. The sole
difference is that 'Feminism Strikes]' (1990s) has replaced 'Women Take Over
The Workplace]' (1940s) as the anxiety headline.
The lovely thing about these phobic films is that they suit both sexes. Take
John Dahl's splendid The Last Seduction, from the man who brought us prior
noirs, Kill Me Again and Red Rock West. Men can swoon at the dominatrix whip
wielded (metaphorically speaking) by sultry, darkhaired Linda Fiorentino, a
go-getting wife who gets gone with Dollars 700,000 of her drug-dealing
husband's money. And women can cry 'Way to go, Linda]' as she outwits all
the men in her life thereafter: from the husband himself (Bill Pullman) to
the provincial hick (Peter Berg) with whom she forms a new partnership in
crime and carnality.
In the little town of Beston our heroine takes an assumed name, an insurance
company job and a season ticket to sexual delirium. Very modernly done, this
last. No '40s-style censor-dodging innuendo. Straight out with the hard
stuff. Girl (Fiorentino) meets boy (Berg) in bar. Girl puts hand inside
boy's fly. Girl sniffs withdrawing hand approvingly. Soon they are crawling
all over each other in beds and cars and garbage areas.
I hear you tut-tutting already. 'No style, no wit, no obliquity]' you tut,
thinking back to the days when all Lauren Bacall was allowed to do on screen
with Humphrey Bogart was ask him if he knew how to whistle. But The Last
Seduction has lashings of style - Dahl knows when to fit a lightning storm
into the visual heraldry, or when to close in on a cigarette surreally
stubbed out in an apple pie - and not a little wit. When the heroine first
comes to Beston, she suffers instant culture shock. Everyone in the street
says 'Good morning' to her: and her startled reaction limns at a stroke the
contrast between the ships-in-the-night New York she has left and the dotty,
convivial Eden she has arrived in.
There is high-style obliquity too, only not wasted on the labour of being
indirect about sex. When Fiorentino hatches her scheme to get rich as a
hit-person - tapping into credit card statements, she tracks down wealthy
men who have betrayed their spouses and suggests her services to the wives -
the film becomes a delicious black comedy of insinuation. For the great
thing about women as prime movers in a plot is that they can draw on
decades, or centuries, of supposed gentility in order 'innocently' to moot
the unmentionable.
Another heroine who knows her mind and mobilises it is the mother in Maria
Luisa Bemberg's We Don't Want To Talk About It. This Argentinian film comes
from the lady who gave us Miss Mary and I, The Worst Of All: Bunuel-suave
tales of sex and gnomic violence. The new movie, drawn from a magical
realist novel by Iulio Llinas, tells of dwarf girl Carlotta, her
normal-height widowed mother (the formidable Lustina Brando) who hopes to
marry her off, and Marcello Mastroianni as a lovestruck charmer who keeps
travelling round the world and back again before finally popping the
question.
The short/tall, May/December, wanderer/homebody romance plot is just one if
the film's offbeat charms. Bemberg draws a rich portrait of a determined
woman; and a funny-malicious picture of a little town where gossip is the
main industry, closely followed by social hypocrisy. When the Mayor dies in
the middle of a wedding - that wedding - everyone pretends not to notice;
and he is shoved into a bathful of ice-cubes afterwards so as not to spoil
the party. Like an impossible wine, at once sweet and dry, the film goes its
intoxicating way towards an ending no less startling and funny for being
utterly inevitable.
John Greyson's Zero Patience is an Aids musical from Canada. Anything that
will shake the grip of this disease - even the use of jollity to judder
people into a greater awareness of it - is welcome. But then again (donning
film critic's cap): just because a movie is brave and well-motivated does
not mean it is any good.
No problem with the giddy production numbers and their up-yours lyrics - 'I
got Kaposi's] I got retinitis]' And all power, in the cause of populist
shock therapy, to the chorus of singing sphincters.
No, what distresses is the straight-and-stuffy stuff. All that rheumatic
'comedy' involving Victorian explorer Richard Burton (John Robinson), who
has been allowed a surreal life-extension as a Toronto taxidermist (sic)
assembling a multi-media exhibition on the disease's history. With help from
the ghost of Patient Zero (Normand Fauteux), the Air Canada flight attendant
said to have brought the disease to America, Robinson-Burton emcees the film
in his dreadful 'English' accent and wages his own brave but boring battle
with homophobia.
The movie would love to be ludic and sometimes it is. More often, though, it
resembles an ill-edited varsity revue: full of smirking sophomores who think
that a mixture of scholarly allusiveness and knees-up vitality will slay
them all in the college prom.
Finally, a 'Where did you read it first?' footnote. I now demand my own
Richard Burton Award for having been the first into uncharted
cine-territory. 'The Emaginator,' newly packing them in at London's
Trocadero centre, is a white-knuckle movie-show cum stunt-ride which you
really should experience. You roll and pitch in a movement-simulator seat
while watching frighteningly realistic footage of speedy mountain roads,
corridors in space, dangerous mine tunnels.
The reason the film is so vivid is that it was shot at an
all-but-flicker-free 60 frames per second, in a system first promoted under
the name 'Showscan.' FT readers will have learned of this in March 1988,
when I brought the news of techno-breakthrough back from Hollywood.
Back then I was asking, Why can they not introduce this system into feature
films? Now I ask it again. We know the usual answer: money. But it is time
we all spoke up and said to Hollywood, 'Stop. Change direction now]' We
would surely rather have millions spent on a serious advance in screen
technology than tens of millions spent on otiose production values and
ageing, overpaid stars in summer rubbish like The Flintstones and Maverick.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Technology: Finally hitting the big time - Vanessa Houlder
examines the commercial applications of massively parallel processors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bass Taverns of the UK ran a promotion to boost the sales of Guinness
in its pubs on St Patrick's night, it wanted to analyse the effectiveness of
the campaign. Did the promotion increase sales of Guinness compared with
other brands of beer? Did it boost margins? Did it build up customer
loyalty?
In the past, it has always been hard to analyse these kinds of questions
with any degree of accuracy. Sifting through massive amounts of data to
answer complex queries was too difficult and time-consuming for the
company's mainframe computer.
This year, however, marketing analysis of this type has become possible for
Bass Taverns as a result of the recent introduction of a massively parallel
processor, a relatively innovative type of high-performance computer.
Parallel processors use numerous microprocessors to process a number of
pieces of information simultaneously, rather than one bit at a time as in
conventional computers.
The power and speed of the MPP allows Bass Tavern's marketing department to
manipulate sales data far more easily than before. 'Someone running the
estate now has information in a far more flexible form,' says Mike Jones,
director of IT planning and development at Bass Taverns. 'They don't have to
fight their way through boxes of information.'
Bass Taverns is just one example of a growing number of companies which are
exploiting the power of parallel processors. Data-mining - the extraction of
information from databases - is at this stage one of the most popular
commercial applications of these machines.
Financial institutions are using parallel processing to crunch through data
to evaluate financial instruments. Retailers are using it to track the daily
spending patterns of consumers. Banking and credit card companies can use it
to detect fraud by going through databases and recognising unusual patterns.
Other potentially important uses include computer modelling of car designs,
'just-in-time' warehousing, digital libraries, interactive multimedia and
video-on-demand.
Parallel processors are not intrinsically new. Ever since the technology was
pioneered in the 1970s, research departments and science laboratories have
been keen users. However, labs represent a relatively small market compared
with the big and largely untapped commercial market.
Many observers think the time has come for parallel processors to make
inroads into the commercial market. 'I think parallel database technology is
going to proliferate throughout the IT community within the next few years,'
says Howard Richmond, vice-president of Gartner Group, a US consultancy.
He predicts that commercial applications of parallel processors, currently
worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) a year, will become a multi-billion dollar
market over the next few years. This enthusiasm is shared by the computer
companies that are scrambling to get into the market, although some
casualties are forecast as a result of more cut-throat competition, together
with the cuts in the defence industry's spending on computers.
One factor hastening the advent of parallel processors into mainstream
commercial use is that researchers have begun to crack the programming
problems which have dogged their progress until recently.
Another reason for the upturn in interest in parallel processing is that
companies are placing greater demands on their IT systems.
'Until now there has not really been a need for massively parallel
processors. Now companies are needing to get a competitive edge by looking
at sales trends,' says Keith Rankin a marketing manager at IBM, which
launched its SP2 parallel processor earlier this year.
Falling costs are also helping to attract new users. Since parallel
processors often use cheap, mass-produced microprocessors, their cost can be
one tenth of that of mainframes with the same theoretical processing power.
The relatively low cost of parallel processors means that companies can
introduce systems that would not have been economic using mainframes.
British Shoe Corporation, which is using a Meiko parallel processor to give
its buyers more information about sales trends, says that it is
'questionable' whether it would have justified the cost of installing the
system on a mainframe.
Humberside county council, which uses a Meiko parallel processing machine to
manage the payroll records of its 60,000 employees and pensioners, likewise
believes that the investment will pay for itself within three years. The
machines' running costs are 20 per cent less than the mainframe which
preceded it.
The flexibility of parallel processors was another attraction for the
council, which has an uncertain future under the planned reorganisation of
local government. Expanding the power of a parallel processing system is a
relatively simple matter of adding extra processors.
'The real beauty of the system is that we can grow as big as we want without
losing performance,' says Bob Burchell, the council's IT manager.
The eventual size of these machines is still a matter for conjecture. Meiko,
the UK-based supercomputer company, is in talks with a bank that wants to
build a 2 terabyte (trillions of bytes) system for marketing purposes, which
it says is about 20 times larger than the largest available mainframe. 'We
don't know whether it would be possible. We just don't know until we do it,'
says Bob Carnell, a vice-president at Meiko.
This underlines the fact that parallel processing machines are still a
relatively unknown quantity. Many businesses are nervous about embracing
them until their reliability has been proven beyond all doubt. 'Customers
who are now buying parallel machines have to be a little brave,' says Robin
Phillips, managing director of Parsys, a UK manufacturer.
But many of the companies which are trying out these systems believe that
being in the vanguard of MPP technology could give their businesses
important advantages. Norman Ellis, business systems manager of the British
Shoe Corporation, believes that the technology will lead to more informed
decision making.
'It turns data into information,' he says. 'I believe it will make quite a
radical change to the business.'

Stephen Cuthbert, who quit a year ago as boss of Brent International, the
speciality chemical maker, has emerged as director general of the Chartered
Institute of Marketing.
Cuthbert, 51, received over Pounds 250,000 in compensation when he stepped
down from Brent last August, following growing City discontent about the
performance of the company. His early career was spent with Price Waterhouse
and he was finance director of Brent from 1976-80 and chief executive from
1980-93.
Cuthbert has been active in the CBI and was chairman of the CBI southern
regional council.
Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman, who is also president of the
Chartered Institute of Marketing, said that Cuthbert's 'strong corporate
background will give the Institute further weight in its urgent task of
establishing marketing at the top of every business agenda'.
The former CIM chief executive, James McAinsh, has retired. He held the post
from March 1992.
The CIM, which has a total of 50,000 members and students, is the
professional body for marketing and sales, and is particularly known for its
training courses.

For a glimpse into the future of massively parallel supercomputers, step
into the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory 'Cave'.
A virtual reality environment created using an IBM SP2 massively parallel
supercomputer, the cave can be used to simulate complex processes enabling
researchers to see and hear physical changes as they occur and to test and
modify their experiments.
IBM has demonstrated two potential applications of the cave. The first,
which could provide a powerful new tool for drug development, is based on a
molecular dynamics simulation program, running on the IBM SP2. It enables a
researcher to watch and interact as a drug molecule docks on to its human
protein target. To show how virtual reality could be used to enhance
standard industrial processes, the cave simulates a grinding process. As
material is ground away from a piece of material - wood, metal or plastic -
changes in temperature and stresses created by the grinding can be
simulated.
'Virtual reality is most often thought of as an exotic technology for
entertainment purposes, but it also has vast potential to revolutionise
applications in scientific, engineering, medical and commercial industries,'
says Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's power parallel
systems group.
The Argonne virtual reality experiments demonstrate the new role that US
National Labs are playing in developing technologies that are expected to
have broad commercial applications. As pioneers in the use of MPPs, the labs
are providing a testing ground for new computing technologies.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Technology: Cleaner ways with nuclear waste - An innovation
with vast potential cost savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL MILGROM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US company has developed a technology for handling high-level nuclear
waste more cleanly and cheaply than existing methods. It also makes the
extraction of strategic and precious metals more economic.
Molecular recognition technology (MRT) is the brainchild of Reed Izatt and
Jeremy Bradshaw, professors of chemistry at Brigham Young University in
Utah. The company, IBC Advanced Technology, was formed as a spin-off from
the university.
MRT is a type of separation process tailored to recognise certain metals and
reject others. Caesium-137 and strontium-90 are the two most important
radioactive constituents of nuclear wastes, even though they occur in low
concentrations. They provide 98 per cent of the heat and 97 per cent of the
penetrating radiation liberated during the first 30 years after the wastes
have been formed.
MRT can remove caesium-137 and strontium-90 from the waste stream, so
minimising the volume of waste that has to be turned into glass and disposed
of geologically. Potential cost savings are estimated to be several billion
dollars.
MRT makes use of cavity-like molecules called ligands. These contain atoms
that function like teeth, biting into and holding certain metals inside the
ligand but not others. What determines this selectivity is the number and
type of atomic teeth contained in the ligand, and the size and shape of the
overall molecule.
Every metal found on earth has its own way of responding to these criteria -
which means that it is possible in theory to design a ligand to recognise
almost any metal and reject the rest.
When the MRT ligands are bonded chemically to solid supports, such as silica
or titania, they can be used in conjunction with porous membranes or
fabricated into columns and gels. This makes MRT potentially valuable in any
industry where metal separation is a problem or a financial burden.
As miners exhaust high-grade copper ores, for example, the metal will
increasingly have to be extracted from low-grade deposits containing large
amounts of impurities. Extracting the metal by conventional methods
(smelting and electrolysis), while abiding by increasingly tough
environmental regulations, means a sizeable hike in the price of copper. MRT
is a cheaper way of extracting these strategic metals.
MRT can also take out toxic metals such as lead, mercury, bismuth, antimony
and arsenic from waste streams, returning clean water to the environment.
New regulations are requiring a lower lead content in tin, used in the
packaging, beverage and electronics industries; MRT will reduce lead levels
in tin to below 30 ppm, without incurring environmental costs.
What makes MRT attractive, compared with traditional separation by
precipitation, ion exchange and solvent extraction, is the speed at which it
operates, and a selectivity that does not diminish however low the
concentration of the desired metal becomes.
One of the company's earlier successes with the nuclear industry in 1991 was
the separation of rhodium from spent nuclear fuel. Rhodium is important as
one of the constituents used in catalytic converters, and European demand
for rhodium is expected to increase as a result of legislation requiring new
cars to be fitted with catalytic converters.
The company has formed an alliance with 3M, the US-based multinational, and
Pacific Northwest Laboratories to tailor MRT for taking caesium-137 and
strontium-90 out of nuclear waste. This involves using 3M's membrane
technology to incorporate IBC's MRT ligands.
Testing at the US Department of Energy's Hanford site (a large underground
nuclear waste storage facility in Washington state) begins later this year,
but tests using non-radioactive caesium and strontium show that the IBC-3M
membranes can isolate these metals at concentrations as low as a few parts
per billion.

North West Water has appointed a managing director to turn round the
fortunes of its process division.
John Beckitt, 46, comes from ICI, where as international business manager
for its KLEA business he was responsible for developing, manufacturing and
marketing a range of refrigerants as alternatives to CFCs.
His task at the process division will be to reverse the recent decline which
has seen profits before interest and tax fall from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds
8.8m in the last year. The division has suffered from a delay in expected
spending on water treatment equipment by US city councils.
Brian Staples, North West's chief executive, said Beckitt was well-qualified
to oversee the division's development. 'John's wide expertise in developing
manufacturing and marketing technical products in an international market
makes him the ideal candidate,' he said.
'Under his leadership I fully expect the process equipment division will
progress strongly to make a valuable contribution to the group's overall
performance.'
The division, recently created by the merger of North West's process
equipment and instrumentation businesses, employs more than 2,000 people in
North America, Australasia, and Europe.

Steven Mills, managing director of BROMSGROVE INDUSTRIES and one of the
architects of its strategy to grow primarily through acquisitions, is
stepping down.
His departure is further evidence of the change in direction at the
specialist engineering group, where consolidation has replaced
diversification as the preferred method of increasing earnings.
Mills arrived in 1987 as part of the management team chaired by Bijan
Sedghi. Since then, shareholders' funds have expanded to Pounds 36m from
Pounds 5.7m.
But with the accent on organic growth and the number of operating divisions
cut from six to three, Mills' financial background has become less relevant.
'We do need an engineer at the centre,' said Sedghi.
There seem to be no hard feelings about the parting of the ways. Sedghi
called Mills 'a man in a million' and stressed that Mills would not be
severing his links - he would advise on the group's property interests and
stay on as an independent trustee of the pension fund.
The decision that Mills would go was taken during discussions at which Mills
was present. 'The discussions were sensible, amicable, the decisions
maturely arrived at,' Sedghi said.
The company is now looking for a replacement.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): What makes a
defector? - A model of brand loyalty inspired by religion and politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If your customers are satisfied, will they be more loyal? If your answer to
the question is yes, you are fully in tune with current conventional wisdom.
But you may also be wrong.
Customer loyalty is a modern marketing buzzword. Studies by consultants such
as Bain &amp; Co have proved that tiny increases in the rate of customer
retention can produce big boosts to the bottom line. Not surprisingly,
loyalty schemes are proliferating and more and more companies are tracking
customer satisfaction in a bid to improve customer loyalty.
Some, such as Rank Xerox, have made customer satisfaction their leading
performance indicator. Others, such as IBM UK, link staff bonuses to
customer satisfaction targets.
But new research throws doubt on one of the basic assumptions behind such
schemes. Sometimes disgruntled consumers are loathe to defect to another
brand and never do. Others, who are 100 per cent satisfied, will switch
allegiance at the drop of a hat. Last week, for instance, British Airways
revealed that the defection rate among 'satisfied' customers was 13 per cent
 -exactly the same as among customers who complain.
The key is to understand the dynamics of conversion, says Jan Hofmeyr, a
South African religious psychologist turned market researcher. At any one
time, he argues, a certain proportion of a brand's followers (be it a
consumer product, service, political party, religion or ideology) will be on
what he calls a 'conversion trajectory'. Effective customer retention - and
the successful poaching of rivals' customers - depends on understanding the
four factors that drive individuals along that trajectory.
They are: the degree to which the brand fits the individual's needs and
values; the degree to which it involves the individual; the availability of
an alternative; and the individual's attraction to that alternative. The
first factor, the needs/values fit, is the stuff of traditional customer
satisfaction surveys. But it misses the crucial element of commitment, says
Hofmeyr.
Where involvement is low, for example in a consumer's relationship with his
cat litter brand, loyalty switching is usually a simple 'hop, skip and a
jump'. But where it is high - the result of heavy emotional or financial
investment as in a financial services product, a car, or even a marriage -
people are much more conversion resistant.
Hofmeyr first developed his theories when completing a PhD on religious
belief formation. In a study of South Africa's large Hindu population he
found a new generation of 'exceptionally unhappy' Hindus desperately trying
to hold on to their beliefs. The Hindus wanted to stay loyal but large
numbers ended up defecting.
He then turned to South Africa's ruling National Party, discovering in 1987
that a growing number of its supporters were increasingly restive about
apartheid's long-term viability. Their doubts had never bubbled to the
surface because they were strongly repelled by the alternatives. They
drifted on, ambivalent, until FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela offered them a
way out.
Since then Hofmeyr has applied such insights, gained from the study of
religious and political conversion, to nearly 50 categories, from banks to
beers. Companies using the model include Anheuser-Busch, Gillette, Mobil,
Nestle, Nissan, PepsiCo, and the current soap wars rivals Procter &amp; Gamble
and Unilever.
According to his 'conversion model', which he presented publicly in Britain
for the first time at a Dragon International seminar recently, purchasers of
any brand can be broken down into four types: 'entrenched', 'average',
'shallow' and 'convertible'. The entrenched feel the brand fits their needs
and values perfectly. They have no need to look elsewhere. The last two,
while still 'loyal' purchasers, are weakly committed, or on the threshold of
defection.
Significantly, the research process (a simple two-minute questionnaire) also
classifies non-purchasers into similar categories: 'available',
'ambivalent', 'weakly unavailable' and 'strongly unavailable'. The crucial
analysis for any brand is how many consumers fall into each of these
categories, and why.
One of the main conclusions of Hofmeyr's research so far is that too many
marketers allow their strategies, especially pricing strategies, to be
dictated by the waverings of the convertibles, only to end up compromising
the very brand values that keep their entrenched followers entrenched.
The conversion model is not the only psychology-inspired attempt to help
companies delve deeper into the black box of consumer motivation. At
Mathematical Market Research (MMR), researchers are employing techniques
originally used to pinpoint perception differences between psychopaths and
the rest of the population.
Central to the technique is the 'method of triads' where the interviewee is
asked in what way A and B are different or similar to C. By asking a myriad
of such questions, the researcher can build up a detailed picture of the
interviewee's world view.
Different levels of questioning, from 'which brand do you prefer, A or B?',
through 'why do you prefer A?' and on to 'why does that attribute
particularly matter to you?', unveil consumers' preferences and what drives
these preferences, says MMR managing director David Thomson. This can be
used to identify gaps in what appear to be crowded, mature markets.
Hofmeyr and Thomson's theories are a challenge to those who confuse habit
with loyalty, who believe that the incentives or 'bribes' associated with
most loyalty schemes create genuine customer loyalty, or who assume that
continued repurchase is proof of customer satisfaction. They also suggest
new ways for marketers to convert their rivals' loyal followers. Customer
loyalty may currently be a bandwagon, but it is no longer clear that it is
heading in the right direction.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): How the model works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers are asked questions to tease out their satisfaction and commitment
to all the leading brands in a given category.
Each consumer emerges with one of many hundreds of possible combinations of
answers. These are number-crunched to create a matrix. Sophisticated
mathematical models, using catastrophe theory (which identifies the cusp
where gradual changes stop, and a leap to a new state occurs) are then
applied to break out clusters of different types of consumer, such as
'entrenched' or 'convertible'.
At the same time, attitudes towards each brand's strengths and weaknesses
are gathered. Perceptual maps, profiling the different attitudes of
purchasers and non-purchasers, pinpoint why consumers are staying loyal or
defecting, and suggest where marketing effort needs to be directed.
To test the model, a US tobacco company analysed the US cigarette market in
June 1990. Two and a half years later, it recontacted the 2,478 consumers it
had questioned. Despite price changes and volatility in the market, only 32
per cent of the 'entrenched' consumers had switched brands, compared with 79
per cent of those identified as 'convertible'.

</HEADLINE>

The word unisex somehow seems trapped in the 1970s, when entrepreneurs tried
to persuade the children of the 1960's sexual revolution to sport the same
haircuts, wear the same jeans and use the same toilets.
Unisex, or the concept behind it, is now set for a revival as Calvin Klein -
the US fashion designer behind such best-selling fragrances as Obsession,
Eternity and Escape - prepares for this autumn's launch of cK one, his
latest scent. Whereas Eternity, Escape and other perfumes are aimed either
at women or men, cK one will be what Calvin Klein calls a 'shared fragrance'
for the young consumers who, he believes, are ready to buy a scent created
for both sexes.
'It's different from everything else we've done,' says Kimberley Delsing,
chairman of Calvin Klein Cosmetics, a subsidiary of Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consumer products group.
'This company is known for big fragrances with big smells. But our research
told us there was a new generation of young consumers out there who want
something new and fresh with a lighter smell that doesn't fit into the
conventional categories. That's cK one.'
Calvin Klein is not the only cosmetics company to have detected a demand
from consumers for innovation in the fragrance market. After an uncertain
period in which the industry has adopted a conservative approach to product
development, a number of other groups - notably L'Oreal of France and
Japan's Shiseido - are now becoming more experimental.
The prestige perfume market remained relatively resilient during the
recession and has grown rapidly as economic conditions have improved.
Industry estimates suggest that retail sales have risen by up to 7 per cent
in the US and Europe since the start of 1994. Yet profitability has been
depressed by the expansion of big companies - such as France's Elf Sanofi
and Estee Lauder of the US, as well as L'Oreal, Shiseido and Unilever -
which has heralded a new era of escalating advertising budgets. The cost of
launching a new fragrance worldwide has risen to Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m)
thereby raising the risk of costly failures.
These pressures have encouraged the industry to play safe in the
presentation of new products. The most successful new scents of the 1990s -
Tresor from L'Oreal and Champagne, the first Yves Saint-Laurent launch since
its acquisition by Elf Sanofi - have targeted the classic fragrance market
by reflecting traditional images of luxury in their advertising.
The first sign that there was also a demand for something different was the
runaway success of the fragrance launched last spring by Jean-Paul Gaultier,
the ageing enfant terrible of French fashion. His scent has a fairly classic
smell, but breaks all the industry rules with its punky advertising campaign
and a bottle (designed by Gaultier himself) in the form of a woman's torso
encased in an aluminium can.
Chantal Roos, chief executive of Beaute Prestige International (BPI), the
Shiseido subsidiary behind Gaultier, says they set out to create a perfume
to 'capture the spirit of his fashion - witty, creative, slightly
controversial'. The strategy has worked with some European stores running
out of the scent last Christmas.
'Gaultier's success taught us all a lesson,' says Georges Klarsfeld,
director of L'Oreal. 'It told us that some consumers were tired of seeing
the same old images in perfume advertising - the classy women jumping out of
private jets or fancy cars. They wanted something they could relate to.'
L'Oreal's response is Eden, the new Cacharel fragrance introduced in Europe
this spring. Eden is designed to appeal to the ecologically concerned
consumers of the 1990s. Its advertising features evocative rainforest scenes
and Eden is packaged in a green bottle with no discernible brand name. The
bottle is made from an opaline substance that changes colour to ensure that
each one is unique.
Eden has already beaten its sales targets across Europe, according to
Klarsfeld. L'Oreal is now preparing for its US launch next spring. Similarly
BPI plans to take Gaultier to North America this autumn. Comme des Garcons
and Yohji Yamamoto, two avant garde Japanese designers, are also finalising
plans for fragrances which, like Gaultier, will reflect the idiosyncratic
themes of their fashion.
But the most iconoclastic new product of all is undoubtedly cK one. Having
decided to break new ground by launching a 'shared fragrance', Calvin Klein
Cosmetics is also adopting an innovative approach to marketing. It has
chosen a tactically low price of Dollars 35 for a 100ml bottle of cK one eau
de toilette, against Dollars 50 for Obsession. It is also introducing
youth-oriented products, such as massage oil, and will sell cK one in
unconventional outlets, notably Tower Records music shops.
'The stores are very excited about cK one,' says Delsing. 'But at the end of
the day it's the customers who'll decide whether it's a success.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / Accountancy Column: Caparo-Touche saga ends with a twist in
the tale - Andrew Jack argues that the pre-court settlement leaves important
issues for auditors untouched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant chapter in the history of auditor liability closed in the last
few days with the settlement of one of the most important legal cases for
accountants in many years.
A decade after the ill-fated acquisition of Fidelity, an electronics group
which issued accounts later shown not to reflect the true financial
position, its auditors have made a payment without admission of liability to
Caparo, the mini-conglomerate controlled by Mr Swraj Paul which bought the
company.
Four years after the original case went to the House of Lords on a point of
principle that left Touche Ross victorious and many of its competitors
delighted, the firm has now paid over some Pounds 1.35m to Caparo in advance
of a related legal action that was due to be heard in the courts in October.
Yet again, it means that independent observers - not to mention interested
parties such as accountants and their insurance underwriters  - have been
deprived of the chance to publicly scrutinise a firm's audit methods and
determine whether or not there was negligence.
The payment is particularly surprising to those who had earlier witnessed
the determination of Touche to prove its innocence and fight the case so
tenaciously - while Mr Paul was equally determined to see justice done to
vindicate his contrary view.
It was back in June 1984 that Caparo Industries began buying shares in
Fidelity, mostly after the unqualified accounts for the year to March 31
1984 had been issued. It was able to complete the acquisition of the company
by October that year.
The 1984 accounts showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.3m, sales up 23 per
cent on the previous year to Pounds 41.1m and the value of stocks up 54 per
cent to Pounds 7.5m. Caparo claims it was on the basis of these audited
figures that it launched its take-over - and would otherwise not have gone
ahead.
Once in charge of the company it soon discovered that the figures were
substantially overstated. This led to the first Caparo action - against both
Touche Ross and the directors of the company - in July 1985. The writ
suggests that instead of the claimed profit, Fidelity had made a loss of at
least Pounds 465,000.
Caparo argues that the difference is explained by a combination of putting
in the accounts stock that did not exist, under-providing for obsolescent
stock, and under-providing for sales credits. It seems that a series of
stock sheets were forged and altered, and then withheld from the auditors
making copies of sample sheets.
It argues that Touche was negligent because a proper audit would have
highlighted many causes for concern. These included abnormally high stock
figures compared with previous years' accounts; knowledge of the
inadequacies of Fidelity's stock system and stock-taking procedures; and
rigorous controls to check and verify the information the stock-take
produced.
Based on its own expert witness report, Caparo also argued that Touche
should have reviewed monthly sales and returns and investigated unusually
high figures such as those in March 1984; thoroughly circularised and
followed-up for responses from debtors; and received all relevant
information including full and proper representations by management before
signing off the accounts.
In January 1991, Mr Justice Webster found in the High Court that Mr Steven
Dickman and Mr Robert Dickman, two Fidelity directors and substantial
shareholders also sued by Caparo, were guilty of dishonesty on a number of
counts relating to information presented in the accounts. They have since
become bankrupt.
But none of the substantive points relating to the auditors ever reached the
ears of the court. Touche argued that it simply had no 'duty of care' to
Caparo, as a third party that was not a shareholder at the time of the issue
of the accounts. The firm's view was ultimately upheld in the House of
Lords. Auditors were accountable only to existing shareholders and the
company itself, the ruling said.
In many ways, Caparo harks back to an even more significant legal judgment
more than 60 years ago, which was also taken against a predecessor firm of
Touche. In 1931, Judge Cardozo in the New York courts ruled in the
Ultramares case that auditors should not have 'liability in an indeterminate
amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class'.
Mr Emile Woolf, a partner with accountants Kingston Smith, says that the
handful of tort actions since Caparo has taken an equally restrictive line
to limit auditors' duty of care. The draft EU fifth directive would have
reversed Caparo across member states, but seems to be languishing. The
result is that auditors are now able to largely shrug off the threat of
third party actions.
Meanwhile, the effect of Caparo has been to shift the battleground to
actions in contract: where the company itself sues its auditors for breach
of its agreed obligations. None are more feared by the firms than those
brought by the receivers and liquidators to large failed companies -
themselves accountants and under a legal duty to pursue the maximum return
for creditors.
It was this route that Caparo latterly chose in its efforts to pursue
Touche. Since the House of Lords prevented an action in the name of the
third party share purchaser of Caparo, it sued as Intersound Consumer
Electronics, the name by which Fidelity itself is now known.
Touche was originally sued in the Caparo case for Pounds 13.4m - the cost of
the acquisition - plus the return had the money on the purchase been more
wisely invested, as well as costs and interest since the date of the
purchase of Caparo: giving a total sum probably in the range of Pounds
25m-Pounds 35m.
The difficulty is that Fidelity as a company only experienced a change in
ownership, and its shareholders in fact benefited from Caparo paying too
high a price. As a result, the only loss apparently suffered by Fidelity in
contract is the few tens of thousands of pounds in fees paid to the auditors
because the accounts were not accurate. In consequence, Mr Woolf says the
Touche settlement seems 'surprisingly high'.
Mr John Magill, the Touche partner who co-ordinated the litigation, says
simply: 'The costs of these things are absolutely enormous. It made good
commercial sense to reach an amicable settlement.'
Asked whether he maintains the view that Touche is confident of the adequacy
of its audit and that it would have won the legal case, Mr Magill says: 'We
would not have settled for that amount of money for any other reason.' He
will not comment on any of the substantive points of alleged negligence
raised by the case.
Mr Woolf believes that Caparo was necessary to prevent 'open-ended
liability' against auditors under all circumstances. In the short-term, he
would like to see contributory negligence permitted in contract cases as it
is in tort, so that the plaintiffs are under an obligation to mitigate
losses and cannot simply entirely rely on the defendants.
In the longer-term, he would welcome a shift to the approach elsewhere in
Europe of 'several liability' where the courts can apportion damages between
the parties being sued based on the degree of culpability. By contrast, the
present English approach of 'joint and several liability' permits one party
such as auditors to pay all damages even if only marginally implicated.
But he argues that Caparo goes too far in protecting auditors under all
circumstances even when there is clear negligence, and an explicit
understanding that their work will be relied on by a third party.
There is a public duty for limited companies to file accounts, and for those
accounts to be 'true and fair'. The auditor has been granted a monopoly to
verify this financial information, and needs to be held accountable. After
all, the audited figures are the same figures whoever reads and acts on
them.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Milk hormone is panned: Alison Maitland finds resistance
stems from fear of a backlash by consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers, consumers, farming organisations and animal welfare groups have
come out strongly against the licensing in Britain of a hormone that boosts
milk production in cows.
More than 100 companies, organisations and individuals responded to a
government consultation paper, with 62 expressing concern about bovine
somatotrophin, or BST. Twenty-one favoured licensing it, including the BST
manufacturers Monsanto and Lilly Industries, and the rest expressed no firm
opinion.
BST, an artificially produced version of a hormone that occurs naturally in
cows, went on sale to farmers in the US in February after approval from the
Food and Drug Administration last November.
European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide in December whether a
ban on its use should be lifted or remain in place until the year 2000.
Britain is believed to have been in a minority of two in wanting the ban
lifted when the 12 ministers discussed the issue last December. Germany is
thought to have favoured an indefinite ban, while most countries wanted a
moratorium until the end of the decade.
Although the hormone has met EU and UK licensing criteria of safety, quality
and efficacy, much of the opposition to it is based on fears of a consumer
backlash.
Monsanto last month cited figures from the US Department of Agriculture
showing liquid milk consumption in the US had remained steady since BST was
introduced.
However, the British Retail Consortium said in its submission that 'consumer
concern about BST has reached such a pitch that most, if not all retailers,
would like to be able to guarantee that their products do not come from cows
treated with it'.
Safeway, the supermarket group, said that if BST went on sale it would seek
supplies 'only from non-treated herds for milk and milk products for our
own-brand products'.
Pressure on Mrs Angela Browning, the new food minister, came in a letter
opposing BST from the Conservative party association in her Devon
constituency. In the event of licensing, it insisted on labelling to
distinguish milk produced with BST, saying: 'It is one of the government's
main planks of policy that consumers have the right of choice in a free
market.'
In spite of the generally accepted view that BST-produced milk is safe for
humans, some groups expressed concern about the increased presence of a
growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).
In a letter last month to The Lancet, the medical journal, four medical
scientists wrote that 'the safety of BST-milk has not been established with
adequate scientific rigour, because of possible adverse effects of
substantially increased concentrations of IGF1 in the milk of BST-treated
cows'. They said evidence was needed about the action on human gut tissue of
IGF1, which is not destroyed by pasteurisation.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals pointed to
problems such as mastitis, injection-site reactions and cystic ovaries which
Monsanto warns farmers about in its product information.
Those favouring BST included scientists and veterinary organisations who
back ministers' views that a decision should be based on scientific
principles and that approval would boost the biotechnology and farming
industries.
The Association of Veterinarians in Industry said approval of BST 'will put
farmers in Europe on an equal footing with their cousins in the US'.

FT  04 AUG 94 / BCCI fraudster is jailed for 3 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former senior employee of Bank of Credit and Commerce International was
jailed for three years at the Old Bailey yesterday in spite of unprecedented
pleas by US prosecutors.
Mr Imran Imam, a former accounts officer in the bank's London offices, was
convicted last week of helping to boost the failed bank's profits
fraudulently by Dollars 250m. He achieved this by falsifying records
relating to bogus loans to customers from which BCCI claimed fee and
interest income.
The jury found him guilty of charges including conspiracy to conceal or
falsify documents and furnishing false information to the bank's auditors.
Mr Imam's sentencing followed highly unusual pleas in mitigation from US
prosecuting officials who argued that his co-operation with them had
resulted in the recovery of Dollars 730m of missing BCCI funds.
Mr John Moscow, assistant New York district attorney, and Mr Richard Small,
counsel with the Federal Reserve, gave evidence to the court praising Mr
Imam's role in their investigations.
Mr Imam's co-operation with the US authorities started when the bank
collapsed in July 1991 and included his giving evidence in two criminal
trials in the US.
Imprisoning Mr Imam, Judge Pownall said the assistance he had given to US
investigators meant he was entitled to a substantially shorter sentence.
The judge also said he could understand why Mr Imam might have felt 'hard
done by' when the UK authorities decided to prosecute him. During a
pre-trial hearing lawyers for Mr Imam said that while he was co-operating
with the US authorities he had been led to believe that he would not be
prosecuted in the UK. The Serious Fraud Office has denied ever giving such
an assurance to the US authorities.
The judge said, however, that the BCCI fraud was a 'stupendous' one in which
Mr Imam had played 'a dishonest and not inconsiderable part'.
He accepted that Mr Imam had acted under the instructions of Mr Swaleh
Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, and that others had been more
responsible for the fraud. However, he said Mr Imam had played a larger role
in the fraud than he had asked the court to believe.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Rules on property receivers urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last remaining area of insolvency that is entirely unregulated could be
subject to tough restrictions under proposals being drawn up by the
profession.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is leading a campaign to
introduce examinations, training and licensing for law of property act (LPA)
receivers.
LPA receivers are appointed by lenders to recover the maximum value from a
debtor from any property or other assets on which they have a fixed charge
to secure their loan.
No existing legal and professional requirements cover LPA receivers, and so
anyone - regardless of any criminal record or lack of experience - is able
to take on the role.
Nobody knows how many LPA receivers are practising, and there are no
official publications or procedures through which they could be publicly
identified.
Rumours circulating within the insolvency profession suggest that a
nightclub bouncer may have been appointed as LPA receiver to a nightclub,
and a matron as receiver to a nursing home.
Mr David Lowe of Grimley J R Eve, chairman of the insolvency skills panel of
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'There is no regulation
at all and we honestly don't know how many LPA receivers there are.'
He said he did not want to see a repeat of the dishonesty and financial
scandals triggered by some insolvency practitioners, which had led to the
introduction of licensing for the profession in the 1986 Insolvency Act.
Initial approaches from the institution to the insolvency profession and the
Department of Trade and Industry were rebuffed on the grounds that if it
took over exclusive licensing rights for LPA receivers, it would be accused
of creating a cartel.
However, representatives of a number of the leading professional bodies,
firms and government agencies are due to meet to discuss the issue at the
end of next month.
The organisations to be represented will include the DTI; the Incorporated
Society of Valuers and Auctioneers; the Insolvency Practitioners'
Association; the British Bankers' Association and several professional
firms.

<TEXT>
The Anglo-French inter-governmental commission has approved limited
passenger services through the Channel tunnel.
The commission has given permission for invitation-only passenger rail
operations, the final stage of preparation for running regular public
services.
Trains will be run at less than full load with increasing frequency, under
the supervision of the commission, which must satisfy itself on safety.
Trains will carry invited passengers and their cars between the Cheriton
terminal at Folkestone and the Sangatte terminal near Calais.
Eurotunnel shareholders, travel agents, journalists and politicians will be
among the first groups invited. The company hopes to launch a regular
service in October.
The commission's decision also covers high-speed Eurostar passenger trains
between London, Paris and Brussels.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Ashdown aloof on 'new-look' Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown is resisting attempts to change the political stance of the
Liberal Democrats so the party becomes more clearly identified with Mr Tony
Blair's 'new-look' Labour party.
The Liberal Democrat leader made clear yesterday that he was unmoved by
criticism that he should establish his party's preference for a government
led by Mr Blair as opposed to further Conservative rule.
Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank - one of the 'Gang of Four' who quit Labour to
establish the Social Democratic party - yesterday underlined the
difficulties facing Mr Ashdown by saying that Mr Blair could be 'a good
prime minister'.
Speaking on BBC Radio, Lord Rodgers called for a clear indication that the
Liberal Democrats recognised that, with the emergence of Mr Blair, Labour
had become electable again.
Another two of the Gang of Four have spoken on the same issue.
Lord Jenkins of Hillhead has described Mr Blair as the 'most exciting'
Labour leader since Mr Hugh Gaitskell. While he has urged 'friendly
relations' with Labour, Baroness Williams has gone further by suggesting
that the Liberal Democrats should work with Labour towards a 'common
programme'.
Lord Rodgers forecast that as prime minister Mr Blair would be able to give
the country the leadership it needed. He would have the authority which
'John Major desperately lacks'.
Mr Ashdown is seeking to retain a middle-of-the-road position, claiming that
the Liberal Democrats would be able to work with either Mr Major or Mr
Blair.
Mr Ashdown hopes that by keeping his party aloof it will retain its appeal
to dissidents in both the main parties.

FT  04 AUG 94 / MoD insists on final say over aircraft order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence yesterday insisted that it would have the last word
on whether Britain should buy the US Hercules or the European Future Large
Aircraft to replace the RAF's ageing transport fleet.
The move came in spite of the formation of a committee of officials from
several Whitehall departments to oversee debate on the project.
The MoD said that any conclusions the committee reached would be advisory,
and that defence ministers would decide. The decision was not thought likely
to go to the cabinet.
The formation of the committee comes after intense lobbying over which
aircraft to buy. The committee will consider the industrial implications of
the decision for the UK, as well as military needs. In addition to the MoD
and the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Welsh and
Scottish offices and the Foreign Office will attend.
Corrosion of the old Hercules airframes and heavy use means that up to half
of the existing fleet of 60 aircraft may need to be replaced or refurbished
before the year 2000.
British Aerospace, the company that would build the wings for the FLA if
Britain joined the project, has argued strongly that its lead in wing design
would be lost to French and German companies if the RAF bought the US
aircraft.
It says that the FLA will be bigger and faster than the C-130J Hercules, and
that, if the UK becomes a full member of the programme, it will be worth
Pounds 5.5bn and secure 7,500 British jobs. If the UK does not agree to buy
the FLA, however, BAe role as wing manufacturer is likely to go to DASA of
Germany.
Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the C-130J, has said its aircraft will be
ready to meet the RAF's immediate need by 1996. The FLA still faces
uncertain development costs and will not be available until the next
century. Lockheed estimates that UK participation in the C-130J will be
worth Pounds 2.2bn and will secure 3,500 jobs in Britain.
The defence ministry has also opposed providing development money for the
FLA project from which it withdrew in 1989. BAe has, however, suggested that
the FLA would be built by the Airbus consortium using civil aircraft methods
and that the development costs could be included in a fixed purchase price.
The MoD said that it took all factors into account when making decisions,
and that defence ministers were best placed to judge military requirements.
Both companies expressed satisfaction at the committee's formation. Lockheed
welcomed the establishment of the sub-committee 'particularly as all of the
facts and claims on both sides - the C-130J and the FLA - will be exposed .
. . to the scrutiny of officials'. BAe 'welcomed the discussions being
broadened to include the rest of Whitehall'. No time has been set for the
committee to reach a decision and it has not yet met. However, the MoD had
hoped to decide which aircraft to buy before the end of the year.
There was some expectation that a decision would be announced with the Front
Line First defence cuts and equipment orders last month, but a publicity
campaign by BAe is thought to have scuppered that possibility.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Mortgage loan data cast doubt on upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further doubt was cast yesterday on the strength of the housing market
recovery as Bank of England figures showed that new mortgage lending was
broadly flat in June compared with May.
There was a mixed picture in the forward-looking indicator of monthly
statistics on mortgage loans approved. This is a guide to the loans which
will be undertaken in the following few weeks.
The amount approved increased - Pounds 4.95bn in June against Pounds 4.72bn
in May - but the number of loans fell to 84,000 from 86,000.
Seasonally adjusted figures showed new gross mortgage lending at Pounds
4.73bn in June, as it was in May and up slightly from Pounds 4.49bn in June
last year.
New net lending strengthened in June, to Pounds 1.61bn from Pounds 1.44bn in
May and Pounds 1.18bn in June last year.
The increase over last summer appears to be due largely to building
societies lending more aggressively and regaining market share. In June last
year banks undertook Pounds 711m new net lending while the figure for
societies was Pounds 772m. In June this year the figures were Pounds 713m
and Pounds 1.1bn respectively.
Significant debt repayment by building societies and other financial service
companies was one of the factors behind a sharp fall in lending by the nine
largest UK banks in the three months to the end of June, the British
Bankers' Association said yesterday.
Its figures showed that borrowing by building societies fell Pounds 530m in
the second quarter of the year, after rising Pounds 617m in the first
quarter. Lending to the financial sector fell Pounds 660m in the quarter -
the first such fall since 1992.
Lending by the largest banks was Pounds 1.35bn in the second quarter of the
year, compared with Pounds 3.76bn in the first quarter.
The association said the decline might have been slightly exaggerated by the
timing of Easter, which had pushed some transactions into March rather than
April, although this probably did not affect the figures by more than Pounds
500m.
In the financial sector borrowing by securities houses fell Pounds 855m, or
15.2 per cent, in the three months to June, compared with the previous three
months. This was partly offset by a 14.2 per cent rise in lending to pension
funds and insurance companies.
Bank lending to the corporate sector continued to decline in the past
quarter, partly due to a switch in corporate funding away from bank
borrowing and towards internal financing and borrowing on the financial
markets.
The largest falls occurred among retailers and construction companies, which
both reduced borrowing by more than 4 per cent.
Lending to the personal sector continued to rise, providing further signs
that consumer confidence remains relatively unaffected by April's tax rises.

FT  04 AUG 94 / BT to cut cost of directory inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is cutting the cost of directory inquiries for UK
numbers, Alan Cane writes.
BT said yesterday that from September 1 calls to directory inquiries will
cost 25p including value added tax compared to the 44.2p now charged. BT
said technical improvements had made the cut possible. Charges were
introduced three years ago. Inquiries for international numbers will still
cost 44.42p.
Oftel, the industry watchdog, and the Telecommunications Users' Association
both welcomed the move.
The association said its research showed that 64 per cent of customers had
either stopped using the service or switched to a cheaper alternative since
the charges , thought to be among the highest in the world, were introduced.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Concern on fall in grants to housing associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government grants to housing associations to fund the cost of low-cost homes
for rent or sale will fall next year, in spite of warnings that this will
make it harder for them to raise capital.
Mr David Curry, housing minister, yesterday announced the ceiling for
housing association grants would fall from 62 per cent of the cost of a new
home to 58 per cent in 1995-96. This is higher than the target of 55 per
cent set two years ago for 1995-96.
Lenders have warned that a fall in rates below the present level would make
it much harder for associations to raise the balance of the cost on the
capital markets.
Nationwide building society, one of the largest lenders to the sector, said
last night that it would have to look much more closely at the viability of
lending to associations. It said: 'Whilst we are pleased that the government
hasn't reduced the grant rate to 55 per cent we feel that at an average rate
of 58 per cent many housing associations may find it difficult to secure
their private-finance requirements.'
Associations raise about Pounds 1bn a year to top up government grants to
build subsidised homes.
The lower grant rate could make many lenders reluctant to lend the 42 per
cent needed to top up the grant. Tenanted homes are commonly valued at 50
per cent of their vacant value, with lenders wanting cover of 150 per cent
of the loan. Associations are now having to pledge older properties as
security for new loans, which in effect cuts many newer and specialist
associations out of development.
The National Federation of Housing Associations has warned that the cuts in
the grant rate will reduce the number of associations that are able to
borrow and build homes.
Mr Jim Coulter, federation director, warned last night that the need to
borrow a higher proportion of the cost would put up rents. 'On average rents
for new homes at this grant level are likely to be 30 per cent higher in
1996 than 1993 rents,' he said.
Mr Curry said that he was confident that associations would be able to
maintain their building programmes at the new rate.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Meter problems confuse electricity users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of industrial and commercial consumers of electricity are facing
confusion over their bills as a result of severe metering problems in the
section of the supply market recently opened to competition.
Four months ago medium to large users were given a choice on who should be
their supplier and about 12,000 took advantage of this. However many have no
firm idea how much their electricity is costing and are working from
estimates.
According to the Major Energy Users' Council some consumers fear they will
never be given accurate bills covering the last four months. Mr Richard
Wills, the council's technical director, said: 'The degree of incompetence
on the part of the electricity industry is breathtaking. Our members are
having to divert a horrendous amount of management time to sorting out the
mess.'
Among the causes of the problem is that about 5,000 consumers are still
awaiting installation of special meters or have had meters installed which
are not working properly. This is partly due to meter shortages in some
areas, although some companies share the blame for slowness in appointing
meter operators.
Reasons for meters not working properly include incorrect installation - in
some cases because of poor training - and a failure to ensure that the meter
is connected to telecommunication lines.
Relatively sophisticated 'code 5' meters are needed because they can gauge
how much power is used every half hour and can be read remotely by the
electricity bill settlement authorities.
Power prices are determined by the pool for every half hour, and vary
according to demand.
The thousands of customers without 'code 5' meters are facing weekly visits
from the local electricity companies' readers to enable the bill settlements
department at the pool to make estimates.
Monthly meter readings were the norm before April 1.
The inconvenience caused by the more frequent meter readings is
counterbalanced to some extent by electricity suppliers sending bills which
in general underestimate what will eventually have to be paid, thus helping
customers' cashflow.
The suppliers say part of the confusion has been caused by late decisions by
Offer, the industry regulator, on several issues affecting the market. One
decision was to introduce competition in meter reading. Previously it was
the preserve of regional electricity companies.
A regional company executive said: 'Introducing competition in both meter
reading and electricity supply at the same time has proved too much.'
Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said that deciding who should
install the meter and associated technology had proved a bureaucratic
nightmare. The system which was introduced involved too many people and
organisations.
The pool has set up a task force of eight people to sort out the settlements
problem.
In spite of the problems many companies will benefit financially from the
introduction of competition because of the fall in prices that has resulted.
Estimates of annual bill reductions of at least 4 per cent are common.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Unions at Swans claim EU victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing former Swan Hunter employees claimed a significant legal
victory yesterday when a Newcastle industrial tribunal decided that it could
consider claims that the British government had failed to implement European
directives.
The shipyard unions had brought a case at the tribunal against the
employment secretary alleging that the government had not paid in full
'protective awards' won on behalf of 420 redundant Swan Hunter employees at
a tribunal last September.
The awards, made under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978,
were made in compensation for the receivers' failure to give 90 days'
consultation before making job cuts after they were called in, in May 1993.
After the tribunal's decision Mr Christopher Vajda, counsel for the
employment secretary, said an appeal would be lodged.
The European Court of Justice ruled in June that the government had failed
to implement properly the collective redundancies directive which requires
that there be a proper sanction against employers who fail adequately to
consult on redundancies.
A ruling by the court in 1990 held that when a member state is in breach of
its obligations, citizens who have suffered losses as a result can pursue
claims for damages against their government. The government maintains that
these cases - called Francovich awards - should be heard only in the High
Court.
Yesterday's tribunal decision means that the way is now open for UK
claimants to pursue a much less costly route for claiming damages, said Mr
Stefan Cross of Brian Thompson &amp; Partners, representing four of the five
unions involved .
Mr Cross said this tribunal decision, unless overturned, would also provide
a potential alternative redress for employees aggrieved by changes to their
contracts under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations of 1981.
The Newcastle tribunal is now hearing the unions' claim, itself a test case
on insolvency, that the department should not have based its calculations on
eight weeks' deducted money, instead of 12, paid in lieu of notice. Most of
the 420 workers received little or nothing, but if the unions win, some
could gain Pounds 5,000.
The employment department is involved because, on receivership, it assumes
many responsibilities to employees.
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, sole prospective bidder for Swan
Hunter as a going concern, said yesterday its latest offer to the receivers
included payment of the design team until the end of this year.
Swans' order book ends in November and receivers Price Waterhouse must
decide soon whether to make redundant the 100-strong design team, needed for
future tenders.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Imro to weigh use of derivatives and emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund-management industry, is to look
at fund managers which invest in emerging markets and those which use
derivatives. The watchdog's aim is to ensure that investors are not being
put at risk.
Mr Philip Thorpe, Imro chief executive, said that while there was no
evidence that investor protection was being compromised, 'we are always
concerned where there is a bandwagon effect'. The performance of emerging
markets relative to domestic or developed stock markets had led to keen
investor interest in this sector, he said.
He added: 'We are just taking a look and seeing if there is cause for
concern.' He was particularly concerned to see that investors understood the
risks both of emerging markets and of derivatives.
Mr Thorpe's remarks came as Imro unveiled its first quarterly 'performance
indicators' report, detailing the extent to which the watchdog is meeting
its performance objectives.
The report showed that 152 separate complaints had been received, of which
71 related to 'unsuitable' advice given to clients. Of these, about
one-third relate to individuals who had been encouraged to transfer out of
their occupational pension scheme and into a personal pension.
Most of these complaints are against Imro member companies which are large
chains of independent financial advisers who will soon join the Personal
Investment Authority.
Separately, Mr Thorpe said that regulators might eventually review their
rules relating to 'soft commissions' - the procedure by which fund managers
accept services from brokers in exchange for agreeing to transact minimum
amounts of trades through them. One Imro member, Abbey Unit Trust Managers,
recently became the first group to be disciplined for abuse of the rules by
accepting free foreign travel for its fund managers.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Further delays hit Crest system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange signalled yesterday that it might not be able to speed
share settlement further by the middle of next year, saying that it would
make a firm decision at the end of October.
The Stock Exchange last month abandoned its two-week or three-week account
settlement period in favour of rolling settlement 10 days after each bargain
is struck - the initial phase of a move to develop the new Crest system for
paperless share settlement.
Crest, a project spearheaded by the Bank of England, is intended to narrow
the settlement period to three days after each bargain is struck.
Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank, had earlier set a target date
for 'T plus Five' - five days after the date of the trade - of no later than
the middle of next year.
In a recent letter to Mr Michael Lawrence, Stock Exchange chairman, Mr Kent
said that the Bank would not be involved in the move to speed share
settlement to five days after trade date. He said: 'We will remain fully
behind the further move to five-day settlement but do not expect that this
will require a major contribution from the Crest team, which is devoting all
its resources to the development phase.'
Meanwhile, Thompson Financial Services, a provider of software for
securities trading and settlement, said yesterday it had extended its
electronic trade confirmation service to Asia, where it would be able to
speed share settlement both in the region and for cross-border transactions
in the US and Europe.
The Bank has said that the ability to confirm trades electronically is
essential for cutting settlement periods.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Railtrack plans for the unthinkable: What the result of the
supervisors' ballot could mean for the signalling dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the railway supervisors' ballot due to be announced this
afternoon could have a crucial impact on the signalling dispute.
Officials of the RMT transport union are publicly confident that supervisors
will support action so that they can join strikes on Friday August 12 and on
the following Monday and Tuesday. This would follow the seven days' notice
of strike action required by law.
But in private officials seem less sure of the ballot result and are playing
down its significance.
The 1,200 supervisors oversee the work of the 4,600 signalling workers, as
well as instructing them and testing their work.
The work of the supervisors, who earn an average of about Pounds 20,000, is
critical in ensuring safety.
Railtrack estimates that just 385 of the supervisors belong to the RMT and
have been ballotted - about a third of the total number. If they reject the
strike call the pressure on the union to make a swift settlement will be
substantial. Such a vote would undermine the solidarity of the signalling
workers and make it easier for Railtrack to persuade an increasing number to
ignore strike calls.
But both sides are planning contingencies in the expectation of a Yes vote
from the supervisors.
A fortnight ago Railtrack officials seemed unprepared to contemplate such an
outcome. They still hoped that a settlement could be reached before there
was any question of supervisors joining the strike action.
Since then management has had to start preparing for the unthinkable. It is
clear that Railtrack and British Rail would not be able to run as many
trains as they have been in the past few weeks if the supervisors joined the
strikes.
But Railtrack said that it was impossible to estimate how serious an impact
that would have on services. Observers believe that some supervisors will
not heed a strike call, partly for fear of managerial reprisals.
Whatever sympathy supervisors may have for signalling workers it is by no
means certain it will translate into joining a dispute that is only
indirectly relevant to them.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Meter problems confuse electricity users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of industrial and commercial consumers of electricity are facing
confusion over their bills as a result of severe metering problems in the
section of the supply market recently opened to competition.
Four months after medium to large users were given the choice of who
supplies their electricity, many of about 12,000 which took advantage of
this have no firm idea how much their electricity is costing and are working
from estimates.
According to the Major Energy Users' Council some consumers fear they will
never be given accurate bills for the last four months. Mr Richard Wills,
its technical director, said: 'The degree of incompetence on the part of the
electricity industry is breathtaking. Our members are having to divert a
horrendous amount of management time to sorting out the mess.'
The problems arise in part because about 5,000 consumers are either still
awaiting installation of special meters or have had meters installed which
are not working properly. This is partly due to meter shortages in some
areas, although some companies share the blame for slowness in appointing
meter operators.
Reasons for meters not working properly include incorrect installation - in
some cases because of poor training - and a failure to ensure that the meter
is connected to telecommunication lines.
Relatively sophisticated 'code 5' meters are needed because they can gauge
how much power is used every half hour and can be read remotely by the
electricity bill settlement authorities.
Power prices are determined by the pool for every half hour, and vary
according to demand.
The thousands of customers without 'code 5' meters are facing weekly visits
from the local electricity companies' readers to enable the bill settlements
department at the pool to make estimates.
Monthly meter readings were the norm before April 1.
The inconvenience caused by the more frequent meter readings is
counterbalanced to some extent by electricity suppliers sending bills which
in general underestimate what will eventually have to be paid, thus helping
customers' cash flow.
The suppliers say part of the confusion has been caused by late decisions by
Offer, the industry regulator, on several issues affecting the market. One
decision was to introduce competition in meter reading. Previously it was
the preserve of regional electricity companies.
A regional company executive said: 'Introducing competition in both meter
reading and electricity supply at the same time has proved too much.'
Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said deciding who should install
the meter and associated technology, and how, had proved a bureaucratic
nightmare. The system which was introduced involved too many people and
organisations.
The pool has set up a task force of eight people to sort out the settlements
problem.
In spite of the problems many companies will benefit financially from the
introduction of competition because of the fall in prices that has resulted.
Estimates of annual bill reductions of at least 4 per cent are common.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Tribunal showed race bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The woman who chaired an industrial tribunal showed bias and acted
irregularly in her handling of a case brought by a college lecturer of Asian
origin, the Employment Appeal Tribunal has ruled.
The Commission for Racial Equality said the appeal judgment demonstrated the
need for specialist tribunals to deal with race-discrimination cases.
The claim was brought in November 1990 before the London South Industrial
Tribunal by Mr Minya Laher, a senior lecturer in financial management at
Westminster College, London. He claimed that his failure to be shortlisted
for two teaching posts at another college amounted to racial discrimination.
The tribunal, chaired by Mrs Stella Hollis, dismissed his claim.
However, Mr Justice Morison said Mrs Hollis had shown bias and acted
irregularly by denying Mr Laher the opportunity to explore evidence. She was
also criticised for querying whether Mr Laher could speak English properly.
Mr Herman Ouseley, CRE chairman, said the case vindicated the commission's
concerns about tribunals in race cases.
'The commission has long advocated the need for specialist tribunals in
discrimination cases. This case demonstrates that adjudication in such cases
requires special skills and good cross-cultural understanding.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / Plan 'to oust' City broker in sex discrimination case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior manager at a City broker accused of making unwanted advances
towards a female colleague told an industrial tribunal yesterday there was a
'strategy' to oust her from the company.
Mr Giles Wilkinson, head of production at Willis Corroon, the insurance
broker, said there was 'a strategy on behalf of Willis' to sack Miss
Samantha Phillips, an aviation broker, after she had been accused of lying
to underwriter LA Hudson to clinch a deal.
Miss Phillips, who is claiming unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination,
has denied that she failed to inform LA Hudson that she had contacted other
underwriters about insurance cover her company was setting up for a client.
At yesterday's hearing in Croydon, south London, Mr Jeremy Flaxman, a senior
executive at Willis Corroon who investigated the allegation, said he did not
set out in advance to fire Miss Phillips.
Mr Leonard Hudson of LA Hudson repeated the allegation against her to the
tribunal. He said Miss Phillips had lied when seeking an insurance quote. He
said: 'We rely on total trust with brokers and it had broken down with Miss
Phillips.'
Miss Phillips was fired in 1992 for gross misconduct. She has said the
insurance deal with LA Hudson hit problems because a colleague sent a fax to
the underwriter containing an offer of terms to another client without her
knowledge.
She has said she was sacked because she rebuffed the advances of Mr
Wilkinson, who allegedly interrupted a business trip in 1992 to join her in
Denmark.
Mr Wilkinson denies harassing Miss Phillips and said he had 'categorically
not' planned to dismiss her because she had spurned his advances.
Miss Phillips earlier said Mr Flaxman had encouraged Mr Wilkinson to 'score'
with her. Mr Flaxman said: 'There are many occasions over the months when
she overreacted.' He said when Miss Phillips complained about Mr Wilkinson's
behaviour in Denmark she did not mention sexual harassment. 'If that
allegation had been made I would have gone straight to the director of
personnel,' he said.

victory

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US-Canadian appeals panel yesterday gave Canada an important victory,
upholding an earlier finding that Canada's timber pricing and log export
policies were not being subsidised, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Therefore, the US will have to return Dollars 800m in duties collected from
its lumber exporters to the US.
On Tuesday, the US and Canada had
The panel, convened under the US-Canada free trade agreement, should have
ended a battle over Canada's lumber pricing methods which dates back to
1986. Since then, the US commerce department has repeatedly found Canada's
methods constitute a subsidy.
Last December, a binational review panel reversed the department's findings.
The three Canadian panellists ruled in favour of Canada while the two US
members dissented. The US then appealed to an extraordinary challenge panel
of judges, claiming that two of the Canadian panellists had failed to
disclose conflicts of interest.
The ruling yesterday was issued by two Canadian members and one US member.
The dissenting American on the extraordinary challenge panel said that the
majority had violated 'more principles of appellate review of agency action
than any opinion by a reviewing body which I have ever read.'
Mr Tom Buell, chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council said: 'Our
governments and industries have expended enormous amounts of time, effort
and money on a case that should never have been brought.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / Two foundation blocks emerge from Congress: The Senate and
House versions of healthcare reform bills as deadline for vote approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that separate healthcare reform bills compiled by Senator George
Mitchell and Congressman Richard Gephardt are on the table as the basis for
debate in the Senate and the House of Representatives next week the outlines
of an eventual overhaul of the US health system are starting to emerge.
There are many differences between the two bills, and it is still far from
certain that any reform will pass Congress. Many Republicans are now arguing
that time has already run out for adequate debate this year on a measure of
such magnitude.
Yet the Mitchell and Gephardt plans have much in common, and if a healthcare
reform bill does pass - albeit by the slimmest of margins - these features
now appear likely to form its foundation.
At the heart of this common ground is a new set of rules for the insurance
market: insurers would be required to accept all eligible applicants, and
would not be allowed to drop or reduce anyone's coverage, nor increase their
premiums, because of their medical record. Community rating, in which
premiums can vary only by geographical area, age or family status, would
replace the now generally practised system of experience rating, in which
insurers set premiums on the basis of their claims experience with an
individual or a company.
This change would lower health insurance costs for many families and
businesses, and would put a stop to the heartbreak stories of people
stripped of their insurance just when they need it most, when they or their
child develops some crippling, long-term illness.
It would, however, probably raise costs for the younger and healthier people
who make fewer claims on their health insurance, and economists disagree on
whether it would on its own increase the percentage of the US population
covered by health insurance.
Both the Senate and House bills would also set a national standard benefits
package defining which types of care must be covered by any insurance
policy, and would increase the benefits the elderly now receive under the
government's Medicare programme by improving coverage for long-term care and
by reimbursing the cost of prescription drugs.
Both would raise the cigarette tax by 45 cents a pack and, in differing
ways, broaden access to the programme under which federal government
employees now obtain their health insurance.
The two bills offer very different approaches to the problem of how to
expand healthcare coverage to the estimated 35m to 40m people who have none.
The House bill simply requires employers to provide health insurance to
their workers and pay for at least 80 per cent of its cost.
Senator Mitchell concluded that this employer mandate would not pass the
Senate, and his bill holds it in reserve for the year 2002 if his own
voluntary system fails to bring 95 per cent of the population into the
health net. It would require companies to offer their workers a choice of at
least three insurance plans, but would not oblige the employee to accept
this offer or the employer to pay any share of its cost. It would, however,
offer subsidies to low income individuals to encourage them to buy
insurance, and to employers to encourage them to expand health coverage to
all their employees.
The two plans also offer different safety nets to the unemployed and the
poor, though both would abolish the current Medicaid programme.
While the House bill fulfils President Bill Clinton's requirement of
'guaranteed universal coverage', the Senate bill's would provide 95 per
cent. But Senator Mitchell has received Mr Clinton's general endorsement,
and argues that the most important thing is to reverse the trend of
coverage, which - excluding the elderly who are covered by Medicare - has
dropped from 88 per cent in 1980 to 83 per cent today.
One critical difference lies in the two bills approaches to containing
medical inflation, which was once the driving force behind efforts to reform
the health system. The House bill relies on increased competition between
insurers and medical providers to control costs, with, as a standby, a
national commission to impose fee schedules if healthcare inflation has not
abated.
Senator Mitchell, on the other hand, has introduced an already controversial
scheme to levy a 25 per cent assessment on expensive health plans whose
costs rise by more than a fixed percentage above the rate of general
inflation.
Because of the different rules of procedure in the two chambers, it is the
Senate bill that is likely to be most heavily amended when debate opens,
probably next week. It is also the Senate bill which appears to come closest
to a lowest common denominator which can pass in both chambers.
But with outright opposition from almost all Republicans and continuing
doubts from many right-wing Democrats, Senator Mitchell and Mr Gephardt have
few votes to play with in their search for a majority.

FT  04 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Fears of sanctions rebound - US telecoms
companies' view of Japan market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US telecommunications companies are jittery about the prospect of US
sanctions against Japan. Long-standing and vocal supporters of their
government's attempts to prise open lucrative Japanese markets, they are now
nervous that sanctions could rebound by undermining hard-won footholds in
Japan.
According to Mr Bruce Moats, spokesman on federal government affairs at
American Telephone and Telegraph, 'we don't want an environment of sanctions
 -it could upset our customers (in Japan)'.
The US, which has accused the Japanese government of discriminating against
foreign companies in its government procurement of telecommunications and
medical technology, will decide by the end of September whether to proceed
with sanctions against Japanese imports.
US companies said yesterday it was not yet clear whether the measures would
take the form of higher tariffs or a refusal by the US government to buy
Japanese products. They also did not know whether the equipment affected
would include electronics as well as mainstream telecommunications
technology.
However Washington has argued that some form of action was justified by the
failure of leading US telecoms companies such as AT&amp;T and Motorola to win
market share in Japan. According to AT&amp;T, which firmly backs the
government's attempts to open the markets, its Japanese sales of switching
and transmission equipment and fibre optics were 'very small' in relation to
its marketing efforts, when compared with results in other overseas markets.
It said that NTT, the part-privatised Japanese telecoms carrier, which is
AT&amp;T's main customer in Japan, gave it only a small slice of its annual
procurement budget of some Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn, although it had
managed to win additional orders from the new common carriers that compete
with NTT on domestic long distance traffic.
The possibility that this precarious business could be jeopardised by the US
government's actions is a growing concern for AT&amp;T. Despite US companies'
support for their government's strategy, they are aware that trade sanctions
have a poor record in bringing about the desired change.
Japanese companies themselves have been sanguine about the potential impact,
while pointing out that the US has often resorted to tough language but has
in practice been extremely cautious about deploying sanctions. Moreover,
Japan's response to the tussle of the past few months suggests that it is
becoming steadily less perturbed about the prospect of US retaliation than
it has appeared during the long history of trade tension between them.
Equivocal about whether such measures would succeed in opening up Japanese
markets, US companies are also sceptical that sanctions would hurt their
Japanese competitors in the US markets. Investment analysts say that price
competitiveness in the market is so great that they would expect Japanese
companies to absorb higher tariffs through their margins rather than attempt
to raise prices.
The most valuable part of the government procurement market, they argue, is
that for military equipment; while its size is hard to estimate, analysts
believe that foreign penetration is low.
Ms Debra Waggoner of the American Electronics Association said: 'Outside the
US, Japan is the world's single largest telecoms market. But our market
penetration is disastrously low - we probably have 3 to 4 percentage points
of the 5 per cent of sales which go to foreign companies.'
She said companies should not be deterred by fears that the US government's
actions would offend Japanese customers. Previous episodes when the US
government had threatened sanctions had shown that 'the pressure companies
can get from their suppliers is intense - the suppliers want them to tell
their government to back off'.
Meanwhile, analysts question whether the Japanese markets are really as
inaccessible as the US suggests - and whether the war is worth fighting.
Mr Richard Kramer, telecoms analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in
London, said technological specifications of equipment already installed,
rather than issues of price, customer loyalty or government preferences,
were among the most important market barriers.
For example, he said, 'it is difficult to mix and match large digital
switches. It is facile to say 'open up your markets and buy this switch'.
'Further penetration in either direction - of the Japanese market by the US
or of the US market by the Japanese - is hard,' he said.
If his arguments are right, and if the US goes ahead with sanctions, US
companies could become embroiled in a trade battle in which they have little
to win and much to lose.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Whitewater inquisitors find no 'smoking gun'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was nearly two in the morning. For the umpteenth time a Republican
senator - on this occasion Mr Phil Gramm of Texas - was berating Mr Roger
Altman for being economical with the truth to Congress.
For the first time in 10 hours of testimony which ended early yesterday, the
deputy secretary of the Treasury allowed his anger to flare. But then he
checked himself and, yet again, repeated that he had not dissembled to
Congress and that he had not engaged in 'substantive' meetings related to
Whitewater other than the one, on February 2, at the White House, that he
had always mentioned.
Later, Mr Altman was back on the stand again, in front of the more friendly
House banking committee, along with Ms Jean Hanson, the Treasury lawyer,
whose recollections of who said what, when and to whom had differed in parts
from his own. Their boss, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, was
practising his courtly wiles on former colleagues on the Senate panel. He
portrayed himself as above the fray while it was unfolding, but in no way
did he disown Mr Altman nor depart from the administration's basic defence
that it broke no laws, criminal or ethical.
Barring the unexpected, the congressional hearings seem to have reached an
impasse. Without doubt, Republicans have succeeded in identifying
inconsistencies in testimonies, but a big breach in the wall has not been
effected and no 'smoking gun' has been found.
This is partly because the hearings have featured much minutiae and been
replete with bureaucratic legalisms - 'pre-briefs,' 'recusals', 'tasked',
'redactions' and 'referrals'.
A week's hearings have embraced only a sliver of the Whitewater affair -
specifically the conduct of investigations into the Madison Guaranty savings
and loan company formerly owned by the partner of the Clinton family in the
Whitewater land development scheme in Arkansas.
There may be fireworks to come. Followers of political streetfighting relish
the upcoming confrontation between Senator Al D'Amato, the rough and tough
New York Republican, and Mr Harold Ickes, the rough and tough New York
Democrat who is now deputy White House chief of staff.
But no heads have rolled, though lesser fry, like Ms Hanson, must be rubbing
their necks. Mr Altman went into his testimony with universal predictions
that he would be the 'fall guy' for the administration's failings to come
clean. But his proud demeanour made it clear that he was not going to walk
the plank on the evidence presented.
Mostly partisanship has ruled, especially in the House. Senate Democrats
seemed to waver when first Ms Hanson and then Mr Altman were under the gun.
But, spurred on by Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, they began to
rally round the deputy secretary, though without assistance from the
committee chairman, Senator Don Riegle. He is retiring anyway.

The French construction group Bouygues is to partner Australia's Transfield

(USDollars 445m) underground rail link between Sydney's centre and its
international airport, to the south on Botany Bay.
The go-ahead for the project was announced yesterday after all-night
negotiations between the New South Wales state government and the private
sector interests. The state will contribute more than ADollars 470m for the
construction of the 10km line, while Bouygues and Transfield, the joint
venture partners, will shoulder about ADollars 125m of construction and
operating expenses for the four stations on the line.
Bouygues/Transfield/CRI will be responsible for the tunnelling, line and
station construction work, and for running the stations at first: the
time-frame for that contract has not been decided but is likely to be
anything from 15 to 30 years. The Bouygues involvement was not mentioned in
the formal announcement but Transfield - a prominent but privately owned
Australian group - confirmed it had signed a separate 50:50 joint venture
agreement with the French group.
There is no rail connection at present between Sydney's airport, the largest
in Australia, and the city centre. The state denies that the choice of
Sydney to host the Olympic Games in 2000 was the catalyst for the project,
but acknowledges that this makes the need for efficient transport more
urgent. Work is due to start next February and the line is to open by
September 1999.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US index of leading indicators rose by a modest 0.2 per cent in June,
this being the latest sign that economic growth is slowing, the government
said yesterday, agencies report from Washington.
Analysts, who had anticipated the rise in the the government's chief
forecasting gauge of future US economic activity, said that a small increase
was consistent with evidence that the economy is expanding at a moderate
pace.
This was reinforced by the Federal Reserve in its latest Beige Book survey
of economic activity, which said scattered signs of economic slowing were
emerging, with rising wage and commodity costs.
Presenting revised figures, the Commerce Department said the index rose 0.1
per cent in May, after remaining unchanged in April. The department
previously reported that the barometer was unchanged in May.
It also said yesterday that orders to US factories rose in June for the
fourth consecutive month, climbing 0.8 per cent and matching the previous
month's increase.
The rise was practically across-the-board, excluding construction-related
material and home furnishings. The rise was led by a 12.8 per cent surge in
orders for medical instruments and navigation equipment.
The Fed said yesterday: 'Business activity in most areas is continuing to
expand at a solid pace, although a number of districts report scattered
indications of some slowing or slight declines.'
The Beige Book, produced about every six weeks, said several districts had
reported labour markets tightening and said that was pushing wages up.
'However, labour shortages appear to be concentrated only in a few skilled
occupations,' the Fed added.
But price rises were reported for a broader range of commodities used for
manufacturing, including finished steel and steel scrap, copper, wood and
building materials.
Retail sales that had moderated in the spring have picked up but competitive
pressures were holding prices down and squeezing profit margins, the Fed
said.

Critics in the US who cite Japan's closed market and Tokyo's refusal to
accept numerical indicators in the framework trade negotiations could find
it difficult to support their arguments with statistics.
Obtaining accurate import and export figures can be almost as difficult as
attempting to interpret them.
The US commerce department, which tabulates data collected by the US census
bureau from shipping statements, is only able to provide figures for a broad
product grouping which includes not only cellular telephone handsets, but
cellular base units and certain other devices, including citizen band (CB)
radios.
These are the only readily available figures. The leading industry trade
association in the US, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,
does not record or file statistics on exports to Japan, and spokesmen at
half a dozen other cellular industry organisations said that they could not
easily arrive at a figure.
Motorola, which is the largest US seller of cellular equipment in Japan,
declined to release any sales figures.
The commerce department statistics demonstrate a progressive increase in the
dollar amount of US cellular equipment being exported to Japan from 1984 to
1991, when the exports totalled more than Dollars 50m. Sales dropped sharply
to Dollars 14.8m in 1992, before climbing back to nearly Dollars 49.5m last
year.

FT  04 AUG 94 / US firms protect partners: Accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the six largest US accountancy firms have changed their legal
structure in an effort to provide protection of their partners' assets from
litigation.
The remaining three large firms confirmed that they were also at an advanced
stage of taking the same route over the next two months.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse changed their legal
status to become Delaware limited liability partnerships on Monday.
KPMG Peat Marwick and Deloitte &amp; Touche are also likely to become registered
in Delaware over the next few weeks, taking advantage of accomodating
corporate regulations. Arthur Andersen, the world's largest firm, is
believed to be considering registering as a limited liability partnership in
Illinois, the state in which its principal US activities are based.
Otherwise it too will register in Delaware.
The change has come as part of efforts by the firms to mitigate the effects
of large lawsuits from aggrieved investors and others who claim to have
relied on their audit opinions.
The firms argue that many of the claims against them are unjust and are
fighting for reform of the US legal system to introduce 'proportionate
liability' rather than the current position in which they can be required to
pay all damages even if only found partly to blame.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Nicotine in cigarettes declared addictive by FDA advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US Food and Drug administration advisory panel has concluded that nicotine
in cigarettes is addictive, this being the first formal step toward US
federal regulation of nicotine as a drug.
The eight-member scientific panel, made up of academics from various parts
of the country, concluded after a nine-hour debate on Tuesday that all
cigarettes on the market are addictive. This was the first official
statement by the FDA that nicotine meets its definition of a drug - a
substance which affects 'the structure and function of the body.'
However, the committee failed to reach a consensus on how much nicotine it
takes to make a smoker addicted.
Dr David Kessler, the FDA commissioner, called the findings 'enormously
important' because they contradict tobacco industry claims that cigarette
smoking is 'a free-choice issue.'
Dr Kessler has been considering tighter federal regulation of the tobacco
industry since February, amid protests from cigarette manufacturers who
claim he is waging 'a dangerous crusade' to ban cigarettes and destroy their
companies.
The commissioner said he does not want prohibition but is increasingly
convinced the government must try to stop more teenagers and children from
becoming addicted.
To regulate cigarettes, the FDA must prove not only that nicotine is
addictive but also that companies purposely manipulate chemical levels to
make more customers addicted.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Three die as strike shuts down Lagos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government offices, banks and factories in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos,
were deserted yesterday, the first day of an indefinite general strike which
has been called to force the military government to release the detained
opposition leader, Mr Moshood Abiola.
There were outbreaks of violence in the city, as police attempted to
dismantle barricades and diperse protesters, leaving three people killed in
clashes.
In Abuja, the capital, the trial of Mr Abiola, the unofficial winner of last
year's presidential election, was adjourned again, this time until August
16. He is being tried for treason after he declared himself president on
June 12, the anniversary of last year's vote.
The judge said he needed time to decide whether the court has jurisdiction
to try an offence allegedly committed in Lagos. At last week's hearing, the
prosecution was forced to admit that it lied to the court when denying that
it had received the defence's petition.
As the prosecution case falters, Gen Sani Abacha's government seems unsure
how to end the deadlock. It appears to have rejected a strategy whereby Mr
Abiola could be released and installed as head of a government of national
unity.
Mr Abiola's family, who are allowed access to him in detention in Abuja, say
that he has twice refused release on condition that he keep silent about
claims to the presidency.
Support for the strike is strongest in the south-west, where members of Mr
Abiola's Yoruba tribe see a chance to wrest political power from the north
Hausas and Fulanis who have dominated government. Northern branches of the
National Labour Congress are disregarding the strike which they say is not
in the national interest.
The shutdown has completed a process begun over a month ago as a combination
of fuel shortages, lack of transport, and earlier political strikes have
been gradually bringing the commercial capital of Lagos to a halt.
People going to work risk intimidation or reprisals from gangs roaming the
streets or being caught in sporadic violence, as anti-government protesters
are becoming more mobile to elude armed police.
A strike by air traffic controllers and lack of aviation fuel in the south
grounded domestic flights but military air traffic controllers have kept the
international airport open.
Labour union representatives are due to hold talks with the military
government today, and central to the discussions will be the disruption to
oil production, which is down by at least 20 per cent.
The oil workers' unions, who went on strike a month ago, have made it clear
that the release of Mr Abiola will not get them back to work. They are
pressing for the regime to make way for elected civilian rule and for the
government to pay arrears to the oil companies estimated at Dollars 800m
which have led to job losses and recession in the industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's chief Taiwan negotiator narrowly escaped being pelted with eggs by
independence activists chanting 'Chinese bandits go home' and burning
People's Republic of China flags on his arrival at Taipei's international
airport yesterday.
But Mr Tang Shubei, the most senior Chinese official to set foot on the
island which Beijing has regarded as a renegade province since 1949, also
missed a crowd of supporters who had come to welcome him when he was whisked
out of the airport through a secret exit.
As four days of talks begin today between Mr Tang and his Taiwanese
counterpart, Mr Chiao Jen-ho, Taiwanese remain divided and uncertain over
the pace and direction of the island's uneasy relations with its giant
neighbour.
Many people in Taiwan are suspicious of the motives of both governments in
the talks, designed to resolve issues such as maritime rights and the
repatriation of hijackers, of which there have been many from the mainland
in the past year.
A government-commissioned poll, the results of which were released
yesterday, found 42.2 per cent of those surveyed supported neither
reunification with China nor Taiwanese independence.
Nearly 21 per cent of respondents backed reunification, while 11.6 per cent
advocated independence.
The passion of the protests against Mr Tang's arrival yesterday highlighted
the sensitivity of China policy for the Taiwanese, who have been taught to
regard the mainland as territory occupied temporarily by the Communist
government and to be retaken eventually by the Taiwanese nationalists.
Pro-independence protesters burnt the Chinese flag and urged Mr Tang to
return to the mainland. He suggested that 'talks are talks' and conceded
that 'we have to raise differing opinions', though Beijing has not ruled out
the possibility of using force to retake the island if it drifts too close
to independence.
Mr Tang said: 'This is not the way Chinese people should treat their guests.
I hope to see some improvement in this.'
Mr Eric Ni, a stockbroker at a Taiwanese securities firm, said he hoped that
Beijing and Taipei could adopt a more pragmatic approach in the cross-strait
talks, which began in April 1993. The previous five rounds have been mired
in legalistic issues.
'Both sides are basically just playing games,' Mr Ni said. 'But it's better
than not talking at all; otherwise there would be more tension.' He
supported resumption of direct shipping and air links as mutually
beneficial.
While in favour of improved relations, Mr Ni, a native Taiwanese in his late
20s, firmly rejects reunification.
'It is good to maintain an older brother-younger brother relationship with
China, but Taiwan should be independent,' he argues.
Building manager Mr Wang, who came to Taiwan from China's Shandong Province
in 1949 fears closer ties with the mainland. 'Direct links are no good; it's
too dangerous for Taiwan. You can't trust the Communists.
'There's no way these talks can come to anything,' Mr Wang said 'Nobody
wants to see any progress. Reunification is not possible. Independence is
not possible either.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France reacted to the killing of five French gendarmes and consular
officials in Algiers yesterday by promising fresh protection for its embassy
staff and by sending its foreign and defence ministers to the Algerian
capital.
Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, and Mr Francois Leotard, the defence
minister, flew to Algiers to pay homage to the victims, shot early yesterday
by terrorists who were trying to drive a car bomb past a French school and
into a housing complex where many French official personnel live. The car
bomb was later defused.
The incident brings to 15 the number of French, and to more than 50 the
number of foreigners, killed by Islamic fundamentalists contesting the
Algerian government's suspension of elections two years ago which the now
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. Since last autumn,
the fundamentalists' hardline factions have targeted foreigners as a means
of bringing international pressure to bear on the authorities.
Before leaving for Algiers, Mr Leotard said he would see what could be done
to 'imp-rove protection', explaining that yesterday's attack had taken place
during the changing of the gendarmes' guard at the school and that three
gendarmes had been killed and a fourth wounded, in addition to two consular
officials killed.
The French foreign ministry issued a statement calling on the Algerian
authorities to guard the French community better and to hunt down
yesterday's killers as well as reiterating Paris' warning for all French to
stay away from Algeria. There are believed to be some 2,000 French nationals
as well as a much larger number of dual passport holders in the former
French colony.
Fearing a worse alternative in the creation of an Islamic theocracy, France
has so far given reluctant and partial backing to the current Algerian
regime. Paris has called for the government to open a dialogue with moderate
Islamic groups.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Cause for concern behind the South Pacific smiles: World
Bank estimates the islands' real GDP has grown 0.1% a year in the past 10
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was little disguising Mr Paul Keating's satisfaction as the Australian
prime minister presided over the closing formalities at the annual meeting
of South Pacific leaders in Brisbane this week.
Australia, as host nation to the South Pacific Forum, attended by 14 other
countries ranging from Nuie (pop: 2,500) to Papua New Guinea, had suggested
'managing resources' as a theme for the conference.
Items agreed included a pledge from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New
Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomons Islands, that they would 'work towards a
common code of conduct governing logging of indigenous forests, to which
companies operating in their countries will have to adhere'.
Monitoring of logging activities would be stepped up, and senior offficials
would meet within two months to begin implementing these agreements.
On the fraught question of overfishing in South Pacific waters, countries
would make an effort to define sustainable catch levels, and take a
multilateral approach to monitoring how, and at what prices, resources
should be exploited.
They would also look at ways of rationalising air services in the region to
try to curtail losses suffered by national carriers.
A meeting of finance ministers from the island states was proposed for 'the
near future', with participation from representatives of international
financial institutions encouraged.
Last year, the World Bank estimated that the Pacific island nations' real
gross domestic product had grown by just 0.1 per cent a year over the past
10 years.
This looks all the more lamentable alongside the double-digit growth rates
in the Asean countries nearby. Reasons sometimes put forward for the
disparity in performance include the smaller size of Pacific island nations
and their geographical isolation.
But Australia, for one, feels the explanations are to be found elsewhere.
'Asian governments have taken deliberate steps to adopt and pursue economic
policies which have had the effect of mobilising domestic savings and
opening their economies to quality foreign investment,' Mr Gordon Bilney,
Australian minister for Pacific Island Affairs, said recently.
'It is perhaps not too harsh a judgment to say that a number of South
Pacific countries are. . . yet to take up this example.'
Moreover, there are fears that, unless immediate action is taken, big
problems are being stored up for the future. The conclusion of the Uruguay
Round of trade negotiations last year, with its promise of a more
competitive world trade environment, could pose trouble for key sectors in
some of the island states' economies. The Fijian sugar industry, which
enjoys preferential treatment in Europe, is one example.
There also is concern that the region will deplete - or allow foreign
interests to deplete - its rich natural resources, in a short-term chase of
profits. Severe environmental damage, from deforestation to coastal
degradation, would be the result. Heavy logging of tropical rainforests in
countries such as PNG and the Solomons, largely by Malaysian interests, is
seen by many as the main worry.
Australia as a leading trading partner and aid donor has a particular vested
interest in the region. Its exports to Forum island countries (excluding New
Zealand) topped ADollars 560m (Pounds 267m) last year, and Australian mining
companies have some large holdings in the region, especially in PNG.
Australia's aid budget to the region is almost ADollars 500m a year,
two-thirds of which goes to PNG. The point has been made that aid to the
rest is about equal to the losses suffered by their national airlines.
Recent problems at the debt-laden Polynesian Airlines - where allegations of
corruption and unsound business judgment within the Western Samoan cabinet
have led to the appointment of a commission of inquiry - has bolstered the
views of those who would like to see more financial discipline associated
with such aid.
Encouraging change without offending sensibilities is a delicate matter.
Australia's approach is to suggest that it is merely passing on lessons
which it, all too recently, learned the hard way itself.
Even so, while smiles were plentiful in Queensland this week, Pacific island
leaders plainly have a different perspective on some of these issues. For
example, Mr Francis Billy Hilly, prime minister of the Solomon Islands,
conceded that his government was concerned about the rate of logging.
But, he noted, 'if we do stop our export of round logs today, which counts
for more than 50 per cent of government revenue, we'll have a big hole in
our budget'. In the absence of assistance, 'our reform policies will be
slower than what we would much like,' he said.
Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said that developed countries 'had to
appreciate the difficulties small island countries faced in controlling
resource development'.
'It is more than just a matter of money. We must take into account the
traditional rights of our people to fish and to harvest their forests,' he
declared.

China's revenues are likely to fall short of budget forecasts this year,
suggesting a larger than expected deficit and making it harder for the
government to ease tight credit restrictions.
Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, said that while a new tax regime
was functioning well, tax revenues had not met expectations. 'Despite the
high revenue growth, the income collected during the first six months of the
year was less than the projected amount,' he told a meeting in Beijing on
finance and taxation.
China's new tax regime, which came into effect at the start of the year,
provides for fresh sharing arrangements between the centre and the
provinces. It included a new value added tax. Western economists in Beijing
said the complex tax reforms were highly ambitious and it seemed the
authorities were encountering difficulties in implementing them.
One official noted government revenues, which grew by 22.6 per cent in the
first six months, were barely keeping up with inflation. China reported that
cost of living increases in 35 main cities were up by 22.7 per cent in June
compared with the same month last year. Retail inflation was about 20 per
cent.
Mr Liu told China's parliament, the National People's Congress, in March
that China's budget deficit this year would reach Yn66.9bn (Pounds 5bn) but
total obligations, including debt service, would exceed Yn100bn.
Mr Liu disclosed that national monthly revenue averaged Yn33bn in the six
months to June, well below budget forecasts. An average of Yn46.4bn would be
required for the rest of the year to enable the government to meet its
revenue targets. 'This would be very difficult to achieve since the highest
monthly average had been Yn39.1bn in June,' Mr Liu said.
He blamed 'tax evasion' and 'delayed tax payment' for some of the
government's budgetary difficulties.

The Japanese subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish company, has
been billed for additional taxes of Y1.1bn (Pounds 7.1m) by the Japanese tax
authorities.
ABB Gadelius, the Japanese unit of ABB, is accused by the National Tax
Agency of failing to report Y2.5bn it forwarded to related companies as a
donation, which is taxable under Japanese law.
According to ABB Gadelius, in 1991 the company invested Y2.5bn in a holding
company acquired to oversee car telephone marketing operations in northern
Europe.
But the market environment for car phones became difficult and ABB Gadelius
handed over the company to its executives for an insignificant sum the
following year.
The Y2.5bn it forwarded to the company was reported to Japanese tax
authorities as an extraordinary loss on an overseas investment.
The Japanese tax agency, however, determined the loss was in fact a donation
aimed at supporting a related company and that therefore ABB Gadelius, which
reported a loss in the year to December 1992, had in fact made a profit of
Y2.1bn.
The move highlights the growing inclination of the Japanese tax authorities
to take a hard line against foreign companies operating in Japan.
The national tax agency in Japan has alleged that many foreign companies
under-report earnings to minimise their tax bills.
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, has also been told it would
have to pay an extra Y5.7bn in taxes for 1990 to 1993, while Coca-Cola is
having a penalty of Y15bn imposed. Other large companies facing additional
tax payments include Roche, Hoechst and Du Pont.
ABB Gadelius said yesterday it was appealing the ruling.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Japan minister gives assurance on N-arms: Document revealed
nuclear option was studied

<TEXT>
Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, was yesterday forced to confirm
that the country had not pursued a nuclear weapons development policy, after
the leaking of a 25-year-old ministry document that argued the case for a
potential atomic capability.
He acknowledged that in the late 1960s the ministry had not allowed Japan's
pacifist post-war constitution to inhibit an examination of all options for
future national defence policy.
The Mainichi Shimbun, a mass-circulation daily, this week revealed the
existence of a 100-page classified document drawn up by foreign ministry
officials in 1969. The newspaper quotes the report as saying: 'Japan will
assume a policy of not having nuclear weapons for the time being. But it
should always maintain the economic and technical potential to produce
them.'
Mr Kono refused to discuss what he described as an internal working paper,
but said: 'It is a fact that before the signing of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) consideration was given at internal meetings
on all policy possibilities and to their advantages and disadvantages.'
Japan acceded to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state after adopting the
treaty the following year, and has maintained a policy of not possessing
such weapons, not producing them, and not permitting them to be brought into
Japan.
The affair will add another layer to the myriad sensitivities within the
country and the rest of Asia which surround Japan's militaristic past, a
wider world role for its post-war self-defence forces, and its nuclear power
programme.
Mainichi's disclosures included an interview with a former head of the
Maritime SDF, Japan's navy, who admitted that in the cold war era of the
late 1960s he conducted two years' research into battle scenarios involving
a nuclear-armed Japan. Mr Kazuomi Uchida said neither the government nor the
military acted on his findings.
Mr Kono said yesterday the nuclear option 'would only go against the
national interests of Japan' and was 'totally unrealistic also from our
special national sentiment as the only country which has suffered from such
devastation.'
Hiroshima on Saturday and Nagasaki next Tuesday commemorate the
anniversaries of their virtual annihilation by US atomic bombs. Anti-nuclear
activists at a conference in Hiroshima yesterday attacked Japanese plans to
employ potentially dual-use plutonium in future nuclear power reactors and
said a government which disavows nuclear weapons should make public all
relevant records.
The August anniversaries annually generate a spate of media disclosures on
nuclear-related issues, but controversy is seldom absent. In May, two
cabinet ministers had to deny a claim by a former Japanese envoy that
Washington had, in agreeing reversion of the US-occupied southern islands of
Okinawa to Japan in 1972, struck a secret deal which would allow the US to
station nuclear weapons on Japanese territory.

China's revenues are likely to fall short of budget forecasts this year,

was functioning well, tax revenues had not met expectations.
'Despite the high revenue growth, the income collected during the first six

Beijing on finance and taxation.
China's new tax regime, which came into effect at the beginning of the year,
provides for fresh sharing arrangements between the centre and the

Western economists in Beijing said the complex tax reforms were highly

first six months, were barely keeping up with inflation.
China reported that cost of living increases in 35 main cities were up by

be required for the rest of the year to enable the government to meet its

'This would be very difficult to achieve since the highest monthly average
had been Yuan39.1bn in June,' Mr Liu said. He also noted that pressure on
expenditures was 'building', with salary increases for government employees
coming into effect in the second half of the year.
He blamed 'tax evasion' and 'delayed tax payment' for some of the
government's budgetary difficulties. By the end of June unpaid taxes
amounted to Yuan16.3bn, 71.5 per cent more than the same period last year.
This indicates that state enterprises, the main source of government
revenues, are facing difficulties meeting their tax obligations.
Many of these enterprises are struggling to keep afloat and have been hard
hit by the government credit squeeze aimed at calming an overheating
economy.
Total national revenues in the six months to June reached Yuan197.9bn,
against expenditures of Yuan197.3bn. Expenditures grew faster than revenues.
Mr Liu vowed the authorities would crack down harder on tax avoiders.
The State Administration of Taxation would give priority to retrieving
overdue tax payments during the second half of the year.
'Public spending must be curbed,' he said 'and expenditure breaches not
allowed whenever possible during the remaining months of the year.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / India's opposition takes 'to the streets' over stock market
row: Investor fears grow after reports that finance minister Singh is
willing to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opposition benches in both houses of India's parliament were empty
yesterday after party leaders carried out a decision to take politics 'to
the streets'. Outside parliament, negotiations went on late into the night,
adding to uncertainty about the future of Mr PV Narasimha Rao's government.
Investors around the world phoned newspapers in the capital to ask whether
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, was likely to resign to take
responsibility for the government's handling of the 1992 stock exchange
scandal in which money was illegally siphoned out of banks into the stock
market.
Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) party and the opposition are in dispute over
the government's 'Action Taken Report' on the scandal inquiry. The
opposition say Mr Narasimha Rao used the report to shield senior ministers
from criticism by a joint parliamentary committee.
Concern about Mr Singh's future arose after the minister, regarded as the
architect of India's economic reform programme, was reported in the
newspapers to have replied in a meeting to the accusation by a party
colleague that he was responsible for the trouble the party and government
was in.
'I had offered to resign earlier,' Mr Singh was reported to have said. 'If
anybody thinks I am blocking the investigations, I am prepared to quit
again.'
Mr Singh resigned last December after which he defended himself and his
ministry in a two-day parliamentary debate. 'Mr Rao did not accept his
resignation then. He is unlikely to do it now,' said a Congress(I) MP.
Yesterday members of the opposition National Front-Left Front alliance
demonstrated outside parliament, telling people who had gathered why they
were boycotting the rest of the monsoon session and had resigned from
parliament's 45 committees.
Members of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, India's largest
opposition party, did not join the demonstration, though they have boycotted
parliament.
Sworn enemies in the opposition have united against the Congress(I) party.
They feel the government has deliberately ignored the recommendations of the
parliamentary committee's report into the scandal, despite the fact that
Congress(I) MPs, who were a majority on the committee, had unanimously
accepted the findings after 18 months of deliberation.
'The government has made a mockery of our findings,' said a senior MP of the
Congress(I) party and a member of the committee. 'Though we cannot openly
join cause with the opposition, the government's 'Action Taken' report
denotes that the executive - never mind that it is my own party - has
decided that there is no need to taken any action at all.'
In addition to insisting on the withdrawal of the 'Action Taken' report, the
opposition has demanded that the government accept the recommendations of
the committee and take action against the ministers criticised in the
report. These include Mr Singh, Mr B Shankaranand, health minister, and Mr
Rameshwar Thakur, formerly minister of state for finance, who was moved to
the rural development ministry after the scandal erupted.
Other committee recommendations the opposition demands should be accepted
include action against the foreign banks implicated in the scandal -
Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlays, Bank of America, and Citibank.
The opposition has also demanded action against the Reserve Bank, India's
central bank, and against its former governor, Mr R Venkitaramanan, and
other bureaucrats, bank officials, and brokers involved in the scandal.
Parliament will still be able to transact business in spite of the
opposition boycott. The only likely constitutional hitch will arise when
President's (direct) Rule is due to be extended in the troubled state of
Jammu and Kashmir before September 3 when a two-thirds majority in the lower
house will be required.
Ten Indian states go to the polls in November and the opposition parties,
hard-pressed to find issues on which to attack the relatively stable
government of Mr Narasimha Rao, are planning to make official corruption an
issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's parliament overwhelmingly endorsed last week's peace accord with
Jordan in a rare display of political consensus between left and right on
the Middle East peace process.
Hours after parliament voted 91-3 in favour of the Israeli-Jordanian
declaration three Israeli fighter jets escorted King Hussein's low-flying
aircraft on an unprecedented flight through the Jewish state's airspace.
In an effort to gain maximum support for the declaration Mr Rabin assured
parliament Israel would maintain its sovereignty over Jerusalem, despite
recognising King Hussein special role over the holy city's Islamic sites.
Opposition right-wing parties, which fiercely oppose the peace accord with
Palestinians and any withdrawal from the Golan Heights in peace talks with
Syria, supported the Jordanian agreement.
'We are in a rare moment in the people's unity in which the opposition is
also in support of the government's political moves,' Mr Benjamin Netanyahu,
leader of the right-wing Likud party said.
King Hussein's flight yesterday was the first official passage of a
Jordanian aircraft through Israeli airspace since the creation of the Jewish
state in 1948. It was timed to mark parliament's endorsement of the accord
and to symbolise the new era of normal relations developing rapidly between
the two countries.
Next Monday King Hussein and Mr Rabin will meet on their Red Sea border to
open a new crossing. Throughout yesterday's parliamentary debate Israeli and
Jordanian tractor crews tore down razor wire fences to build the new border
post 3.5km north of Eilat.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state who is visiting the region,
will attend the border dedication ceremony and make the first telephone call
between the two states. Israel's communications ministry also said yesterday
a fibre optic cable will be eventually laid from Amman across the Jordan
river into Israel.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Bank airs its doubts on the budget: Governor Fazio has no
quarrel with spending cuts, but wonders if they will bring the expected
savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second year in a row the Bank of Italy finds itself in the
uncomfortable position of casting judgment on economic policies formulated
by one of its own who has passed over to the government.
First, it was the policies of a former governor, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
who became prime minister. Now, it is Mr Lamberto Dini, the bank's former
director-general, who has been Treasury minister since May, and is the key
figure in the Berlusconi government's economic team.
In neither case can the bank be accused of being too soft. The underlying
theme has been to hammer home the dangers of failing to tackle with
sufficient energy the problem of Italy's public finances. This was evident
this week when Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank's governor, appeared before
parliament to comment on the outlines of the 1995 budget and the
macroeconomic framework for 1995-1997.
The government, he said, had inherited a budget deficit far greater than
originally projected despite interest rates falling more than expected. But,
having got in this little dig at Mr Ciampi, he then made several telling
observations, which, despite the measured language, could be interpreted as
friendly warnings.
The first related specifically to the 1995 budget which seeks to hold the
deficit down to 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product, relying on a mix of
spending cuts and revenue raising measures. Mr Fazio did not quarrel with Mr
Dini's aim to find L45,000bn (Pounds 18.5bn) in extra funds next year - an
ambitious target for any Italian government. However, he voiced concern that
the spending cuts would not produce the required sums and that too much of
the new revenue was coming from one-off measures.
This was not just a reference to the unresolved dispute between the
government and the unions over the extent of cuts in Italy's generous
state-run pensions scheme. It also raised a question mark over cuts proposed
in health care and hospital management. At the same time he noted that the
government had yet to make any provision for the recent constitutional court
decision ordering back-payments on pensions totalling more than L30,000bn.
On the revenue side, Mr Fazio appeared anxious about the way the government
was planning to raise money through temporary measures rather than create
sustained sources of funding. The main source of L18,000bn in new revenue
will be a tax amnesty and a pardon on illegal buildings. Similar measures in
the past have tended to yield less than expected.
He also implicitly questioned whether the government was right in its
determination to avoid increasing the fiscal pressure. He pointed out that
it remained below that of France and Germany 'and other countries which have
the same pattern of public sector expenditure as Italy'.
More generally, he observed: 'The experience of the past five years shows
just how costly it has been continuously missing the targets; likewise, it
has shown that adopting one-off measures has been counter-productive since
both spending and the deficit have systematically increased.'
Mr Fazio's second friendly warning concerned employment, and was aimed
specifically at Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, who promised to
create a million jobs during his election campaign. The governor doubted
whether the private sector could create more than 350,000 jobs over the next
three years - even with the positive effect of easing hire and fire laws
plus giving tax incentives for job creation. Public sector employment would
decline, he said.
But perhaps his real warning was on the effect of political uncertainties on
the lira. In the second quarter of the year, he said, there had been a net
outflow of portfolio investments to the tune of L20,600bn. Of this,
L11,700bn had taken place in June. These capital outflows had weakened the
currency, especially against the D-Mark.
The lira, he insisted, was as much as 10 per cent undervalued against the
D-Mark, especially with exports still booming and a domestic recovery
beginning against low inflation. If the lira remained weak, there was a risk
of renewed inflation. Italy then could move into a vicious cycle, with
interest rates being pushed up once again. As it is, interest rates in Italy
are now more than 3 percentage points higher than in Germany.
A rise in interest rates affects Italy in particular, with its huge stock of
debt, now equivalent to 123 per cent of GDP. A 1 percentage point rise
increases the annual borrowing requirement by some L15,000bn. In other
words, it could wipe out the equivalent of a third of all the new revenues
the government is pledged to find next year.
The government fully recognises the problem of the debt stock in its
economic planning document and projects that it will peak at 124 per cent of
GDP next year before falling back. But its sheer size and the continuous
need to fund it makes Italy so vulnerable to a crisis of confidence.
In parliament yesterday, Mr Dini appeared to take on board the governor's
comments in the spirit they were offered, well aware of the difficulties
ahead in fleshing out the details of the budget in the autumn. But he was
also bullish on the economy. The strong recovery in progress could see next
year's growth exceed 2.7 per cent, he said.
The government's economic team will be given only a small breathing space by
the summer break since concrete proposals for spending cuts will have to be
finalised by mid-September. In the meantime, a hint of the problems ahead
came this week from the senate where the government lacks a clear majority
and where the health, labour and industry commissions rejected various
budget proposals.
These could pass in a full house; but the government cannot take for granted
a safe passage for the most controversial of its proposals - the pardon on
buildings constructed illegally. This proposal has been criticised by the
mayors of most large cities and attacked by the environmentalists as
condoning the large scale speculative development that has blighted many
municipal suburbs. If the scope of the pardon is reduced as result of these
protests, the government faces the difficult task of finding replacement
revenue.

<TEXT>
Russia yesterday signed a treaty 'defining the areas of competence' between
Moscow and the south Urals autonomous republic of Bashkortostan  - the
second treaty of its kind and one which President Boris Yeltsin said
represented 'genuine federalism'.
The treaty was signed as Russia continues to trade threatening rhetoric with
its most unruly federal subject, the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya.
Russian officials have supported the claims of the rebel Chechen interim
council to oust General Dzhokar Dudayev, the republic's president. However,
yesterday Mr Yusup Soslambekov, the former speaker of the Chechen
parliament, said 'only a war' would oust the general.
The Russian president also held talks yesterday with President Alexander
Lukashenko of Belarus aimed at concluding a political treaty between the two
former Soviet states. Both men were vague on the all-important issue of
monetary union and said they would 'honour previous agreements' in
establishing a monetary system.
Mr Vyacheslav Solovov, a deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank, told
the Financial News Agency that 'some points were corrected' in a draft
treaty unifying the two currencies, and that the Belarus National Bank would
play a role in money supply and the issuing of credits.
Commenting on Russia's negotiations both with former Soviet republics and
its own internal regions, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko
political party and a proponent of closer economic union between the former
Soviet states, said that 'economic union is inevitable, both for the Russian
economy and for their economies. Political union, military union, are quite
different things and we should not seek them now'.
The treaty with Bashkortostan, an oil-producing republic which has already
adopted its own constitution, is in line with Moscow's attempt to hold
together the sprawling Russian Federation by bilateral treaties which
concede large areas of economic and legislative autonomy - including
independent tax-raising powers - within a common constitutional and
macro-economic framework in which defence and foreign affairs are handled
largely by Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin told the official news agency Itar Tass after the signing
ceremony that 'we are now moving towards the fine-tuning stage in federal
relations. We are agreeing who answers exactly for what'.
Mr Murtaza Rakhimov, the Bashkortostan president, said 'the process of
creating independent legislative bodies will continue. The only demand (of
the treaty) is that the common legislative framework of the Russian
Federation be preserved.'
Tatarstan, an oil-producing republic which neighbours Bashkortostan, was the
first to sign such a treaty - after claiming virtual independence from
Russia two years ago. Ukraine and Russia signed an agreement yesterday to
create a single border guarded by a joint command, Reuter reports from Kiev.
Since Ukrainian independence in 1991 the 1,500 mile border has been guarded
by separate sets of Ukrainian and Russian posts.

The Bank of Spain yesterday trimmed its benchmark intervention rate to 7.35
per cent from 7.50 per cent, its first cut since May 13. The markets expect
a further cut in September if the July CPI figures, due in the middle of
this month, show that inflation is continuing its downward trend. The Bank
has room to manoeuvre because the peseta remains stable, underlying
inflation is at an historic low of 4.4 per cent year-on-year, domestic
demand remains flat and most wage increases have kept to around 3 per cent.
The research department of Banco Central Hispano (BCH) estimates that GDP
has grown by 2.5 per cent in the first five months of this year and that it
will show 2 per cent growth overall in 1994. The forecast compares with the
government's estimate of 1.3 per cent. BCH expects year-end short-term rates
to stand at around 7 per cent in December. Economy minister Pedro Solbes
said yesterday that Spain's budget deficit fell by 22.8 per cent during the
first seven months of this year compared to the same 1993 period. 'The total
deficit (to July 31) is 1.378 trillion pesetas compared to 1.782 trillion
pesetas in the same period last year.' he said.
The number of corporate bankruptcies in west Germany rose 21 per cent to
6,000 in the first five months of the year, the federal statistics office
has said. A further 1,438 companies collapsed in the east.

A Moscow municipal court yesterday delivered the first legal blow in
post-communist Russia for consumer rights. In a sign that Russia is
gradually adopting the 'customer is always right' philosophy of capitalism,
the court awarded Mr P Gusev 2.318m roubles (Pounds 574) for a faulty video
camera. The store involved, Kvikk, had suggested he have it repaired at his
own expense, arguing that the warranty had run out. They also challenged his
claim that he had purchased the machine at their shop. However, the court
found in Mr Gusev's favour and ordered Kvikk to pay Mr Gusev the current
price for the video camera (Russian inflation means it has increased by
220,000 roubles since January), legal fees and moral damages.

There was an unexpected twist to Sweden's most notorious cold war spy
scandal yesterday when Stig Bergling, who served as a double agent for the
Soviet Union in the 1970s, returned home and gave himself up. Bergling was
convicted of spying for Moscow and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979
but escaped to Finland in 1987 during an unsupervised conjugal visit to his
wife. He had been recruited to the security police despite warnings from
colleagues that he was unreliable. He was caught after Israeli intelligence
services arrested him during a visit to Tel Aviv in 1979. He and his wife
were said yesterday to have returned chiefly to resume contact with their
children. Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said Bergling would serve out
his prison sentence.

<TEXT>
The attorney general of Gibraltar, Mr John Blackburn Gittings, has resigned
11 months before completion of his three-year term in office. The governor
of Gibraltar, Field Marshal Sir John Chapple, last night announced that Mr
Gittings had resigned early because of 'difference of views' between the two
men. The governor said that the attorney general's decision to resign was
'unconnected with questions of legal advice or current public issues'. The
resignation is likely to refuel the controversy surrounding the handling of
a British and Danish police investigation into allegations of fraud linked
to a major property development in Gibraltar. Four Danes are currently
standing trial in Denmark after being charged with defrauding a local
construction company JPC which was involved in the Gibraltar property
development. The charges relate to payments totalling Pounds 5.4m. Mr
Gittings has been present at police interviews with local officials in
Gibraltar in connection with the alleged fraud. In recent weeks he has also
requested the Swiss authorities to provide information of bank accounts
related to the police investigation.

<TEXT>
The Bosnian Serbs' self-declared assembly voted yesterday to reject the
latest international peace plan for Bosnia and to invite their people to
back the decision in a referendum, to be held on August 27-28. Deputies said
the referendum on the territorial division of Bosnia between the Serbs and
the Moslem-Croat federation was expected to confirm the leadership's
rejection of the peace plan. The 'contact group' of countries which drafted
the plan - the US, Russia, Germany, France and Britain - have called for
stiffer sanctions against Serbian-led Yugoslavia if the Serbs in
neighbouring Bosnia reject the peace plan. They say a referendum is a
time-wasting measure. Serbia, itself, has threatened to cut off links with
the Bosnian Serbs if they persist in rejecting the plan.
Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic said the period leading up to the
referendum could provide an opportunity for the maps defining the
territorial split to be adjusted in the Serbs' favour by the contact group.
Addressing the assembly, he said Bosnia's Serbs would have move to a full
war footing and prepare for closed borders with Serbia. 'Probably we shall
have to declare a (full) state of war, full mobilisation and rationed
supplies.' Yesterday's announcement coincided with increased fighting around
Sarajevo.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Zurich's services sector gets back to basics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich has long prided itself on providing the finest and safest in banking
and shopping for the world's rich. Soon the city may be able to offer them
similarly trustworthy services of a more traditional kind. Zurich is about
to get its first official brothel.
An application has been lodged with city authorities seeking to change the
use of a building in Allmendstrasse to 'erotic services, a brothel from
offices and shops' (erotische Dienstleistung, Bordell anstelle von Buro- und
Gewerbesraumen).
The detailed plans call for the creation of 12 apartments (Arbeitsplatzen)
to be rented to prostitutes individually, administration and medical rooms
and a 'contact and recreation room'.
This is not a joke, but a well-meaning and, of course, typically practical
and commercial, Swiss response to a recent change in the law which
decriminalises prostitution in some circumstances.
The project is the brainchild of Mr Valentin Landmann, a colourful Zurich
lawyer who has fought for years to legalise prostitution. Mr Landmann's view
is that the power of pimps over prostitutes can only be removed if women are
allowed to practise the oldest profession freely.
The Swiss federal government appeared to come to a similar view two years
ago, altering the criminal code article dealing with prostitution so that
each canton could determine in what circumstances it was a criminal offence.
This has left the situation uncertain in Zurich, and Mr Landmann takes the
view that if a prostitute practises her trade of her own free will, it
cannot be a criminal offence.
He and Mr Erwin Herren, the builder behind the project, plan to rent the
rooms directly on a daily or weekly basis, precisely to prevent pimps from
interposing themselves. Prices would be similar to those of a middle class
hotel, they say.
They have been careful enough to take a purchase option on a building where
there is likely to be little disturbance to, or objections from, neighbours.
It sits half under an elevated motorway on a busy trunk road and is
surrounded by parking space.
A waitress at the Restaurant Hocklerbrucke 200m away said yesterday that the
news caused much ribald comment among regulars at first. 'But we do not
think it will make much difference. We are full anyway.'
The Zurich authorities concerned with these matters - the police, the
justice department and the building and planning department - have all given
a cautious welcome to the application.
They see it as a way of getting the women off the city's otherwise pristine
streets. In the past few years, pimping and streetwalking have reached
distressing levels in Zurich, being an inevitable adjunct to the city's
oversized hard drug community.
Coincidentally, the brothel application comes just after the Swiss federal
finance ministry has ruled that, for purposes of its new value added tax,
prostitution will be classified as a service, not an element of medical
care, and therefore will be taxable.
There have been many jokes about how diligent Vatmen might enforce this
decision, but they now know where to begin their patrols.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Berlusconi gains a breathing space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has gained an essential
breathing space for his embattled government in the wake of Tuesday's
parliamentary debate on the conflict of interest with his Fininvest media
empire.
This was the majority view among political commentators yesterday as they
analysed the impact of Mr Berlusconi's most difficult parliamentary
performance at the close of his first 100 days in office.
The debate showed the opposition had no wish to bring the government down
and that, for the time being, there was no alternative to the right-wing
coalition. Mr Berlusconi thus has a chance to recover his strength during
the summer break and to prepare for what is likely to be a 'hot autumn'.
During the four-hour debate, which went on late into the night, Mr
Berlusconi made clear his determination to resolve the increasingly
problematic conflict of interest between his role as prime minister and his
ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group. But it was
also evident that the problem is so complex that it can be solved neither
quickly nor easily.
Mr Berlusconi back-tracked on the proposals he made only last Friday to
avoid a conflict of interest, declaring himself willing to accept any
reasonable solution. This means his idea of a five person commission to
monitor the conflict of interest could be scrapped.
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, failed to come up
with his much-promised counter proposals. However, he said the League would
have concrete details soon based on a two-stage separation of Mr Berlusconi
from Fininvest. The first step would be to separate him from his proprietary
interest, the next to place such interests in a US-style blind trust.
The opposition claimed there was no option but to sell Fininvest, especially
the commercial television interests. But again no details were provided. Mr
Berlusconi himself, while willing to be flexible, still seems to draw the
line at selling his stake in a group he created from nothing in 30 years.
The conflict of interest was only one aspect of the debate. Mr Berlusconi
used the occasion to appeal to his electorate, via live television coverage,
reassuring them of the government's stability and that the economic recovery
was gathering pace.
At another level, the debate proved a predictable contest, with each player
laying down markers for battle in the autumn. Mr Bossi showed he will be Mr
Berlusconi's most redoubtable opponent and difficult ally. The final words
of his speech, which time rules prevented him from saying, were: 'You are
free to do what you want, but it must be very clear - this cannot be against
the interests of the country.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / Change of role for French fast breeder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's Superphenix, built as the world's largest fast breeder reactor to
produce electricity, is to start a new life in the next few days as a centre
of research into the burning of plutonium and nuclear waste.
The French nuclear safety authority yesterday gave the final go-ahead for
the 1,300MW reactor to end its four-year shutdown, and the director of
Superphenix at Creys-Malville, south of Lyon, said he hoped to be able to
push the start button before Sunday.
Running Superphenix as a research reactor will cost FFr100m (Pounds 12m) a
year, to be borne by France's Atomic Energy Commission and Electricite de
France (EdF), the French utility that owns 51 per cent of the reactor. Half
the money will be spent on a study into the burning of plutonium.
The restarting of Superphenix, primarily as an incinerator of plutonium and
unrecyclable waste and only incidentally as a power generator, comes as
Cogema, France's nuclear fuels agency, is trying hard to maintain important
German reprocessing contracts.
Last week Greenpeace, the environmental action group, published a resume of
discussions between Cogema and Preussenelectkra (PE), a subsidiary of Veba,
in which the latter said it wanted to make some changes to its 1990 contract
with Cogema in an effort to limit its plutonium stocks.
Originally conceived in the fuel-short 1970s, Superphenix was designed to
'breed' more plutonium than it consumes. But it is now to be switched to
destroy more than it creates. Mr Jean-Louis Ricaud, Cogema's head of
reprocessing, said yesterday that Superphenix's net consumption of 100kg of
plutonium a year would be useful, but only marginally in the context of the
10 tonnes of plutonium which French reactors produce each year.
But Mr Ricaud said Cogema's contract renegotiation with PE began well before
a recent legal change in Germany, dropping the previous requirement for
German utilities to reprocess their spent nuclear fuel, and giving them the
option of stocking it.
Mr Ricaud said he was confident of keeping his German clients, who account
for 15 per cent of Cogema's FFr14bn a year reprocessing business, and who
have helped fund the FFr30bn spent on the fuel recycling plant that Cogema
has built for its foreign clients at La Hague in Normandy.
The change in Germany is the result of a compromise thrashed out between Mr
Klaus Topher, environment minister, and the opposition Social Democrats, to
end a dispute which has frozen development of nuclear energy in Germany
since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986.
The German utilities will have to decide whether to continue current
contracts with Cogema and British Nuclear Fuels or to seek an alternative
site for direct disposal to the Gorleben salt mines in Lower Saxony.
Gorleben, which is being financed by the utilities is not yet in use, and
commissioning is running behind schedule because of political obstacles.

West German chemicals companies increased their turnover by 4 per cent to
more than DM83bn (Pounds 34.2bn) in the first half of the year, the VCI

which led the recovery, was continuing to rise, while domestic bookings were
an increasingly important factor. However, the association warned that
prices were still unsatisfactory - down an by an overall average of 0.1 per
cent in the first half - and further structural changes and job losses were
unavoidable.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Tesco increases offer to win battle for Wm Low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco, the UK's second-biggest food retailer, yesterday struck a knock-out
blow in the takeover battle for William Low, the Scottish supermarket group,
with an increased offer of 360p a share.
Tesco's new offer, which values the Scottish chain at Pounds 247.4m,
persuaded rival J Sainsbury to pull out of the contest.
Sainsbury bid 305p a share last week, valuing Wm Low at Pounds 210m. Tesco's
bid yesterday was 60 per cent more than its original bid three weeks ago
which valued Wm Low at Pounds 154m, and 18 per cent more than Sainsbury's.
Mr James Millar, Wm Low's chairman, said he regretted that the company was
losing its independence but was 'delighted' with the value placed on it by
Tesco's offer. The board was likely to meet today to vote on a formal
recommendation to shareholders.
Wm Low's shares ended 23p up at 359p  - having touched 368p before
Sainsbury's withdrawal  - more than twice the 169p they stood at before
Tesco's original bid. Sainsbury was steady at 419p, but Tesco closed down 5
1/2 p at 237 1/2 p, amid fears of the acquisition's impact on its earnings.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, denied Tesco had been pushed into paying
too much. He said the acquisition would have a 'negligible impact' on
earnings per share in the current year, and a positive impact in future.
'We have looked at this business for a very long time. We are confident we
can make a very good return from its stores,' he said.
He added that analysts who had suggested a bid above 350p would dilute
earnings had underestimated how much Tesco could improve the performance of
Wm Low.
'We are very encouraged by the stores we already have in Scotland, which
trade above the company average,' he said.
Mr David Quarmby, joint managing director of Sainsbury, said Sainsbury's bid
of 305p a share had been a 'full and fair offer' and the group was not
prepared to go higher even though it still believed it was in the best
position to maximise Wm Low's potential.
'We do not believe we could have achieved a return that would be acceptable
to Sainsbury's shareholders at (the 360p) price,' he said. He added that the
failure of Sainsbury's bid would not affect its plans to build stores in
Scotland. It had five stores in the pipeline in addition to four already
operating there.
Tesco's revised offer is 360p in cash for each Wm Low share, and 169p for
each convertible preference share, with a share alternative available. It
will assume Pounds 50m of Wm Low's debt.
The acquisition will increase Tesco's share of the Scottish market from 7
per cent to 13 per cent.
Tesco plans to spend Pounds 35m on refurbishing Wm Low's 57 stores in
Scotland and northern England  - operating 45 Scottish stores as Tesco
Scotland.
Significant job losses are likely among the 300 staff at Wm Low's head
office, which will be closed.
The takeover is subject to approval from the Office of Fair Trading, and
some MPs were yesterday demanding that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
should investigate its effect on the Scottish economy.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said if the
MMC was 'not prepared to block the bid, they should be looking for
assurances from Tesco that they will continue to purchase at least as much
produce as William Low from Scottish suppliers'.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Beef export inquiry puts pressure on Dublin coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's coalition government came under pressure yesterday following
criticism of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister and former industry and
commerce minister, for his decision to grant more than IPounds 100m (Pounds
99m) in credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq six years ago.
Following publication of a long-awaited official report into the affair
earlier this week, Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour
party leader, described Mr Reynolds' actions as a 'major failure of public
policy'.
The report has further strained relations between Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail
and Labour, the junior government partner, already at odds over Northern
Ireland and a labour dispute at Team Aer Lingus, the maintenance arm of the
Irish airline.
As industry and commerce minister, Mr Reynolds approved export credit
guarantees to the Goodman Group, Ireland's biggest beef processor and
exporter, for meat exports to Iraq. The credits were granted between 1987
and 1988.
A tribunal was set up to investigate allegations against Goodman Group in
May 1991, before the Labour-Fianna Fail coalition government was formed in
1992.
Its report concluded that Irish taxpayers were exposed to a potential
liability of more than IPounds 100m as a result of the insurance cover
extended by Mr Reynolds. It also said the decision on credit insurance was
taken by Mr Reynolds 'against the professional advice available to him'.
'The benefit accruing or likely to accrue to the Irish economy from this
situation would be minimal . . . and would not justify the risk involved in
granting export insurance in the amounts granted,' it said.
The report has undermined Mr Reynolds' assertions at the weekend that he had
been 'totally vindicated' by it.
The chairman of the inquiry accepted that Mr Reynolds had the right to
extend the export credits, but said a more detailed investigation should
have been carried out.
Goodman Group had intended to export a large proportion of the beef to Iraq
from European Union intervention stocks but not from sources within the
Irish republic. The benefits to the Irish economy of this were 'illusory
rather than real', the report said.

FT  04 AUG 94 / Travel groups begin price war for summer of '95: Rival tour
operators race to launch next year's brochures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's leading package holiday companies stopped merely kicking sand over
each other's towels yesterday and started an outright brawl for a larger
share of the summer market.
Not for this summer, but for the summer of 1995. There are still 1.5m
packages on sale for this summer and more than a third of holidaymakers have
not even left home yet.
But so intense is the rivalry between tour operators and travel agents that
they cannot bear to see competitors publish an earlier brochure, offer a
bigger discount or boast that more children go free.
First on the beach was Thomson, the largest tour operator, and Lunn Poly,
its travel retail chain. Thomson's first 1995 brochure, published on
Tuesday, was no more than a sampler - 83 pages of family holidays in
destinations such as Spain, Tunisia and Florida. Lunn Poly offered 11 per
cent discounts off all summer 1995 holidays.
Yesterday, Airtours, the second biggest operator, hit back, sending travel
agents 1,600 pages of holidays to places as diverse as Turkey and Thailand.
Mr Harry Coe, Airtours' finance director, denied his group had been forced
into an early launch by the Thomson brochure.
Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours' marketing director, admitted, however, that
the company had prepared four possible launch dates to ensure that it was
not beaten to the market by Thomson. Airtours, he revealed, had been ready
to launch its summer 1995 long-haul programme as early as last month, had
Thomson forced it to do so.
Going Places, Airtours' travel agency chain, said it would offer discounts
of up to 12 per cent on favoured operators. These include Airtours itself,
but also rivals such as Owners Abroad and British Airways Holidays.
Mr Coe said Going Places' highest discounts would go to those operators
which provided the chain with the most 'support', which means that they
offered to help bear the cost of the discounts. Other operators' holidays
will be sold at discounts of 4 per cent to 8 per cent. Last night, Lunn Poly
hit back by announcing 12 per cent discounts on all holidays, following
which Going Places increased its top discount to 13 per cent.
Thomas Cook, the third largest travel retailer, said it would match the
prices of any other chain but said it thought starting a price war this
early was silly.
Mr Peter Shanks, Thomas Cook's commercial director, said the sensible time
to offer discounts for the following summer was in late August or early
September when people had returned from holiday. The early launch of summer
1995 brochures meant holidays were now being sold for three seasons: this
summer, this winter and next summer.
Mr Francis Baron, chief executive of Owners Abroad, the third largest tour
operator, said the price battles 'defy commercial logic'. 'It remains to be
seen how many people are going to book before they have even gone on this
year's summer holiday.'

FT  04 AUG 94 / BR chief warns of rail 'devastation' from signal strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid intervened publicly in the signalling
dispute for the first time yesterday with a grim warning that continuing
disruption threatened the future of the railway industry and everybody who
works in it.
In an open letter to Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general
secretary, he warned that the expected intensification of the eight-week
long conflict with the planned stoppages for 72 hours around next weekend
'would be hugely destructive'.
The BR chairman called on the RMT executive to ballot their signalling grade
members again on Railtrack's latest pay offer and suspend further strike
action until the result was known.
His plea came as travellers endured the eighth 24-hour strike by signal
staff and as the RMT prepared to announce the result of the rail
supervisors' strike ballot. Their decision will have a crucial impact on the
dispute.
Sir Bob said it would be 'devastating' if the rail dispute were 'to
degenerate into outright confrontation'. 'There is a new atmosphere of
bitterness and recrimination in the public statements from both sides,' he
said.
'That is no help to us in dealing with the difficult and taxing problems
ahead - reorganising the industry and continuing to improve services to
secure business for rail. All must do whatever we can to avoid that. I
believe there is a last chance for you to take action that could avoid it.'
In a separate letter to Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton, Sir Bob said that
his 'key concern' was to 'do whatever I can to ensure that the railways get
back as quickly as possible to providing the safe and reliable service to
our customers that is vital for all of us in industry'.
Interviewed on BBC Radio Four's PM programme last night, Sir Bob said there
might have to be sackings before the dispute was solved though he added that
this 'does not have to happen'.
Railtrack said last night it had no immediate plan to force through its pay
offer by requiring signalling staff to sign new employment contracts and it
ruled out any suggestion that any of them would be dismissed.
Instead it called on the signalling staff to urge their union to come back
to the negotiating table. The state-owned company that maintains and runs
the network claimed that the package on offer is liked by signal staff in
every area of the country.
It called on them to 'persuade the RMT executive to listen to them and
reconsider plunging the industry into even deeper conflict'. Yesterday,
Railtrack denied suggestions it had made any new offer when talking to the
conciliation service Acas over the past few days. But it said it had
'repackaged' its pay offer by agreeing to an improvement.
This would involve consolidating half the 6 per cent supplement into basic
rates proposed eight weeks ago, which will be backdated to April 4.
Railtrack said this would give the signalling staff an immediate earnings
increase of 4.5 per cent.
An RMT spokesman said that there was no extra money involved. 'The gap
between what we want and what is being offered has not closed.' The union
still insists on an interim payment for past efficiency savings before
talking about restructuring. Railtrack wants the whole package to be
negotiated while accepting there should be an up-front payment.

FT  03 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Buoyant outlook at AF Bulgin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 5th August 1994) appended to this article.
Shares in AF Bulgin, the electronic components and power supplies group,
rose 6p to 63p yesterday after Mr Ronald Bulgin, chairman, told shareholders
at the annual meeting that the six months to the end of July seemed to have
'been the most profitable half year for a number of years'.
He added he would be surprised if profits for the year to January 1995 did
not exceed Pounds 875,000, and more than Pounds 1m was targeted for the
following year. In the year to January 1994, pre-tax losses were Pounds
212,000.
CORRECTION
AF Bulgin made pre-tax profits of Pounds 507,000 in the year to January 1994
and not losses of Pounds 212,000 as reported in Wednesday's FT.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swedish bourse in London move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Stockholm Stock Exchange has taken the first step towards enabling
London-based members to trade directly on the bourse through its electronic
SAX system, instead of through a Swedish-based broker.
The exchange said it had approached the British Securities and Investment
Board for the conditions to allow direct trading from London.
The move follows last week's approval of similar applications by the Paris
bourse and the Paris-based Monep options exchange, which became the first
European exchanges to gain permission to operate in London. Several North
American exchanges and the Sydney futures exchange do so.
The Stockholm bourse said it wanted to ensure that it remained the main
forum for trade in Swedish stocks as the extension of technology and
deregulation broke down traditional restraints on trading.
From 1996, no official approval will be required within the European Union
for member's exchanges to operate in other member states. Sweden is due to
join the EU next year if membership is approved in a referendum in November.
Two Danish and one Norwegian member of the Stockholm exchange trade through
SAX from their bases in Copenhagen and Oslo.
Stockholm has three other foreign members, one each from France, the UK and
Switzerland, and wants to attract more. Since the last restraints on foreign
buying of Swedish stocks were dropped at the end of 1992, foreign investment
has grown. More than one-quarter of the value of Swedish equities are
foreign-held.
The stock exchange said direct trading from overseas would hit Swedish-based
brokers, but it believed overall volumes traded would rise.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Tokyo to miss emissions target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is unlikely to meet its official target for cutting carbon dioxide
emissions, set under a UN treaty which aims to tackle global warming.
In a report to be submitted to the UN next month, Japan's environmental
agency forecasts that carbon dioxide emissions will rise to an annual 330m
tonnes by the year 2000, a 3.1 per cent rise from 1990.
Japan had agreed at the UN Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992 to cut greenhouse
gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Some industrialised countries, including Germany and Denmark, are now
calling for stricter targets, requiring governments to reduce emissions
rather than simply stabilising them.
During the past 20 years, Japan has halved sulphur dioxide emissions and
nitrous oxide pollution, by rigorous curbs on air pollution. A recent OECD
study praises the country for its achievement in reducing air pollution from
industrial plants, cars and power stations.
Japanese environmental agency officials say that, because of the already
rigid regulations on car exhausts and industrial emissions, there is little
room for further controls.
The Japanese agency had initially tried to include a carbon dioxide emission
tax in its environmental protection bill approved last year, but was forced
to remove the clause following pressure from business and the government's
own ministry of international trade and industry.
The Japanese government says it will, however, meet its other target for
stabilisation of carbon dioxide, where emission will be frozen at per capita
levels. The environmental agency said that since the country's population
will have grown about 3 per cent in the 10 years to the year 2000, carbon
dioxide emission per head will be unchanged.
Aside from carbon dioxide levels, the report forecasts methane emissions to
fall by 16.7 per cent to 1.15m tonnes; nitrous oxide output levels are
predicted to rise 8.3 per cent to 52,000 tonnes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gambia's new military rulers yesterday freed all the former government
ministers who were detained after last month's bloodless coup, Reuter
reports from Banjul.
The junior officers who seized power in the small West African country on
July 22 also released public officials but senior security personnel
remained in custody.
All 10 ex-ministers detained after the coup went to their offices yesterday
to formally hand over government files to their successors appointed by Lt
Yahyah Jammeh's Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council.
Finance Minister Bakary Darbo, who fled with ousted President Sir Dawda
Jawara after the coup, was the only member of the former cabinet to keep his
job.
Lt Ammeh, head of state at only 29, justified one of Africa's increasingly
rare military takeovers by accusing Mr Jawara's elected administration of
corruption. Mr Jawara, who had led the former British colony since 1965, was
granted temporary asylum in neighbouring Senegal.

Indonesia's military has banned protests in East Timor ahead of a planned

police broke up demonstrations last month, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
In mid-July troops used teargas and sticks to disperse hundreds of mostly
Roman Catholic protesters. About 20 people were injured. Indonesia has been
widely criticised for its invasion of East Timor after the Portuguese, the
former rulers, left in 1975 and a formal annexation.

<TEXT>
An elderly Russian woman gestures pleadingly towards the closed offices of
the MMM finance company in Moscow yesterday. On the right is a second world
war veteran, wearing a high-ranking decoration and a covering for his head
against the sun.
The affair of the company, which is swaying between life and death, took
another step into uncharted territory yesterday when a group of people
claiming to be simple shareholders took out newspaper advertisements
attacking the government for destabilising their company.
MMM, a scheme which lured millions of Russian investors with promises of
3,000 per cent annual returns, suspended trading in its shares last week
after a crisis of confidence led to a collapse in the price.
Its share price tumbled to Rbs1,000 from Rbs115,000 the level to which it
had climbed from less than Rbs2,000 in February. But despite MMM's troubles,
bankers reported a steady rise in foreign portfolio investments in Russia in
recent weeks.
'Lately, there's been strong interest in capital-intensive projects in
Russia ' said Mr Fred Strickland, a senior banker with the Russian Project
Finance Bank.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Equity and bond prices rise in Europe as dollar gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equity and bond prices rose strongly across Europe yesterday reflecting
optimism about economic recovery and interest rates.
The dollar, meanwhile, recovered above Y100 as markets took a benign view of
the prospects for US-Japan trade talks. It closed in London at Y100.415
against Y98.85 on Monday.
News that German industrial production had risen 1 per cent in June,
together with favourable review of the chemical industry by a Deutsche Bank
research unit, focused attention on the pace of economic recovery across
Europe.
The bourses in Paris and Frankfurt closed at their highest levels for more
than two months. In Paris, the CAC-40 index rose more than 2 per cent in
moderate trading, while the Dax in Frankfurt finished 1.5 per cent ahead.
The London stock market enjoyed its strongest session of the year. The FT-SE
100 gained 60.1 points, or 1.94 per cent, to 3,157.5. In London, concerns
over base rate prospects were allayed further when the Bank of England again
showed in its money market operations that it did not want rates to rise at
present.
Currency analysts said the breakdown in the US-Japan talks was not seen as
significant since there was still a lot of time to reach a compromise, and
both sides seemed anxious to strike a deal. A Japanese foreign ministry
official told reporters in Tokyo that talks could probably resume by early
September.
A further factor bolstering the dollar is an apparent shift in capital
flows. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London,
commented: 'We have seen some quite important switching out of yen assets
into dollar assets by international investors. There may be a tide turning
in favour of the dollar.'

860p, while Reuters added 21 at 489p, Glaxo 21 at 594p and Unilever 23 at
1046p.
Unilever is due to report second-quarter results on Friday, and Strauss
Turnbull reiterated its positive stance. The house forecasts a slight
decline in profits to Pounds 588m but expects a second half boost from a
recovery in European demand and the benefits of recent corporate
restructuring.
Cable and Wireless, another dollar beneficiary, received additional support
from a Hoare Govett note which argues that the company's non- Hong Kong
operations are valued at 'close to a five-year low' and a share price of
580p would reflect the true valuation more closely. The shares strengthened
15 to 451p.
Household goods group Reckitt &amp; Colman, usually a niggardly market
performer, jumped 25 to 613p as a reshuffle at SG Warburg prompted the house
to boost its recommendation to buy from hold.
The house acknowledges that earnings growth is not one of the company's big
strengths but adds that the stock is on a 10-year p/e relative low and yield
relative high and sees a short term 10 per cent upside in the share price.
Insurer Commercial Union fell 9 to 539p on nervousness ahead of the expected
rights issue needed to fund the acquisition of Groupe Victoire, of France.
Among food retailers, bid target William Low slipped 4 to 336p as hopes for
a counter-bid from Tesco receded slightly. J. Sainsbury, which last week bid
Pounds 210m for the Scottish supermarket group, gained 7 at 419p. Tesco,
whose Pounds 155m agreed offer for Low two weeks ago was trumped by
Sainsbury, put on 6 1/2 at 243p.
Tate &amp; Lyle advanced 7 to 442p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to be
recommending the stock.
A mixed trading statement from Burton was taken positively by the market and
the shares ended the session 3 ahead at 59 1/2 p. Disappointing sales during
the 22 weeks to the end of July were offset by better than expected gross
margins. The company also said it was closing its 'IS' discount chain.
Forecasts were edged upwards, with Hoare Govett now looking for Pounds 42m
this year and Pounds 63m in 1995. The broker also upgraded the stock.
Brewers and spirits groups responded to reports of increased sales during
the recent spell of hot weather in the UK and the government's Green Paper
on extending licencing hours. Bass advanced 13 to 568p, Grand Metropolitan 9
to 424p and JD Wetherspoon 19 to 395p.
Agency broker James Capel placed the rump of the recent rights issue from
Greycoat, 21.75m shares being sold to a range of institutions at 14 1/2 p.
Greycoat firmed a penny to 15 1/2 p. Elsewhere, MEPC continued to benefit
from reports of its finance-raising exercise in Australia, gaining 12 at
470p.
Meanwhile, Capel, a re-knowned bull of the property sector, reported
unexpectedly strong rental growth, particularly in London's West End and
City office markets. The broker recommended Land Securities, up 16 at 673p,
and British Land, ahead 9 at 432p, as being well placed to benefit from the
renewed optimism.
British Aerospace improved 10 to 511p after a positive note from Hoare
Govett, the group's broker, landed on clients' desks yesterday. The focus of
the circular is BAe's long term potential but the broker also increased its
current year profits forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 170m.
Margins worries at vehicle distributor Cowie Group sent the shares tumbling
12 to 256p, after the group reported a robust set of interim figures with
profits up 32 per cent to Pounds 20.5m. Lex Service, which recently came
under similar pressure following its results, relinquished 7 1/2 to 422p.
Engineering company TI closed 15 up at 402p ahead of interim figures due
tomorrow.
Lucas Industries put on 8 at 203p, with a big buyer of the shares said to
have been waiting in the wings.
Resignation due to ill health of the deputy chairman at Hall Engineering
left the shares trailing 13 at 180p.
British Airways was restrained to a rise of only 3 at 421p in trade of 3.8m.
Dealers reported some nervousness ahead of today's publication of July
traffic figures.
Yorkshire Chemicals, the colours and dye based group, jumped 29 to 421p
after announcing first-half profits of Pounds 7.2m, at the top end of City
expectations. Holliday Chemicals moved up 13 to 235p ahead of next week's
interim results.
Construction group Havelock Europa moved ahead 8 to 177p after it was chosen
by Camelot, operator of the national lottery, to fulfil a substantial
proportion of its requirements. Elsewhere in the sector, Smith New Court
recommended housebuilder firms Bryant Group at 154p and Beazer Homes at
157p.

High Street bank National Westminster surprised the market - but more
because of the performance of its shares than the details of its first half
profits. Once the reduction in the bad debt charge had been taken into
account underlying profits were down by 9 per cent.
However, the shares have fallen so far this year that by the time the
figures came out they looked very cheap. Analyst Mr Michael Lever of Nomura
said: 'It was the cheapest in the sector in p/e terms. The results were
disappointing in terms of underlying profits but this was more than
adequately compensated by the rating.'
The stock rose 17 to 470p, with a number of investors taking the opportunity
to close out their bear positions.

Oil major British Petroleum pleased the market with a set of second-quarter
figures well above market forecasts. The shares jumped 18 at one stage but
in the afternoon US investors, who take a more cautious view of the stock,
were happy to sell into strength and took the stock back to close 7 up at
418 1/2 p. Turnover of 22m shares was the highest in London.
The unexpected element of the figures was the low tax charge, which
encouraged analysts to raise forecasts by around Pounds 50m.
Hoare Govett increased its full-year estimate to Pounds 1.4bn, while Mr
Fergus Macleod of NatWest Securities argued that the temptation to take
profits should be resisted ahead of a big presentation on the group's
upstream performance in mid-September.

<TEXT>
The near month Footsie futures contract broke through three recent
resistance levels to finish strongly as talk of a big buyer and prospects of
economic recovery brought active buying, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 started at 3,122.
Rumours that there was a buyer of 1,000 lots in each of the leading European
futures markets swept through the sector, driving the contract strongly
ahead.
The rally by the US dollar and the strong overnight performance on Wall
Street were factors adding to the positive mood of the market, encouraging
further buying. September powered ahead, breaking through several resistance
levels to trade comfortably above 3,150.
The contract stretched its premium to cash as the session progressed and
dealers reported strong arbitrage activity.
It closed at 3,183, up 75 from its previous close and around 22 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was
18,983 lots.
Turnover in trade options improved to 32,518 contracts from Monday's 27,320.
FT-SE 100 option volume was 14,989 lots and 2,613 contracts were dealt in
the Euro FT-SE option. Guinness was the busiest stock option with a total of
2,030 trades.

FT  03 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie scores strongest daily gain
this year - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highly positive developments, in terms of economic and corporate recovery as
well as inflation and interest rate prospects, yesterday inspired the
strongest session recorded this year on the UK stock market. The FT-SE 100
Index broke through an important chart point to close 60.1 higher on the day
at 3,157.5 as investors moved in ahead of publication of the views on
inflation expressed in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, which was
released just before the equity market closed.
Firmness in the US dollar, overnight strength on Wall Street and reports
from Tokyo that the US-Japan trade talks will reopen next month set the
stage for a strong opening in London. Lingering concerns over base rate
prospects were further calmed by a further round of benign operations in the
London money market by the Bank of England.
Share prices, encouraged both by demand from stock index futures and strong
gains in UK government bonds, had already achieved most of their gains
before the Bank Bulletin was released, but closed very near to the best of
the day.
Trading reports from British Petroleum and National Westminster Bank, both
exceeding market expectations, underscored perceptions that share prices are
now driven by prospects for higher company profits and dividend payouts, as
well as by belief that inflation will remain under con-trol in the UK.
The market was very confident at the close, although Wall Street
disappointed with a virtually unchanged Dow Industrial Average. Equity chart
specialists, pointing out that the Footsie had broken through an important
testing level around 3,140, prophesied that the market could soon test the
3,200 level and then perhaps the 3,500 mark, still seen as the high end of
analysts' forecasts for the year. The September contract on the Footsie
touched 3,188 in late trading.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 32 points at 3,673.4, although the focus of
the day was on the blue chip international stocks. Trading volume increased
sharply towards the end of the session and Seaq volume finally totalled
810.3m shares, compared with 544.7m on Monday, when retail, or customer,
business in equities was worth Pounds 1.22bn.
The strongest performances came among the dollar-orientated issues, with
Glaxo and Shell Transport to the fore as the results from BP and National
Westminster set the stage for an improving scenario.
The banking sector was in strong form, with the merchant banks and
integrated securities trading houses in demand as investors weighed the
implications for profit and loss accounts of the resurgence of confidence in
global markets. Consumer and retail stocks, including the leading UK high
street traders, also advanced as the market took the view that higher base
rates will probably be delayed until later in the year.
There were some warning voices, however, pointing out that rises in domestic
interest rates have only been postponed, and that strong corporate profits
are likely to increase inflationary pressure. A more considered response to
the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin is more likely to come today after strategists
at the leading securities houses have had time to examine the Bank's
comments on inflation more thoroughly.
Traders admitted that some leading houses had moved too strongly on to the
bear tack on Friday afternoon, when the Bank's actions in the London money
markets raised the alarm on base rate prospects. This meant that the sudden
recovery in confidence brought a hurried scramble to buy stock which, with
the stock index futures supplying extra pressure, inevitably drove share
prices ahead very strongly.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Latest data fail to provide
fresh impetus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks paused after a two-day rally yesterday in spite of more economic
data which may help to delay the Federal Reserve's next move to tighten
monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 1.95 at 3,796.22, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.45 at 460.56. Volume on
the Big Board amounted to 295.6m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged up 0.12 to close
at 439.74, while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.05 to 724.80.
When the session commenced, stocks appeared to be heading for their third
big gain in a row. The Dow industrials opened 12 points higher, building on
a powerful 67-point advance which began late last week.
Yesterday's economic news provided additional support to a scenario which
had triggered the rally on Friday. The Commerce Department announced that
sales of new single-family homes had dropped by 14.1 per cent in June to an
annualised rate of 591,000. Analysts, who had expected a much more modest
decline, said the downturn was evidence of the effect of more restrictive
credit conditions. The data supported the view, advanced by last week's GDP
report, that the Fed would hold off its next move to put up interest rates.
In spite of the favourable news, stocks ran out of steam. Most equity
investors were content to sit tight, delaying their next big moves until
after Friday's crucial employment data. The keenly watched report may
provide the Fed with the last piece of evidence it needs to make a decision
on when to lift rates again.
However, investors were showing no inclination to cut and run. Stocks across
the board hovered within a tight range of their opening values, mirroring
activity in the bond market.
In pharmaceuticals, investors shrugged off an early report that SmithKline
Beecham was negotiating an asset swap with American Cyanamid. But minutes
from the close, news broke that another company, American Home Products, was
offering to acquire shares in Cyanamid for 95 cents each.
Trading in both issues was halted on the annoucement, with AHP at Dollars 56
3/4 , down Dollars  3/4 on the day, and Cyanamid at Dollars 63 3/4, up
Dollars 3/4. SmithKline added Dollars 1/2 to finish at Dollars 32 1/8.
The takeover bid gave a late boost to the entire sector, with Warner Lambert
jumping Dollars 4 to Dollars 68 1/2, Schering Plough up Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 66 1/4 and and Pfiser ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 63 1/2.
Among the Dow industrials, a few cyclical issues showed improvement.
International Paper was Dollars 1 3/8 stronger at Dollars 75 1/4 amid a
general upturn among paper and pulp stocks. Elsewhere, Georgia Pacific
gained Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 69 1/8 and Scott Paper added Dollars 1 1/2
at Dollars 60.
United Technologies climbed as high as Dollars 64 1/4 during the morning but
dropped back to close at Dollars 63, a net gain of Dollars 1/4. Over the
last few sessions the stock has retraced some of the losses it had suffered
on the release of its second-quarter results.
Bethlehem Steel, up Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 23 5/8, appreciated amid reports
of higher prices being paid by Chrysler for raw materials. National Steel
moved Dollars 1 higher to Dollars 22 5/8 .

Toronto closed higher in quiet post-holiday trading, but the rise was
tempered by falling gold issues and a severe drop in Newbridge Networks'
stock.
The TSE 300 index gained 15.3 at 4,194.3 and advances outnumbered declines
by 373 to 346. Volume was 49m shares valued at CDollars 624.3m.
Newbridge plummeted CDollars 17 7/8 to CDollars 40 3/8 after the company
warned on Monday that its earnings for the fiscal first quarter would fall
short of analysts' estimates.
The gold sub-index hampered the market with the day's biggest decline of 2.0
per cent as the price of gold bullion fell USDollars 4.70 an ounce to
USDollars 379.15 in New York.
Among gold stocks, Placer Dome shed CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 28 1/8 after
its Placer Pacific subsidiary reported an explosion and fire at the Porgera
gold mine in Papua New Guinea.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico rises sharply on prospects for
election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican shares rose sharply on optimism that the ruling party would win the
general election later this month. Analysts said prices were also boosted by
expectations of lower domestic interest rates. The IPC index gained 64.98,
or 2.6 per cent, at 2,538.52. Volume was a heavy 129.8m shares.
There was strong demand from foreigners, and foreign exchange traders said
the new peso ended higher against the dollar on demand for Mexican currency
with which to buy on the Mexican bolsa.
Salomon Brothers said it had increased the weighting of Mexican equities in
its Latin American portfolio to 40 per cent from 38 per cent, based on a
positive economic and political outlook for the country.
Salomon added that it had maintained its 3,100 estimate for the Mexican
bolsa's IPC index by the year-end, up by some 22 per cent from the current
level.
Following a recent visit to Mexico, Salomon said it was confident that the
ruling party candidate Mr Ernesto Zedillo would win the August 21
presidential election with between 43 per cent and slightly more than 50 per
cent of the vote.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers 1.7%,
Shanghai falls on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in the yen and the overnight advance on Wall Street prompted a rise
in the stock futures market, and the Nikkei 225 average rallied 1.7 per cent
in low volume on index-linked buying by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index ended 388.78 ahead at 20,660.13 after opening at the day's low of
20,429.29 and setting a high of 20,661.93 just before the close. Buying by
investment trusts and dealers also supported share prices in the afternoon.
A total of 250m shares changed hands, against 179m on Monday. Small-lot
buying also came from public funds, while traders said overseas investors,
who have been leading sellers during the past few weeks, remained absent.
The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 22.78, or 1.4 per cent,
at 1,652.60 and the Nikkei 300 rose 4.49 to 300.16, recovering the 300 level
for the first time since July 20. Gainers led losers by 871 to 168, with 132
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.54 at 1,346.22.
High-technology electricals and other exporters firmed on the rise in the
dollar, while consumption-related stocks, including food manufacturers and
retailers, gained ground due to the recent recovery in consumer confidence.
Drug companies and stocks linked to the Aids theme were purchased ahead of
the international Aids conference starting this weekend in Yokohama.
Among exporters, Hitachi moved ahead Y41 to Y1,010, Toshiba Y29 to Y776,
Honda Motor Y40 to Y1,750 and Sony Y150 to Y6,000.
Investors were also encouraged by the prospect that July supermarket sales
could rise from a year earlier due to the hot weather, for the first time in
23 months. Retailers firmed, with Daiei rising Y60 to Y1,820 and Isetan Y20
to Y2,040.
Reports that Japan Telecom, a telecommunications operator, would be listed
in September supported East Japan Railway, which owns a 22.7 per cent stake
in the company. JR East advanced Y12,000 to Y527,000, while Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone added Y25,000 at Y862,000.
Nippon Kayaku, a drugmaker, jumped Y32 to Y816.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 227.96 at 22,911.30 in volume of 60.6m
shares.
Roundup
Profit-taking took its toll in some of the region's markets.
SHANGHAI's A share index made a spirited early attempt to build on Monday's
36.1 per cent surge before profit-taking left the market 3.2 per cent down
on the day. The index of shares available to local investors lost 14.28 at
433.42, sharply off its intraday high of 499.49.
Volume reached a record 920m shares with turnover hitting Yn5.31bn (Dollars
617m), the second highest in history.
Analysts commented, however, that the mood remained positive in the wake of
Beijing's ban on all new share issues and listings this year, and an
announcement yesterday that companies that had published prospectuses would
not go ahead with issues. They expected the market to make further upward
progress in coming days.
Shandong Bohai Group, Monday's star with a 103 per cent gain, was the day's
heaviest loser. It dropped 25.9 per cent to Yn4.67 on profit-taking.
In Shenzhen, the A index closed 2.24, or 1.8 per cent, down at 125.80 after
a day's high of 143.16.
In contrast, Shanghai's B index of shares that can be bought by foreigners
rose just 0.93 to 73.36 and the Shenzhen B index put on 0.08 at 100.14.
HONG KONG finished higher after a day of seesaw trading within a tight
range. The Hang Seng Index ended 11.35 per cent up at 9,695.03 in heavy
turnover for the time of year of HKDollars 5.6bn. Some blue chips lost
ground on profit-taking. Sun Hung Kai Properties shed 50 cents to HKDollars
52.25, China Light 50 cents to HKDollars 41.40 and Wharf 40 cents to
HKDollars 32.50.
China-based H shares made gains on the back of better than expected economic
data and Monday's A share rally in China. Tsingtao Brewery rose 35 cents to
HKDollars 6.80.
SEOUL saw profit-taking in reaction to rising local interest rates as
trading volume fell to its low for the year. The August 12 deadline to
redeem part of borrowings by investment trust companies to the central bank
also cast gloom on the market.
The composite index dipped 5.14 to 927.55 in volume of 16.7m shares. Among
recent firm performers, Posco fell Won400 to Won74,400 and Samsung
Electronics lost Won1,000 at Won89,000.
KUALA LUMPUR was spurred to a five-month high by institutional and retail
demand and the composite index rose 18.85, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,075.19.
Investors had pushed the index to a day's peak of 1,077.26 as positive
corporate earnings reports rekindled interest in blue chips, before some
profit-taking pulled prices back from their best levels.
SYDNEY failed to build on a strong opening rise and the All Ordinaries index
closed just 4.8 firmer at 2,086.9, having seen a 16-point gain early on.
Turnover was ADollars 482.1m. BHP closed at a record high, up 8 cents at
ADollars 19.52, but below an intraday peak of ADollars 19.70.
MANILA dropped back on a bout of profit-taking following a solid rise early
in the session brought on by good company results. The composite index,
which had risen to an intraday high of 2,905, closed 16.81 down at 2,866.53.
Turnover rose to 1.6bn pesos.
Manila Electric was the biggest loser among blue chips: its B shares fell
3.4 per cent to 355 pesos. PLDT went against the trend, firming 5 pesos to
1,720 pesos.
BANGKOK ended slightly lower, adjusting its support level before breaching
the 1,400 psychological resistance. The SET index closed 2.26 easier at
1,399.72 after fluctuating between 1,391.06 and 1,409.40 in high turnover of
Bt11.21bn.
Bangchak Petroleum, which made its debut, closed at Bt48.50, against its
offer price of Bt31, in turnover of Bt2.2bn.
TAIPEI built on Monday's gain, with electronics stocks doing well. The
weighted index was up 40.54, or 0.6 per cent, at 6,879.56, after touching
6,919.60, in turnover of TDollars 126.6bn.
Institutional buying in the electronics sector, which put on nearly 3 per
cent, was strong throughout the session: Tatung rose TDollars 5 to TDollars
86.5.

FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German chemicals sector
boosted by upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overnight gains on Wall Street gave bourses a good start yesterday, although
there was also talk of their domestic attractions, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, after a recovery based on better bond markets, a stronger dollar
and the outlook for the German economy, put in an extra spurt after DB
Research, the Deutsche Bank research arm, put out sharply upgraded earnings
estimates for the big three German chemical companies.
The Dax index rose 32.60 to 2,186.39 and continued to improve after hours,
ending 1.5 per cent higher on the day at an Ibis-indicated 2,193.63.
Ms Petra Zamagna, for DB Research, lifted BASF's 1994 and 1995 earnings
estimates from DM14.50, and DM23, to DM21 and DM30; Hoechst's from DM16 and
DM27 to DM25 and DM31; and Bayer's from DM25.50 and DM30 to DM26 and
DM32.50. She noted that the accent was on the two more cyclical stocks, BASF
and Hoechst, rather than on Bayer, with its strong position in
pharmaceuticals.
BASF rose DM8.70 to DM329.20, Bayer DM9.30 to DM372.80 and Hoechst DM12.80
to DM358.50. Ms Zamagna said that the reason for the ugrades was that
business was much better than expected.
The third quarter, she said, normally produced a downturn in order intake
and an absence of product price increases but this year there was evidence,
backed up by recent progress reports from ICI, in the UK, and Solvay, in
Belgium, that the order intake had continued to grow in July and that
product price rises were continuing to take place.
In the broad market, turnover soared from DM4.7bn to DM8.5bn. Financials
were relatively weak after Monday's stagnant first-half operating profits at
Bayernhypo, but Daimler rose with renewed vigour, by DM16.20 to DM816.20. In
engineering and metals, Preussag and Thyssen added DM12.30 at DM466 and DM9
at DM305.50 on the assumption that their products will feed the recovery in
the German economy as a whole.
PARIS was another beneficiary of the livelier atmosphere across the
Continent and was also supported by higher turnover, up to FFr4.6bn from
Monday's low FFr2bn. The CAC-40 index advanced 47.65, or 2.3 per cent, to
2,117.23.
UBS Global Research highlighted the fall in French unemployment in June  -
the first monthly decrease since 1990. 'More jobs means more positive income
prospects and higher consumption, underpinning our robust consumption
forecast of 2.4 per cent growth in 1994,' the research team commented.
'Also, as unemployment falls, it becomes less of an issue in the
presidential election, diminishing the prospects of some radical departure
from present policy. This will have the effect of settling the bond market
and, through this channel, supporting the equity market.'
Peugeot moved FFr11 ahead to FFr870 on a rise in domestic new car sales in
July.
ZURICH, returning from a long weekend break, rose 2 per cent as it caught up
with Wall Street. The SMI index added 50.2 at 2,629.7, but trading was quiet
and volume low.
Banks were firm, CS Holding bearers rising SFr11 to SFr582, with last
Friday's figures from Credit Suisse, which contained no unpleasant
surprises, providing cautious encouragement. UBS moved up SFr12 to SFr1,196
ahead of its six-month figures due later in the week.
Roche certificates continued their recovery from recent lows, bouncing
SFr170 to SFr5,490. Ciba registered were marked SFr28 higher to SFr809.
AMSTERDAM made further headway and the AEX index finished at its highest
level since mid-April, rising 7.1, or 1.7 per cent, to 419.24 in
anticipation of the interim report season.
Akzo Nobel and DSM, featuring second-quarter results today, made respective
gains of Fl 2.80 and Fl 3.10 to Fl 219.50 and Fl 147.40. Analysts were
expecting both chemical groups to confirm signs of Europe-wide recovery,
while DSM is seen as providing the stronger results.
ABN-Amro gained further ground, following on from Monday's rise when it
broke through the Fl 60 resistance level, to end up Fl 2.20 at Fl 62.30.
Unilever was another of the day's big risers, climbing Fl 5.50 to Fl 195.90.
MILAN hoped that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's address to parliament last night
would help to clear the air. The Comit index rose 6.63 to 715.33.
Industrials led the advance, as hopes grew for positive first-half results.
Fiat added L82 at L7,041 and Olivetti put on L34 at L2,433. Pirelli firmed
L34 to L2,940 after announcing that it was selling its 50 per cent stake in
Caboto Sim for L72bn to Ambroveneto.
Stet put on L140 at L5,384 after Monday's growth forecasts forgroup income
and operating profits this year. Sip rose L106 to L4,608.
MADRID majored on its US quoted stocks and turnover nearly doubled on the
day, jumping from Pta26.1bn to Pta50.65bn as strong buying was seen in
Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa.
Unfortunately, the US stimulus weakened in the late afternoon and the
general index closed off its best, 1.42 higher at 320.80. Telefonica and
Repsol finished modestly better, up by Pta10 at Pta1,880 and Pta30 at
Pta4,275, while Endesa eventually fell Pta30 to Pta6,230.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rises above Y100
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conciliatory statements from Japanese officials yesterday helped the market
overcome fears about a trade war between the US and Japan, driving the
dollar above Y100, writes Philip Gawith.
The markets took a benign view of the breakdown in talks, buoyed by comments
from a Japanese Foreign Ministry official that talks might resume in early
September.
The dollar finished in London more than 1 1/2 yen firmer at Y100.415 from
Y98.85. It was also higher against the D-Mark, ending at DM1.5814 from
DM1.5743. The US currency showed little further change at the New York close
at Y100.34 and DM1.5824.
In the UK, interest rate sentiment was improved by the Bank of England's
latest inflation report and a further calming of worries about an imminent
interest rate rise.
Three-month sterling LIBOR traded at 5 9/16 per cent, down from 5 3/4 per
cent on Monday. Short sterling futures also recovered, with the September
contract closing four basis points up at 94.21. Prices firmed further to
94.28 after the release of the inflation report.
The trade weighted sterling index finished firmer at 79.3 from 79, but the
pound weakened after the release of the Bank of England's monetary report,
which was more bullish than expected on inflation. The UK currency closed in
London at DM2.4346 from DM2.4221. It was little changed against the dollar
at Dollars 1.5396.
Trade in Europe was thin as holiday spirit took hold. The Italian lira
remained weak, finishing unchanged at L1,003 against the D-Mark.
Analysts were split as to whether the dollar's breach of Y100 marked a
change in sentiment, or simply a temporary recovery before the downward
trend was resumed.
Two factors seemed to underpin the dollar's firmness: the belief in some
quarters that the Clinton administration is pursuing a strong dollar, rather
than a benign, neglect policy; and the view that the trade row will be
resolved.
The market is clearly of the view that both parties want a deal badly, and
hence will achieve one before the end-September deadline.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at Industrial Bank of Japan in London,
cited a further factor: a change in US - Japan capital flows. 'We have noted
some quite important switching out of yen assets into US assets by
international investors. There may be a tide turning here on the yen. People
are showing much more of a preparedness to risk a few per cent loss on the
currency. Increasingly, people are getting attracted to the higher yields in
the US.'
Mr Hannah added that the dollar had the potential to rise to Y102-3 before
the September deadline.
In contrast, Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London,
said that although the market was taking the view that a compromise trade
deal would be reached, he would not rule out a further bout of yen strength.
The Bank of England, in its daily monetary operations, underlined the
message that interest rates remained unchanged. After forecasting a shortage
of Pounds 1.1bn, it offered early assistance to the market of Pounds 850m.
The Bank later provided a further Pounds 475m after revising the shortage to
Pounds 1.3bn. Overnight money traded between 2 and 5 per cent.
The Bank's accommodating stance helped douse fears of a rise in interest
rates, reflected in the better performance of short sterling and cash rates
in the money market.
The fall in the level of three-month money should assist the Bank in
handling this Friday's Treasury bill tender.
Markets continued to be much occupied with last week's treasury bill auction
which fuelled speculation of higher interest rates. Following earlier near
blanket condemnation of the Bank, some revisionist voices have started to
appear.
One money market source was scathing about the reaction of the City and much
press comment, saying it had been at best mischievous, at worst
manipulative. 'I think it was downright irresponsible,' he said.
Noting that the Bank's inflation bulletin suggested that they did not
believe there were large inflation pressures in the economy, he continued:
'You get the impression that the market is much more concerned about
inflation than the Bank is.'
Mr Hannah of IBJ said Friday's events were just an 'unsubtle' way of
preparing the market for higher rates. 'The Bank is experienced enough to
know exactly how the market would react.'
He said they were part of a pattern of events, including Mr Eddie George's
Mansion House speech, where he said rate rises were inevitable, and his
comments in the most recent monetary minutes, that there was an advantage in
raising rates before inflation rose.
Mr Hannah said the Bank's activities had had the desired impact of putting
the market on interest rate alert. This meant the UK would probably avoid
the ructions that followed the first policy tight-ening in the US earlier
this year. 'It has to be regarded as successful monetary management,' he
added.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought shrivels output in
Queensland's 'country garden' - For the fourth year in a row the state's
grain growers are facing disaster conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large roadside billboard greets travellers heading west from Brisbane:
'Welcome to Queensland's Country Garden', it reads. Today, the message seems
laughable. As far as the eye can see, there is nothing but scorched earth
under a blistering blue sky.
This is the Queensland drought, and it has tens of thousands of farmers,
working land on Australia's eastern seaboard, praying for rain. If the
weather does not break in the next week, all winter planting opportunities
will have passed. Worse, this will be the fourth consecutive year and eighth
planting season when many grain farmers have faced such conditions. The
length and severity of the drought is unprecedented since European
settlement, and it is wreaking havoc on the rural economy.
Already, 35 per cent of Queensland has been declared a drought area,
including major grain-growing areas around the Darling Downs and central
tablelands. This figure will almost certainly rise this month. A similar
situation persists in New South Wales, where almost 60 per cent of the state
was declared to be drought-stricken earlier this week. The only consolation
for NSW is that drought is relatively recent. Last year's grain production
was good.
Even so, many Australian farmers - wheat and cotton growers, in particular -
are hurting badly. The Queensland Graingrowers Association reckons that lost
production resulting from this year's weather conditions alone will total
ADollars 1bn (Pounds 480m), about Dollars A330m in Queensland and the
remainder in New South Wales.
More broadly, Mr Wayne Goss, Queensland's premier, has calculated that the
paucity of rain since 1991 has cost his state around ADollars 2bn-worth of
rural production. Allowing for the 'multiplier' effect - as farmers' reduced
spending power hits demand for other goods and services - he puts the total
damage to Queensland's economy at ADollars 3.6bn.
The extent of the 1994 grain disaster has only become apparent in recent
weeks, as successive windows for winter planting have passed. Back in March,
above average rainfalls actually encouraged farmers to hope that the drought
jinx had been broken. Even six weeks ago, in its quarterly crop report, the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics was forecasting
that the nation would sow about 10.2m hectares to wheat this winter and
produce some 15.7m tonnes of the grain. This would have compared with just
under 18m tonnes in the previous year.
Since then, the situation has changed dramatically. Now Abare warns that, if
meteorologists' forecasts of below average rainfalls for the next two months
are correct, national production could fall to as little as 10.8m tonnes,
with only 8.3m ha sown.
In Queensland, the picture will certainly be bleaker. In a 'normal' year,
the state might produce 1.5m to 2m tonnes of wheat. Last year, the figure
was just over 600,000 tonnes. This year, the Australian Wheat Board says it
expects under 500,000 tonnes, and the Queensland Graingrowers Association
warns that the figure could be lower still. In New South Wales, where
'average' production exceeds 5m tonnes, the AWB is talking of 2m tonnes, and
'that's assuming normal weather conditions from now on'.
Already, the chances of retrieving the winter planting season look slim.
'We're not going to get rain until next weekend at best, so it would be the
middle of August before farmers can plant in southern Queensland - and you'd
have to be desperate to do that,' says Mr Ian MacFarlane, president of the
QGA. With central Queensland already a lost cause, he concludes: 'What we're
going to get is what's already in the ground'.
And already the implications of both present and cumulative damage are
starting to emerge.
On the one hand, there is talk of endangered export contracts, even a
suggestion that Australia may have to make the rare move of importing wheat.
The grain represented the country's seventh most important export category
last year, with a trade value of ADollars 2.2bn; and the big problem is that
the premium wheat, favoured by Japanese buyers, is grown mainly the
drought-affected areas.
Of most concern is an agreement to sell about 300,000 tonnes of prime hard
wheat to the Japanese, for whom security of supply has always been a prime
requirement. 'We are currently reasonably confident that we can satisfy
that,' says the Australian Wheat Board, the central agency which handles
export sales. But the AWB also acknowledges that total Australian production
needs to reach 13m tonnes before it can comfortably handle all export
business. This figure will almost certainly be undershot.
To ensure that the AWB at least secures the bulk of the available supply of
premium wheat, the agency has sharply increased the pool prices in selected
regions. It is also shipping lower-grade wheat from other states to satisfy
feed buyers in the drought-affected areas - in the hope of reducing their
rival calls on the premium product.
Unfortunately, this will almost certainly push up feed costs, thus spreading
financial impact of the drought. 'The grain farmers are getting the
attention, but I guess that forgotten people in all this are the livestock
producers, and the agricultural suppliers,' says Mr MacFarlane.
Moreover, while both the AWB and grain growers remain fairly sanguine about
imports - not least because of quarantine restrictions and the like - they
do concede that shortages in niche areas like durum wheat, used to make
pasta, may necessitate some selective purchasing from overseas.
Secondly, there is the question of assistance for farmers. To date, some
ADollars 75m of aid has been provided by state and federal authorities,
mainly in the form of interest subsidies. Federal government allowed for a
further ADollars 4.5m of assistance in its 1994-95 budget estimates, and
Queensland is promising about ADollars 20m.
But Queensland grain growers say that the sums are paltry when set against
the cashflow crisis in the farm community. They claim that the need for aid
surpasses any previous experience - and that a major rethink should
encompass everything from the size of re-establishment grants for farmers
who want to quit the land, to training facilities for farm workers who are
now idle.
Later this week, Senator Bob Collins, Australia's primary industry minister,
will tour the Darling Downs region. He has already asked for separate
assessments of the situation from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory
Council, which handles federal relief, and from the Queensland and New South
Wales governments. The federal cabinet will discuss the need for further
measures next week.
In the meantime, some damage may be irreparable. While few Queensland
growers think that land will be lost to grain production in the long term -
simply because cash-flow should return quickly when the rains come - they do
worry that an exodus from the land could occur. Mr MacFarlane quotes
figures, which he says are supported by Abare, suggesting that 15 to 20 per
cent of farmers could sell up if the drought continues.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada and the US yesterday agreed the terms of a one-year peace pact over
wheat trade, setting new temporary tariffs on some of Canada's wheat exports
to the US.
The agreement ends, for now, a threatened trade war. Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, and Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said the
new tariffs were necessary to protect US farmers against a 'precipitous'
surge of Canadian durum and feed wheat imports.
Mr Kantor said there were no losers in the deal, and Canadian officials
seemed to agree that they, at least, had won the negotiations. They said the
pact still permitted the shipment of 2m tonnes of wheat to the US, which
exceeds the recent three-year annual average of Canadian wheat exports to
the US.
The new one-year tariff schedule would impose Dollars 50 per tonne tariffs
on all wheat, except durum, after 1.05m tonnes are imported. On durum wheat,
Dollars 23 per tonne tariffs will be imposed after 300,000 tonnes are
imported. That will be raised to Dollars 50 per tonne once Canadian imports
hit 450,000.
The new temporary US tariff schedule does not apply to wheat grown outside
the Canadian Wheat Board area.

Pressure was mounting on the Chilean government yesterday to urge UK and US
regulatory authorities to investigate alleged 'irregular' metals futures
trading that led its state copper company, Codelco, to incur heavy losses
last year.
Two opposition deputies, who recently visited London and New York, have
demanded a probe into the part played by foreign brokers in the loss of up
to Dollars 270m.
An investigation in London could be mounted by the London Metal Exchange,
Serious Fraud Office or Securities and Investment Board, Mr Luis Valentin
Ferrada, one of the two deputies, said. His visit had 'established
indubitably that a foreign investigation was possible'.
He said that, if the Chilean government approached authorities in London, 'I
have absolutely no doubt' that proceedings could begin. It was in London's
interests to 'protect the transparency and control of its market', he said.
Other commentators, however, thought it unlikely that proceedings would
start unless strong evidence of foul-play was produced. So far, little, if
any, has come to light.
Speculation about irregular transactions has resulted largely from
statements by Mr Jose Benquis, a Chilean judge, that of 8,000 futures
operations conducted in 1993, 400 were 'strange'.
Ernst &amp; Young, the British consultancy employed by Codelco to study the
case, told Reuters last week it 'had no direct evidence of any
irregularities'. It said yesterday that the investigation had 'moved on',
but it would be 'unhelpful' to comment further.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper supported after heavy
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Present conditions in the copper market were summed up by one analyst
yesterday who said: 'The only certainty is that it will be volatile'. He was
speaking at the end of a day when copper's price dropped by Dollars 60 a
tonne in early trading on the London Metal Exchange to its lowest level for
six weeks. But during the afternoon it regained virtually all the lost
ground.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the
sell-off came as no surprise because stocks were rising both in LME
warehouses and on the New York Commodity Exchange. However, the selling
yesterday was not heavy and the price refused to go below strong technical
support at Dollars 2,360 a tonne.
'Copper's fundamentals are not negative but they are neutral now,' he added.
'US economic growth is slowing, tightness in the US copper market is easing
and in Europe many fabricators are on holiday this quarter. There probably
will be a small supply surplus this quarter compared with the big deficit in
the first half. That is showing up in stock levels.'
Selling was triggered yesterday by a reported rise of 2,046 short tons in
Comex stocks. Then the LME reported its stocks had gone up - only by 250
tonnes but this was the first increase since March.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New York's two biggest futures exchanges officially merge today, creating a
single powerful commodities exchange that will be the world's largest. After
nearly a century as competitive and often quarrelsome neighbours, the New
York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and the Commodities Exchange (Comex),
become two divisions of a single exchange.
The merger, which was approved by members of the exchanges in April and by
regulators last month, is expected to lower the costs of operating the two
markets, where futures and options are traded in energy and metals, and
raise their competitive profiles.
Their combined volume for 1994 is projected at over 80m contracts.
Merger papers will be signed today, and some Dollars 82m will be paid out to
members of both exchanges within the next few weeks. Nymex's 816 members
will share a Dollars 22m bonus while Comex's 750 members will receive more
than Dollars 60m over the next five years.
After today's signing ceremony, exchange officials are expected to announce
their selection of a site in the New York area to house the combined
markets. The exchanges share cramped space in the World Trade Center, and
hope to move into a new building within three years.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten people were missing and feared dead after an explosion yesterday at the
giant Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, reports Reuter from Sydney.
The mine operator, Placer Pacific, said the blast was in the above-ground
explosive storage area of the mine and the missing workers were employees of
Dyno Wesfarmers, an Australian-Norwegian company that is contracted to run
the mine's explosives operations.
All operations at the mine, one of the biggest gold producers in the world,
were halted pending an investigation into the cause of the blast and damage
assessment.
The first explosion was reported to have been followed by a second blast
when a tank of chemicals caught fire, triggering shock-waves that caused
some structural damage to an accommodation block, a truck servicing bay area
and another on-site building. Up to 200 non-essential staff were being
evacuated from the mine back to their villages or to Port Moresby.
Porgera had a total workforce of 1,800 in June this year, of which 350 were
expatriates.
The mine, which began production in 1990, is owned equally by Placer,
Highlands Gold, Renison Goldfields Consolidated and the PNG government. In
1993 it produced 1.16m troy ounces of gold.

FT  03 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Mixed reaction to fall in US housing sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday in spite of news of a sharp
contraction in the housing sector.
At the close, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 86
5/16 , with the yield rising to 7.397 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 5.956 per cent.
The initial reaction to the day's economic data was decidedly positive.
Bonds across the spectrum pushed solidly higher after the Commerce
Department announced that sales of new single-family homes had slumped 14.1
per cent in June to an annualised rate of 591,000, the lowest level in two
years. Analysts had expected a more modest decline to an rate of 700,000
homes.
Most economists agreed that the downturn was powerful evidence of the impact
of the Federal Reserve's moves to tighten credit conditions in the first
half. The report therefore supported a scenario which sees the central bank
delaying its next move to lift interest rates. At the same time, the
development reassured fixed-rate investors that the economy was slowing
enough to allay fears of inflation.
The market failed to sustain its forward momentum, with many retail accounts
hesitant to assume new positions ahead of Friday's critical data on
employment. As a result, the early gains evaporated, leaving bond prices
near their opening values.
Later in the session, the long end of the yield curve dipped into negative
territory, as the Johnson Redbook Service reported retail sales last month
had risen 0.3 per cent from June's level.
UK gilts gained nearly two points at the long end of the yield curve,
cheered by the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report in which the
Bank indicated that inflation pressures remain subdued.
After rallying throughout the morning, partly on Japanese buying overnight,
gilt prices received another lift from the report, which was released in the
afternoon. The long September gilt futures contract on Liffe rose two point
to 103 9/16 .
The long end of the market was further supported by technical factors in the
futures market, where the break of resistance around 102 on the September
contract triggered further buying, traders said. Moreover, dealers reported
purchases by overseas investors, notably in east Asia and the US.
Italian bonds also staged a recovery, boosted by heavy switching out of
Spanish bonds and a general improvement in market sentiment.
'Prime Minister Berlusconi's decision to address the conflict of interest
between his business and political interests has led to a general
improvement in sentiment,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at
Midland Global Markets.
The September BTP future on Liffe was up 1.21 point at 102.61 in late
dealings.
French bonds rose in largely futures-led dealings, with the September
notional bond future on Matif gaining 0.80 point to close at 118.06.
However, some of those gains may be erased as traders start building up
short positions ahead of Thursday's monthly bond auction.
The Treasury will auction between FFr19bn and FFr21bn 6.75 per cent bonds
due 2004, 8.5 per cent bonds due 2008 and 6 per cent bonds due 2025.
German bonds also firmed, with the September bund future on Liffe rising by
0.36 point to 94.16. However, traders said these were not backed by cash
buying from investors.
Germany's debt liquidation fund (Kreditabwicklungsfonds) today will sell
one-year zero-coupon paper via the Bundesbank. 'With the advent of money
market funds in Germany, the issue should go quite well,' said a bund
dealer.

Canadian Pacific, the transport, resources, hotel and property group, posted
net profit in the second quarter to June of CDollars 110.5m (USDollars 80m),
up from CDollars 29.6m a year earlier.
Including special items, final net profit was CDollars 198.4m, or 60 cents a
share, against CDollars 12m, or 3 cents. Consolidated revenues from
continuing operations were CDollars 1.9bn, against CDollars 1.65bn.
First-half final net profit was CDollars 215.6m, or 65 cents, against
CDollars 33.7m, or 10 cents, on revenues of CDollars 3.5bn against CDollars
3.13bn. The first quarter was adversely affected by the severe winter, but
second-quarter results were better than most analysts had estimated.
The half-year included a positive CDollars 9.5m contribution from Laidlaw,
the waste management group, against a negative CDollars 5.8m. However,
telecommunications losses were up sharply.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: American General launches
Dollars 2.6bn bid for Unitrin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American General, the life insurance and financial services group, yesterday
unveiled a hostile, Dollars 2.6bn cash bid for Unitrin, the health and
property/casualty insurance group.
The offer is the second big hostile bid in the US insurance industry this
year, following an unsuccessful attempt by GE Capital to acquire Kemper
earlier this year.
American General said it had proposed three weeks ago paying Dollars 50 3/8
a share for Unitrin, but that its offer had been turned down by the
company's board on July 26. It added that it might increase the offer if
Unitrin could show it was worth more 'in the course of due diligence and
negotiation'. Unitrin's shares closed at Dollars 39 3/4 yesterday, before
the offer was disclosed.
The announcement echoes the GE Capital bid for Kemper, which was only made
public after Kemper had rebuffed a private offer. That announcement
eventually flushed out a higher bid from Conseco, another insurance group.
Unitrin, which last year had revenues of Dollars 1.3bn, was spun off from
Teledyne, the manufacturing group, in 1990.
American General said it believed the company, which has shareholders'
capital of Dollars 2bn and assets of Dollars 4.8bn, was overcapitalised by
Dollars 1.4bn. Releasing this capital would bring down the cost of the
acquisition substantially.
American General said its offer would be open until September 16.

property deal

<TEXT>
Rodamco, the international property arm of Robeco Group, the Dutch pension
fund, has acquired two of Spain's largest shopping centres in a Pta12bn
(Dollars 92m) deal.
The Dutch group bought Parque Sur, a 110 sq metre complex in Madrid, and
Bahia Sur, a 57 sq metre retail area outside Cadiz. The price could rise to
Pta15bn if post-purchase financial criteria are met. The centres were
launched by Parques Urbanos, a domestic developer that collapsed last year,
and were owned by Banco Exterior, part of the Argentaria banking group.
The acquisition was viewed as a turning point in Spain's slack property
sector and as an indicator that domestic consumption was ready to pick up
strongly.
Spain's biggest shopping centre, La Vaguada in north Madrid, which is valued
at close to Pta12bn, is poised to change hands under the terms of a
pre-contract signed between its owners, Compagnie Financiere de Suez, and
Arc Union-Unibail, the French investment group.
Rodamco's entry into the Spanish retail market follows its purchase of a
shopping centre in Cottbus, eastern Germany.

<TEXT>
The traditional roles of drug industry and biotechnology company were
reversed yesterday by US companies Bristol-Myers Squibb and Cephalon.
Bristol-Myers, the second largest US drug company, is to share marketing
rights on one of its drugs with Pennsylvania brain specialist Cephalon.
Normally, the research strength of biotechnology creates drugs but not
marketing expertise and it is the biotech side that seeks marketing partners
in the pharmaceuticals sector.
Under a renewable three-year agreement, the two companies will enter into an
income-sharing agreement based on increased sales of a painkiller, Stadol
NS, in the neurology market.
Cephalon will recruit a salesforce dedicated to selling Stadol NS in a nasal
spray for the treatment of migraine headaches and other kinds of pain.
That salesforce would then be in place to sell Cephalon's products after
their approval by regulatory authorities in 1996 at the earliest.

Australian National Industries, the Sydney-based engineering company which
owns the Aurora group in the UK, yesterday announced a ADollars 191m
(USDollars 140.4m) bid for Palmer Tube Mills, another quoted Australian
company which manufactures steel tube and pipe sections.
ANI is offering either all-paper terms, or a mixture of shares and cash.
Shareholders can choose 72 ANI shares for every 100 Palmer shares held, or
64 ANI shares and ADollars 13 cash for every 100 shares.
In order to meet the potential cash element of the bid, ANI is to place 32m
new shares at ADollars 1.80 each, raising ADollars 57m.
Explaining the reasons for the bid, ANI said that the two companies had
'compatible' interests in the steel production area, and that ANI's
resources and technical know-how could enhance Palmer's performance.
However, Palmer responded coolly, saying that ANI had raised the bid
possibility in recent discussions between the two companies.
'Now that the offer has been made, the board will give consideration to it,'
the company said.
Palmer's operations are split between Australia and the US, and it employs
250 and 290 people in the two countries respectively.
Its sales in the nine months to the end of March were ADollars 235.7m,
compared with ANI's ADollars 1.1bn for the same period. Palmer's main plants
are in Brisbane, Melbourne and Chicago.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Foreign banks gain entry to
Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty foreign banks plan to open up subsidiaries in Mexico this year.
Mexico agreed to open up its banking sector under the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Initially foreign banks are limited to holding 8 per cent
of the sector's total capital, although this limit is increased to 15 per
cent by 1999, and then abolished. Under Nafta rules, all banks not from the
US or Canada have to apply through US or Canadian subsidiaries.
Each bank is limited to 1.5 per cent of the banking capital and, like
Mexican banks, has to make a minimum capital payment of 60m pesos (Dollars
17.6m). Finance ministry officials said last week that only a minority of
banks would apply for the maximum permitted market share.
The government hopes competition from foreign banks will reduce margins
earned by domestic banks, and put pressure on interest rates. Foreign banks
are expected to target the corporate rather than consumer sector.
US banks formed the majority of those that applied together with French,
Spanish, German and Japanese banks. No UK bank applied, to the Mexican
government's surprise.
The banks that sought authorisation are: Bank of Boston, Morgan Stanley,
Bank of Tokyo, Banque National de Paris, Citibank, Chemical Bank, Bank of
America, Chase Manhattan, First Chicago Bank, International Bank of
Commerce, J. P. Morgan, NationsBank, Republic National Bank of New York,
ABM/Amro Bank, Banco de Santander, Societe Generale, American Express, Fuji
Bank, ING Capital Holdings and Dresdner Bank.
They will be the first to offer full services in Mexico, with the exception
of Citibank. Finance ministry officials have said that the banks should
receive authorisation in a month or so, and be operating by the end of the
year.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National lifts offering on a
quiet day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A brisk flow of mainly small offerings in the eurobond market yesterday
failed to stimulate much buying interest.
However, the recent tightening of yield spreads in the secondary market
boosted interest in the latest eurolira offering, a L300bn three-year deal
for Abbey National Treasury Services, increased from an initial L150bn.
Because eurobonds have lagged the sharp falls in Italian government bond
prices, many are now trading at 50-80 basis points below Libor in the
secondary market. The new Abbey deal, priced to yield the equivalent of five
basis points below Libor, appeared attractive relative to secondary Abbey
paper trading at 50 basis points below Libor. However, if the underlying
market rallies it is likely that secondary market spreads will widen.
In the D-Mark sector, the European Investment Bank launched a DM750m
six-year deal via Dresdner Bank, designed to avoid the overcrowded five-year
area, where several recent deals have failed to clear.
The pricing of the deal, to yield one basis point less than German
government bonds and five basis points less than German domestic bonds,
discouraged participation by domestic investors. However, international
accounts also look at spreads relative to Libor, and the spread of 7 basis
points below Libor appeared relatively attractive.
In the euroyen market, Sweden is widely rumoured to be preparing a Y100bn 2
1/2 -year offering via Nomura. Nomura said a transaction was being
discussed, but no final terms or timing had been set.
Poland plans to set a Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m eurobond early next year,
Reuter reports. A Polish official said the dollar-denominated bond was
likely to be fixed-interest paper, maturing in three or five years and with
semi-annual coupon payments.
He said the eurobond issue would serve as a benchmark for future borrowing
and help establish Poland's position on international financial markets.
The finance ministry was waiting for the outcome of Poland's negotiations
with its commercial banking creditors before setting terms, he added.

<TEXT>
Spain's Banco Santander, which in May acquired the loss-making Banesto group
for more than Dollars 2bn, received an important credit boost yesterday when
Standard and Poor's, the US rating agency, left the bank's short-term debt
and commercial paper qualification unchanged at an A1 plus rating.
Standard and Poor's, which had placed Santander on credit watch after the
Banesto takeover, nevertheless marginally lowered the bank's long-term debt
rating to AA minus.
In a more surprising move, Banesto, which will consolidate with Santander
after next month, has been upgraded to A1 from A3 for commercial paper
following its acquisition.
The US rating agency said the lowered rating 'related solely to the
acquisition of Banesto'.
IBCA, the London-based agency, meanwhile, lowered Banco Central Hispano for
the second time in the past year, reducing its long-term rating from A plus
to A and its individual rating from B/C to C.

Agco, the US farm machinery company which recently acquired Massey Ferguson,
reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 21.7m, or Dollars 1.53 a
share, on sales of Dollars 226m, up sharply from year-ago earnings of
Dollars 13.6m, or Dollars 1.18, on sales of Dollars 152m, writes Laurie
Morse in Chicago.
For the first six months of the year, Agco earned Dollars 36m or Dollars
2.56 a share, on sales of Dollars 405m, up from Dollars 18m or Dollars 1.87
a share on sales of Dollars 255m.
Cost-cutting and sales volume generated by Agco's acquisition of White-New
Idea, a US equipment maker, helped the result. Its Dollars 329m purchase of
Massey Ferguson's European operations did not close until June 29, so
second-quarter results reflect only one day of Massey's results.

to foreign firms

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's finance ministry is expected to give approval soon to more than 100
applications from foreign financial institutions to open up subsidiaries
this year.
The institutions, which include banks, brokerages, 'non-banks', insurance,
factoring and leasing firms, are permitted into Mexico under the terms of
the North America Free Trade Agreement, which opens up gradually Mexico's
financial sector. Non-US and Canadian banks have to apply through their
North American subsidiaries.
The finance ministry said it had received applications for 20 banks, 17
brokerages, 13 insurance companies, 17 non-banks, 12 leasing companies, and
four factoring businesses, among others, before the July 31 deadline.
Officials said barring unforeseen problems, all applications would be given
authorisation, and should be operating by the end of the year.
'This is much better than we expected,' said Mr Guillermo Ortiz, deputy
finance minister. 'This is an enormous sign of confidence just two weeks
before the election in a period of unusual political instability.' The
foreign groups will initially invest about 9.329bn pesos (Dollars 2.74bn),
and lend in the first year 11.024bn pesos, according to the government.
In the brokerage sector, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan,
Citibank, Chemical Bank, Morgan Stanley, Bankers Trust, Lehman Brothers,
Deutsche Bank, Continental Bank, ING Capital Holdings, Indosuez, Santander,
Swiss Bank, James Capel and Baring Brothers have applied. Some, such as J.
P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Santander, ING, and Chemical bank also
applied for banks.
Mr Ortiz said the 17 brokerages had applied for more than the initial limit
of 10 per cent of the sector's capital, and some scaling back of offers was
possible.
In the non-bank sector, US organisations dominated, with Ford Credit, GE
Capital, Chrysler, General Motors, Caterpillar, IBM Credit Corporation,
Associates Corporation of North America among those submitting applications.

Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA), which is seeking a strategic partner to replace
Air France, posted losses of Kcs273.2m (Dollars 9.75m) in the first six
months of this year, writes Vincent Boland in Prague.
This is less than half the deficit in the same period last year, when CSA
lost Kcs629m. The airline said improved revenues from domestic and
international ticket sales and tightly controlled costs, held to 1993
levels, contributed to the better performance.
Passenger numbers in-creased and seating capacity rose to 59.2 per cent from
53.6 per cent, with routes to western Europe showing a 10 per cent increase
in capacity.
CSA is in talks with several international airlines on strategic
co-operation.

co-operation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Qantas, the Australian airline, and British Airways, which holds a 25 per
cent interest in the federally-owned carrier, have agreed to step up
'co-operation' on services between Australia and the UK.
This effectively ends the companies' half-decade of competition on the
'Kangaroo route'. The airlines conceded yesterday the changes were partly
designed 'to increase our return on assets'. While the route has been a
flagship service for Qantas, it has rarely made money.
The airlines said yesterday that, under the new arrangements, they would
operate five daily services between Australia and Europe, three of which
would be flown by Qantas and two by BA.
Qantas will operate twice-daily services linking Sydney and Melbourne with
London. Five times a week, it will also fly between Sydney and Frankfurt,
extending to Paris on three days. Twice a week, it will fly between Sydney
and Rome.
BA will operate twice-daily services between London and Perth, and
London-Sydney.
Yesterday's announcement represents the most significant operational change
instigated by the companies since BA acquired its stake in Qantas for
ADollars 665m (USDollars 493m) last year.
The plans require approval from Australia's Trade Practices Commission, the
competition watchdog.

<TEXT>
Bangchak Petroleum (BCP), the first oil refiner and distributor to be listed
on the Stock Exchange of Thailand as part of the country's privatisation
programme, was valued at Bt25.32bn (Dollars 1bn) on the first day of trading
in the shares yesterday.
BCP shares closed at Bt48.50, bettering the initial public offering price of
Bt31 but falling from yesterday's high of Bt57 after disappointing
second-quarter results.
After the flotation, 20 per cent of the shares are held by local and foreign
investors, but the government retains control of the company: the finance
ministry has 48 per cent, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand 24 per cent
and Krung Thai Bank 8 per cent.
BCP recently expanded capacity at its refinery in Bangkok to 120,000 barrels
a day from 80,000 b/d and is investing aggressively in retail outlets around
the country.
BCP's latest financial results, however, disappointed investors. Figures
released yesterday showed that net profit rose only 6.8 per cent to Bt352.7m
in the first half of this year from Bt330.4m a year ago.
Stockbrokers blamed heavy interest payments relating to BCP's expansion
programme for the lacklustre performance, and said the cash from the initial
public offering should reduce debt for the rest of the year.
Second-quarter net profit rose to Bt171.7m this year from Bt136.2m a year
earlier, suggesting that the company's forecast of more than Bt830m in net
profit for the whole year will be attainable only if net earnings improve
sharply in the third and fourth quarters.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investors switch on to star of
Chinese TV - Television Broadcasts is more than just a popular network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television Broadcasts (TVB) is viewed as not only an excellent portfolio
investment - with earnings per share forecast to grow by 15 per cent for the
next three years and a balance sheet clean of debt - but also the best
vehicle for a foreign media company to ride the expected growth in Asian
media during the coming decades.
This explains why Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Time Warner, the
US media group, have both looked at taking an equity interest in the Hong
Kong broadcaster.
Mr Murdoch opted instead for control of Star Television, the Hong Kong based
satellite-TV network, rather than partnership with TVB, while Time Warner
seems likely to seek an alliance with TVB in its satellite operations,
according to industry executives. They say Time Warner could not afford the
entry price for an equity stake.
This week it was revealed that Pearson, the UK media and entertainments
group whose interests include the Financial Times, has been in discussions
with TVB shareholders - Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok owns 24.5 per
cent of the company - for some months.
Talks about the possible Pounds 150m (Dollars 98m) purchase of up to 10 per
cent of TVB have reached an advanced stage, although Pearson has declined to
comment beyond confirming that talks have taken place.
If Pearson can clinch the deal it will be in a position where, through its
joint venture with the British Broadcasting Corporation and its stake in
TVB, it partners the world's largest producers of English-language and
Chinese-language television programmes.
The key difference with the BBC venture, however, is that TVB is an
investment that pays dividends from day one.
TVB's strength rests on its stranglehold of Hong Kong's television market,
where it enjoys a 72 per cent share of the audience. The station maintains
this enviable position by producing original television drama, soap operas
and comedy with home-grown 'stars' who are tied to its studio.
Its penetration into southern China has become a particular attraction to
advertisers in both Hong Kong and China.
Products are often advertised on TVB which are available only to consumers
on the mainland.
The audience in southern China - from Shenzhen to Guangzhou - is estimated
at some 3m. But it has the potential to grow, given that the population of
the Pearl River Delta is more than 25m.
Revenues from Hong Kong accounted for 80 to 85 per cent of pre-tax profits
of HKDollars 591m (USDollars 76.5m) in 1993 and are expected to underpin the
company's financial performance for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax and
operating margins are strong, at around 30 per cent last year.
Analysts believe that TVB's position in Hong Kong is secure, even with the
increased competition that has come from cable-TV, through Wharf Cable, and
Mr Murdoch's Star TV.
Wharf Cable delivers 11 channels in Cantonese, the predominant dialect in
Hong Kong, but suffers from poor programming. Star TV is not permitted to
broadcast in Cantonese until 1996.
TVB's strength in programming - it produces about 5,000 hours of television
drama, soap operas and comedy a year - is also one of its most important
assets and the secret to its future.
It is the region's largest and most efficient producer of Chinese-language
television.
In a region where TV capacity is being added by new, high-powered satellites
almost daily, it is the programming, or software, provider that stands to
win the most.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, estimates that TVB has a library
of useable material of between 25,000 and 35,000 hours. Industry executives
say the figure is nearer 40,000 hours from the company's library of 70,000
hours of programmes.
'Excess demand for programming is becoming chronic,' said Ms Helena Coles,
media analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
'TVB is the most obvious beneficiary.'
The company dubs its Cantonese programmes into Cambodian, Mandarin, Thai,
Vietnamese, Korean and Malay. It may soon go into Indonesia as well, where
it has a promising venture with the Salim group, Indonesia's largest
Chinese-owned group, in a local television station.
The company's main strategy, however, is to exploit its dominance in
Chinese-language programming.
In Taiwan, it has 62 per cent of a joint venture with Fu Long, that
country's leading production house, which makes several hundred hours of
talk shows and comedies for broadcast on its Mandarin satellite channel.
TVB also has satellite ambitions. Since September last year it has broadcast
via satellite to most of Taiwan's cable-TV providers. The company is keen,
however, to develop its Galaxy satellite-TV network.
It is expected to announce soon the launch of Galaxy, which will bring
together the Mandarin channel now seen in Taiwan, a TVB movie channel,
western films through Home Box Office, a children's TV channel from Time
Warner and possibly others.
While Galaxy plans to use the Apstar 1 satellite, it is unclear whether the
problems with its position in space will affect the network unduly.
In any event, it has a back-up on PanamSat which is due for launch next
year.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Earnings warning hits Newbridge
Networks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Newbridge Networks, until recently one of North America's best-performing
technology companies, saw its share value drop almost a third yesterday
after the company warned that first-quarter earnings would not match
analysts' expectations.
Ottawa-based Newbridge has emerged as a leader in the development of
asynchronous mode transmission (ATM) switches and frame relay equipment.
These products are a crucial link in the rapidly growing transfer of
interactive information across telephone lines and computer networks.
Newbridge claims to have captured about half the North American market for
ATM wide-area network switches. Its customers include phone companies,
government agencies and universities.
Newbridge shares tumbled CDollars 17.87 to close at CDollars 40.38 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. They reached a peak of CDollars 97.50 a year ago,
but have gradually lost ground in line with investors' general disillusion
with the high-technology sector, and concerns that Newbridge's share price
exaggerated its earnings potential. At its peak, the share price was equal
to more than 60 times earnings.
The share-price shake-out follows Newbridge's announcement that earnings for
the three months ended July would fall short of the 41 US cents a share
posted in the preceding three months. However, the company said that
earnings for the quarter - to be published on August 23 - would be higher
than last year's first-quarter of 30 cents a share.
Revenues, orders and an end of quarter backlog have broken records but have
been offset by higher expenses. The jump in expenses was ascribed to
expanded research and development staffing and a 'very busy' trade show and
advertising programme.
Mr Terry Matthews, chief executive and Newbridge's largest single
shareholder, is no stranger to the vicissitudes of North American
high-technology companies. He was a co-founder in the 1970s of Mitel
Corporation, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, which enjoyed a period
of rapid growth but suffered severe financial problems in the late 1980s.
Mr Matthews left Mitel in 1986, shortly after British Telecommunications
bought a controlling stake. He joined Newbridge shortly afterwards. BT sold
its Mitel shares at a heavy loss in mid-1992.
Newbridge's sales have more than quadrupled in the past four years. Wood
Gundy, the Canadian investment house, recently estimated fiscal 1994 sales
at USDollars 547m. Although the growth rate is expected to slow, Wood Gundy
said annual demand for its advanced network systems would grow by at least
40 per cent over the next two years.

half

<TEXT>
Net earnings at the Hugo Boss male fashion group rose 17 per cent to DM26.4m
(Dollars 16.5m) in the first half of the current year, the company said
yesterday.
The result, bolstered by increased income from licences, was achieved in
spite of a 4 per cent decline in turnover to DM395m. Margins have been
helped by increased production outside Germany.
The company recently closed one of its three remaining German plants, moving
production to cheaper suppliers, mainly in eastern Europe.
German sales, affected by shrinking real incomes, fell 8 per cent to DM160m,
and there was a similar fall elsewhere in Europe to DM128m.
However, the Americas saw turnover rise 6 per cent to DM85m, and there was a
marked increase in Asia, the company said.
Boss, which last year recorded record earnings of DM76.5m due to exceptional
items and a one-off tax break worth a total of about DM28m, said full-year
earnings this time would be slightly under 1993's underlying profits of
DM48.6m.
The company said it expected turnover to increase slightly as international
economic prospects brightened, and to end the year at around the DM846m
recorded in 1993.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bond losses and R&amp;D costs take
toll on Hafslund

<TEXT>
Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian pharmaceuticals and energy group, saw
first-half pre-tax profits fall to NKr651m (Dollars 92m) from NKr782m after
bond losses and higher research and development costs.
However, the group is sticking to an earlier forecast that pre-tax profits
for the full year would match last year's NKr1.57bn.
This is in spite of the threat of higher interest costs in the second half,
following the group's June decision to buy the diagnostic imaging business
of US-based Sterling Winthrop for Dollars 450m. The acquisition will make
Hafslund the world leader in the diagnostic imaging field.
The deterioration in the group's financial performance was the main reason
for the first-half downturn, although operating profits were slightly lower,
at NKr728m compared with NKr741m.
There was a net financial loss for the period of NKr73m, after a NKr42m gain
in 1993. Losses on bonds restricted overall income on the company's
securities portfolio to NKr3m, down from NKr115m in 1993.
Operating revenues rose to NKr3.50bn from NKr3.15bn, while operating profit
before before research and development costs was NKr1.11bn, against
NKr1.10bn. Research and development rose to NKr386m from NKr361m.
Nycomed Imaging saw operating profits before research costs fall to NKr736m
from NKr806m, as revenues tumbled to NKr1.21bn from NKr1.28bn. Bulk sales of
iohexol to licensees were 15 per cent lower, due to cyclical variations in
sales patterns and general price pressure in the US.
By contrast, there was a strong performance from Nycomed Pharma, where
operating profits before research and development costs rose to NKr305m from
NKr241m, helped by cost-cutting.
Hafslund Energi, benefiting from higher trading activity, increased
operating profits to NKr116m from NKr108m.

FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pargesa emerges from the gloom
under a new guise - The Swiss group's investment strategy is now
concentrated on francophone Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pargesa, the large Swiss investment group controlled by Mr Albert Frere, the
Belgian financier, and Canada's Mr Paul Desmarais, has emerged from nearly
four years of purdah following the noisy departure of Mr Gerard Eskenazi,
former chairman, in 1990.
Today's Pargesa bears little resemblance to the high-flying financial and
industrial combine of the 1980s with stakes in Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
failed US junk bond specialist, and Henry Ansbacher, the ill-starred UK
merchant bank, and a plethora of other companies in sectors from tobacco to
railway sleeping carriages.
The new Pargesa, according to Mr Aimery Langlois-Meurinne, chief executive,
is concentrating on 10 industrial and financial holdings in francophone
Europe. The most important are CLT Multimedia, owner of the RTL television
and radio networks, and Petrofina, the Belgian oil group.
It aims to hold and exert strategic control over its investments rather than
have an uncertain influence with smallish minority stakes.
The idea is to convince investors that Pargesa is a value-adding corporate
governor for the long term, worthy of a better fate than having its shares
trade at a 25 per cent discount off net asset value.
All this is a long way from the secretive group that was set up in Geneva in
1981 by Mr Eskenazi, then deputy managing director of Compagnie Financiere
de Paribas, and Mr Frere to prevent the Swiss and Belgian subsidiaries of
Paribas from being nationalised by the French government.
Within a few months of its launch, Pargesa pulled off its most important
coup, buying a blocking minority position in the venerable Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert of Belgium for BFr2.6bn (Dollars 77.4m). GBL's main holdings -
Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Petrofina, the Tractebel electric utility, CLT and
Royale Belge, the insurer - remain among Pargesa's core assets.
Through the 1980s, Pargesa expanded rapidly, with Mr Frere following
industrial opportunities, mainly in Belgium, and Mr Eskenazi buying up banks
in Luxembourg, the UK and the US. By 1989, the group had consolidated equity
of SFr1.9bn (Dollars 1.4bn).
Tensions developed as Mr Eskenazi, who dreamed of creating an international
federation of banks, tried to associate Pargesa more closely with the
re-privatised Paribas. Mr Frere and Mr Desmarais, who had been brought in as
a core investor in Pargesa in 1982 by Mr Eskenazi, saw their influence would
wither under such a scheme. So they joined forces, raised their combined
stake to more than 50 per cent and pushed Mr Eskenazi out.
Since then, all Pargesa's bank holdings have been sold, with the notable
exceptions of Paribas and Banque Bruxelles Lambert (although BBL was the
subject of a failed bid by ING of Holland last year).
Investments in the French Schneider electrical engineering group, in
Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits and Rinsoz &amp; Ormond Tabacs have
gone.
On the other hand, Pargesa's stakes in GBL and its French and Swiss
sub-holding companies have been raised to effective controlling levels, and
last year the group purchased a 6 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the
French packaging group.
Mr Langlois-Meurinne concedes the group's portfolio has no sectoral logic,
but neither is Pargesa a traditional conglomerate in that it will not shift
resources from one subsidiary to another. He would not like the number of
core holdings to be much larger than 10. Geographically, Pargesa has pulled
in its wings from the US and the UK. 'We are trying to understand Germany
and German-speaking Switzerland, but we start from a low base,' he said.
Mr Heinrich-Horst Wiemer, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Zurich, says many
of Pargesa's holdings are structured in the French style, reflecting complex
alliances that are difficult for outsiders to appreciate fully. For example,
the controlling 52.4 per cent stake in Royale Belge is held jointly by GBL
and UAP, the French insurance group.
To help keep relations with UAP sweet, Pargesa joined the group of core
investors when the insurer was privatised last year, buying a 2.2 per cent
stake for over FFr1bn.
In another series of links, Paribas still holds 15 per cent of Pargesa and
Pargesa holds 5 per cent of Paribas. Meanwhile, Paribas and UAP both have
stakes in CLT.
It is still too early to judge the performance of the new Pargesa. Net
earnings have been on a downward trend, to SFr159.4m last year from a 1990
peak of SFr197.9m. But this is due to the decline in capital gains from
disposals.
Aggregate earnings of core holdings have been rising briskly, as has the net
asset value - now just above SFr2,000 per share compared with SFr1,483 at
the end of 1990. Investors have long appreciated Pargesa's high dividend
payout ratio, and Mr Langlois-Meurinne says this will continue.
There has been nervousness about the possibility that Mr Frere and Mr
Desmarais, both aggressive entrepreneurs, might steer Pargesa too closely
towards their other interests. Mr Langlois-Meurinne notes that a few
institutional shareholders have acquired significant minority stakes, and Mr
Desmarais and Mr Frere know they are being watched carefully.
The Public Institution for Social Security of Kuwait has 5 per cent and the
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, the Caisse des Depot et
Placements du Quebec, and a large UK pension fund each have 3 per cent.
Individual investors should look at the rollercoaster ride of Pargesa in the
past decade. The shares peaked in 1987 at SFr2,426 then more than halved in
the autumn crash of that year. After climbing back to SFr1,900 in early
1990, they plunged again in the wake of the Drexel collapse and Mr
Eskenazi's departure to a low of SFr889 in early 1991. They began to recover
late in 1992 and have been on a rising trend ever since.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Crown Eyeglass shares improve on 25%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crown Eyeglass saw its shares jump 20p to 185p after the USM-quoted maker of
spectacles and reading glasses reported profits up 25 per cent for the year
to March 31.
Turnover climbed 47 per cent to Pounds 5.51m and while some margin was
sacrificed by way of special promotions, pre-tax profits reached a record
Pounds 530,000 (Pounds 423,000). With tax returning to a more normal level,
earnings per share rose 46 per cent to 22.4p (15.3p).
Mr Joe Lee, chairman, cautioned however, that having regard to the
competitive trading climate in Crown's sector, it was prudent to expect less
dramatic growth this year than last. The recommended final dividend is 6.5p
for a total of 9.5p (7p).
Mr Lee said Crown intended to continue its development through an ongoing
expansion programme, which would involve opening additional optical centres
in the UK and Sweden.
In the UK, four new optical centres opened in the second half bringing the
total of new outlets for the year to seven.
In Sweden, Crown's Direkt Optik offshoot had continued to expand and
accounted for 24 per cent of group turnover for the year. Crown now had five
Swedish optical centres and negotiations for three more were currently
taking place.
At the year end, group net assets stood at Pounds 1.49m, including cash of
Pounds 460,000.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CLT to let Chiltern bid lapse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLT, the European broadcaster, has decided to let its recommended cash offer
for Chiltern Radio lapse.
CLT blamed the consolidation of Chiltern's shareholder base. More than 50
per cent is now held by Daily Mail and General Trust and its associate,
European Media Associates, GWR and Capital Radio.
The Takeover Panel recently dismissed an appeal by Chiltern that DMGT, GWR
and Capital were acting in concert to obtain control.
Mr Peter Burton, chairman of Chiltern, said: 'The board is very concerned
that, as a result of the panel's decision, (DMGT, GWR and Capital) will
continue to hold the majority of shares in Chiltern Radio without the
minority shareholders being offered the 300p per share which DMGT and GWR
were prepared to pay to secure their stakes.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Spider Systems jumps 25% to Pounds 719,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spider Systems, the Edinburgh-based company which makes products and
software for communication between computers, increased pre-tax profits by
25 per cent, from Pounds 575,000 to Pounds 719,000, in the year to March 31.
Turnover rose from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 21m, an increase of 22 per cent.
Mr Martin Ritchie, managing director, said the improvement had been achieved
in a year when much of the company's resources had been concentrated on its
Spiderintegrator, which it said was the first device of its kind able to
choose the cheapest route for communications between computers. It was
launched in April.
Orders taken for the Spiderintegrator in the first quarter of 1994-95 had
exceeded forecasts and sales of its internetworking and communications
server business had risen 50 per cent.
Thanks partly to the Spiderintegrator, the company expects a 30 per cent
rise in turnover this year.
Spider's communications software and networking solutions businesses account
for 40 per cent of sales.
Mr Ritchie said that a Stock Exchange flotation was a 'possibility' as
Spider developed.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Lionheart fell 1 3/4 p to 7p yesterday after the Cheshire-based
manufacturer of paintbrushes and bathroom fittings, announced a boardroom
reshuffle and issued a profits warning.
The company said that its results for the first half of the current year
would be 'materially lower than anticipated' reflecting 'cautious and
erratic consumer demand'.
A recent review of operating expenses led to annualised savings of some
Pounds 2m, the company said, and a reduction of more than Pounds 400,000 in
annualised head office costs via a restructured board.
Mr David Railton, operations director, Mr David Kay, finance director and Mr
Michael Tuttle, a non-executive director, have all left the company; Mr Mark
Walker, previously financial controller, has been appointed group finance
director.
The consequent redundancy and restructuring costs will be charged to the
first half results. Albert E Sharp, the company's broker, revised its
interim profits estimate down from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 500,000 pre-tax and
anticipates a provision of about Pounds 700,000 to cover the costs.
In March, Lionheart announced a return to the black with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.77m for the 1993 year. Mr Paul Lever, chairman, said at that time
that an acquisition was likely 'within months'.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ewart consolidates its recovery with Pounds
1.13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ewart, the Belfast-based property company, continued the recovery seen at
the interim stage with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for the year to April
30, compared with losses of Pounds 155,721.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 4m to Pounds 5.9m, generating operating
profits of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 768,871). The pre-tax result was struck
after a Pounds 546,358 profit on the sale of investment properties and net
interest payable of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 924,592).
Mr Paul McWilliams, chairman, said further progress had been made on the
Laganbank development near Belfast city centre. Also, the first phase of the
retail development at Hamilton, Scotland, had been completed.
Proceeds from the sale of the retail investment in Newcastle upon Tyne had
been reinvested in an industrial property at Livingston, Scotland, and in a
retail warehouse north of Belfast, adding about Pounds 160,000 to the
company's rental base, Mr McWilliams said.
Earnings per share emerged at 5.21p (0.44p) and a proposed final dividend of
0.6p brings the total for the year to 1p (nil).
On July 25, dealings in Ewart shares began on the Dublin Stock Exchange.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals ahead 19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Chemicals, the dyes and specialist chemicals manufacturer,
shrugged off the effects of depressed prices and intense competition by
yesterday reporting a 19 per cent increase in half year profits.
The Leeds-based group saw pre-tax profits climb to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds
6.02m) as its heavy investment programme in new equipment and increased
capacity began to pay off.
The improvement - achieved on turnover of Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 55.6m) in the
six months to June 30 - prompted a 29p rise in the share price to 421p.
Mr Phillip Lowe, chairman, said the group had overcome fragile trading
conditions in the UK and continental Europe by 'producing and selling more
at lower price levels'.
More than Pounds 13m was spent last year to increase capacity, and Mr Lowe
said a further Pounds 12m would be invested before the current year end.
The investment programme, funded with cash left over from last year's Pounds
24.3m rights issue and banking facilities, is expected to centre on
Yorkshire Colours, the UK dyestuffs division, where the group plans to
increase capacity by 25 per cent.
Although the division increased turnover 8 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, price
cuts averaging 5 per cent left its operating profits virtually unchanged at
Pounds 3.82m.
That flat performance was offset by improved results at Yorkshire Speciality
Products - the tanning agents manufacturer - and Yorkshire Australia, the
overseas dyes sub-sidiary.
They proved more resilient to price pressures and increased operating
profits to Pounds 2.08m (Pounds 1.25m) and Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.36m)
respectively.
Operating profits fell, however, to Pounds 447,000 (Pounds 513,000) at
Yorkshire Americas after the group decided to withdraw its distribution
operations for US chemical manufacturers in favour of using its own
products.
Mr Lowe said there signs of an upturn in Europe and forecast steady growth
in Australia and the Asia Pacific region.
'We shall continue to offset the pressure on margins by further improvements
in efficiency, and by increased production and sales volumes,' Mr Lowe

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Vivat down after exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After an exceptional Pounds 1m charge to cover the closure costs of its
Marseilles distribution centre, pre-tax profits at Vivat Holdings fell from
Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.06m in the six months to end-June.
Turnover declined by 12 per cent to Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 38.3m).
The drop in sales was because of organisational difficulties at the jeans
manufacturer's French subsidiary, but was partly offset by good performances
in Belgium, Spain and the UK.
The company also recently became aware of a long-standing under-statement of
stock in its Tunisian subsidiary.
The Pounds 3.5m under-statement has been dealt with as a prior year
adjustment to reserves, and has had no effect on the profit and loss account
since 1990.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said 'further clarification of the
circumstances is being sought'.
Earnings per share were 1.3p (2.4p).

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Raglan launches Pounds 20m rights -
Property group to buy portfolio based in UK regional centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Raglan Properties, the development and investment company, yesterday
announced its second rights issue in nine months, to raise funds to pay for
the acquisition of a property portfolio valued at Pounds 96.7m.
Raglan is paying Pounds 30.8m for Letinvest, a subsidiary of SPP, the
Swedish Pension and life assurance company. It will also take on Pounds 70m
of long-term debenture stock and Pounds 17.2m of cash.
Raglan has undergone a complete transformation over the past 18 months,
including a share consolidation, financial restructuring, and new
management. The latest deal represents a threefold increase in its gross
assets.
The company is offering new shares at 32p, on a 3-for-4 basis, raising
Pounds 20.4m net of costs. The share price closed 1p lower yesterday at 36p.
In addition to Letinvest, Raglan is paying Pounds 6m for Melrose House, in
London's Savile Row.
Letinvest had a net asset value of Pounds 38.5m as at March 31, putting
Raglan's purchase price at a 20 per cent discount. However, the debenture
stock, which is listed in London and pays an 11.25 per cent yield, is to be
retained.
About 70 per cent of Letinvest's portfolio is based in regional centres,
including London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Cardiff. It has an even
spread between retail, office and industrial properties.
The purchase price is adjustable against the difference between the net
asset value at completion, and the Pounds 38.5m valuation.
The company estimates the deal will enhance its net assets, with a net asset
value per share of 38.5p after the purchase, against the current figure of
36p. In addition, it will provide a combined current rental income of Pounds
13.2m.
Raglan is already conducting negotiations for the sale of some of the
Letinvest properties, which would reduce gearing from its post-acquisition
level of 126 per cent.
COMMENT
Mr Alan Fosler, Raglan's chief executive, transformed Swire Pacific's
property arm into one of Hong Kong's most substantial property businesses,
and the latest Raglan deal will give him a chance to prove himself in the
UK. The rights are pitched at a 6.5p discount to net asset value, which
should attract a good take-up. But it will be the first real test for the
new management to see if Raglan can translate a highly mixed portfolio into
profits.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Newmarket Venture Capital, which has a portfolio of venture capital
investments in the UK and US, reported a fall in net asset value per share
to 58p at June 30 against 61p a year earlier.
At the December year-end the value was 62p.
The portfolio was adversely affected during the six months by a decline in
UK and US stock markets and a weakening of the dollar/sterling exchange
rate.
As already announced, the company is to be voluntarily wound up after the
annual meeting and the assets distributed to shareholders.
At June 30 net assets stood at Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 21.7m).

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Wateraccepts price set by Ofwat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Water yesterday became the eighth water and sewerage company to
accept the new price limits set by the industry regulator last week.
Mr Trevor Newton, managing director, said the decisions were 'acceptable,
and give us the headroom we were looking for to handle some of the risks'.
'We can now forget about managing the regulators and get on with managing
the business.'
Mr Newton said the company was already on track to beat the cost-cutting
targets set by the Office of Water Services. Yorkshire's management layers
had been reduced from seven to four, with a further two to be stripped out.
A further 400 jobs will go this year and the 10-strong board of the utility
division will be reduced by about half.
Yorkshire's acceptance leaves only Southern Water's position unclear,
although it is expected to accept the price limits. South West Water intends
to appeal against the regulator's decision.
Yorkshire will be allowed to increase prices annually by 2.5 per cent above
inflation between 1995 and 2000 - a formula known as the K factor. The
regulator has authorised capital spending to meet obligations of Pounds
1.5bn.
Sir Gordon Jones, Yorkshire's chairman, has repeated the board's opposition
to the appointment of Mrs Diana Scott, a former regulator, to the board of
the parent company. 'If she wants to look after the interests of the
customers the board of the plc is not the place to do it,' he said.

Two acquisitions helped Scott Pickford, the USM-quoted petroleum consultant,
more than double pre-tax profit and turnover for the year to March 31.
Pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 498,000 (Pounds 231,000), on turnover

The figures included an eight-month contribution from Gaps Geological

and enters Dollars 3.5bn market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elan Corporation, the Irish pharmaceutical company which moved up from the
USM with a capitalisation of Pounds 892m in November last year, turned in a
pre-tax profit of IPounds 9.44m (Pounds 9.25m) for the three months ended
June 30, up from IPounds 7.61m for the comparable period.
Turnover for the first quarter was ahead at IPounds 28.8m (IPounds 25.3m),
with the manufacturing and distribution side contributing IPounds 13.2m
(IPounds 12.8m). Revenues from contract development and royalties were down
from IPounds 11.2m to IPounds 7.74m, but license and option fees increased
sixfold to IPounds 7.79m.
Strong future growth is predicted for the company's multiple sclerosis and
anti-cancer products, said Mr Donald Panoz, chairman.
Earnings per share were 23 per cent ahead at 27p (22p). Elan is also listed
on the American Stock Exchange. It is classified as a growth stock and not
permitted to pay dividends.
Elan has received FDA clearance for its Panoject ambulatory infusion
devices, which provide continuous controlled delivery of drugs and
analgesics.
This positions the company to tackle home infusion, the fastest-growing
sector of the US health care industry.
This is a market currently estimated at Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.25bn),
rising to Dollars 16bn by 1997, driven by the emphasis on controlling health
care costs by providing therapy in patients' homes and out-patient
departments.
Elan also announced an agreement with Syntex, the US drugs company taken
over by Roche in May, to market Elan's once-daily formulation of
prescription naproxen in the US.
Naproxen was discovered by Syntex Research; Elan's formulation uses its
proprietary intestinal protective drug absorption system to provide
controlled release of the dosage. The drug will be sold by Syntex
Laboratories, a US affiliate of Syntex Pharmaceuticals International, which
will make milestone payments to Elan.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark in agreed bid for Milwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C&amp;J Clark, the family-owned shoe company, has made an offer, thought to be
worth about Pounds 10m, for Milwards, a privately-owned Reading-based
footwear retailer.
The move comes ahead of a possible flotation of Clark - perhaps as early as
next year. 'There is a growing momentum towards a commitment to an early
flotation,' a company source said.
Clark's offer has been unanimously recommended by the Milwards board.
Milwards runs a chain of 75 shops, mainly in the south of England, and in
the year to January 31 had sales of Pounds 24m.
Clark's intention is to invest Pounds 5m over the next two years in changing
some of the shops to the Clarks and K Shoes formats. Closure of several
sites is also expected.
'This development reflects the close and friendly relationships which have
existed between the two companies over many years,' Mr Roger Pedder, Clark's
chairman, said.
Last year, Clark shareholders narrowly threw out a Pounds 184m takeover bid
from Berisford International which led to the resignation of Mr Walter
Dickson as Clark's chairman.
In the year to January 31, Clark's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 121,000
to Pounds 20.8m on sales 5 per cent higher at Pounds 655.3m.
Clark is in talks with Mr Peter Bolliger, former managing director of
Harrods, about his joining the Somerset-based company. The job he is being
considered for is thought to be as general manager of K Shoes.

Protect

<TEXT>
Holmes Protection, the US security group which is quoted in the UK,
yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits, from Dollars 133,000
to Dollars 733,000 (Pounds 473,000) in the six months to June 30.
The group said its performance demonstrated continued improvement in spite
of a drop in half-year sales from Dollars 27m to Dollars 25.8m.
It attributed the progress to continuing steps taken to reduce operating
expenses.
Last month Sir Ian MacGregor, the former chairman of British Steel and
British Coal, resigned as chairman of Holmes.
This followed disagreements over a deal in which HP Partners, a US investor
group, injected Dollars 10m into the group in return for a 34 per cent
stake.
Mr Paul Douglas, a director for the past 19 months, succeeded as chairman of
Holmes, which plans to delist its shares in London and obtain a quotation on
the Nasdaq exchange in New York.
Earnings per share rose to 1.5 cents (0.1 cents). There is no interim
dividend.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Strategy of expansion through profitable
niches - Andrew Bolger looks at acquisitive MY Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A flurry of recent deals by MY Holdings marks the determination of this
small company to become a significant force in the UK's highly fragmented
specialist packaging sector.
The Surrey-based group this year more than doubled its size, and returned to
the main market from the USM, by paying up to Pounds 21m for Insight, a Kent
company which makes illustrated food cartons.
The Insight deal also marked a significant dilution of the controlling stake
in MY held by Malbak, the South African industrial conglomerate which was
recently unbundled from the Gencor mining group.
MY lost its listing on the main market in 1988 after Malbak took control of
the group, which at that time was still involved in making consumer goods
such as bicycles and dartboards.
Just as the South Africans took control, MY was hit by recession and higher
than expected factory relocation costs, which caused the company to lose
more than Pounds 2m in 1990.
New management was brought in that year in the shape of Mr John Grainger,
chairman, and Mr John Monks, chief executive. They had both held senior
management positions with Norton Opax, the specialist print and packaging
group which was bought by Bowater Industries in 1989 for Pounds 382m.
The new team completed a process of divesting MY's non-print and packaging
activities, and concentrated on cutting costs by improved financial and
management controls. Debt was cut and in the half-year to February, MY made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m on sales of Pounds 19.1m.
The Insight deal in February involved a Pounds 23m share placing which cut
Malbak's stake from 86 to 65 per cent. The South African group is willing to
see its stake diluted below the 50 per cent mark, as and when further
acquisitions are funded by the issue of more shares.
Mr Monks has tried to focus MY on higher-margin business in specific niches.
He said: 'We are a bespoke business - we make to order.'
The chief executive said Insight was the culmination of a two-year search
for the right strategic acquisition. Founded in 1981 by Mr Terry Neill, the
Gillingham-based business makes high-quality printed folding cartons, used
mainly by the food industry.
Insight claims to be market leader in those sectors where a rapid turnround
of orders and 'just-in-time' delivery of orders is required. The Gillingham
plant has the latest colour printing technology, computer-aided design and a
fully automated warehouse.
Mr Monks said the acquisition of Insight would both improve MY's
profitability and enhance its reputation as a niche player. Insight's
pre-tax profits nearly doubled, from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 2.04m, between
1990 and 1992, a period which saw sales rise from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds
12.09m. The enlarged group is forecast this year to make pre-tax profits of
at least Pounds 4m on sales in excess of Pounds 60m.
Healthcare is another area which MY has identified as offering high-margin
opportunities and last year it paid Pounds 1.3m for Kohler, a Portsmouth
company which makes pharmaceutical cartons. In May this year the group paid
Pounds 1.6m for two more businesses - Cleanprint, a Cambridgeshire company
which prints patient information leaflets, and Jensa, a Bedford-based
company licensed to pack pharmaceutical products.
Mr Monks said: 'We are experiencing strong growth in the healthcare
packaging market and these acquisitions will enable us to offer customers a
wider range of products and services . . . We are continuing to seek further
opportunities to offer other specialist products in this important sector.'
The enlarged MY now has more than 800 employees, working from 12 sites.
Although his group is dwarfed by companies such as Bowater, Mr Monks says
the UK packaging industry is very fragmented - with about 3,000 companies
operating in a market estimated to be worth Pounds 8.5bn annually.
In common with other packaging groups, MY has been suffering from margin
pressures - not least in its corrugated board packaging businesses, which
remain the largest in turnover terms. But the enthusiastic Mr Monks and his
team remain confident that their strategy of focusing on profitable niches
will pay off.
He said: 'We hope to have sales of about Pounds 200m in four years from now.
It would only take one more Pounds 25m deal, with a couple of small infill
acquisitions, to take us to the Pounds 100m level.'

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bank syndicate gears up to sell WPP shares
from September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The syndicate of banks which acquired shares in WPP, the marketing services
group, in a Dollars 271.6m debt-for-equity swap in 1992, is gearing up to
sell its interests from September.
WPP announced yesterday that conversion notices had been received from the
syndicate for 169.5m convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares.
These are expected to convert to 190.2m ordinary shares - equivalent to 26.5
per cent of the enlarged ordinary share capital. The group said the shares
could be sold from September 1.
The bank syndicate has appointed a consortium made up of Bankers Trust
International, JP Morgan Securities, and SG Warburg Securities to dispose of
the new ordinary shares. The consortium said the number of shares to be sold
will probably not be decided until nearer the sale date.
A series of presentations by WPP management to investment institutions in
the UK and continental Europe will be made during August, following the
group's interim results.
The deal struck in July 1992 stated that members of the syndicate could sell
the ordinary shares arising on conversion at any time after September 2
1994. The first available date would have been September 3 - a Saturday - so
WPP has agreed to bring the date forward to September 1.
A further 12.2m convertible preference shares are convertible at any time.
Conversion of these shares would mean the issue of a further 13.7m new
ordinary shares - 1.9 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share issue.
WPP shares were unchanged yesterday at 111p.

FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Burton to close 79 IS stores at cost of
Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burton, the clothing retail group, is to close its 79 discount IS stores
before Christmas, at an expected cost of Pounds 20m.
IS was developed in 1991 as a partly experimental format and a way of
trading from excess space in towns where the Burton group was
over-represented. But, Burton said yesterday, it was expected to make an
operating loss of about Pounds 5m this year.
The group added that the recovery in the property market meant it would now
be easier to dispose of the outlets.
The 500 IS staff would be offered positions in other chains wherever
possible.
The provision to cover IS closure costs and operating losses will be taken
this financial year.
It will be offset by a Pounds 20m property write-back after Burton sold its
remaining retail developments for Pounds 20m more than their written-down
book value.
Burton also reported that sales for the 22 weeks to the end of July were 3.1
per cent higher than last year.
Sales at Debenhams were up by 5.2 per cent, while Burton's multiple chains
lifted sales by 1.5 per cent.
In the multiples, Dorothy Perkins, Top Shop and Top Man turned in good
performances. These balanced out continuing problems at the Burtons men's
wear chain, where sales were down and mark-downs were necessary to clear
stocks.
There were signs of improvement at Principles, where a new management team
was sorting out the stock and shop design problems which depressed the
chain's performance last year.
Group gross margins were down 0.6 percentage points, but this was an
improvement from the 2.3 point fall reported at the interim stage.
Burton said it was continuing to reduce the level of discounted sales.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 40m for the year to
September 3.
