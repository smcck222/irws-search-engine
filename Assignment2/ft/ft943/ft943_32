FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bredero to lose listing on September 1
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bredero Properties, the property developer that was almost dragged down by
its ambitious Centre West development in Hammersmith, will lose its listing
on September 1 after Slough Estates succeeded in gaining an 81.8 per cent
stake.
Slough received 32.3 per cent acceptances for its 10p a share privatisation
offer, adding to its initial 49.4 per cent stake in the company.
It is unclear whether British Land has accepted the offer, after taking a 7
per cent stake in Bredero in June.

FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Soccer's old attitudes ruled offside - Why
excluding players' values may be a commercial mistake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Chris Sutton, Blackburn Rovers' new Pounds 5m signing, takes the field
against Southampton on the first day of the Premier League season, most fans
will probably regard him as one of the Lancashire side's prime assets.
Not so the club's accountants. Blackburn is common among English football
clubs in excluding players' values from the balance sheet.
That policy is flawed, according to accountants, Touche Ross, and
contributes to the losses which have raised serious questions about the
financial strength of the national sport.
By dealing with transfer fees through the profit and loss account, Touche
Ross believes clubs such as Blackburn are failing to show substantial asset
values in their balance sheet.
'Soccer's 'hidden assets' may put a club at a commercial disadvantage when
trying to raise finance or convey a message to investors or financial
analysts,' says Mr Gerry Boon, co-author of Touche Ross's annual survey of
football club accounts.
The survey, published today, warns that by not declaring player values in
the balance sheet, clubs fail to show an objective return on assets and
capital employed; expose themselves to large and unpredictable swings in
profits; and cannot give a realistic picture of their 'worth as a company'.
The cost to Blackburn has been high. It spent Pounds 13.1m on new players in
the 1991-92 and the 1992-93 seasons, resulting in pre-tax losses of Pounds
7.92m and Pounds 6.34m respectively.
Its spending spree helped lift the estimated value of the Premier League's
players to Pounds 250m.
Fortunately for the club, it can rely on the deep pockets of Mr Jack Walker,
the businessman who sold his steel stockholding business to British Steel
for Pounds 330m and has since acted as Blackburn's benefactor.
Most clubs do not have such backers. So why do they not embrace Touche
Ross's recommendations? The answer may be simple: tax.
By building up accumulated losses, clubs can reduce their liability to
corporation tax should they have a windfall on the sale of a star player or
on a cup run.
But such practices may soon attract the attention of the Inland Revenue,
according to Mr Colin Sandy, finance director at Tottenham Hotspur.
He believes that the Revenue's Special Compliance Office, which is currently
examining payments to players, could 'extend its inquiry to look at other
matters'.
Their attention may focus on the two thirds of clubs in the Premier League
which reported a profit in their last financial statements, but avoided
corporation tax through losses carried forward from previous years.
Newcastle United, one of the seven sides to include player values in the
balance sheet, says clubs must now face up to the challenge of introducing
efficient management.
The club changed its accounting policies after it was rescued by Sir John
Hall, the north east property entrepreneur. Mr Freddie Fletcher, chief
executive, says it was completely revamped after accountants at Cameron Hall
Developments, Sir John's private company, drew up a new financial strategy.
'This club was in a mess,' he adds.
The Football Association, however, is reluctant to endorse common accounting
standards for all clubs. Mr Mark Day, the FA's chief accountant, says there
is no proof that one accounting system is better than another. 'As long as
clubs are operating within accountancy rules, then we wouldn't seek a set
format.'
Nevertheless, Mr Boon at Touche Ross says clubs should shrug off their old
attitudes. If they don't, he warns, they may not be able to afford new
players or invest adequate sums in their stadiums.
'In order to secure the finance for such developments, clubs need to present
themselves to banks, shareholders and investors as well-managed businesses,'
he says. 'The financial manager is very much part of the squad.'

FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Grosvenor Inns up at Pounds 0.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Grosvenor Inns rose 12p to 150p on Friday after the expanding
USM-quoted pub operator accompanied improved annual profits with an upbeat
trading statement.
On turnover of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.1m), including Pounds 1.43m from
acquisitions, pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 increased to Pounds
854,000 (Pounds 764,000), struck after higher interest charges of Pounds
227,000 (Pounds 47,000) and Pounds 159,000 compensation to two former
directors.
Mr Tim Thwaites, chairman, said that trading was 'certainly much stronger
than experienced a year ago, particularly in food' - the Slug &amp; Lettuce pubs
showed a 21 per cent rise in food sales.
Most of the group's acquisitions, of 10 managed houses, four tenancies and a
joint venture, came too late to contribute to the results. But 'they are now
fully on stream and will make a positive impact on current year trading'.
Grosvenor had 40 outlets at the year end, including 11 freeholds. Mr
Thwaites said the proceeds from February's rights issue gave the group the
resources to purchase 'further individual outlets or small groups'. Gearing
dropped from 32 per cent to 23 per cent.
The final dividend is lifted to 2.5p, making 4.75p (4.25p), payable from
unchanged earnings of 7.4p per share.

FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: EMAP bid decision likely tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAP, the media group, should learn tomorrow if its bid for Trans World
Communications (TWC) can proceed in a High Court judicial review with
wide-reaching ramifications for the radio industry.
EMAP, which already owns three radio licences, is planning to skirt around
the present regulations forbidding ownership of more than six licences, by
putting two of TWC's five licences into joint ownership with Schroders,
Emap's merchant bank.
Guardian Media Group, which holds a 20 per cent stake in TWC, is seeking to
prove that the Radio Authority has exceeded its powers under the 1990
Broadcasting Act in approving EMAP's plan.
Industry analysts believe that if the court upholds the Radio Authority's
decision, it will prompt a number of similar moves within the sector and
accelerate the rationalisation process already under way.
It could also herald similar moves within the television sector, whose rules
governing ownership of broadcasting licences also originate from the 1990
act.
The radio regulations are also being tested by Daily Mail and General Trust
which recently set up a joint venture company in order to increase its stake
in Chiltern radio. As a newspaper owner, it cannot hold more than a direct
20 per cent stake in a broadcast group. Daily Mail and its joint venture
company currently hold 29.99 per cent of Chiltern.
The government is currently examining the radio ownership rules under its
cross-media ownership review, with the licence-owning arrangement widely
seen as ripe for abolition.

FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Move to ban more directors - Government
plan to clamp down on insolvency practitioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is clamping down on insolvency practitioners who fail to
provide the information which would lead to the directors of collapsed
companies being disqualified.
The move is part of a series of initiatives designed to increase the number
of director disqualification orders sought through the courts.
The number of criminal prosecutions is also to be raised.
The aim is to give a boost to the number of directors disqualified during
the current year.
The provisional plan is to raise the total number of disqualifications
sought during 1994-95 by about one third from the target of 500 for 1993-94.
The moves follow publication last year of a highly critical report from the
National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog.
This suggested that the government was failing to take adequate steps to
disqualify sufficient numbers of company directors criticised for poor
business conduct.
Action is now being taken by the Insolvency Service, the Department of Trade
and Industry agency which launches disqualification petitions. Officials at
the Insolvency Service argue that many insolvency practitioners - including
some within the UK's large accountancy firms  - have been failing to provide
sufficient and timely information on the directors whose conduct they
examine.
They have launched discussions with several firms and plan to raise lack of
compliance with the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit, the self-regulatory
body set up under pressure from the Service.
The NAO report said that many insolvency practitioners were failing to
submit detailed returns.
As part of its efforts to increase the rate of disqualification, the Service
is planning to issue a simplified version of the 'D-form". This is the
return required at the completion of insolvency cases conducted by
practitioners.

FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tentative signs of financial upturn for
English football clubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English football is showing tentative signs of a financial upturn with most
clubs cutting their losses or moving into profit, according to accountants
Touche Ross.
The firm's annual survey of football club accounts, published today, shows
average operating profits in the Premier League more than doubled to Pounds
1.46m (Pounds 620,000) in the 1992-93 season.
Increased income from television contracts and commercial sponsors also
helped reduce average losses per club in Division One from Pounds 423,000 to
Pounds 332,000; while sides in Divisions Two and Three cut their losses from
Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 47,000 and from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 54,000
respectively.
Although the figures represent an improvement over the previous season, the
survey shows that more than half the country's clubs continued to operate at
a loss.
Only 43 per cent of clubs were profitable at the operating level and losses
at several exceeded their total turnover.
Senior football executives also expressed concern that transfer fees - the
main source of income for most clubs - had fallen back to Pounds 73m (Pounds
75m), while almost Pounds 200m still needed to be spent improving the
country's stadiums to comply with the Taylor Report recommendations on
ground safety.
Mr Roger Alwen, chairman of Charlton Athletic - which reported losses of
Pounds 1.57m in 1992-93 compared with a Pounds 35,000 profit in the previous
year - warned that declining transfer income and refurbishment costs could
force some teams out of the Football League.
'I think there will be a fall-out of clubs in the next few years. Only
around 50 clubs may survive on a full-time basis.'
His concern was echoed by Mr Colin Sandy, finance director at Tottenham
Hotspur, which is controlled by Mr Alan Sugar. Mr Sandy warned that clubs
with insufficient gate receipts and no outside backing 'would go to the
wall'.
In the Premier League, several leading clubs incurred significant losses.
Blackburn Rovers made pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.37m (Pounds 7.93m) and
Chelsea and Wimbledon both lost more than Pounds 1m.
Touche Ross said the success of Manchester United, which made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.06m), demonstrated that clubs had to
develop commercial activities off the field in order to survive.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Board split at Astra operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg company behind the Astra
satellite television system, has been split by boardroom rivalries and an
attempt to oust the director-general.
SES runs three 16-channel television satellites and has plans to launch
three more. It is also proposing to float on the London Stock Exchange, and
other European exchanges, next year and could attract a value of Pounds 1bn.
Mr Pierre Meyrat, the Swiss-born director-general, has run SES for the past
nine years. An attempt was made to oust him last month by a group of
shareholders, including Luxembourg financial institutions which control 20
per cent of the equity and 30 per cent of the votes.
It is believed the two vice-chairmen of SES, Mr Romain Bausch, chairman of
the SNCI bank of Luxembourg, and Count Roland Kergorlay, a private investor,
were involved.
The main criticism against the director-general was apparently that he did
not consult widely enough among the 24-member board.
Mr Meyrat's supporters included Deutsche Telekom, which recently bought 16.6
per cent of the company. The matter reached government levels and it is
believed Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, became involved.
Last week at an SES board meeting Dr Meyrat faced what amounted to a
vote-of-confidence and received overwhelming support. Apart from Deutsche
Telekom, his backers included Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank and Thames
Television, part of the Pearson media and entertainment group which also
owns the Financial Times.
As part of a compromise, however, SES will have to strengthen the
operational directors.
SES is also taking difficult decisions on the development of digital
television. Its fourth satellite, due to be launched in November, will use
existing analogue technology. The fifth and sixth are scheduled to be
devoted to digital television.
Negotiations are continuing with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Mr
Leo Kirch, the German television entrepreneur, on how many channels the
Murdoch-Kirch consortium should have on the new satellites and on what
terms.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Unilever fights soap war with environmental claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, has opened a new front in
its battle over washing powders with US rival Procter and Gamble by pointing
to the environmental impact.
It claims that its Persil Power powder is environmentally friendlier than
predecessors and rivals.
It maintains that the manufacture of the powder uses 80 per cent less
energy, achieved by abandoning a process of blowing hot air through a slurry
spray to make a dry powder. The new method involves only dry ingredients.
The company says the powder's manganese-based catalyst allows consumers to
wash clothes at a lower temperature. This could save about 5 per cent in
electricity consumption, equivalent to 25p on a Pounds 5 box or about Pounds
3 a year, said Mr Rudy Bircher, head of the detergents environment group at
the company.
The company also claims the catalyst enables less powder to be used: 30
washes need 2.35kg of Persil Power compared with 2.8kg of Ariel Ultra, its
P&amp;G-made rival.
Unilever's counter-attack follows accusations from P&amp;G that the catalyst,
called Accelerator, damages clothes. The allegations were reiterated in a
media campaign by P&amp;G over the weekend.
Unilever, which has cut the amount of the catalyst in the formula, denied
the suggestion that clothes had been damaged significantly. It added that
wearing clothes caused two-thirds of fabric damage, with a further 10-20 per
cent caused by the mechanical action of washing machines.
The Anglo-Dutch company is reluctant to attack its rivals' products directly
in public, even though it acknowledges that P&amp;G has broken an unwritten code
that prevents direct brand comparisons in UK advertising.
It has prepared a list of claims to environmental superiority for Persil
Power including a 30 per cent improvement in biodegradability and toxicity
compared with other detergents.
Companies have become more conscious of their products' environmental impact
recently. Several countries in Europe have banned phosphates in washing
powders because of water pollution from washing machines.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Company News This Week: Crude oil price recovery should
prevent slippage - British Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First half results from British Petroleum, due tomorrow, are expected to
show that the company remains on track to improve profitability and reduce
debt.
Analysts expect that the cost-cutting and restructuring which has been the
dominant feature of the company over the past year or so will continue to
underpin earnings. Second quarter earnings on a replacement cost basis are
predicted to be in a range of Pounds 230m-Pounds 300m. Replacement cost net
profits for the first quarter were Pounds 305m.
BP should also benefit from the recovery in crude oil prices, which have
risen from a low last February of around Dollars 12 a barrel for the
benchmark Brent blend to the present level of more than Dollars 18 (Pounds
11.60p) a barrel. BP shares have been boosted in recent weeks by firming oil
prices, as the company is one of the most highly leveraged among the oil
majors to higher oil prices.
There should also be signs of improved earnings from BP's chemical
operations, as European demand increases in line with indications of
economic recovery.
NatWest Securities expects that higher crude profits will boost upstream
profits by more than 20 per cent compared with the first quarter. These will
be offset, however, by lower refining margins, which usually suffer when
crude prices rise.
Mr Simon Flowers, oil analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, said the
results may also be affected by the recent weakness of the US dollar. Half
of BP's oil production is in Alaska, and it has a large US dollar cost base.
But most analysts are generally optimistic about the company's prospects. Mr
Paul Spedding at London brokers Kleinwort Benson, which is forecasting
second quarter earnings of Pounds 265m, notes that BP has surprised the
market with better-than expected results for the past three quarters.

The failure of Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, to gain approval from
US regulators for the over-the-counter sale of Pepcid, its heartburn
treatment, is a blow to companies' hopes for switching prescription
medicines to store shelves.
The decision by two US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees
followed similar rejections earlier in the week for SmithKline Beecham's
heartburn medicine Tagamet and Upjohn's Rogaine, a treatment for balding.
Drugs companies have been banking on extending the product-life of their
medicines once their patents expire by marketing them without prescriptions.
Many other groups are hoping to convert the status of their drugs from
prescription-only to OTC.
Last week's rejections raise the question of whether there were particular
problems with these three drugs or whether such strategies, involving
powerful medicines being sold in supermarkets without a pharmacist's advice,
are flawed. In each case there were concerns about the individual drugs, but
three refusals in three days represent a serious set-back for the industry.
In Upjohn's case, there were clearly problems with both the drug and the
company. Upjohn's reputation with the FDA is still tainted by concern about
the accuracy of clinical trial data for Halcion, a sleeping pill. The
advisory committee also felt reluctant about allowing a potentially powerful
drug becoming available on supermarket shelves for baldness - a non-serious
condition.
As for SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, the committees expressed concerns about
the drug's safety, in particular its possible interaction with other, widely
prescribed, medicines.
The refusal by the FDA OTC and gastro-intestinal advisory committees to
recommend Pepcid reflected concern about its effectiveness. Merck presented
data from trials using doses of 10mg, compared with usual prescription doses
of 20mg-40mg.
The committees said the trials had failed to demonstrate that the drug
consistently provided relief from heartburn or consistently prevented
heartburn.
More generally, the committees are worried about recommending potent
medicines such as Pepcid and Tagamet which come from a class of drugs called
H2-antagonists.
That gastroenterologists generate a good deal of income from repeated
prescribing of such drugs - the longest prescription available in the US is
for three months - may also have been a factor, according to Mr Viren
Mehtha, of New York-based analysts Mehtha and Isalay.
The immediate outlook for non-prescription Tagamet and Pepcid is not good.
SmithKline Beecham needs to conduct additional clinical trials, while Merck
must argue with the FDA about the validity of its efficacy data.
Approval may take a long time. The advisory committees washed their hands of
the medicines, saying that it was up to the FDA to make a final decision.
Risk-averse FDA bureaucrats will have little incentive to make a rapid
judgment, given the advisory panels' concerns.
Glaxo, which is working with the joint-venture Warner-Wellcome to change the
status of its top-selling ulcer-drug, another H2-antagonist, Zantac, will
have watched last week's developments with apprehension.
Nevertheless the rewards for the first H2-antagonist on to the US antacid
OTC market are huge. Mehtha and Isalay expect the first to be generating
annual revenues of Dollars 500m (Pounds 320m) within five years, the second
Dollars 200m and the third Dollars 100m. The antacid market is worth only
Dollars 800m at the moment, according to Merck.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Company News This Week: Signs that jam will soon sugar the
pill - Dutch Chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The two Dutch chemicals groups, Akzo Nobel and DSM, are expected to confirm
growing signs of recovery in the European chemicals industry when they
release their second-quarter results on Wednesday.
Of the two companies, DSM is expected to see the stronger rise, mainly
because its position as a commodities chemicals producer meant that its
performance in the corresponding quarter of 1993 was particularly weak.
Analysts are looking for net profits of between Fl 35m (Pounds 12.9m) and Fl
70m compared with a profit of just Fl 4m a year ago.
Akzo Nobel, whose presence in sectors such as pharmaceuticals means that its
second-quarter figures are less cyclical than DSM's, is forecast to show a
rise of 25 per cent or more from the same quarter of 1993.
Both companies are expected to benefit from Europe's emergence from
recession.
The two companies' results are regarded as important pointers for other
cyclical sectors on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Shares in both companies
rose sharply early in 1994 as investors began to focus on sectors likely to
benefit most from higher economic growth in Europe. The weakness of the
dollar sent the shares lower in early summer, but they have since recovered
to trade within reach of 12-month highs set in the spring.

TI Group: The specialist engineering company is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of up to Pounds 70m, against Pounds 62.8m, on Thursday. The
increase is likely to be dominated by Bundy, the automotive and
refrigeration tubing business, which has benefited from buoyant demand among
motor manufacturers in North America and the UK. Improving sales to the
chemicals sector is also expected to boost the performance of John Crane,
the engineering seals manufacturer, which accounted for 46 per cent of group

Analysts expect pre-tax profits to be in the region of Pounds 430m compared
with Pounds 367m. Attention will be concentrated on dividend policy. Most
observers expect the dividend to remain unchanged, but will ask what sort of
dividend cover the board wants before it will start to increase the pay-out.
Otherwise key developments will include progress in the US of Zestril, the

FT  01 AUG 94 / Suez reinsurance sale off as Scor cuts offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suez, the French financial and investment group, has broken off negotiations
to sell its Abeille Reassurances for around FFr2.1bn (Pounds 250m) to Scor,
France's largest reinsurer, because the latter wanted an unacceptable price
reduction.
Suez said it would keep Abeille Reassurances which has premium income of
around FFr4bn a year, though if 'any other potential buyer comes along, we
will study their offer'.
It noted that it was Scor who had initiated negotiations which had led the
two companies to a preliminary agreement on June 15, by which Scor would pay
FFr1.3bn in cash and cede 19 per cent of its capital to Suez in payment for
Abeille Reassurances. 'In the end Scor insisted on a lower price and
supplementary guarantees, which we found unacceptable,' said a Suez
spokeswoman.
Suez's rupture with Scor does not affect Suez's agreement in principle to
sell the Abeille life and non-life divisions of its Victoire subsidiary to
Commercial Union of the UK for FFr12.5bn. They are aiming to close the sale
by the end of September.
It was Commercial Union's lack of interest in the Abeille reinsurance
operation of Victoire that attracted Scor, the largest French reinsurer with
FFr7.9bn of premium income.
Over the past three years, the Suez group has sold off some FFr35bn in
assets, mainly parts of the Victoire insurance company to various buyers and
also industrial holdings of Societe Generale de Belgique.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Berlusconi under coalition pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's populist Northern League, a member of
the government coalition, has dismissed as wholly inadequate the proposals
by premier Silvio Berlusconi to distance himself from his Fininvest media
empire.
Speaking at the weekend, Mr Bossi said: 'The proposals won't stand up.'
The League leader went on to announce he would be presenting a completely
new approach to resolve the worsening crisis over the conflict of interest
between Mr Berlusconi's role as prime minister and his ownership of
Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group.
The challenge from Mr Bossi followed earlier misgivings voiced by President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro over the plans which Mr Berlusconi unveiled on Friday.
This suggests Mr Berlusconi will face a much tougher task than originally
expected when he defends his proposals in a special parliamentary debate
tomorrow.
Mr Berlusconi proposed that President Scalfaro, in conjunction with the
speakers of the two houses of parliament, nominate a five person commission
to monitor the conflict of interest. They could also monitor the management
of Fininvest.
At the same time, Mr Berlusconi would be able to nominate an 'administrator'
who would be able to sanction management decisions as an impartial trustee
for the prime minister as principal owner of Fininvest.
Mr Bossi waited 24 hours before commenting, in contrast to the immediate
favourable response from Mr Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance and Mr Berlusconi's other main partner in the
right-wing coalition. He said it was essential to place all Mr Berlusconi's
assets in a foundation which would be run by a board 'completely free from
any association with the boss of Forza Italia'.
The objections of President Scalfaro in the form of a much-publicised note
centred on him being required to play a role that exceeds the constitutional
powers of the head of state. The president, he said, could not nominate such
a commission.
Some political analysts said President Scalfaro was reluctant to nominate a
commission when he had to co-ordinate with the speakers of the two houses.
Yesterday, both the president's office and that of the prime minister were
at pains to play down any differences.

FT  01 AUG 94 / UN backs use of force to remove Haiti junta: Exiled
President Aristide calls for swift action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Security Council yesterday gave US President Bill Clinton
permission to invade Haiti and remove its military leaders by force as and
when he wishes. Sources within the Clinton administration said this did not
necessarily mean an invasion was imminent.
The UN resolution, passed by 14 votes to none with China and Brazil
abstaining, employs the formula first used for the Gulf war in 1990-91,
which authorises member states to 'use all necessary means' to bring about
an objective, in this case the departure of Haiti's military leadership
under General Raoul Cedras.
The decision was legitimised by a letter sent to the council on Friday by Mr
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the elected president whom Gen Cedras ousted in a
coup in 1991 and who is now in exile in the US.
Mr Aristide had refrained from calling publicly for a US invasion, on the
grounds that he is forbidden to do this by the Haitian constitution. Now, he
has called for 'swift and decisive action' to remove the military leaders -
which, like 'all necessary means', is a transparent euphemism for the use of
force.
The UN resolution calls for a 'multinational force under unified command and
control' but this is understood to mean a US force with token participation
from a few Latin American or Caribbean states.
Once the military leaders are removed and a 'secure and stable environment
established', this would be replaced by a more traditional UN peacekeeping
force of 6,000 men, intended to help Mr Aristide impose law and order and
reorganise the Haitian armed forces to ensure their future loyalty to the
elected government. In the view of most US experts on Haiti, this longer
term task presents much greater difficulties than the initial invasion.
There is little support among the US public for an invasion, except in the
influential black caucus in Congress and in parts of Florida where it is
seen as the best hope of ending the flow of Haitian refugees. In the past
month, the US has been housing Haitian refugees at its naval base at
Guantanamo in Cuba rather than allowing them into Florida, and the outflow
has dropped.
This is one reason why observers in Washington no longer expect an immediate
invasion, but believe Mr Clinton will use the threat of invasion, plus
tougher sanctions imposed by the Security Council in May, to try to persuade
the military leaders to step down peacefully.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Signal staff offered payments to break rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some railway signalling staff have been offered one-off payments of between
Pounds 750 and Pounds 800 to work during this week's 24-hour rail strike
planned to run from noon on Wednesday to noon on Thursday.
The RMT transport union said yesterday that local managers had made the
offer to individual signal workers in the south-west of England and East
Anglia on instructions from Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible
for running the network.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack denied that the company had authorised the
offer. But she said managers in the south-west had taken their own
initiative without authorisation and canvassed signalling staff on whether
they would accept a lump sum of Pounds 800, the amount they could expect
immediately the current dispute is resolved.
The figure is made up of a 2.5 per cent basic pay increase backdated to
April, a Pounds 250 lump sum for accepting credit transfer of wages and a 6
per cent increase in pay as an unconsolidated supplement.
It was unclear last night whether Railtrack would extend this offer to the
rest of the company's signal staff.
The RMT said the offer was conditional on the signalling grades working on
the strike days until negotiations had produced a settlement of the
seven-week dispute.
'I thought I could no longer be astonished by the antics of Railtrack in
this dispute but this must take the prize for stupidity,' said RMT general
secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp.
'Railtrack are offering individuals Pounds 800 to try and break the strike
when putting the money on the negotiating table will go a long way to
resolving the dispute.'
Mr Knapp suggested that Railtrack's offer indicated that money was 'clearly
not a problem' for Railtrack.
'Once again, I invite Railtrack to get around the negotiating table and
start looking afresh at ways of resolving this dispute,' he said.
Railtrack said last night it believed that there would be a larger number of
signalling staff going to work in defiance of this week's strike. Last week,
one in seven of the signal staff worked normally during the 48 hours of
disruption.
A Railtrack spokesman said, however, that the company was 'not very

FT  01 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Underwriting fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The heated debate about underwriting, which has been fanned by the latest
OFT investigation, is ultimately a battle between lenders and borrowers. The
big City battalions are determined to protect pre-emption rights and their
risk premium for lending capital. Besides, they can argue that the current
underwriting structure guarantees that a company will always receive its
money. That is an advantage not to be discarded lightly.
Companies respond that a fixed commission of 2 per cent is hard to justify
in any conditions approximating a free market. Yet the biggest disadvantage
of the current underwriting structure is the required discount to market
price - typically 15-20 per cent. That risk cushion is too plump for all but
the most extreme circumstances. Companies pay different prices for capital
in the debt market depending on their financial strength. Why should the
same considerations not apply in the equity market? Option pricing
methodology certainly suggests that the discount could be narrowed in the
vast majority of cases.
The net result is that UK companies pay a higher cost for equity capital
than competitors in most other industrialised countries. It means that
earnings growth is consequently slower, yields are higher and the total
returns to shareholders are likely to be less. Fees earned for guaranteeing
companies receive capital may be justified. But institutional investors - as
well as companies - would ultimately benefit if they were prepared to
support a narrower discount.

<TEXT>
The Bank of England's latest quarterly bulletin sheds light on the slow
growth of investment so far in the upturn. Investment by companies is
certainly growing more slowly than during previous upturns - 1.7 per cent
last year against 2.4 per cent in 1982. But spending held up unusually well
during the recession. As the chart shows, investment as a percentage of
gross domestic product is now much higher than in the early 1980s.
Investment through recession also weakened company balance sheets. On a
replacement cost basis, capital gearing across the economy is not far below
the peak reached in 1992.
But while that might discourage some companies from investing, the bigger
barrier is uncertainty about the economic prospects. The Bank's straw poll -
taken in March - found that companies were unwilling to increase investment
without firm evidence of rising demand. Similarly, only 30 per cent of
companies had lowered their hurdle rates of return for new investment to
take account of low inflation. Corporate Britain is clearly sceptical about
the promise of stable, low-inflationary growth.
Such a conclusion tallies with surveys by the Confederation of British
Industry. It is also consistent with strong investment during recession:
companies usually demand a lower rate of return from investments in
efficiency rather than capacity. The outlook for growth is less clouded than
when the Bank took its poll, so the emphasis may slowly switch towards
increasing productive capacity. If the government wants companies to lower
hurdle rates, though, it still has something to prove on inflation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flurry of bids in UK food retailing is a reminder that life is not as
bad for the merchant banks as their market performance might suggest. The
sector has dropped by 16 per cent this year, roughly twice as far as the
market as a whole. Kleinwort's results this week will give some indication
of whether merchant banks deserve to be treated so badly, but there are
grounds for doubt. Not only did equity and gilt market turnover hold up well
during the first half in spite of falling prices. There was also an active
UK market in new issues.
Two other points suggest investors are wrong to link merchant bank
performance too directly to the equity market. The first is that several now
appear to be basing pay more closely on financial results. They are thus
more easily able to rein in costs when income drops. The larger merchant
banks are also increasingly active on the international stage. Full control
of Wertheim will strengthen Schroders' position in the US. But even smaller
Kleinwort has shown it can compete globally for privatisation business.
This is not to say that 1994 will turn out as good as last year. Warburg's
recent annual meeting caution is a reminder that the new business pipeline
is not particularly full. But in the longer term a structural change may
become apparent. The capital markets should continue to capture business
from commercial banks while larger merchant banks continue to diversify
abroad. They will thus enjoy greater growth prospects and less volatile
earnings. Currently depressed share prices ignore this prospect altogether.

The pharmaceuticals industry as a whole has reason to worry about the US
Food and Drug Administration's refusal to approve Pepcid, Merck's anti-ulcer
drug, as a heartburn remedy. Many of the drugs which fuelled growth in the
1980s are now losing patent protection. Selling watered-down versions
directly to consumers without a prescription could be an important line of
defence. Yet the FDA's reluctance to approve prescription drugs for sale
over the counter suggests that the US regulators do not share the industry's
enthusiasm.
Merck's failure is especially worrying news for Glaxo, which has high hopes
for its own ulcer drug Zantac as an indigestion remedy. SmithKline Beecham,
which had its ulcer compound Tagamet rebuffed by the FDA last week, might
take comfort that it is not alone in falling foul of the authority's
stringent criteria. But valuable time has been lost, especially for Tagamet
which has already lost patent protection. With millions of patients already
familiar with Tagamet and Zantac in prescription form, the stakes are high.
Wellcome, which hopes to sell its anti-viral compound Zovirax without a
prescription in the US, has some nail-biting months ahead. Warner Lambert,
which will help promote both Zantac and Zovirax if they are approved, also
has a lot riding on the FDA's decisions. While satisfying US authorities was
never going to be easy, the migration of pharmaceuticals companies into
consumer healthcare looks in danger of being stopped in its tracks.

What fascinates New York commodity futures traders more than the consumer

The health or otherwise of celebrated movie stars and politicians,
apparently. The hundred members of the Great Beyond have been winning and
losing money for the past couple of years according to the timing of the
various big-name appointments with St Peter.
It works like this. Each trader pays Dollars 10 up front to join, and a
Dollars 5 monthly membership fee thereafter. He or she gets allocated a
celebrity by picking names from a hat. Whoever's celebrity dies next scoops
the pool.
To qualify, the famous persons - ranging from Mother Theresa to Gene Kelly -
have to be over 50 and not too well. Excitement is running high at the
moment because 'no one' has died for three months so there is about Dollars
2,500 in the kitty.

Can Trevor Hemmings do no wrong? If weekend press reports are to be believed
the former builders' lad from Lancashire is poised to sell his string of
gambling casinos, including Maxims, Charlie Chester's and the Golden
Horsehoe, for another handsome profit.
It is the latest in a series of deals which has made the 59-year-old
Hemmings one of Britain's richest entrepreneurs. According to the Sunday
Times he is worth Pounds 175m or more than three times as much as Lord
Hanson.
Hemmings is not known as a high-roller but when it comes to buying and
selling businesses he's the man with the lucky touch for the moment.
His first big break came when Sir Fred Pontin asked him to build him a
holiday camp in Southport in 1967 and Hemmings became Sir Fred's right-hand
man. After Pontins lost its independence, it was Hemmings and not Sir Fred
who bought it back from Bass in 1987. Quickly, he more than doubled his
money by selling it to another brewer, Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
Since then Hemmings has been doing more of the same - buying low and selling
high. Apart from owning Pounds 84m of S&amp;N shares, he also has a seat on the
board and a Pounds 14m stake in Wain Homes, the recently-floated Northern
house builder, plus a raft of properties and a racecourse.
When the receivers were called in to John Ashcroft's high-flying Coloroll,
Hemmings was one of the first to pick up the more valuable pieces and it
seems only a matter of time before his son of Coloroll re-emerges on the
stock market.
Given Hemmings undoubted flair for wheeling and dealing for his own private
account, one wonders how he finds time for his day job running S&amp;N's leisure
and property interests.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sergei Mavrodi, boss of the teetering MMM financial pyramid has been unusual
among Russia's nouveau riche in being discreet to the point of invisibility.
There exists no known interview with him: he is said to be of Greek descent,
and is thought to be Russia's fourth richest person. The rest is silence.
However, his approach to business communications is starting to catch on.
Those who once gave interviews freely, now ration their time - less because
they grudge wasting it when they could be making money, more for reasons of
security: concealed in a tape-recorder could be a bomb.
Konstantin Borovoi, once the motor-mouth of Russian business and one of the
first to make it big - through his Moscow Commodities Exchange - is now
rarely featured. Oleg Boicko, the man behind the Russian Credit Bank, has
never been a great talker, and Vladimir Gussinsky, reputedly Russia's
wealthiest man, prefers the phone these days.
Mavrodi also shares his fellow tycoons' belief in mixing business and
politics. When MMM began to crumble, he threatened to use his 10m
shareholders to force a referendum on the government's performance. Borovoi
started his own Economic Freedom party, Boicko bankrolls Yegor Gaidar's
Democratic Choice, and Gussinsky helps out Grigoy Yavlinsky's Yabloko party.
Finally, all live in fear, behind armies of bodyguards and high walls.
Gussinsky, for example, built his own restaurant to have somewhere safe to
eat and his convoy of guard vehicles is larger than that of President Boris
Yeltsin. Doing business in Russian takes nerve: Sergei Mavrodi merely shows
a little more than the norm.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Emu may not be dead, after all: A currency union embracing
most of Europe cannot be ruled out by the end of the decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I hope my fellow heads of government will resist the temptation to recite
the mantra of full economic and monetary union as if nothing had changed. If
they do recite it, it will have all the quaintness of a rain dance and about
the same potency.'
Thus did John Major, in an instantaneously notorious article for The
Economist last September, dispose of the soul of the Maastricht treaty he
had fought so hard to enact. Yet there is an excellent chance that this
particular piece of wisdom, albeit increasingly conventional, is quite
wrong.
Some continental politicians agree that the Maastricht timetable is no
longer realistic. Not surprisingly, this is particularly true in Germany,
where the notion of sacrificing the beloved D-Mark in favour of what has
been condemned by one Bavarian politician as 'esperanto money' is decidedly
unpopular.
In June, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said that a
single European currency might not be realised until 2001. In similar vein,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, have
both emphasised that maintaining currency stability is more important than
sticking rigidly to the Maastricht timetable.
British Tory politicians find the idea of Emu too painful to contemplate
since it might spell the end for their party. As for Mr Kohl, he has made a
commitment upon which he can hardly renege if his country is to retain its
credibility abroad. Yet the consequences of living up to it could seriously
damage his popularity at home. When confronted by alternatives so
unpleasant, a natural response is to pretend the choice will not arise, or
at least not soon. It is certainly a natural response for vote-seeking
politicians.
Yet there are strong reasons for believing Emu will happen.
The first is that influential people in Germany and France remain convinced
that closer integration between their two countries is in their interest.
For Mr Kohl, who looks increasingly likely to retain power at the
forthcoming German general election, this is an article of faith. As for the
French policy-making elite, whose hold on power is unlikely to be shaken by
next year's presidential election, it wants Emu not just for broad political
reasons, but specifically to obtain influence over German monetary policy.
If the French were to request Emu when the treaty says they are entitled to
do so, could Germany refuse?
Second, many European policy-makers believe that a single market must have,
if not a single currency, at least currency stability. This desire makes Emu
still more important than before last August, when at least there was the
hard ERM. The present provisional arrangement, with its 15 per cent
divergence bands, has proved more stable than might have been expected.
Indeed, one of the reasons for believing a move to Emu would not be too
disruptive is that the French franc is back within the old 2.25 per cent
divergence band from its central rate against the D-Mark. The same is true
for the Belgian franc and Irish punt. It is almost true for the Danish
krone, while the Dutch guilder never even moved into wide bands. Yet such
stability cannot be guaranteed, it is argued, except through a currency
union.
Finally, the loosening of the ERM has demonstrated that a currency union is
different in kind from an adjustable-peg exchange rate system. An Emu would
be binding throughout an unknowable future. It is frivolous to pretend that
failure to meet arbitrary convergence criteria by 1998 would make Emu
unsafe, while success by, say, 2001 would make it safe. So why should EU
member states not attempt to use the dates they have already set?
The obvious answer to that question is that the criteria laid down in the
treaty, albeit arbitrary, are likely to prove an insuperable obstacle to Emu
by 1999. But this is to forget the subtlety of the treaty.
The relevant criteria fall into three groups: for inflation and interest
rates; for exchange rates; and for fiscal policy.
Consumer price inflation must be within 1 1/2 percentage points of the level
in the best three members. Long-term interest rates must be within 2
percentage points of bond yields in the three countries with the lowest
inflation rate. The Commission's latest forecast for 1994 inflation makes
the three best performers France, Denmark and the Netherlands (see chart).
Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the UK all meet the criterion. In
early July, these countries also met the interest rate test.
The treaty was written on the assumption that Emu would emerge out of the
ERM with narrow bands. The precise requirement, however, was that 'a member
state has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the
exchange rate mechanism of the EMS without severe tensions for at least the
two years before the examination'. The current wider bands can now be used
to define what is normal. Those with an excellent chance of meeting this
criterion are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands
and Luxembourg. Others may, too.
Fiscal policy appears, at first glance, to be the paramount obstacle. On
closer examination, however, this obstacle too disappears.
The treaty offers two fiscal 'reference values', namely, '3 per cent for the
ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product
at market prices' and '60 per cent for the ratio of government debt to gross
domestic product at market prices'.
On Commission forecasts, Luxembourg and Ireland should meet the deficit
criterion this year, although Germany and the Netherlands will come close.
The public debt criterion should be met by Germany, France, Luxembourg and
the UK, although Spain is very close and Portugal not too far away.
If unchanged, the fiscal position would appear to preclude Emu by early
1997, when a majority of members would have to satisfy all criteria.
Furthermore, if Emu is to start in January 1999, it appears that there will
be few participants. A monetary union between Germany and Luxembourg would
seem the definition of futility.
This analysis is misleading, however, because the 'excessive deficit'
procedure of the Maastricht treaty, of which the reference values are
components, is judgmental. In addition, the leading role in applying it
falls on the Commission, hardly a disinterested party.
The latter is enjoined to identify 'gross errors'. It is a gross error, for
example, if the 'planned or actual' general government deficit is in excess
of 3 per cent of GDP, 'unless either the ratio has declined substantially
and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference
value; or alternatively the excess over the reference value is only
exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference
value'. It is also a gross error if the ratio of general government gross
debt to gross domestic product exceeds 60 per cent, 'unless the ratio is
sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a
satisfactory pace'.
Exceptional circumstances - the recent recession - may well be used to
explain why Belgium, France, the UK and Denmark cannot meet the deficit
measure. Furthermore, economic recovery should make it feasible for all of
these countries to cut their deficits further. Most already have plans to do
so.
Ratios of debt to GDP cannot be adjusted as swiftly as can deficits.
Furthermore, three member states are forecast to have debt ratios of above
100 per cent this year: Italy, Greece and Belgium. In addition, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Ireland have ratios well above 80 per cent.
The question, however, is whether debt ratios will be judged to be
'sufficiently diminishing'. If a country maintains a large primary budget
surplus - that is, excluding interest payments - that ratio will indeed tend
to diminish. Of the high debt countries, Belgium, Ireland, Italy and the
Netherlands all had significant primary surpluses last year. Though
generally smaller this year, they could rise again.
In 1996, therefore, the Commission may be able to argue that the eight
countries which meet the inflation and interest rate criteria also meet the
fiscal standards. It has, in fact, already argued that Ireland does not fail
the fiscal tests, despite its high debt, because of its low deficit. The
Commission should also be able to get away with this sleight of hand, since
the Council 'shall, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from
the Commission (my emphasis) . . . decide . . . whether an excessive deficit
exists'. The Commission has the initiative. Thus the supposedly awesome
fiscal criteria vanish, leaving but a grimace behind.
The Maastricht treaty offers two specific dates for the move to the third
stage. The first is not later than December 31 1996, by when the Council,
acting by qualified majority, shall determine 'whether a majority of the
member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single
currency, decide whether it is appropriate for the Community to enter the
third stage, and if so set the date for the beginning of the third stage'.
Seven members - Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg and Ireland - may be judged to meet the criteria in 1996. The UK
is likely to pass all except the ERM criterion. But Denmark and the UK have
their hard-won opt outs from the third stage of Emu and are excluded by the
treaty from any potential majority.
By then, however, the EU will have been enlarged, in theory by four members.
Norway already meets all the criteria and Austria almost all. Although not a
member of the ERM, Austria possesses the most stable of all exchange rates
against the D-Mark. Finland might well meet the criteria too. But Sweden
looks likely to be excluded by its daunting fiscal crisis. Nevertheless, the
number of countries meeting the conditions and not having opt-outs could
well be nine out of 16 by late 1996, a majority.
If the member states decide in 1996 that the conditions are met for the EU
to enter the third stage, they must then set the date. They could set 2097,
for example, not 1997. Yet such finagling seems unlikely, since it would
ruin the EU's credibility. If they do not make a decision in 1996, the
treaty requires Emu to start on January 1 1999.
Germany is the only plausible obstacle to Emu, since one without it would
rob the project of its purpose. That many Germans are uncomfortable with the
idea is obvious, but the country has made a commitment. To draw back would
do grave damage. What is more, the German constitutional court is not likely
to prove a decisive obstacle. It has insisted, quite rightly, that the rules
laid down in the treaty must be followed. But those rules are themselves
judgmental. Provided the procedures are followed, there is no obvious legal
basis for complaint.
Some may object that this analysis is insufficiently political. But it is
precisely through legal obligations that European integration proceeds.
There was, after all, also scepticism about the ability of the EU to meet
the 1992 date for completing the basic legislation relating to the single
market. Never underestimate the EU's fear of failure and the tyranny of the
deadline.
Politics might arise in other ways. Germany could, for example, use the
threat of being difficult to obtain concessions on political integration at
the inter-governmental conference due in 1996. But the Germans are not in a
good position to insist on a quid pro quo for Emu. Mr Kohl presumably knew
what he was doing when he sold the pass, even if he does not care to tell
his electorate now.
One way to make the move to the third stage more palatable would be to have
irrevocably fixed exchange rates, but make no early moves to a single
currency. Technically, all that would be needed is an open-ended commitment
to support member currencies vis a vis one another, combined with a common
monetary policy. The latter is what the European Central Bank would provide.
Meanwhile, the angst of the man on the U-Bahn would be assuaged by continued
circulation of his beloved D-Marks.
Mr Major may be unwilling to contemplate the possibility, but the
dissolution of the ERM does, if anything, make Emu more probable, because
more urgent. By the end of the decade an Emu embracing Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway is
quite conceivable. Even the participation of Italy, Portugal, Spain and
Sweden cannot be precluded. Would Denmark and the UK then say no?
The prime minister was wrong. This rain dance is potent - and could be
followed by a downpour.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Outing the insiders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry's decision last week not to take action
over allegations of insider dealing involving the former deputy chairman of
the Conservative party, Lord Archer, provided an unrevealing conclusion to a
bizarre episode. Whether the move by Trade Secretary Mr Michael Heseltine to
publicise the investigation cost the ever-controversial Tory peer a
ministerial post remains a matter for conjecture. But at a more mundane
level the saga raises questions, once again, over the extent to which the
approach to insider dealing in the UK stands up.
In the nature of things insider dealing is difficult to prove. It is not a
victimless crime, though contrary to popular belief the biggest losers from
insider dealing tend to be market makers rather than small investors. In the
open, international environment that followed the liberalisation of the old
London Stock Exchange, the club ethic ceased to offer workable penalties. If
insider dealing had not already been made illegal in 1980, new legislation
would anyway have been needed after Big Bang.
The paradox that confronts legislators is that insider dealing arguably
makes for more efficient pricing. This is because the practice causes
information to be reflected more quickly in share prices. Yet such
efficiency is gained only at the cost of some loss of investor confidence in
the market itself. It is no coincidence that in many countries where insider
dealing has been rife - for example, in southern Europe - stock exchanges
have remained backwaters in their domestic economies. Companies have
suffered from the adverse impact on the availability and cost of capital.
Weak rules
Equally important, from the point of view of London's international role, is
that the preferred rules of the international capital markets are American
ones. Most US institutions, while hostile in principle to over-regulation,
regard weak insider dealing rules with unease.
The case for legislation is thus powerful. Yet controversy remains
inescapable because of difficulties of definition and proof. No one can be
certain of the scale of the problem - although the large share price
increases that precede so many takeover bids suggest that it is substantial.
The fact that a mere 34 prosecutions in 14 years have delivered just 23
convictions and 29 acquittals invites unflattering comparison with the
record of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
UK record
In an attempt to improve the UK's record, the government has refined the
insider dealing rules in the Criminal Justice Act, which came into effect on
March 1. But although the act considerably widens the definition of an
insider and of inside information, it remains to be seen whether it delivers
more convictions. The central difficulty facing prosecutors - establishing
that someone knew that he had sensitive unpublished information - remains as
high an obstacle as ever.
None of the remaining policy options are foolproof. Encouraging companies to
reveal more information in order to reduce the potential value of insider
trading is subject to obvious constraints where the information could be
commercially damaging. Publicising all tentative bid approaches would create
a false market.
Another option would be to remind traders that they are being watched with
increasingly sophisticated technology, and hope that this would act as a
deterrent. The London Stock Exchange has made much of its ability since
November, to identify the names of brokers' clients soon after they deal in
shares - a blunt sanction, but one that nonetheless bears thinking about.
A third route would be to give the authorities at least some of the tools
enjoyed by the SEC. Unlike its British counterparts, the SEC acts as both
investigator and prosecutor, and can bring civil prosecutions where the
burden of proof is lower than that in criminal cases. Plea bargaining
frequently then leads to fines and to the surrender of profits without
admission of guilt. The approach is at least flexible and the punishment is
more appropriate to the crime. These are both merits which ministers would
be ill-advised to ignore.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A chance to help Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of inept economic policy, Ukraine finally has a government
which appears ready to implement market reforms.
Ukraine's new president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, sent a strong signal of his
intentions by telephoning the International Monetary Fund the day after his
election. The IMF responded with commendable speed: last week Mr Michel
Camdessus, the managing director, flew to Kiev and offered to help Mr Kuchma
write an economic plan. The US, which appears to have recovered from its
initial distaste for Ukrainian independence, has followed suit, dispatching
Al Gore, vice-president, to Kiev tomorrow.
Sceptics may argue that it is too early to judge Mr Kuchma's policies.
Nevertheless, the IMF and the US were right to seize the opportunity to
encourage reform, not least because of Ukraine's size and crucial
geo-political location.
A stable and prosperous Ukraine would be one of the best guarantees against
the emergence of a neo-imperialist Russia and a welcome neighbour for the
economically more robust, but politically vulnerable nations of eastern
Europe. However, continued economic deterioration could inflame both
nationalists in the west of the country and separatists in the east,
creating conditions that might lead to civil war.
That is why the west must follow-up its flurry of flights to Kiev with a
concerted effort to nudge Ukraine on to the right economic course. The IMF
has already offered Mr Kuchma its usual advice: support the tight monetary
policy of Ukraine's surprisingly good central bank, produce a budget which
is balanced, or nearly so, and liberate the country's economy from the
administrative bondage which is restricting the development of its
potentially vibrant private sector.
Currency stability
This is sound policy so far as it goes. But Mr Kuchma should be urged to go
further and the IMF and the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
should be urged to give him the wherewithal to do so. One need is to make a
commitment to exchange-rate stability. Another is to yoke sound
macro-economic policies to radical structural reform. For Ukraine, that
means starting to shut down inefficient heavy industries, while creating a
social-welfare net able to support the workers who will lose their once
secure jobs.
Paradoxically, Mr Kuchma, who like Mr Victor Chernomyrdin in Russia spent
his career in the heart of Ukrainian heavy industry, is well placed to deal
with his country's rust-belt. He speaks the language of Ukraine's industrial
barons and, during the presidential elections, won a land-slide in eastern
Ukraine, the region which would be hardest hit by radical reform. His
distaste for the nationalist rhetoric which his predecessor, Mr Leonid
Kravchuk, employed as a substitute for economic policy should prevent the
new administration from wasting its time bickering with Russia.
Financial resources
Even with these political advantages, Mr Kuchma will need substantial
financial resources if he is to persuade his country to endure the initial
pain of market reforms. The Dollars 4bn promised by the G7 would be a start,
but much of this money is ear-marked for dismantling nuclear weapons,
cleaning up the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and technical
assistance. In addition to this, the west must also directly support the
budget and the currency. One measure worth direct assistance on the right
terms would be the New Deal-style public works programme Mr Kuchma would
like to create.
Western aid must be swift and substantial, for two reasons. First, Mr
Kuchma's tentative conversion to the market must be seen to be rewarded.
Otherwise, Ukrainians, who still have a touching, indeed naive, faith in
western financial institutions, could become as disillusioned as their
Russian cousins.
Second, Mr Kuchma needs the political leverage a substantial western aid
package would give him. Ukraine has not yet resolved the three-way power
struggle between the presidency, cabinet and parliament which, in Russia,
ended in bloodshed last October. In pursuing tough economic reforms Mr
Kuchma faces a fierce battle with Ukraine's conservative legislature.
Ukrainians should be made to understand that the west is in their
president's corner.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Student loans need improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is usually best to avoid saying of any idea - whether socialism,
Keynesianism or Christianity - that it has not been tried. Most of these
ideas have been tested to destruction by fallible human beings; and there is
no point in invoking perfect versions operated by archangels.
Where however a scheme is in its very early stages, there is a case for
reform before judgement. This applies to Britain's student loans scheme,
inaugurated in 1991. One of the pioneers of the idea in a booklet published
in 1965 was Professor Edwin West. He has returned to the charge in a paper
entitled Britain's Student Loans Scheme in World Perspective: A Critique
(Institute of Economic Affairs Pounds 4).
The basic case for student loans or their equivalent is unanswerable.
Graduates as a group have higher incomes than the rest of the community. The
conventional explanation is that they benefit from an investment in human
capital which increases their marketable skills. The more heretical
explanation is that degrees and diplomas act as a 'filter' which helps
employers to choose the abler and more industrious recruits for better
positions, irrespective of the value of what they have learned. On either
theory the graduate has on average a better lifetime earnings prospect than
the non-graduate.
If living and tuition costs are completely paid for by the taxpayer the
result is a regressive transfer from the worse off to the better off. On the
other hand some mechanism is required to assist students who are not easily
able to borrow large sums in the capital market. One solution is a
state-supported loan scheme, which graduates service and repay when they can
afford to do so. Professor West argues that any benefits to the whole
economy from the existence of trained graduates should be recognised by a
grant element in student support, and that the individual benefit should be
recognised by a loan element.
The British government has accepted this thinking de facto. As the table
shows, public cash expenditure on fees and maintenance is already below what
it was last year and is expected to fall further. The gap is being filled by
student loans, which should account for some 30 per cent of fee and
maintenance expenditure by 1996.
The knee-jerk objection to students getting into debt is misguided. Debt is
a normal feature of business and personal life, and is encountered by most
people when they buy a house. But there are genuine defects in the British
model. The government is worried by the exchequer burden and is
contemplating another attempt to persuade the banks to finance student loans
or to 'securitise' the loans so that the government can sell them to
financial institutions. That is, however, largely a matter of budgetary
cosmetics. The economic and financial effects are much the same if a student
borrows from a financial institution on government guarantee or if the
gov-ernment borrows for him.
There are more deep-seated defects in the present scheme noted by Prof West.
First the graduate repays only the principal, adjusted for inflation, and no
real interest. A second criticism, which should appeal more to young people,
is that repayments are made in fixed monthly instalments starting the April
after graduation - with exemptions for those with less than 85 per cent of
average adult earnings. Prof West would like loan services collected through
the income tax, as already happens in New Zealand. This would be both easier
to enforce and more directly related to ability to pay.
Other academics have previously argued for a graduate surcharge on National
Insurance contributions, without the mechanics of a loan at all, but
involving the same pattern of receipts and payments. Government opposition
to these ideas savours of the financial fetishism which Conservatives too
frequently substitute for genuine market economics.
Finally, a loan scheme serviced via the income tax - or grants offset by a
graduate surcharge - would make it easier to finance more generous support
for students willing to accept a larger burden after they graduate.
Several decades ago Professor Harry Johnson warned that a large student
class, living at a sub-proletarian standard of living, was a recipe for
trouble. It need not occur with sensible arrangements for shifting the
burden of expenditure and payments over a graduate's lifetime.

FT  01 AUG 94 / The FT Interview: Softly, softly along Wall Street - Arthur
Levitt, chairman of the SEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arthur Levitt has a reputation for not rocking the boat. As head for the
past year of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the main investment
regulator in the US, the 64-year-old Mr Levitt has chosen not to force extra
regulations on the US investment industry. Instead, he has sought an
accommodation with dealers, managers and underwriters.
But that does not stop him taking a swipe at the fastest-growing part of the
US stockbroking industry, the 'soft commission' business. Critics claim soft
commission arrangements are a form of legalised corruption: an institutional
investor agrees to channel a portion of his securities trading through a
particular stockbroker in return for services, such as the provision of a
Reuters screen. The value of commissions with such strings attached exceeds
Dollars 1bn a year. The practice (known in the US as 'soft dollars') should
be banned, Mr Levitt says. 'It doesn't feel right, smell right or taste
right.'
He admits such arrangements have been part of business life 'since the days
of Hadrian'. But that does not make him feel any easier about them. 'Would I
like to do away with soft dollars? Yes. Can I? I don't know.' For now, he is
in the early stages of launching a review of the area.
If his determination to take action against soft commissions is followed
through, he will face considerable opposition from those who benefit from
them: principally the big investment houses. To provoke such a confrontation
would be uncharacteristic for an SEC chairman who has otherwise been a
consummate diplomat, striving to please both his constituencies: Wall Street
and the politicians on Capitol Hill, to whom he is answerable.
Take his approach to the markets for derivatives, the complex instruments
whose value is based in part on some underlying financial market. The scale
of trading in derivatives, the increasing complexity of some of the
instruments and their potentially destabilising effect on other financial
markets have worried many in Washington. Some congressman fear a repeat of
the 1980s savings and loan crisis, when deregulation led to the collapse of
many of the country's thrift institutions at an estimated cost to the
taxpayer of more than Dollars 100bn.
Yet Mr Levitt has argued against legislation to extend his agency's powers
in this area. Securities firms, which are regulated by the SEC, run their
derivatives businesses through subsidiaries which are outside the scope of
the agency's powers. Instead, Mr Levitt began negotiations last month with
the six largest derivatives dealers on Wall Street - CS First Boston,
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Salomon
Brothers - to create a set of voluntary standards that would govern firms'
activities in the market.
'I have a general resistance to asking for legislation at this point,
because it will take time to get legislation, and you cannot be certain what
the legislation might call for. The process is cumbersome and
unpredictable,' he says.
His approach is causing concern among some legislators because voluntary
codes lack teeth. Mr Levitt counters that such arrangements have been
effective before: he recently secured a voluntary agreement among
underwriters of municipal bonds not to make donations to local politicians,
a practice that had led to allegations of bribery. But that agreement is
only temporary, and is to be enshrined in new regulations by the relevant
self-regulatory body.
Mr Levitt appears anxious not to provoke a confrontation over the issue of
derivatives. Legislation may be needed in due course to provide a back-stop
to a voluntary approach, he says.
He also points out that the SEC is putting pressure on the investment
industry to control the risks involved with derivatives by other means. Last
month Mr Levitt warned that the use of such 'exotic' financial products was
inappropriate for some supposedly low-risk mutual funds (similar to unit
trusts in the UK). He was concerned that complex financial instruments were
being used without being fully understood. He urged such funds to sell their
holdings of risky derivatives.
To date, the writing of a stiff letter has been as far as the SEC chairman
has been prepared to go. He summarises his approach by saying: 'I've tried
to use consensus rather than confrontation. I believe that, in running any
institution, it's a good idea to change its style every four or five years.
If the style of my predecessor (Mr Richard Breeden) was more
confrontational, mine is more consensual.'
His concern about mutual funds' involvement with derivatives highlights
another priority Mr Levitt has set himself: better protection of the small
investor. 'I have moved the SEC towards an investor-consumer bias and away
from an institutional bias,' he says.
One example of his efforts to protect consumers was his response to
criticism that mutual fund managers faced a conflict of interest when
dealing in shares they owned personally. Mr Levitt believed there was a
danger of undermining individual investors' confidence in the fund industry.
Earlier this year, he urged the Investment Company Institute, a trade
association for US mutual funds, to introduce a code of practice on the
subject.
While he puts investor protection at the top of his agenda, Mr Levitt has
been busy encouraging more foreign companies to raise money on US stock
exchanges. He has visited Germany twice this year for that purpose.
A year ago, when Daimler Benz became the first German company to list on the
New York Stock Exchange, it seemed a watershed. But no further listings have
followed. Mr Levitt believes more will come soon. 'I think that, five years
from now, this period will be looked back upon as an aberration. We've
thrown a lot of effort into this. It's a major initiative for me.'
As always, Mr Levitt is keen to be obliging and to examine aspects of
listing rules that might prove offputting to foreign companies. The SEC's
new policy, he says, has been 'to seek out those areas that are either
poorly understood (by foreign companies), or confrontational, and see
whether they're fundamental to my goal of protecting American investors. If
they're not fundamental to that, I'll seek an accommodation.'
That does not mean, though, that the SEC is about to make big changes to
help foreign companies. On issues such as whether non-US companies should be
forced to adhere to US accounting and disclosure rules, Mr Levitt does not
budge.
When head of the American Stock Exchange, Mr Levitt argued for the
relaxation of regulations to make it easier for foreign companies to tap US
markets. Now, he says, his views have changed: 'Probably nothing did that
more for me than Daimler. When they listed, if they had used German
(accounting) standards they would have shown earnings that were a multiple
of Chrysler's, but using US standards . . . they showed a loss. It's
impossible for us to justify to US companies or US investors that
inconsistency.'
Despite this, the SEC chairman insists that promoting US markets
internationally remains one of his main priorities.
When points of great importance are not involved, his style has been
flexible: procedures for admitting foreign companies have been streamlined,
for instance. 'I'm absolutely committed not to lose America's pre-eminence
in this area, and I'll do whatever I have to do to accomplish that.'

FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rwanda tragedy could have been
averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOE SILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was delighted, for the most part, with Edward Mortimer's article,
'High price of dallying' (July 27). Mortimer hits the nail on the head when
he says it is futile for member states to blame the United Nations for not
acting quickly enough in situations of crisis when they themselves do not
provide the organisation with the tools to do so.
I do not think this is the time to apportion blame; the 'international
community' is finally rushing to the aid of the desperate people of Rwanda.
But could not much of this tragedy have been averted had the member states
of the United Nations heeded the repeated appeals of the secretary-general
to help that bleeding nation back in May?
Indeed, if fully equipped forces had been earmarked in various national
armies around the world, as suggested by UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in his Agenda for Peace two years ago, then the UN could have
moved more effectively to stop the carnage in Rwanda.
By warning the Security Council last week that the UN might be forced to
withdraw its personnel from Bosnia-Herzegovina if the peace proposals
presented by the 'contact group' were accepted or rejected by the parties,
the secretary-general was merely being realistic. If the proposals were
accepted, enforcing them would require 60,000 troops, far beyond the means
or political will of the member states, as recent experience has shown us.
If they were rejected and 'disincentives' imposed, that would once again
endanger the lives of the peace-keepers.
Member states need to decide what they want their UN organisations to be - a
relic of the cold war, a toothless tiger, or an effective, credible defender
of world peace?
The only point in the article which I object to is the author's suggestion
that the UN's Department of Public Information be closed down because it
spends its money on journalists' tours of the Middle East rather than
broadcasts in places such as Rwanda. In fact, it is difficult to get the
member states to approve funds for UN radio facilities; the effective
station in Cambodia was approved only mid-way in the mission, and a request
for funds for a radio facility in the former Yugoslavia is still
encountering difficulties.
In contrast, journalists' tours of the Middle East are funded and
specifically mandated by the General Assembly. To suggest that the
department should be closed down is as if I were to suggest closing the FT
because of one article I did not like.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Different interpretation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof G MAYNARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My letter on US foreign indebtedness (July 22), now challenged by
Professors Thirlwall and Kennedy (July 27), was based less on the
theoretical ignorance gratuitously attributed to me than on an
interpretation of the following developments. Since the early 1980s, the US
current account has moved from rough balance to a deficit of more than 2 per
cent of gross domestic product. In the same period, the US's real effective
exchange rate has depreciated and relative unit labour costs have fallen
both by about 30 per cent; gross national saving as a per cent of GDP has
declined from 20 per cent to near 14 per cent; and US GDP has risen by
nearly 3 per cent a year while unemployment has fallen from 8 per cent of
the labour force to just above 6 per cent.
Do these statistics suggest that US economic growth has been held back by
excessive saving and an overvalued exchange rate, a possibility that
Thirlwall and Kennedy appear to have in mind? Or do they not support the
view that the US's trade problem (if there is one) lies in the country's low
propensity to save, not in an overvalued exchange rate?
When preparing their next tutorial, Professors Thirlwall and Kennedy will no
doubt bear in mind that in this period the current balances of Japan and
Germany rose as a proportion of GDP, at least until German reunification put
a special strain on Germany's saving. In both countries, also, gross
national saving as a per cent of GDP rose strongly, as did their real
effective exchange rates. Japan's GDP growth rate was somewhat above that of
the US while Germany's was a little below.
I do, of course, agree that the US suffers from 'deeply rooted' problems, as
do the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Italy et al, although the nature of these
problems no doubt varies from country to country.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Added value should be real measure
for R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J DENNIS HENRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Since publication of the Department of Trade and Industry's report on
R&amp;D (Technology: R&amp;D Scoreboard, June 17) there has been much discussion on
the subject - yet none about the fact that there is little correlation
between R&amp;D and sales, on which the study was based. R&amp;D should be measured
in relation to added value created - that is sales less bought-in materials
and services.
An up-to-date analysis of the FT-SE Non-Financial companies shows that 40
per cent of the companies disclose R&amp;D expenditure rather than the 30 per
cent implied in your feature. Of the remaining 60 per cent many are in
distribution and leisure which incur no significant R&amp;D expenditure. For
example, Marks and Spencer does not show any R&amp;D but much is done by its
suppliers.
The general manufacturing sectors of the FT-SE show an average of 1.83 per
cent of sales being spent on R&amp;D but 5.25 per cent of added value. One
company which is greatly affected is Rolls Royce whose 7.19 per cent on
sales becomes 20.62 per cent on added value. Consumer goods, including
pharmaceuticals, has averages of 2.69 per cent on sales and 9.28 per cent on
added value. For Glaxo the change is from 14.99 to 25.19 per cent; for
Fisons, 7.14 to 21.46 per cent.
This latest analysis shows that total R&amp;D expenditure has risen by only 4.5
per cent in the latest year against a 5.5 per cent increase in sales and 4.3
per cent on added value. However, the situation in the general manufacturing
sector is much worse with a 7.42 per cent drop in the latest year. This has
been offset by an 18.74 per cent increase in the consumer goods sector.
Comparing R&amp;D with dividends makes an interesting headline, but is this
really a fair basis? Do dividends not depend more on national practices?
Countries with low dividend practices will always come out favourably.
Having undertaken analyses of international performance, I know that it is
not possible to extract added value from US, Japanese and similar accounts.
Nevertheless, it can be done for all west European countries. A study using
added value would then be restricted to west Europe but would be much more
useful.
Britain's gross domestic product creates our national wealth. Added value
creates our industrial and commercial wealth. We should be using the output
measurement of added value for studies such as the one on R&amp;D.

Barry Hearn is a key factor in the sports world. In the 1980s he dominated
snooker, acting as agent to most of the leading players, including Steve
Davis. When the popularity of the green baize started to wane Hearn shifted
his attention to boxing. This has proved a much harder game to crack, but,
as the manager of Chris Eubank, Hearn has already made fortunes for himself
and his clients. In On the Line: Boxing Clever (BBC 2 at 8pm), the TV
cameras follow Essex man Hearn around the world as he does his deals.
It had to happen: British television is linking into Court TV, the US
channel which brings live transmissions of court room proceedings. Tonight
there is footage of the case which has gripped the US by the throat - the
trial for murder of one of its most celebrated black sports stars and
actors, OJ Simpson. (BBC 2 at 9pm). In Travels with my Camera (Channel 4 at
9pm) Charles Nicholls tries to replicate the journey into Africa of the poet
Arthur Rimbaud a century ago.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts: Our heritage is in his hands - The role of Lord
Rothschild and the lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like it or not, and on the whole they do, Lord Rothschild, chairman of the
National Heritage Memorial Fund, and Georgina Nayler, its director, seem
destined to become the patrons of our age. From next January, throughout the
land, small, and not so small, improvements in the cultural and physical
shape of the nation will become apparent - and Lord Rothschild will be
approving and Ms Nayler will be signing the cheques.
In this village the war memorial, or the duck pond, might be restored and
enhanced; in that small town the derelict Methodist chapel might be
converted into an arts centre; in our big cities the municipal art gallery
might be showing off paintings that were in danger of disappearing abroad. A
cathedral might have its bells restored; a country house secure a visitor
centre; a decaying mansion be brought back to life. The British heritage, so
long under threat from foreign predators and domestic neglect, is in line
for revival.
Lord Rothschild and Ms Nayler will be the conduit for change but the
motivating force is, of course, the National Lottery. A fifth of its
proceeds destined for good causes, an estimated Pounds 150m in the first
year rising, hopefully, to Pounds 320m.
When the government was looking for institutions to handle the windfalls
from the lottery some seemed obvious - the Arts Council was in place to
distribute the money going to regenerate arts buildings; ditto the Sports
Council. The heritage honeypot became the responsibility of the National
Heritage Memorial Fund, a tiny quango, set up in 1980 by the government in
response to public outrage over the sale of one of the nation's most
historic stately homes, Mentmore Towers. The task of the fund was to try,
with a limited government grant, to prevent any more such scandals.
Undoubtedly the presence, since 1992, of Lord Rothschild as chairman, has
given the fund bottom. He spent his early career making money and shoring up
the heritage and then managed to combine the two. He restored one of the
great aristocratic mansions of London, Spencer House, and lets it out for
business and social functions. More recently he gave a facelift to a former
family home now in the hands of the National Trust, Waddesdon Manor in
Buckinghamshire.
Lord Rothschild and Ms Nayler have been presented with a monster that could
well consume their tiny organisation. The government has been fairly good
(to date) about the lottery, regarding it as additional money and, in
theory, pledging to maintain current funding on the arts, heritage and
sports. Yet it could not resist cutting its annual grant to the Heritage
Memorial Fund by Pounds 3m, to Pounds 8.6m, for the next three years.
Lord Rothschild has tried to create a new role for the organisation,
concentrating its grants on obvious memorial projects, on saving for the
nation Nelson's letters, Victorian paintings of Florence Nightingale tending
the wounded, and putting money aside for the yet unresolved matter of the
Churchill archive. But in three years there is a real danger that the
government will allow the traditional grant to wither away.
But this is the least of Lord Rothschild's problems. His main task is to
define the heritage and to ensure that the new money is spread impartially
around the country. Every region will have its lottery punters and must
receive its benefits. Treasured stretches of countryside must be saved as
well as paintings and museums. The sums involved will range from the Pounds
2,000 needed to preserve a village common, up to the Pounds 200m which might
be required to ensure that the Duke of Sutherland's unrivalled collection of
Poussins, Raphaels, and Titians, remain on loan to the National Gallery of
Scotland after his death.
About 10,000 requests are anticipated annually and already Lord Rothschild
can be seen as the soft cop, prepared to help where he can, while Ms Nayler
is the tough cop, worried about establishing precedents and allocating money
before it has been handed over.
Already, Lord Rothschild has won two major victories in the run up to the
launch. He has persuaded the government to broaden its original criteria and
accept that paintings, and other works of art, were objects worth saving
with lottery money. Bad timing, with an early August deadline, makes it
virtually inevitable that Canova's neo-classical sculpture of the Three
Graces will leave the UK for the Getty Museum in California. But if a
comparable work appeared on the market in a year's time the odds are it
would be saved. Ms Nayler might draw in her breath, but Lord Rothschild
boldly hopes that: 'the Three Graces should be the last great treasure to
go. In future there will be an acknowledgement that we exist to save
things'.
Lord Rothschild's second success was in persuading the former national
heritage minister, Peter Brooke, to allow the fund to give money towards
endowment funds for worthy projects. There was little point in contributing
towards a new gallery in a museum if there was no money to pay the
additional keepers and to preserve the objects.
To a great extent the work of the fund will be defined by the nature of its
supplicants. This week the Memorial Heritage Lottery Fund embarks on a
proselytising mission around the country, explaining what it can offer. It
will also learn more about the needs it will be expected to address. The
hope is that it will grow into its job. The payroll has already risen from
six to 15. It should level out at 27, a modest task force for the allocation
of Pounds 150m. But Lord Rothschild, with his own merchant bank, is used to
handling vast sums of money. As a former chairman of the National Gallery he
also knows his heritage. This very British institution might just have the
character and breeding to convert the casual wagers of the public into
enduring national treasures.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts: Peacocks not penguins - Jeremy Isaacs defends
laissez-faire dress codes at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY ISAACS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Deedes leaned languidly against the wall of my retiring room at the
Royal Opera House in the interval of a performance recently, and said: 'I
believe the last time I was here, we wore white tie.' 'Really, Bill. Was it
a grand gala?' 'Oh, nothing like that.' With a pleasant jolt, I realised we
were back in another era; dances every night of the season; the bright young
things; dressing for dinner; white tie and tails for the opera. Ah, halcyon
days] England has moved on since then, and at Covent Garden all are welcome.
Some come straight from the office; some straight in from the street. Black
tie in the Royal Box, galas and important first nights. But normally, no
dressing up. And as far as I can remember, since the gala for the Queen's
Silver Jubilee in 1977, not a white tie to be seen.
Clement Crisp, his collar and cuffs as immaculate as his commas and colons,
has on this page (July 18) deplored current standards of dress at his
favourite theatre, and even claims to detect signs of a national malaise in
what he sees. Others take a different view, remarking favourably on the wide
range of attire worn nowadays at the Met in New York, or at the Coliseum
compared with business suits in the Royal Opera House stalls. The point is
worth addressing, but it is not a necessarily a simple one.
In Munich the other night at the festival, everyone seemed to have dressed
up; the men in variegated finery; some of the women in frocks. But there was
nothing formal about it. People come to ballet or opera to enjoy themselves
and should dress as if they expect to do so. I am not for any formal
requirement to wear particular clothes on an ordinary evening, but I love to
see anyone on pleasure bent, even if it is only a dress or an eye-catching
tie that sends the signal.
Two factors in London militate against peacocks of the sort one constantly
sees at Bayreuth or at Salzburg. Most of our patrons are not on holiday;
they come to the opera directly from work and few have time to change before
doing so. And then, when folk do dress, when a generous sponsor hosts a
party, the men wear black tie. Anything less like a party than 50 men in
identical, predictable black and white I cannot imagine; penguins are not
peacocks. Come dressed for a party, I would sometimes like to say, in
anything but black tie.
Some visitors to the Royal Opera House, particularly in sweltering weather,
come very informally dressed. Should we let people in in shorts? Some
patrons think not, and occasionally write to me to say so. 'I didn't pay
Pounds 100 for my stalls ticket, to sit next to a sweaty fellow in T-shirt,
shorts and sneakers.'
Now, everyone who pays taxes contributes to our funding. Everyone who buys a
ticket does so also. We are the only publicly-funded opera house in Europe,
after all, that earns as much at the box-office as we receive in grant. So
all are welcome. We prefer, rather than instituting strict rules or issuing
formal warnings about appropriate attire, to leave it to the discretion of
our sensitive house management to exclude anyone whose dress will offend.
(So far, the right of exclusion has not been exercised.)
Not content with censuring the dress codes, Clement Crisp also thinks that
there is too much eating and drinking going on. I cheerfully plead guilty to
catering to our customers' needs. What is true is that we are cramped for
space to serve them in.
The Opera House was built in 1858. If you compare a plan of Barry's building
with that of any other great lyric house in the world, it is striking to
note how much of that space the auditorium itself occupies, and how little
is left over for the public, to chat, saunter, eat, drink, even - why not? -
see and be seen. The Crush Bar is not called that for nothing. And, although
there is more demand than we can cope with, we all know that it is less than
ideal to seat tables for supper in the crowded pit lobby or Crush Bar.
But we need more space to serve our customers in, not a ban on their
appetites. When the house is redeveloped, as it will be by the millennium,
amenity for the public will be vastly improved. New spaces will be added,
with restored Floral Hall serving as a great salon and a loggia looking out
over the Covent Garden piazza higher up the House. Those who come to the
Royal Opera House are entitled to a whale of a time. We shall not rest
content until, in every respect that makes an evening happy, they can be
certain of doing so.

FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Alitalia tries to fly higher -
Robert Graham learns what Roberto Schisano intends for Italy's state airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The call for Roberto Schisano came out of the blue from a head-hunter:
'Would you be interested in serving your country?'
It soon transpired that 'serving his country' meant overhauling Alitalia,
Italy's loss-making national airline. For the 51 year-old Schisano,
president of Texas Instruments Europe, it was a challenge hard to refuse.
Having spent his working life with the US electronics multi-national, the
prospect of applying his knowledge of American management techniques to
shake-up an ailing state airline was irresistible. It was also the first
time the chief executive of any Italian state enterprise has been actively
head-hunted.
Since February he has been installed as chief executive in Alitalia's
cavernous new headquarters, mid-way between Rome and the city's Fiumicino
airport - a building he will almost certainly sell-off as part of the
airline's rationalisation.
'When I came to Alitalia, I told everyone I was a frequent flier clocking up
thousands of miles annually; but I only ever flew Alitalia when it was
unavoidable,' says Schisano.
Such blunt talking is an essential part of the new management style, which
in five months has brought about what is arguably the biggest ever cultural
revolution in an Italian state enterprise. He has broken down entrenched
union resistance to change, and Alitalia is likely to implement the kind of
restructuring programme that Air France, the neighbouring state airline, has
tried and failed to do.
'The (recent) agreement with the unions is the first building block for a
new era of relations in which we must decide we have a common objective - to
work together to stay in the market,' he observes. The core of the agreement
centres on a near 20 per cent cut in the 20,000 strong workforce; the end of
restrictive practices among cabin crew; the switching of crews among
different types of aircraft; effective cuts in wages; and longer working
hours.
Schisano, who trained as an electronic engineer, began by spending a month
between jobs soaking up everything he could about Alitalia. For a while when
he arrived he simply listened - to individual managers, to groups and then
to two huge assemblies of the workforce.
'The big surprise for me was to discover Alitalia was not a company as I
knew one. Rather it was a conglomerate whose professional skills were not
being coordinated towards a common goal.'
He adds: 'Alitalia did not have an identifiable objective at all. And with
time there had occurred a total divorce between people and the company.'
Using one of his pithy one-liners, he summed up Alitalia as he found it:
'The company had become separated from the market; and the management had
become separated from the company.' The first situation he was prepared for.
The second was unexpected.
Another surprise was the way Alitalia had misplaced its priorities. 'The
culture of the company rotated round the machines, the aircraft. The
rationale was - 'we fly because we have aeroplanes' - rather than 'we fly
because we have customers'.'
The customer indeed had become forgotten, not least by the flight personnel
who were bent on protecting their privileges. Schisano discovered that cabin
crew pay was based on 504 separate job considerations, most of which had
been individually negotiated between unions and management.
Although he pays tribute to the professional skills inside the airline,
Schisano scarcely conceals his dismay at the lack of competitiveness that
existed against other airlines. 'Our previous bench-marks were what I call
the so-so bunch - the other European state airlines, not those seeking to be
market leaders like Britsh Airways or Southwest in the US. And when one
mentioned losses, the reply was 'Oh, we're not as bad as Air France'.'
Through a combination of badly organised and poorly developed Italian
airports, inadequate flight schedules and indifferent service, Schisano
reckons Alitalia has been losing 2m passengers a year to competition. Thus
to impose radical change and become customer-orientated, the first step was
to stop the airline being run like a government department with life-long
job security. Management had to be flexible, not rigidly hierarchical, and
people had to be properly motivated.
To achieve this, Schisano began with some simple and obvious personnel
relations exercises, nevertheless unfamiliar to the Alitalia culture. 'I
made myself very visible and walked about the building a lot. . . My first
meeting with the unions was carried everywhere on closed circuit television.
. . I cut out all the awful bureaucratese in memos and circulars.'
This direct contact in turn helped to produce a creative atmosphere, in
which the management could focus on drawing up a restructuring programme to
restore profitability and ready the airline for privatisation. The plan
itself, designed to raise productivity by 25 per cent and cut operating
costs by 12 per cent, was ready by May.
Remarkable by Italian standards, the main union leaders decided in less than
two months to back Schisano's tough recipe for saving Alitalia.
'I set out to convince them by showing the figures in easily understandable
presentations and charts,' he says with more than a hint of satisfaction. He
devised comparative tables to show just how over-paid and unproductive
Alitalia had become had become: cabin crews earned more than double British
Airways.
'They could see our costs had been higher than revenues for the past six
years. . . From this I was able to say: either we accept the restructuring
plan or we go home.'
The threat carried credibility because both the previous Ciampi government
and the current Berlusconi administration had made it clear the airline had
to stand on its own feet. According to Schisano, the government attitude
makes Alitalia's plight different from that of Air France. 'Air France still
behaves as if it is an arm of the French government.'
Unions in strategic public service sectors like transport have traditionally
held the company and the public to ransom. But Schisano gambled that the
balance of power had shifted away from the unions. 'Unions need the
management today; the management doesnt need the unions,' he says.
His tough line appears to have paid off. Industrial action against the
restructuring was largely limited to wild-cat strikes by a new militant
union, which Schisano excluded from negotiations.
If this sounds too much of a success story, Schisano is the first to admit
Alitalia has still to prove it can be a profitable and competitive operator.
It has yet to decide on a coherent policy of international alliances and is
unlikely to be fully prepared for the liberalisation of European airfares.
But perhaps the lesson from his brief experience is that where radical
surgery is necessary, it is more easily done by someone brought in from
outside. One up for the head-hunter.

FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the news): Emap's handy Francophile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the successful magazine, newspaper and exhibitions group, is clearly
becoming a much more Francophone company, following last month's acquisition
of Pounds 108m worth of French magazines, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Emap was already in France through a joint venture with Bayard Press. For
the past two years new recruits to the company have been expected to offer
another language besides English - preferably French.
The latest acquisitions comprise 28 titles bought from Editions Mondiales -
including Tele Poche, one of the leading television listings magazines - and
L'Auto Journal - France's biggest selling motoring journal - bought from
Robert Hersant, owner of Le Figaro.
The deal makes Emap the third largest consumer magazine group in France,
with 860 staff. Clearly, management changes were necessary.
David Arculus, Emap managing director, believes that given the company's
growth in France it was important to have senior management on the ground.
Kevin Hand, the 43-year old chief executive of Emap's consumer magazine
division, has just been appointed chairman of Groupe Emap, and is heading
for France with his family for at least a year to integrate the new titles.
'People say I'll never be back in a year. Then we move on to the exciting
part - launches and acquisitions,' says Hand.
For the past three years - apart from visiting the French business - he has
been working steadily at his French; he now describes his efforts as 'pas
mal.'
He concedes that his French colleagues may wince sometimes at what he does
to their language, but he thinks he gets high marks for trying.
'If you don't speak French you are going to get dropped from the team,' says
Hand, who hopes that increasingly French Emap staff will spend a couple of
years working in London and vice versa.
He has no doubt there will be further Emap acquisitions in France. 'The
calls are already coming - in French,' he says.
Hand will remain chief executive of Emap consumer magazines but Tom Moloney,
who currently heads four companies covering Emap's teenage, music,
entertainment and women's magazines has been appointed deputy chief
executive of Emap's UK consumer magazine division.

FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the news): Belzberg likes to buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent Belzberg may lack the panache of the Vancouver corporate raiders who
made his family famous in the 1980s. But the younger Belzberg seems to be
building his business on more solid foundations, writes Bernard Simon.
Belzberg, aged 43, is chief executive of Harrowston, an unglamorous
Toronto-based outfit, which rose from the ashes of First City Financial, the
Belzberg-controlled group which mounted daring but ultimately
self-destructive raids on several North American and European companies in
the mid-1980s.
Revived with the help of a capital infusion from institutional investors,
Harrowston is quietly buying up victims of North American corporate
shake-ups.
Its latest purchase is ICI's polyol division. Together with earlier
acquisitions from ICI and EI DuPont, Belzberg has now stitched together a
chemicals group with annual sales of some CDollars 250 million. He has also
bought a meat retailing business.
Brent is the nephew of Sam and Bill Belzberg, the once-feared brothers who
were the driving force behind First City. Sam and Bill have wisely faded
into obscurity on the west coast while their nephew tries to rebuild the
family's reputation in Toronto.

FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the news): Parker picks his own leaving
date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Parker, the chairman of Newmont Mining, must be the only businessman
who has faced up to the attentions of three of the world's most aggressive
corporate raiders - T Boone Pickins, Lord Hanson and Sir James Goldsmith -
and still be in his job, writes Ken Gooding.
Boone Pickins, fresh from raiding the US oil patch, was the first to make a
run at Newmont in 1987. Parker beat him off but had to sell most of
Newmont's assets to cover the costs and turn for help to the UK's
Consolidated Gold Fields, which ended up with 49 per cent of Newmont.
Parker had no sooner started to rebuild Newmont as a gold company - it is
now the biggest in North America - when he had to reciprocate by helping
Gold Fields ward off Minorco, the offshore arm of Anglo American of South
Africa. Gold Fields won after a two-year battle but was in no shape to put
up much resistance and was gobbled up by Lord Hanson's outfit shortly
afterwards.
That was in 1989. After a year of dancing around Parker, Hanson retired and
swapped his Newmont holding for Sir James Goldsmith's North American
forestry interests. Through all these tribulations, Parker was protected by
a neat legal safety net - anyone who picked up Gold Fields' 49 per cent
Newmont stake also inherited a 'standstill' agreement preventing them from
buying the extra shares to give control.
Sir James tried to wriggle round this by encouraging a merger between
Newmont and Peter Munk's American Barrick; that fell apart almost as soon as
talks started. Goldsmith gave up and sold all but 4.9 per cent of his
Newmont stake as the gold price went up last year. This left Parker, who
joined a Newmont copper affiliate in 1959, once more as Newmont's undisputed
boss.
Fittingly as the gold industry's great survivor, Parker, a tall and taciturn
man of 58, has dictated when he plans to retire. He will hand over the
chairmanship of Newmont to chief executive Ronald Cambre at the end of the
year - and not a day before.

The BBC opens its Networking Club for business today, offering what it
describes as low-cost, user-friendly access to the global computer networks
of the Internet.
Mr Eurfron Gwynne Jones, BBC director of education, believes the BBC is the
world's first media organisation 'to open up mass access to the
communications revolution.' Echoing the launch of the 1980s BBC micro
computer, membership, with starter kit, will be from Pounds 25 plus VAT,
with a monthly fee of Pounds 12 plus VAT.
As well as Internet access there will be an information and conferencing
service, Auntie, with information about BBC radio and tv programmes, and
transcripts and fact sheets. The network backbone will be provided by Pipex.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Media Futures: The man who would be king of pay-tv - Martin
Dickson talks to the still innovative but now less abrasive chairman of Home
Box Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Fuchs, the ebullient, irreverent chairman of Home Box Office, the US
pay-television company, could never be accused of false modesty. 'I consider
us to be the McDonald's sign on the side of the information highway,' he
declares. 'We are a king brand.'
He speaks with considerable authority: HBO, 21-years-old this year, is not
only the oldest pay-television service in America, born at the dawn of the
cable television era, but it is also the biggest, with operating profits
last year of Dollars 230m (Pounds 148m) on revenues of Dollars 1.4bn.
A subsidiary of Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment group, HBO's
profits have grown by 9 per cent a year on average during the past seven
years and this month (July) it reported record earnings of Dollars 128m for
the first half of 1994, up 14 per cent.
Its main channel transmits a mixture of feature films and sports,
documentaries, comedy and music shows to 18m US subscribers, by means of
cable systems and satellite.
Last year, it garnered more of the television industry's prestige prime-time
Emmy awards than any of the big three traditional broadcast networks - NBC,
ABC and CBS. Its winners included the made-for-tv films 'Barbarians at the
Gate', which deals with the epic takeover battle for RJR Nabisco, and the
wonderfully named 'The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom'.
A second channel, Cinemax, is devoted entirely to movies and reaches 7m
customers.
But does the current turmoil in the US communications industry pose a threat
to HBO? After all, the cable television industry is fairly mature; and in
the coming era of inter-active, multi-media entertainment, viewers will be
able to choose from a vast number of viewing choices, including
movies-on-demand.
On the contrary, insists Fuchs, 'we are feeling right now more optimistic
about our business over the next five years than I have felt at any other
moment over the 10 years I have been (in charge) here'. He admits that after
about the year 2000 his crystal ball gets foggy.
Fuchs acknowledges that the US basic cable industry - where subscribers pay
a fixed fee to a cable service company for a cocktail of channels, mostly
advertiser-supported - is fairly mature, reaching about 60m US homes.
But he says there is plenty of room for growth at pay channels like HBO,
which are not supported by advertising and which viewers pay a special
additional fee to receive. Analysts also point out that cable service
companies, which recently had basic cable rates cut by regulators, are now
likely to emphasise marketing pay channels to customers.
The company is also stepping onto the international stage, which will absorb
cash in the short run, but which has greater long term growth potential than
the US. 'Don't have the misconception that Rupert Murdoch is going to own
Asia, because he's not', says Fuchs, who also has designs om Europe and
Latin America.
In the US, HBO added 1m subscribers last year, an increase of about 4 per
cent, thanks to the strength of its programming, powerful marketing (a
Dollars 150m a year warchest) and pioneering innovations like 'multiplexing'
 -rebroadcasting its programmes on different time schedules.
'The biggest complaint we have had from the first day of this business is
'it's not on when I want it.' So we are configuring HBO so people can have
eight bites of the apple instead of one,' Fuchs says.
He also maintains that well established television brands are not going to
simply disappear with the advent of inter-active television, although some
smaller players may be squeezed.
Several analysts agree, and a few bold ones even suggest that HBO may be the
prototype channel of tomorrow, unencumbered by programme advertising breaks,
and supported solely by the subscriptions of the people who wish to watch
it.
'The basic cable channels are nervous about a la carte,' Fuchs says. 'We
don't know anything but a la carte."
Any television channel ultimately stands or falls by the quality of its
programming, and it is here that Mr Fuchs has proved himself an important
innovator.
HBO, which began as a movie and sports channel, but was very adversely
affected by the advent of the video cassette recorder in the 1980s, has
developed a reputation for the kind of sophisticated, cutting edge, and
socially conscious programming which the big three broadcasting networks
often shy away from - for fear of offending viewers or advertisers. It also
keeps very tight control of costs.
A native of New York, where HBO is headquartered, Fuchs, 48, was an
entertainment lawyer before joining HB0 as a programmer in 1976.
He became president in 1984 and acquired a reputation for abrasiveness,
particularly during negotiations with Hollywood production companies.
The image was accentuated in 1989 when Time, HBO's parent, merged with
Warner Communications. Fuchs clashed repeatedly with executives at the
Warner Brothers film studio about his plans, bitterly opposed by Warner, to
make films for release in cinemas.
Fuchs lost the battle and bitter feelings between the two sides lingered,
making a mockery of claims that the Time Warner merger would produce great
synergy.
'There wasn't a lot of sportsmanship and team playing, but we've gotten
through that,' admits Fuchs, who insists the two are working well together
in developing international markets. 'We wouldn't be in the foreign business
without Warner Brothers.'
Fuchs seems a mellower individual generally. After avoiding the press for
years, he has suddenly made himself available for interviews.
Some suspect this is a diplomatic offensive to improve his chances of
succeeding Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman. Others say he simply has
a lot to shout about.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Media Futures: 3i acquires 25% stake in First Information
Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Touch the screen representations of a Pounds 10 and Pounds 5 note in the
museum of the Bank of England and interesting things start to happen.
The cricket game from The Pickwick Papers of Charles Dickens on the back of
the Pounds 10 note comes to life , as does Stephenson's Rocket locomotive on
the back of the Pounds 5 note.
They are part of an award-winning CD-Rom recounting the history of the Bank,
now celebrating its 300th anniversary, produced by First Information Group.
Today FIG, which believes it is the UK's largest independent multimedia
company, announces that 3i, the investment capital group, has bought 25 per
cent of the company for Pounds 4m of equity and loan finance. It is 3i's
largest investment in multimedia so far.
FIG was set up less than a year ago by Mr James Edmonds,the entrepreneur who
recently flew a microlite aircraft from Wiltshire in England to China to
raise money for charity.
To create FIG, he organised a management buy-out of Chrysalis Multimedia
from its parent group. Mr Edmonds is a 48-year-old lawyer who built up a
US-based holiday and travel business sold in 1992 for Pounds 50m. 'I made a
bomb, but I didn't want to retire. I spent a year with colleagues looking
for something to invest in and we decided on multimedia,' said Mr Edmonds.
FIG plans to use the 3i money to purchase the electronic rights to a wide
range of established educational and training books and add digital moving
and still images and sound to the original text.
Agreements in principle have already been signed with publishers for as many
as 30 titles, plus options on others, and FIG will now act to finalise the
deals.
Initially titles will be aimed at the US market, as that is where the
installed CD-ROM base is at the moment. The first title, to be released by
Christmas, is likely to be a history of the American Civil War. Another
title in development is a children's encyclopaedia.
'It's a simple philosophy. We sell off the back of the established books,'
says Mr Edmonds, who hopes that multimedia is about to take off and that he
will make another 'bomb' as a result.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Architecture: Demolition and Art Deco / Assessing the case
for saving the Smith Kline Beecham HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens when an international company wants to demolish its
headquarters and finds itself at the centre of a row about the value and
importance of listed buildings ? When that building is a prominent London
landmark on the chief route into the city from the airport you can expect at
least a debate. The leading pharmaceutical company Smith Kline Beecham
earlier this year launched their campaign to win consent to demolish their
Art Deco tower alongside the M4 viaduct as part of a Pounds 150m
redevelopment scheme to create 1m sq ft of new offices.
Their proposals were launched with hype as 'a new gateway for London' and
Smith Kline Beecham with their development consultant British Land engaged
the fashionable late-modernist architect Sir Richard Rogers.
The launch was a flashback to the 1980s. There was a newsletter called
'Great West Revival', photographs of a model of Rogers's proposals alongside
a traffic free motorway. There was no mention of the fact that the main
existing building on the site 'SB House' is an 11-storey Art Deco tower that
is listed Grade II - the charms of which have been diminished by its
proximity to the elevated section of Westway. There were computer generated
views of the Rogers' scheme showing that the 'new gateway' is a precipitous
gantry across the traffic from the series of new glass office towers that he
has designed for the site.
The Art Deco tower is worth examination. Designed in 1937-1942 by the firm
of Wallis Gilbert and Partners for the firm Simmons Aeroaccessories, it
cleverly incorporated an earlier tower by GA Warren. Wallis Gilbert were
pioneers of the Art Deco factory and office building, bringing the style
from America and employing it commercially. They designed the Firestone
Building, also on the Great West Road, which was wickedly demolished on a
Bank Holiday in 1980 just as the climate changed in favour of its
preservation.
Wallis Gilbert's most famous building in England is the Hoover Factory at
Perivale, a stunning example of neo-Egyptian Art-Deco. The Hoover factory
has been gloriously restored and partly adapted as a new Tesco Superstore.
It is a perfect example of the way a listed building can add value to a
development. The Great West Road was once known as the Golden Mile - with
its fine factories behind rolling lawns with streets of pleasing semis in
large gardens (surely the conservation areas of tomorrow) surrounding them.
No-one is pretending that the old traffic free world can be re-created. but
the Smith Kline scheme does boast that, as well as providing 1m sq ft of
offices (of which the company will occupy a quarter), a new park will be
created which will, 'establish a continuity of open space and the creation
of continuous green routes to the River Thames.' Richard Rogers is always
creating these mythical 'routes' which only exist in drawings. The so-called
park will be largely in permanent shadow and always be noisy and polluted.
What are the qualities of the listed building? It is a very good example of
stream-lined Art Deco with plenty of detail and all its railings and gates.
Seen from the south carriageway of the A4 it is a fine example of a 'Golden
Mile' building and even seen from the motorway it does have landmark
qualities. Art Deco was an important parallel to the Modern Movement and is
under represented in England. The building is in good structural condition
and could be refurbished for Pounds 4m.
There is a clear case for the retention of the listed building as an anchor
building with a business park around it. Positive value could be generated
by a better mixture of uses on the site. The retention of the listed
building makes this more, rather than less, possible. The use of a famous
architect and all the promotional words about new gateways should not fool
anyone. In the official Planning Policy Guidance issued by the Department of
the Environment, it would be wise for Smith Kline and their advisors to
remember that 'the Secretaries of State take the view that subjective claims
for the architectural merit of proposed replacement buildings should not in
themselves be held to justify the demolition of listed buildings.'
There is always a presumption in favour of the preservation of a listed
building and this application for an outline planning consent using Richard
Rogers (who may not be retained for the detailed planning consent) should
clearly be rejected with the support of English Heritage. Mr Jocelyn
Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, only has to point to the success of
Bracken House in the City where Michael Hopkins added to the listed building
in an inspired way. Mr Stevens should encourage Richard Rogers to be more
imaginative and to keep the listed building at the heart of his scheme.
There are plenty of boring glass towers around. A refurbished Deco tower
will have real cachet. This kite flying operation to get a quick consent
should not be allowed to go any further without serious consideration of a
less intensive mixed development with the Wallis Gilbert Tower at its heart.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Patience of multimedia investors sorely tried
by research findings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Providers of interactive television services will have to wait until the
early years of the next century to see a return on their investment,
according to estimates by Ovum, a London-based consultancy specialising in
information technology.
It says that interactive television, which many believe is poised to become
the domestic face of multimedia, will generate revenues of Dollars 7bn in
2000 in the US and Europe, representing about 26 per cent of all revenues
from multimedia in the home and four per cent of total household expenditure
on consumer electronics.
It points out, however, that the costs of providing products and services
for interactive television will rise from slightly more than Dollars 1bn in
1994 to Dollars 24bn in 2005: 'Costs will be higher than revenues from
subscriptions in the early years of deployment. The market will become
cash-positive around 2002; until then, other sources of revenue such as
advertising will be required.'
Interactive television differs from the traditional variety in the freedom
it affords viewers to control what and when they watch. Technically, it
demands a network server capable of storing and delivering large amounts of
information, a set-top box to control the programme, and a two-way
transmission channel between the two.
Ovum suggest the most popular services are likely to be near-video-on-demand
(nvod): a choice of, say, 20 top movies; the ability to take part in games
and opinion polls; control over the angle from which customers view sports
and games; and home shopping.
The concept of a two-way tv service has, however, existed for at least two
decades. Current interest is being driven by technological advances which
enable low cost distribution of digitised information, competition between
telephone and cable companies, and political initiatives by leaders who see
interactive services as a key to economic recovery.
Interactive television is not, Ovum points out, the information
superhighway: 'It is an extension of the existing cable and direct broadcast
satellite markets.' Ovum sees developmental phases beginning with today's
test of the technology leading to full service provision by 2005 when video
telephones will be integrated with the tv set and teleconferences,
interactive games and communication between subscribers will all be
possible.
The winners will be the customers who will have a broader range of services
to choose from, the content owners (studios and picture libraries), creators
of new programming and hardware suppliers. The principal losers, Ovum
reckons, will be existing video distribution channels - video rental outlets
and cinema chains.

The UK government says the security situation has improved in Egypt, where
two tourists have been killed and 30 wounded in attacks by Moslem militants
since 1992. Mr Tony Baldry, assistant foreign secretary, said after a visit
to Cairo, that the authorities now had the upper hand.
However, visitors should still avoid Assiut in southern Egypt - the region
where the militant Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) had been most active.
Yesterday the group said it had wounded two policemen near the southern town
of Mallawi in a revenge attack for the killing of two Gama'a members by
police.

A general strike is likely to start in Nigeria on Wednesday.
The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), comprising 41 trade unions, decided last
Friday that its 3.5m members would take action after failing to persuade
head of state General Sani Abacha to free presidential claimant Moshood
Abiola and other political detainees.
Shell and other oil companies have been told by the unions to pull out their
expatriate staff.
The west African nation has all but shut down over the crisis prompted by
the arrest of Abiola, the assumed winner of last year's annulled
presidential election, on treason charges.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Wristwatches and brown paper socks -
Michael Skapinker on responses to his request for tips on avoiding jet lag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not eat while you are flying was the advice we gave readers of this page
several weeks ago. Consume as little food as possible and as many
non-alcoholic drinks as you can - and you will never be troubled by jet lag
again, we said.
Many of the travellers who responded to our request for further tips agree.
Most add another piece of advice: the moment you step into the aircraft,
begin adjusting to the time at your destination.
Andrew Marjoribanks of Glasgow recommends purchasing a watch with two time
displays: one with old-fashioned hands and one digital. Set the hands to the
time at your destination and leave the digital display on home time.
One of the criticisms of our no food or alcohol suggestion is that it does
not sound much fun. A New York reader argues in favour of the odd alcoholic
drink, provided you have plenty of water. Do not drink anything carbonated,
he adds.
Others say that the answer is not abstinence, but eating and drinking
quantities appropriate to the meal you would be having if you had already
arrived. So if the cabin crew is serving dinner when it is breakfast time at
your destination, treat the meal as if it were breakfast - that is, do not
overeat and avoid alcohol.
Adjust your sleep as well. Sleep when you would be doing so at your
destination. This assumes you can sleep on aircraft at all.
Jeff Bowman, an international tax specialist at accountants Price Waterhouse
in London, says the key to better sleep is to fly economy. Try to find some
empty seats - the best place to look is at the rear of the aircraft, just in
front of the smokers. Most non-smokers avoid this section if they can;
Bowman copes by turning up the overhead air jets. Lift up the arm rests
(which you cannot do in business class) and stretch out.
The Insomnia Cure Group, based in Bristol, suggests that you spend as much
time outside as you can when you arrive. It says: 'Nothing does more to
acclimatise you to your destination than getting out into the daylight as
soon as possible after arriving. The subtlety of light is essential
information for the brain, which helps to resynchronise your body clock
systems.'
Finally, the mystery of the brown paper socks. We reported reading that
cutting out pieces of brown paper and putting them in your socks is the way
to beat jet lag. You can then eat and drink anything.
Lynda Davies and Liz Carr of the marketing department of Imperial College,
London, say they tried this on a recent flight home from New York and it
worked. Unfortunately, despite working for a leading scientific
establishment, they cannot find anyone who can explain why.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Business Travel: City of moneymakers / Explaining how to
cope with - or even escape - the industrial sprawl of Osaka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Because of the many rivers and canals running through the downtown area, the
people of Osaka like to call the city the 'Venice of Japan'. Yet most of the
waterways are now little more than open sewers, and the grey industrial
sprawl - home to leading electronics manufacturers and textiles companies -
may remind visitors of Birmingham in the UK or Cleveland, Ohio, rather than
the Italian lagoon city.
This is not to say that the spirit of the old mercantile town has been
entirely lost. Many Osakan businessmen still greet each other by asking 'Mo
kari makka?' - which translates as 'Making any money?'
The people remain down-to-earth, and Osakans pride themselves on their
distinct dialect.
With the opening of a new international airport in September, however, Osaka
is trying to promote itself as a refined international city. New high-rise
office and shopping complexes are sprouting in the city centre, while local
store owners and merchants are encouraged to start English lessons.
The Kansai International Airport will be Japan's first 24-hour airport,
offering flights to 44 countries - four times as many as at Osaka's current
Itami Airport. Passengers can also travel on to 22 Japanese cities via
domestic flights, which also have access to the new airport. This is a
convenient change from the current principal international airport, Narita
International, which is three hours away from the nearest domestic airport.
Visitors can also take trains from the airport to Namba, Osaka and Kyoto
stations, while a sea ferry is available to Kobe. Once in Osaka, it is best
to travel around by train and subway. If you have the time and yen, you may
choose to travel by taxi, but many drivers do not speak English and come
from the provinces, so a simple map of your destination will make the
journey easier and faster.
While Osaka offers a variety of places to eat, shop and play, there are no
historical sights to see. Instead, you could spend your spare time exploring
the ancient cities of Nara and Kyoto, which are both only half an hour away
by train from Osaka.
In the past few years, downtown Kyoto has turned into a drab regional city,
with an urban skyline of office buildings, condominiums and department
stores. But many of the 1,000 temples and 400 shrines nestling at the foot
of the mountains, which border the city on three sides, provide pleasant
retreats. Unlike Tokyo or Osaka, Kyoto does not have an efficient intra-city
transport system, so the most effective mode of travel is taxi.
The spring and autumn months are the best times to visit Kyoto, but they are
unfortunately the most crowded. High-school students and groups of elderly
people descend on the main sites by the bus load.
Nara, Japan's first imperial capital, is green and spacious, and offers a
pleasant alternative to the urban bustle of Kyoto. Half of the city is
parkland, where you can roam around, and you can feed the tame deer which
inhabit the commons of Nara Park.
Nara offers a greater variety of historical sites than Kyoto, and it still
has the atmosphere of an ancient city, rather than a centre for property
development like Kyoto.
If on business in Osaka, it is convenient to stay in the central business
area of Umeda. Umeda station is one stop from the terminal for the
Shinkansen (bullet train), which links Osaka with Tokyo. The Hilton, Westin
and Hankyu International hotels, which all have shuttle bus services from
Umeda station, offer packages that include a night's accommodation and
breakfast for about Y20,000 (Pounds 130).
If accompanied by your spouse or family, you could stay in Kyoto or Nara,
which are within commuting distance of Osaka. Both cities have a range of
accommodation: from low-cost business hotels for the budget traveller
suffering from the rise in the yen, to some of Japan's most traditional and
expensive ryokan inns, which offer guests a zen-like atmosphere of serenity.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Socialisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month Tony Blair's election to the leadership of the UK Labour Party
was completed. The three candidates produced two vivid new terms: moderniser
and traditionalist. Like all jargon outside its environment, these words
lose their specific currency outside Socialist politics.
Modernisers are the right and traditionalists the left of the party. Blair
is a moderniser (The Sunday Times, 17 July), unhelpfully described as
'neither Neil Kinnock nor John Smith'.
Moderniser has roots meaning 'measure or limit' (Latin modus and moderator
from moderare), but also a sense of actuality from modo and modernus which
produced modern via medieval French. It is a powerful word which unites
ideas of time, change and shape (from the Latin modulus which produces
model). In the 1940s and 50s, it applied to developing and Commonwealth
countries en route to liberal democracy; it has roots in Weber and Marx. The
OED first usage is Fielding (1748), with Thackeray coining the first current
sense in 1860: 'gunpowder and printing tended to modernise the world.'
Blair's moderniser is closest to theological usage early this century,
bringing the idea of advanced or progressive views.
Opposite moderniser there is traditionalist. This comes from the Latin
tradere (to hand over, deliver, in a sense, to betray) and surfaces in
Voltaire's idea of extradition and the English extradite.
Ironically, the word contains both safeguard and betrayal: handing on and
handing over. Shakespeare coins traditional in Richard III: 'you are too
senseless obstinate . . . too ceremonious and traditional'.
The sense has changed little in the Labour leadership election, with
traditionalist used to describe other people's conservative views.
TS Eliot's essay Tradition and the Individual Talent did for literary
criticism what the Labour party leadership election tried to do for the
party: define the past and shape the future. Eliot thought English
Conservatives thrived in proportion to their distance from intelligent
thought, more Socialism than solecism.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Sport: Atherton and the child within
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a child, I was a compulsive cheat. I would peer into the bag full of
Scrabble tiles, looking for the letters that would complete the word
'quetzal'; I would steal from the Monopoly bank. Like all real cheats, I
would even cheat at patience.
The truism that I was 'only cheating myself' meant nothing to me. All I knew
was that I simply could not bear to lose: it made me feel diminished, it
made me feel ridiculous, and I saw no reason why I should feel these things
when it was so easy to ensure that I did not.
Victory, when it came, was so sweet that it would expunge from my memory all
the machinations that had been necessary to gain it. All that was left to me
was the sensation of winning.
I was reminded of this long-buried amorality by the Michael Atherton saga,
which seems already to have been running for a very long time but which is,
let us be assured, just getting into its stride.
The chief question posed by the incident is obviously that of Atherton's
intentions: was he attempting to give the English attack an unfair
advantage?
The irresistible reply is that, if he was, one could only wish that he had
done it better. But the truth is that it is an impossible question to
answer. Study it as one may, and certainly I have seen it more often than
one of Bob Hoskins' British Telecom adverts, the ball-rubbing footage will
not yield up its secrets. Only the ball-rubber himself knows what his
intentions were.
And so another question, less specific, more general, arises in place of the
unanswerable one.
If Atherton had, in fact, been tampering with the cricket ball, if his
actions had helped England to take a couple of South African wickets, and if
these wickets had helped England to victory, would that have been a victory
worth having, a victory to believe in?
When Ben Johnson left Seoul in 1988 with his 100 metres gold medal, did he
look at it and think, Hurray, I'm the fastest man in the world?
Had Diego Maradona led Argentina to win this year's World Cup, would he have
thought himself entitled to receive the acclaim of millions?
Do those cricketers who have not just a bit of honest dirt in their pockets
but bottle tops, lip salve, miniature cans of Mr Sheen, feel that the
wickets they take are truly their trophies?
Now that I have grown out of my cheating past, I find it hard to believe
that they do.
That is not to say that I no longer feel the urgent desire to win - I still
find losing unbearable - but I also feel that it would be easier to live
with the memory of defeat than with the knowledge of an unreal victory.
Surely, as soon as the straight course of the contest has been bent in any
way, the winning post ceases to have any significance.
Another example relevant to this argument is that of this year's Grand Prix
drivers' championship. Damon Hill was helped to victory at Silverstone by a
penalty inflicted upon Michael Schumacher, who forfeited several seconds in
the race for overtaking Hill on the warm-up lap.
Since then, Schumacher has been further penalised. He has been docked six
points and banned from two Grand Prix (a decision against which he is
appealing); Damon Hill is now within striking distance.
But would a world championship won in such circumstances really satisfy him?
He says that it would, that posterity only remembers who won and not how he
did so, which, of course, is true. Yet victory must surely be soured by the
sense - however slight - that it has been given, rather than earned.
Of course, Schumacher has not been penalised for nothing, and if he loses
the championship because of the Silverstone misdemeanour then that is his
own fault.
But it is the element of uncertainty which creeps in when the straight
course of the contest has been bent that affects winners, should-be winners,
losers, and should-be losers alike.
For example, can Carl Lewis ever be entirely sure that he would have won the
1988 Olympic 100 metres final?
What about all the other races that Ben Johnson ran; all the football
matches that Maradona played; all the cricket matches won by wickets taken
by suspect bowlers? To whom do all those victories truly belong?
And what, in the end, is cheating in sport?
Whatever Michael Atherton was really doing to that fateful ball, whether or
not his action were inside or outside the laws of the game, they were hardly
any diferent from the sort of thing that is done in cricket all the time.
Athletes are constantly taking substances to improve their performances;
obviously these are permitted but only within an arbitrary set of rules.
Legality and illegality are fluid terms in such an environment.
It comes down, as I said before, to intention. Even then, though, I am not
so sure that proven cheats are singled out by the detached, premeditated
quality of their desire to win.
When, 20 years ago, I sat with one hand in the Monopoly bank and the other
placing an hotel on Mayfair, I knew that what I was doing was wrong but it
did not feel wrong.
Within the miasma of intensity, expectation, and desperation that must
sometimes fill the sportsman's head, creating conditions that no longer
relate to reality or responsibility, who is to say that he does not view his
actions with the uncomprehending wilfulness of a child?

FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: City air pollution breathes fresh life into
drug sales - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO, VICTOR MALLET, LOUISE KEHOE and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, BANGKOK, SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Although Japan has been successful in reducing its air pollution by half
during the past 20 years thanks to rigorous curbs - nitrous oxide levels in
Tokyo are 26 per cent lower than in London - the number of patients who
suffer from hay fever and asthma has risen sharply in the past few years due
to the increase in pollen which reacts with pollutants in the air.
This has opened a whole new market for drugs companies, which offer various
treatments and masks. Kowa, a pharmaceutical maker, says the mask market has
grown into a Y2.4bn business in which more than 50 companies compete to sell
their 'clean air' masks which use anti-germ and static filters.
Levels of sulphur dioxides and nitrous oxides have fallen sharply, but
incidents of chemical oxidant smog, created by a combination of air
pollutants, strong sun rays and an increase in ozone, have doubled in five
years.
Elsewhere in the region, air pollution is at critical levels due to
governments pressing for economic growth and high temperatures aggravating
the problem. According to the World Health Organization, of the seven cities
in the world with the worst air pollution, five are in Asia.
Emission from vehicles is the largest cause of air pollution in most Asian
cities, where fuels are among the dirtiest in the world with sulphur in
diesel fuel and lead in gasoline. Pollution caused by industry and building
heat are other sources in the colder climates, especially in China.
In the Thai capital Bangkok, bus passengers and pedestrians often hold a
clean handkerchief across mouth and nose.
Air pollution is particularly dangerous in a country where so much of life
is lived on the street. Throughout Bangkok, people eat at roadside noodle
stalls; they not only breathe in lead from vehicle exhausts, they eat it.
Recent studies suggest that air pollution causes hundreds of deaths in
Bangkok each year. In 1990 more than 1m of the city's inhabitants were
treated for respiratory problems linked to dirty air.
Across the Pacific ocean, California has the toughest anti-air pollution
regulations in the world. For 20 years all new cars have been fitted with
catalytic converters while car owners need to obtain a 'smog certificate'.
The restrictions have provoked complaints from industries, but have prompted
innovative businessmen to create a market where companies' permits to emit
pollution are traded.
In London, the government issued smog warnings three times in July after
ozone levels rose high enough to trigger asthma and other breathing
difficulties among vulnerable groups. The Department of Environment asked
people to use cars less.
A DoE survey, during one of the ozone peaks, showed that few complied - only
10 per cent of motorists decided not to use their cars on at least one
occasion when they would otherwise have done so, according to the survey.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Tax exemptions during rail strike - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that the rail strike is disrupting three working days, many employees
are having to make their way into work, regardless of convenience or cost.
Most will have to pay more than their usual travel expenses, for taxis or
for an overnight stay in a hotel.
Will they face a higher tax bill if they then claim the expenses from their
employer? Usually, where the cost of travel between work and home is met or
reimbursed by an employer, the employee is taxable on the amount paid. The
same is true for accommodation costs.
However, accountant Touche Ross points out that since 1986, the Inland
Revenue has operated a concession in cases where industrial action is
involved. Reimbursed travel and 'reasonable' costs incurred in getting an
employee to work during transport strikes, are tax-exempt. Neither employer
nor employee has to report these payments to their tax office and employers
who prefer to meet the cost directly can do so without fearing the tax
liability.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Invest in a sun hat and save your skin - Style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHY PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When they give you sunburn levels in the papers and on Teletext, you can be
sure that there is a risk out there, thanks to the hole in the ozone layer
over northern Europe. That means concern about sun exposure here and on a
Mediterranean holiday.
Those who ring Freephone line 0800 556655 will hear a soothing voice telling
them about the dangers of skin cancer and ageing from exposure to WA and WB
rays.
'Wear a wide-brimmed hat and good sunglasses,' says the voice.
This is the most important instruction of all. Nothing protects the skin
from pollution and sunburn like a hat. And yet it's often something that
only the mother-of-the-bride invests in.
If you're going to change your ways and wear a hat, then it makes sense to
buy one that combines glamour and practicality.
A cheap, chain store straw hat that is too small and perched on the back of
the head is no good at all. A good Panama designed for a man would be
infinitely better (Herbert Johnson, Bond Street, London, Wl), especially as
they are built for travelling and look even better on a woman.
Gilly Forge (071-603 3833) and Patricia Underwood (Browns, South Molton
Street, London, WI) both use a fine Italian straw that really does travel
without crushing although they might cost you upwards of Pounds 75.
Herald and Heart in SW8 always have untrimmed straws with brims of every
size. The Hat Shop (58 Neal St, London, WC2 and 30 Wilson Street, Glasgow)
offers alternatives to the basic straw - a large-brimmed cotton hat with
safari overtones, a fashionable fishing pull-on or a navy casquette. All
good staples that don't cost more than the holiday itself and don't look
like an afterthought or a panic midday purchase.
Incidentally when you try a hat on, look yourself straight in the eye. You
can't wear a hat casually without pencilling in your eyebrows and
considering your make-up.
There are no hard and fast rules but the crown of the hat should balance the
shape of your face from the eyebrows down. It is a mathematical equation.
Therefore, if you've got a big face make the crown of your hat higher in
proportion.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Marlowe fans strut their stuff - Interiors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electric fans work wonders in environments which lack efficient
air-conditioning. But, as with umbrellas, you never think about them until
you need one. When a really sweltering day arrives, the tendency is to buy
the first fan you can find. As the seasons change, this unappealing object
is then stored in some inaccessible cupboard. Far better to buy a
handsome-looking fan that you will want to keep on display all year.
Highly effective in stirring life into air on even the muggiest days, the
Cinni all-metal electric fan also provides a treat for the eye. It is
pleasingly old-fashioned with gleaming steel blades whirling inside a
circular wire cage. This solidly-built design classic is one fan you won't
want to hide away when autumn comes.
Viewing the fan head as it steadily oscillates through 90 degrees, there is
a temptation to imagine oneself as Philip Marlowe awaiting a dangerously
curvaceous client on a sticky LA night. In fact RK Narayan or Vikram Seth
are more appropriate to bring to mind since the Cinni range is manufactured
in Varanasi, India.
The only drawback is price. Table-top versions range from the tiny 200mm fan
(Pounds 100 chrome, Pounds 82.50 black) to the larger 400mm model (Pounds
138.75 chrome, Pounds 117 black). Most impressive is the 400mm pedestal fan
which stands 4ft high and at full blast creates a turbulence which would
register double figures on the Beaufort scale (Pounds 225 chrome, Pounds 185
black.)
Imported by the Freud Shop, 198 Shaftesbury Avenue, London, WC2 (Tel:
071-831 1071,) Cinni fans are also sold by John Lewis, The Conran Shop,
Heals, Harrods and Leading Edge stores. Ceiling-mounted versions are
available from the Freud Shop. A 1,500mm-diameter fan with splendid gold
trim costs only Pounds 150.
If you are not too concerned about looks, there are plenty of plastic fans
which do much the same job as the Cinni for around a quarter the price. The
Pifco range, for example, includes a 6in clip-on fan (Pounds 16.99), a 12in
table fan (Pounds 34.99) and a 16in pedestal fan (Pounds 49.99).
Unfortunately, they have about as much character as a paper cup.
One of the more unusual designs of electric fan is the Goldair Vertical
Oscillating Fan (Pounds 69.50). Made in China, it measures about 3ft high by
6in square. When operating, the whole squat column turns through 90 degrees.
Though advertised as giving 'vibration-free operation', the one displayed in
John Lewis, Oxford Street, had a decidedly wobbly action. While adding to
the entertainment of office life, there would always be the possibility of
the Goldair setting off for a robotic stroll in order to chat up the
photocopier.
Just Pounds 4.95 will buy you a Jegs Handfan, which seems to work well as
long as you don't mind looking like a modern-day pasha. At the opposite end
of the price scale is the Carrier Holiday: (Pounds 999 from Selfridges),
described as a 'portable air conditioner', ('wheelable' would be more
accurate). While providing an instant arctic blast, it ejects an equal flow
of hot air from a plastic pipe at the back which has to be expelled through
an open window.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Andrew Longhurst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long spell of uninterrupted peace on a desert island might seem ideal for
the complex task of devising a lawful and effective way of sharing the
Pounds 1.8bn cash which Lloyds Bank has offered for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society among the society's members. But Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G
chief executive, would use his time to indulge his interest in computers,
French and golf rather than to run his business from afar.
You can take one piece of office equipment with you, apart from a telephone
and a fax - what would it be?
I have not had enough opportunity to play with computers recently, so I
would like a powerful PC and modem. My background is in computers; I joined
C&amp;G as data processing manager and I read maths and statistics at
university. My first act would be to send a message to C&amp;G saying that I
retire and I'd use the computer to play Civilisation - it's a very long game
that starts in 3000BC and goes on into the future, as you create your own
civilisation.
How would you cope with life on the island?
I'm good at being on my own, but I do like to have the facility of
communicating with people. I would hope that occasionally a rescue vessel
might offer me a job, so if I got bored I could maybe get on one of those
and start a new career.
Would you become a beach bum?
No - I'd want to maintain a lot of mental activity. But I wouldn't try to
stick to a schedule - I'd get up when I felt like it, play on the computer
when I felt like it, and so on. When I tired of the computer I would take a
sand wedge on to the beach. I can't play out of bunkers at all and it would
be a good opportunity to practise.
You can take one film with you, what would it be?
I'd take Jean de Florette. I admire Jean's tenacity, persistence and will to
succeed, even though his farming projects in Provence ultimately fail.
And a book?
I would hope to have a CD-Rom program called Classic Library 2000 on the
computer, which would keep me well supplied with literature. Even if I'm not
allowed that, I would still like the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.
What food and drink would you like on the island?
This ties in with my luxury - 100 tons of best-quality top soil - as seen on
Gardeners' World - so I could grow vegetables. The key thing would be that
they'd be fresh and I'd have grown them. I'd also enjoy fishing and cooking.
To drink I would have New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.
You can take one person with you - who would it be?
Catherine Deneuve, the French film actress. eI think she would improve my
French conversation.
How would you like to be remembered?
It's not so much a question of liking to be remembered, as liking people to
want me back again. I'd like to be missed rather than remembered.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Management: Betrayed, unloved and angry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It did not promise to be a great night out. The venue was Wembley Conference
Centre, London, and the occasion was the annual employees' evening for one
of Britain's biggest companies. Local staff had been invited to bring a
guest for a Q and A session with the company's board, hosted by a well-known
media personality. Afterwards, there was to be a prize draw, a buffet and
drinks.
My first response to the occasion was incredulity. How could the management
be so out of touch to expect workers and their dates to give up an evening
to hear company propaganda, eat a sausage roll and drink a glass of nasty
white wine? As I sat in the half-empty hall listening to a deafening disco
beat and waiting for the top team to file on to the stage, I felt my doubts
confirmed.
In the event the evening was grim, but not in the kitsch, pointless way I
had bargained for. Instead of the usual queries about broken coffee machines
or dirty windows, there followed a barrage of hostile questions. Employees
of this would-be world-class company complained about their job insecurity,
their lack of prospects and about planned changes to their hours. They
ridiculed the company's new-fangled mission statement with its fine words
about mutual respect. The graduate employees, the rank and file and the
middle managers spoke with one voice: they felt betrayed, put-upon, unloved
and angry. Even some of the spouses had their say. One who worked in the
civil service said that at least her employer recognised there was no point
in talking about customer care unless the staff were also cared for. With
each successive sally came louder cheers from the crowd.
The panel, equipped with all the media training money can buy, ducked and
weaved. They talked of external pressures, about the need to be competitive,
about going through a hard patch. Their answers were long and tangential, as
if trying to postpone the next onslaught. But all to no avail. The crowd
continued to hustle.
What a public relations disaster, I started to think. An employee who began
the evening faintly resentful would surely have ended it mutinous, having
everyone else's grievances to add to their own.
Yet I left with a different conclusion. It is not easy for senior management
of big companies to communicate with its employees. They cannot hope to meet
people informally, and company magazines and videos are a one-sided way of
keeping in touch. You have to give this unhappy management some credit for
being brave enough to face the workers directly. One only hopes they were
shaken enough by the experience to ask themselves why motivation is so low,
rather than heave a sigh of relief that they have a full year before having
to go through that ordeal again.
The real message from the evening was not about the virtues or otherwise of
employee meetings. It was that big companies such as this one, which have
done well by their customers and their shareholders, have been neglecting
their employees. Half have lost their jobs and the rest are left desperately
demoralised. Dealing humanely with the ones who go is the easy part. Dealing
with those that remain is a more serious problem than an annual invitation
to Wembley can hope to solve.
The other day I heard a perfectly sensible person saying that she needed
half an hour's 'face time' with a colleague. Half an hour's what? Surely she
did not mean the two of them needed to reapply their make-up? It turned out
she simply wanted to talk to her colleague in person. It cannot be long
before speaking on the telephone is known as 'ear and mouth time'.
'Face time' apart, I detect a degree of imagination creeping into the latest
management speak. Michael Johnson, author of Business Buzzwords, has sent me
some brand new examples, a few of which are almost useful. One such is
'brains on sticks', which refers to all those MBAs and wet-behind-the-ears
management consultants who have read the books but do not know how to
comport themselves when faced with a seasoned business person.
Another nice one is 'Achilles mouth' - the tendency to say things better
left unsaid. This trait is becoming rarer as managers get more uniform; it
is therefore sad to see one of the finest Achilles mouths on record, Roland
Shaw (who once described me as a semi-literate, ill-informed hack), retiring
this week as chairman of Premier Consolidated Oilfields. But my favourite
concept is that of the Pavarotti manager, who is so booked up that he can't
see you for years ahead. Robert Horton used to be a case in point. When
chairman of BP he told me one November that he did not have a free spot in
his diary until June. In his new incarnation at Railtrack he is having to be
a bit more spontaneous - the Pavarotti manager would not cut much ice with
Jimmy Knapp.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Management: Measuring up to success - Growing numbers of UK
companies are turning to benchmarking to improve their performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benchmarking - the practice of comparing business practices between
companies - has come of age in the UK. More than three-quarters of the UK's
top 1,000 companies claim to use benchmarking to assess and improve their
performance, according to a recent Gallup survey.
Such findings should perhaps be treated with caution. The success of
management fashions is often exaggerated by the efforts of publicity-seeking
pioneers, business-hungry consultants and the natural unwillingness of
managers to admit to pollsters that they are neglecting state-of-the-art
management practices.
Nonetheless the benchmarking success stories are the stuff of management
textbooks. Rover halved its test times after benchmarking against Honda.
Lucas Industries cut the number of shopfloor grades four-fold following a
benchmarking exercise against a German plant. British Rail cut the time
taken to clean a train to eight minutes after benchmarking against British
Airways.
But despite the enthusiasm about benchmarking, there is little consensus
about how best to do it. Even the meaning of the term causes 'considerable
confusion', according to the Gallup survey, conducted on behalf of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand and the CBI. Knowing where to start can be daunting for newcomers,
particularly if they are unwilling to spend large sums on management
consultancy.
The old hands make it sound easy. 'Benchmarking is so simple. It is just
like a business meeting. The most effective benchmarking is to sit with
another professional and talk,' says Shaun Pantling of Rank Xerox, a
subsidiary of Xerox, the US copier company which pioneered benchmarking in
the early 1980s.
When Rank Xerox decided to improve its call handling, it approached
companies with a strong reputation for answering calls quickly such as the
RAC and British Gas. 'We have re-engineered our call handling as a result,'
says Pantling.
British Airways also makes benchmarking sound simple. When it wanted to
improve the service on its frequent-flier programme, it visited the Oriental
Hotel in Bangkok - renowned for pampering its guests - to pick up tips on
how to record details of its customers' preferences. When it wanted to
improve its passenger handling areas, it analysed its weak points and then
studied some of its rivals.
Benchmarking against a company which appears to be the best at a particular
activity is the most popular option for large, confident companies. 'If you
benchmark against mediocrity, you end up with mediocrity,' says Pantling.
But it is not necessarily the best option for smaller, less experienced
companies. Studies in the US, Japan and Germany have found that
inexperienced companies which try to match the techniques of world-class
performers often make things worse by trying to do too much, too soon.
In any case, small, obscure companies are generally unable to ask leading
companies to benchmark with them. 'A small, not well-known company would
find it difficult to knock on Marks and Spencer's door and say 'will you
benchmark with us'. It tends to end up with small and medium-sized companies
benchmarking with each other,' says Graham Whitney of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
One solution to the problem of finding a benchmarking partner is to join a
club or network. Over the last 18 months, a number of these groups has
sprung up to provide companies with a pool of willing partners.
The main disadvantage of a club is that it tends to restrict the number of
potential partners. But even experienced benchmarkers, with large networks
of contacts, find that belonging to a club makes benchmarking simpler.
'There are a lot of advantages of a club when it comes to finding the right
contact within an organisation,' says Barry Povey, a quality management
consultant at IBM.
Most of the large management consultants also have benchmarking divisions,
which draw on their large client bases for potential partners. Price
Waterhouse, for instance, runs a Customer Excellence Benchmarking Club,
which has 45 members.
Another large group of benchmarking clubs is run by trade associations. The
British Footwear Manufacturing Association has organised two clubs to look
at factory performance and pre-production engineering and design.
Many were started as a result of the DTI's Benchmarking Challenge, which
last November awarded Pounds 500,000 to 13 trade associations to set up
benchmarking clubs. These clubs generally focus on providing industry
trends; firms tend to be reluctant to divulge information on their processes
to competitors.
Benchmarking against other companies in the same industry is the most
popular form of benchmarking, practised by 80 per cent of large companies,
according to Gallup. But the information offered is usually limited and it
rarely helps companies identify radically innovative practices.
More often, clubs offer companies the chance to benchmark against companies
in other industries. For example, the Benchmarking Centre, which was set up
in Hemel Hempstead a year ago, has 40 companies including SmithKline
Beecham, TSB, IBM and ICL. The centre puts companies together in pairs or in
groups to examine issues such as management information systems, supply
chains, customer satisfaction, human resources and productivity.
Both the management and the members of the club say its strengths lie in the
loyalty and support that members can give each other. 'It is a place where
we can go for help, where we can go for information, where we can go for
like-minded companies which will share information and results,' says Gordon
Cossar of Dexion, a shelving manufacturer.
Yet finding a willing partner is just part of the battle. A problem that has
dogged benchmarking from its inception is whether the comparisons of
particular activities between companies have any validity.
Even apparently straightforward measures such as the productivity of a
finance or personnel department can be complicated. 'Why one company has a
bigger personnel department than another is to do with complexity, staff
turnover ratio and culturally driven factors about how highly companies
value people,' says Keith Roberts of PIMS, a management consultancy which
runs the PIMS Benchmarking Council.
If companies use inappropriate benchmarks, it can raise unrealistic
expectations on the part of senior management that can lead to dejection
within the ranks of a company. 'There have been cases of chief executives
using it as a weapon to bash their business,' says Roberts. 'There is a
danger that people will become disillusioned.'
Another potential morale problem arises when the benchmarking exercise
concentrates on productivity or financial performance. 'There is a great
chance that if people are being measured on a financial basis, they do get
paranoid about their jobs,' says Steve Wright of Brown &amp; Root, the
engineering group.
Another potential pitfall for companies embarking on benchmarking is
insufficient preparation. Too often, benchmarking has meant unfocused visits
to companies and factories, a practice consultants dismiss as 'industrial
tourism'.
'A lot of people try benchmarking and fail miserably. They are not prepared.
They don't understand their own processes before they visit a company,' says
Marcus Boyle of Arthur Andersen, the management consultants.
This point is echoed by Glen Peters of Price Waterhouse. 'One of the
mistakes people make is that they don't look at themselves in the mirror.
They need to do a thorough benchmark on themselves.'
Some companies find the process of self-examination one of the most useful
aspects of benchmarking. 'What I found useful about the exercise was as much
the exercise itself - the discipline of classifying our processes and
putting numbers on it - as the report at the end,' says Steve Wright,
continuous improvement manager of Brown &amp; Root, who took part in a
benchmarking club organised by PIMS, which examined the costs of personnel
functions.
Many managers play down the importance of the benchmarking report. The
reports that emerge from benchmarking studies are often treated with a
degree of caution. This information - on how a company compares with the
average score of the other companies within the group on a particular
activity - may be useful in alerting companies to weaknesses, but should not
be taken too literally.
'Classic, cost-based benchmarking projects where there is not adequate
analysis of performance are dangerous,' says Alan Braithwaite of LCP, which
runs a benchmarking network set up with the Cranfield School of Management
and Logistics. 'It can be a wild goose chase.'
Whitney concurs. 'If people just focus on numbers they get frustrated
because it does not address how they achieved better performances,' he says.
Too much effort is put into number-crunching and diagnosing the area that
needs change and not enough into thinking about to improve the processes.
The emphasis should be on learning, rather than just comparison.
The possibility of learning from other companies is dependent on a degree of
openness. 'The major gains come if you loosen the confidentiality,' says
Boyle.
But frequently companies are simply not willing to be open. When Price
Waterhouse announced plans to hold a forum of all its benchmarking club
members across Europe in October to exchange ideas on best practice, it
found that about half the club was reluctant to take part. 'People are very
guarded. I get more information from people on an unattributable basis,'
says Peters.
But on balance, the openness, rather than the secrecy, of companies is
remarkable. Companies that are enthusiastic benchmarkers often point to
public relations benefits, which outweigh their concern about giving away
information to competitors.
'The information gets to our competitors; it also gets to our customers,'
says Cossar. Benchmarking 'is part of the image of Rank Xerox as being a
quality organisation,' says Pantling.
Even companies which claim to be highly-proficient at certain processes
claim to benefit from exchanging ideas and information. 'Generally if
someone wants to benchmark you always learn something,' says Pantling.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Call for reduction in excise duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain must cut its excise duties to the same levels as France in order to
prevent the cross-Channel bootlegging of alcohol, says London Economics, the
consultancy.
The group says in a report that legitimate cross-Channel trade in alcohol
costs Britain between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m a year, while illegal
trade results in further losses. The price of an average bottle of wine is
69 per cent higher in Britain than in France, while a case of beer costs 123
per cent more.
The consultancy estimates that cross-Channel travellers could soon be
spending Pounds 1bn a year on alcohol, and that by 2000, more than 10 per
cent of UK spending on alcoholic beverages will occur in France.
It adds that the trade also limits the ability of the government to
discourage alcohol abuse by raising prices.
The report has been backed by Tesco, the supermarket chain, which said it
lost Pounds 38m of alcohol sales to French retailers last year.
Tesco is calling for a freeze on excise duties and a harmonisation of
European Union duty rates.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Independent cuts price 20p 'to protect circulation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent last night cut its cover price by 20p to 30p in a move which
could cost more than Pounds 14m a year in revenue, although the newspaper
said the move was temporary and the price may increase at a later stage.
The move to cut the price of the weekday Independent means that The
Independent will now sell at the same price as The Daily Telegraph and below
those of the Daily Mail and the Daily Express.
It has been clear for some time that the directors of Newspaper Publishing,
which owns both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, were planning
a cover price cut. It has been acknowledged that last year's decision to
increase the cover price to 50p was a mistake.
The main price cuts tested in different areas were to 40p and 45p. The fact
that The Independent has now gone for a deeper price cut suggests that it is
facing a more serious loss of circulation than has been supposed.
Shareholders last night made clear that the price cut was seen as tactical
and designed to protect circulation until significant editorial improvements
are made. Mr Ian Hargreaves, former deputy editor of the Financial Times,
takes over as editor of The Independent in the middle of this month and
editorial changes are expected to follow.
The main problem with last night's announcement for Newspaper Publishing is
the difficulty of increasing the price of the paper after consumers have got
used to 30p.
The decision on The Independent's cover price decision will also put
pressure on The Guardian, which has kept out of the price wars at 45p a
copy. Mr Peter Preston, its chairman and editor, said last night: 'We will
continue to watch the situation, which so far has had very little impact
upon us.'

FT  01 AUG 94 / Rethink on London's healthcare urged by policy centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is today urged to respond to mounting concern over its plans
to reshape healthcare in London.
In an intervention that will be highly embarrassing for ministers, Mr Robert
J Maxwell, chief executive of the King's Fund health policy centre, says in
a pamphlet that there is 'widespread concern' that the changes are putting
patients at risk.
He says: 'At a minimum there is a need to re-establish confidence, revive
timescales and review the management of the transition.'
Mr Maxwell's comments will prove particularly difficult for the government
because it was a King's Fund report two years ago that first recommended
what has become the government's policy of reducing hospital beds in London
and diverting resources to family doctor and community services. Some
hospitals, including St Bartholomew's in the City, are scheduled to close,
while others, among them Guy's and St Thomas', are due to merge.
Mr Maxwell argues that the case for tilting London's healthcare towards
primary services, with specialist hospital activities organised around fewer
centres, remains overwhelming.
However, he says, while there have been gains over the past 18 months,
including improvements in primary services, there have also been weaknesses
with 'a deterioration in many London hospitals, a decline in public
confidence and a lack of communication of what is actually happening'.
The government, he says, should not back away from change because it is
difficult or unpopular but neither should it continue with present policies
regardless of opposition and criticism.
He proposes a number of changes in the handling of the transition. He also
calls on the government to agree that there should be no further reduction
in hospital beds while the pressure on beds and accident and emergency
departments 'both remain as intense as they do now'.
The government faces dilemmas of timing. Hospital closures are unpopular
with the public and the timetable for achieving them is so long that the
future of London's healthcare is certain to be an issue at the next general
election.
Immediate problems are exacerbated by the fact that inner-London hospitals
are losing patients under the National Health Service's new contract funding
arrangements and rely on subsidies to keep going. Mr Maxwell warns that in
several areas of London 'the financial situation is one that continually
threatens to go out of control and to drive damaging cutbacks in service'.

FT  01 AUG 94 / BT plans to shed 50,000 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is aiming to shed a further one-third of its
workforce in the medium term. This will lead to about 50,000 redundancies in
addition to the nearly 90,000 imposed in a cost-cutting exercise over the
past four years.
The redundancies, some of which may be compulsory, will reduce BT's
workforce to about 100,000, less than two-fifths of its size in 1990.
Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said in an interview with the Financial
Times that 'roughly speaking' he regarded 100,000 employees to be his goal
for servicing BT's existing network.
He refused to specify a precise timescale for the reduction, and said this
would not be fixed until this year's target of 15,000 redundancies had been
achieved and the company had reviewed its strategy.
He declined to give a commitment not to resort to compulsory redundancies to
secure the reductions 'over the next five years or whatever it is', raising
the prospect of job losses proceeding at the rate of about 10,000 a year
after the present financial year.
'The commitment is to do the very best we can through voluntary redundancy,'
he said. 'But clearly it gets stickier as time goes on.'
BT has so far achieved its redundancy targets through volunteers attracted
by generous severances.
It appears, however, that BT may be finding it more difficult to find
volunteers as the focus shifts to management grades. BT is this year seeking
to shed more than 6,000 of its 35,000 managers.
The move comes amid serious discontent among BT employees at the scale of
job losses and uncertainty about the future, reflected in an angry meeting
of BT employees attended by Sir Iain last week. Most management grades have
had their salaries frozen this year, and managers were the most outspoken at
last week's meeting.
Sir Iain acknowledged the 'genuine feelings of uncertainty' at BT,
particularly among managers. He said they were similar to those prevalent in
the company in 1990-91, when nearly 20 per cent of managers were made
redundant and the number of management grades was reduced from 11 to five.
However, he said that a recent survey showed an improvement in overall staff
morale last year.
BT has set aside Pounds 750m for redundancies this year. Its first-quarter
results, published last week, showed it has spent just Pounds 54m so far.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Lords hit at EC over visa list plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A House of Lords report published today accuses the European Commission of
exceeding its powers by seeking to impose visa requirements that narrow the
drawbridge to 'fortress Europe'.
Citizens of Commonwealth countries now entitled to make 'short-stay' visits
to the UK would be affected by a proposed regulation establishing a list of
countries whose nationals would require visas to visit any state of the
European Union.
The European communities committee calls for a 'significant pruning' of the
proposed list. This call is aimed particularly at removing Commonwealth
countries, whose citizens are more likely to go to the UK than to other
member states.
The report also advocates stronger safeguards to accompany the introduction
of a blanket ban on undesirable immigrants throughout the European Union.
Under an external frontiers convention proposed by the European Commission
all those named on a computerised joint list would be barred from all 12
member states.
The new regime would help to ensure, for example, that a person deported
from France would not be able to travel back to Frankfurt or Brussels and
then to French territory.
The committee also says that specific arrangements for airports in the
proposed convention do not take adequate account of the special position of
London as an international airport handling a great number of transit
passengers who are kept 'airside' and do not undergo passport checks.
In a recommendation which disagrees with government policy the committee
says the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice should be extended to
settle disputes and questions arising from the proposed convention referred
to it by national tribunals.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Bank sounds warning on lack of investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment could be undermined by the high rates of return that companies
are demanding on projects, the Bank of England has warned.
The warning follows a report from the Confederation of British Industry last
week which found that most companies had not adjusted their investment
assessments to take account of the recent trend of low inflation.
The Bank's warning, contained in an article in its quarterly bulletin, is
based on an informal survey of 250 companies conducted in March and adds
further weight to the CBI's findings. It notes that more than 70 per cent of
businesses questioned had not reduced their target rates of return, while
just 25 per cent had revised their investment appraisal techniques to take
account of low inflation.
The main reason, it says, is that most companies argued that investment
decisions were affected by longer-term considerations, and saw 'little
reason yet to adjust their longer-term expectations of inflation rates and
the cost of capital'.
These findings have prompted Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, to warn that
companies are missing profitable investment opportunities by continuing to
demand high rates of return. This view is disputed by many companies and
analysts who argue that high rates of return are not the only factor holding
back investment.
However Mr Andrew Ward-low, head of the Bank's conjectural assessment and
projections division, and author of the report, takes a more cautious line.
Although companies' slowness to adjust their investment criterion may
undermine investment in the future, it may not have been critical to
investment when the survey was conducted in March, Mr Wardlow says.
He adds: 'A further period of monetary stability may be needed before a more
fundamental adjustment in behaviour becomes widespread.'
The nominal rate of return on projects that companies are demanding - about
20 per cent according to the Bank's survey - was not previously unreasonable
given that producer price inflation was running at an average of 9.5 per
cent between 1970 and 1990, the report notes.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Societies braced for legislation: A regulator who would
welcome a permissive system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies could soon be required to set up committees to represent
members' views to their boards under proposals to be floated by the Treasury
as part of its review of societies' legislation.
A consultation paper to be published early next month will set out options
for strengthening the voice of members in societies and encouraging them to
play a more active role.
The paper will also look at ways of enabling societies to offer a wider
range of activities, allowing them to compete more effectively in personal
financial services.
Ms Rosalind Gilmore, head of the sector's regulator, the Building Societies
Commission, believes that the Treasury review will lead to legislation.
She said that the most likely outcome was a decision to shift from a system
which specifies the activities that societies can undertake to one in which
a society is clearly defined, but can then carry out any line of activity
not expressly forbidden. 'The most likely next piece of legislation is the
one that establishes an identified building-society sector - which
recognises what they are but makes the move from a prescriptive to a
permissive system. That would be a good outcome.'
This would enable societies to respond more flexibly to competition from the
banks and others, reinforcing the confidence in mutuality expressed by
society chief executives.
A survey from stockbrokers UBS, due out tomorrow, shows that fewer society
chief executives expect the large societies to convert to PLC status,
compared with five years ago. At that time, as Abbey National converted,
there were widespread predictions that the other large societies would
follow, leaving just small, relatively insignificant societies in mutual
ownership.
Instead, Abbey has remained the only one to convert and the Pounds 1.8bn
cash offer by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester seems, in spite of
growing bank interest, unlikely to set an immediate trend.
Some of the credit for the continuing future of the sector should go to the
commission. It has maintained a fine balance between preventing societies
from expanding into areas for which they are unsuited without hampering
their ability to diversify around their core business.
However the greater flexibility which is contributing to the sector's
prospects is also adding to the debate about the commission's future. It is
argued that as societies become more like banks the need for a separate
regulator from the the Bank of England is reduced.
Ms Gilmore is not convinced. 'I think we have a sensible, contained remit,
and a cost-effective form of regulation. I think we'll be there in the 21st
century.' There may be grounds for this optimism in the Treasury's
reluctance to tackle how changes to societies' legislation would affect
regulatory arrangements.
Although Ms Gilmore supports a more permissive system, she is cooler about
the idea of mutual-bank status in which Halifax building society, the UK's
largest, has expressed particular interest. She said: 'I can see why Halifax
would like to be seen as a bank in special circumstances - like overseas
markets where building societies are not so easily recognised. But it's only
fair to the public here that they should be able to understand what a
building society is.'
On greater involvement by society members she sounds more positive than some
society chief executives: 'The interesting question is how in a mutual, or
very diffused, ownership you actually get the members taking a bit more
direct part in what happens.'
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said when he
announced the first stage of the review that ministers felt members should
be able to hold society directors to account more effectively. One proposal
he mentioned was reserving places for member representatives on the board of
a society.
Another way of increasing member activity would be to set up a national
'members' council', funded by societies, to act as a voice for the 33m
society members.
The Treasury may also seek to recognise the differing interests of investing
members and borrowing members.
Many building society boards are likely to resist moves to create new
channels of member representation, arguing that they are already accountable
to their members. However they, like Ms Gilmore, are likely to welcome an
enhancement of their powers, although many contrasts have been drawn - to
societies' disadvantage - between structures in a mutual organisation and a
limited company.
Two weeks ago Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers'
Association, called for improvements in societies' accountability, saying
that they should be required to consult members on changes in strategy.
Ms Gilmore described his assessment as 'broadly not right'. He added:
'Already new powers are adoptable, new ventures would routinely be the
subject of comment in the report and accounts.
'Like any board, the rules may be very wide - the board is there to manage
the business and there are a lot of things which, under the rules, it can
do. I don't see a vast difference between the two situations.'
Whatever the future for large societies and the commission, Ms Gilmore will
have departed. She has announced her intention to stand down towards the end
of the year and her successor is expected to be announced later this month.
Her advice to her successor is typically pragmatic: 'Get out and about - go
to lots of review meetings with societies and listen. Decide it's going to
be a pleasure, because it's sure going to be hard work.'

A machine-tool builder has achieved a rare success in the industry's
equivalent of carrying coals to Newcastle - selling general purpose
machining centres to Japan, the world's largest producer.
Helped by the strong yen and by recent productivity and manufacturing
improvements, Birmingham-based Cincinnati Milacron UK is undercutting
Japanese rivals in their home market with its low-cost Arrow 500 machining
centres - multi-function machine tools.
The Birmingham company is owned by Cincinnati Milacron of the US but the
Arrow, along with its larger counterparts the Sabre and Lancer, was
developed and designed in the UK and is being made solely at Birmingham for
markets worldwide.
The Arrow 500 was launched earlier this year in Japan at a price of Y7.8m
(Pounds 52,000) which is understood to be at least 20 per cent cheaper than
rival Japanese machines.
Mr Mike Colvin, the UK company's export sales and marketing manager, said
several machines had already been sold in Japan. He had been astounded at
the response from big names and smaller engineering companies.
Trade between the UK and Japan in machine tools is normally a one-way
affair. Japan was the biggest exporter of machine tools to the UK last year
with sales of Pounds 90m, down 35 per cent on 1992, but UK exports the other
way were just Pounds 4m, down 45 per cent.
Last year Japan was only the 21st biggest export market for UK machine
tools.
Milacron has had some success selling its plastics machinery and more
specialised products in Japan but it is believed to be years since it sold a
general purpose machining centre there.
Mr John Bloxham, managing director of the UK company, said the Arrow had
been a 'mindblowing' success since its launch. The machine was first shown
at an exhibition in Germany a year ago.
Overall production of machining centres at Birmingham would double this year
to more than 1,000 units, he said. Arrows will account for about 40 per
cent. The company is taking on more than 40 new employees, lifting its
workforce to 360.

The Hundred Group, which consists of the finance directors of companies in
the FTSE-100 share index, has issued a briefing note on the growing

FT  01 AUG 94 / Offshore industry assets reported
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Big international companies continue to dominate the UK's offshore oil and
gas industry, says Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultants,
in a report published today.
Wood Mackenzie points out that British companies account for only 43 per
cent of the Pounds 40.2bn of total UK upstream assets in exploration and
production. The figure assumes that Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group, is counted
as wholly British.
British Petroleum, however, remains the leading company in the sector,
accounting for 14 per cent of the total value. It is followed by British Gas
with 12 per cent of the total assets.

Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, told the annual
Engineering Assembly in Cambridge last week that details are being
determined for a new reformed council, which is the umbrella body for 41
professional engineering institutions.
The new council would have a senate and two boards - one for the profession
and one for regulation. Sir John said this would 'allow us to speak and act
with unity when appropriate but allow the individual institutions to develop
their own particular role and specialisation'.

Fears that pay pressures would be heightened by the April tax increases, as
employees sought to restore spending power, have proved unfounded, a report
by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay analysts, says.
Its figures show that pay awards remained at 2.5 per cent in the second
quarter. Half of the 214 pay settlements were between 2 per cent and 3 per

FT  01 AUG 94 / Anxious wait for City on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's money market operations will have an unusually large
audience today as the City waits anxiously to see whether interest rates
will be raised, Philip Gawith writes.
Markets closed on Friday amid a frenzy of speculation after the Bank
accepted bids for Treasury bills - short-term government debt - at rates of
up to 5.75 per cent, half a percentage point above the level of base rates.
The move was interpreted by some traders as a sign that base rates will
shortly rise. The picture was confused, however, by the Bank dealing at
unchanged rates in its daily operations before and after the auction. The
daily activities are the customary method of indicating rate changes.
Although most weekend comment seemed to favour rates staying unchanged,
analysts said the picture was too confusing to make predictions. A decision
to raise rates would have considerable impact, affecting a range of prices
across the economy and probably having a negative impact on financial
markets.
While some recent economic data have hinted that inflationary pressures
might be developing in the economy, justifying higher rates, many economists
argue that the level of economic activity is not sufficient for a tightening
of policy.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, described
Friday's events as a chaotic situation 'which will have done the City's
reputation no end of harm'.
If rates are left unchanged, sterling could come under pressure. The UK
currency rose quite sharply on Friday, in anticipation of higher rates, and
may be vulnerable to a downward correction.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Companies healthier than in previous recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial and commercial companies are considerably more profitable now
than at the equivalent stage in the previous recovery, Philip Gawith writes.
A study by the Bank of England has found that pre-tax return on capital in
the non-North Sea sector was 9.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994.
This is almost double that of the equivalent stage in the previous recovery
of 1982-84, and compares to a trough of 6.3 per cent in the first quarter of
1992.
The study - by Mr Kieren Wright of the Bank's structural economic analysis
division - found that differences in profitability, investment and financial
decisions were partly attributed to the relative shallowness of the
recession.
Retained earnings increased by more than a third last year when companies
made net repayments of debt to banks equivalent to 1.8 per cent of gross
domestic product. In 1982, the comparable year in the previous cycle,
companies made net borrowings of 2.4 per cent of GDP.
The study also found companies making increasing use of capital markets for
external finance. Gross capital issues by industrial and commercial
companies rose 51 per cent to Pounds 23.9bn last year, representing 30.3 per
cent of total funding. Dividend payments continued to grow, by 9.3 per cent
to Pounds 22.7bn in 1993. Fixed investment has been higher than during
1982-84, but this reflects a higher base rather than investment rising as
the recovery has progressed.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Auditors face more checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chartered accountancy firms that conduct audits will be subject to more
frequent inspection visits under plans being drawn up by their professional
bodies.
Officials at the Joint Monitoring Unit, which scrutinises registered
auditors who are members of the UK's three chartered accountancy bodies, aim
to visit all 10,500 firms under their jurisdiction within the next five to
eight years. The action follows changes recommended in letters written
earlier this month to the regulatory bodies by Mr Neil Hamilton, minister
for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry.
It comes in a review of the first two years since the new self-regulatory
regime for auditing was established under the 1989 Companies Act.
The Joint Monitoring Unit will continue to scrutinise most closely the 160
larger firms that conduct the audits of listed and public-interest
companies, which are already scheduled to be visited once every five years.
Officials are also considering ways to change the inspection techniques of
the largest accountancy firms, in which breaches are difficult to highlight
using present approaches.
Mr Hamilton asked the bodies to:
Target firms where there was greater risk;
Ensure monitoring was linked closely to the circumstances of different
practices;
Use a wider variety of techniques to supervise the firms;
Prevent any cost increase.
They have until October to submit details of the changes.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Power scheme 'failed to cut wholesale price'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt by the electricity industry in England and Wales to give large
users a role in power-price determination has failed to meet expectations
that it would cut wholesale prices by an average 1.5 per cent.
Although prices in the electricity pool, the wholesale market through which
power is traded, have fallen since the experiment was introduced, the pool's
administrators say this is because of other factors.
They say the effect on prices of the 'demand-side bidding' experiment,
through which large customers can agree to reduce consumption if prices go
above a certain level, has been negligible.
The scheme is one of a series of recent disappointments for intensive energy
users.
Earlier this month Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity regulator,
decided against allowing large users to bypass the pool by buying their
electricity directly from suppliers including the generating companies.
Large companies had pressed for bypass arrangements in the hope that this
would lead to lower prices.
Unlike most power consumers, which have seen prices fall since
privatisation, the largest users, including such companies as Imperial
Chemical Industries and Blue Circle, have suffered price increases.
This is largely the result of the loss of cut-price electricity which the
power industry and government considered to be subsidised.
It was partly in response to large users' complaints over prices that the
pool, controlled largely by the power companies, agreed to the demand-side
bidding experiment.
The pool executive estimated that the experiment could lead to a cut in
average pool prices of about 1.5 per cent and reductions of 3 per cent at
times of peak demand.
However since its introduction last October the experiment has affected
prices on only 23 days - in some cases for only a half-hour period.
The failure of the experiment to cut prices will be seen by companies such
as ICI as vindication of their opposition to the scheme. ICI supported
demand-side bidding but said the pool's scheme would have little effect
because it provided insufficient incentives for companies to take part.
The pool hopes to devise a better scheme for the future, but will continue
the experiment until the end of this year.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Copier leasing rules amended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New restrictions on photocopier leases are to be introduced by members of
the Finance and Leasing Association to combat criticism of the photocopier
industry by the Office of Fair Trading.
The association is proposing substantial amendments to leasing guidelines
which it hopes will overcome concerns expressed earlier this year by Sir
Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
Sir Bryan in March called for urgent moves to end what he described as 'an
extraordinary variety of malpractices and excesses'. He said he was prepared
to give self-regulation a chance but if that failed he would refer the
supply of photocopiers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Under the association's proposed guidelines, which are binding on members,
photocopier lease periods will be restricted to a maximum of five years
rather than the unspecified 'working life' of the equipment.
The association says it also intends to ensure that the controversial
cost-per-copy contracts are restricted to larger companies only, where their
use is considered to be appropriate. Sir Bryan, however, called on trade
associations actively to discourage the use of cost-per-copy arrangements.
Mr David Hardisty, association chairman, said its guidance notes on
cost-per-copy contracts seemed to be effective as it had received only one
complaint since this section came into force last year. He added: 'However,
so there is no room for doubt, we are quite happy to tighten up this area to
ensure best practice.'

FT  01 AUG 94 / Wage issue high on TUC agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month's Trades Union Congress looks likely to cause the Labour party
political embarrassment by favouring a specific target for a national
legally binding minimum wage.
It is also expected to try to commit a future Labour government to making
full employment the dominant element of its economic policy.
In the TUC's preliminary agenda, published today, a resolution from the
usually moderate shopworkers' union Usdaw declares that Labour should
introduce a national minimum wage at half of male median earnings - now
about Pounds 4 an hour. This figure should be revised upwards annually, says
Usdaw, in line with the movement of male median earnings.
Unison, the largest union with many low-paid members in the public services,
goes further by saying the proposed national minimum wage target should
eventually rise 'over time' from half of male median earnings to two-thirds
of average earnings.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, has made clear that while he supports the
idea of a national minimum wage in principle he does not want to commit
himself to a specific target.
The GMB general union in its motion calls on Mr Blair to 'stand by the
commitment given to the 1993 congress by John Smith, the then Labour leader,
that the party will ensure all the instruments of macro-economic management
will be geared to sustained growth and rising employment'.
The TGWU, the largest industrial union, says it 'believes unreservedly that
full employment is an achievable social and economic goal and should be a
central priority of the next Labour government'. It also calls for an
'innovative and imaginative' TUC campaign to win support for the full
employment agenda next year.

<TEXT>
The government is considering proposals to allow pubs and bars in England
and Wales to open all day on Sunday and to end the restrictions on opening
hours for off-licences.
The proposals could be announced by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
in a green paper due to be published this autumn.
According to Whitehall officials, a draft of the green paper suggests that
public houses should no longer have to close on Sundays between 3pm and 7pm.
The green paper also proposes that pub closing times on Fridays and
Saturdays should be extended by one hour to midnight. Ministers may also
introduce a system of dual licensing for publicans and their premises which
would simplify the transfer of a public house to a new landlord.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Blair welcomes M&amp;S overture on funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, has cautiously welcomed an invitation
from Sir Richard Greenbury, the chairman of Marks and Spencer, to discuss
whether the supermarket chain could give financial backing to the Labour
party.
Amid growing signs that leading business figures could develop contacts with
Mr Blair, M&amp;S confirmed yesterday that Sir Richard had sent the Labour
leader an invitation to hold talks.
Sir Richard's move coincided with reports that Mr David Sainsbury, the
millionaire supermarket chief, financially backed Mr Blair's campaign for
the Labour leadership.
In recent years M&amp;S has invited Mr Blair's predecessors Mr Neil Kinnock and
the late John Smith to discuss policy issues and the prospect of financial
backing.
Both men declined these invitations.
But there were indications yesterday that Mr Blair, who has spearheaded a
drive to modernise Labour, could break with previous practice. 'If the
chairman of Marks and Spencer wants to discuss matters of mutual interest,
then it would be churlish not to agree,' said Labour.
M&amp;S said that Sir Richard would want to hear what policies Labour had that
might affect retailing. 'If they were of benefit, the main board would
discuss finance (for the Labour party),' it said.
In its 1993 annual report M&amp;S revealed a donation of Pounds 40,000 to
Conservative Central Office. The company said yesterday that 'whatever
happened, we would continue to support the Conservative party'. But it added
that supporting both Labour and the Tories would not be a problem in
principle.
Labour officials underlined that Mr Blair could not be expected to tailor
policies in exchange for financial backing.
They would not confirm that Mr Sainsbury, who backed the formation of the
Social Democratic party in the early 1980s, had donated Pounds 5,000 to Mr
Blair's leadership campaign.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Confidence rises at tin mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's last operating tin mine, South Crofty, near Redruth in Cornwall,
had by the weekend been promised only Pounds 300,000 towards the Pounds 1m
it must raise this week under the terms of a survival package agreed with
the government.
Nevertheless, the management was optimistic. Mr Howard Midwinter, a director
of South Crofty, said: 'After a slow start, things are picking up. We have
moved from being optimistic to confident that we can make it.'
Mr Kevin Ross, managing director, made an emotional appeal to investors on
June 29 to provide up to Pounds 1.8m for South Crofty, which can trace its
roots back for 400 of the 2,500 years that tin has been mined in Cornwall.
He revealed that, if the mine could raise the minimum Pounds 1m to ensure
its survival for another 18 months, the government would write off loans
totalling Pounds 23.4m. Also the RTZ Corporation, which sold South Crofty
and its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, would
forgive loans of Pounds 7.7m.
The loans are interest-free but their presence on the balance sheet makes it
hard for South Crofty to raise money.
South Crofty employs 260 people - most of them have taken regular cuts in
pay to help the mine survive so far - and produces about 2,200 tonnes of tin
a year.
The share sale prospectus shows a pre-tax loss of Pounds 42,000 on turnover
of Pounds 6.5m last year compared with a profit of Pounds 79,000 on Pounds
6m of sales in 1992.

The Yemeni government yesterday denied talks held in Geneva last week with
its defeated southern rivals had any official status, saying the meeting was
only to clarify its own position with the UN. But UN sources said the two
sides met in a good atmosphere and agreed to further talks. Yemeni officials
on Saturday said their negotiators had gone to the talks to underline
earlier demands for the UN to end its efforts at mediation since the
country's civil war was over. They insisted any further talks be held in
Yemen without outside involvement. Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN mediator, last
week said Thursday's meeting ended with both sides agreeing to pursue
further dialogue. Yemen's civil war erupted in April. Since their defeat,
exiled southern leaders have used the threat of guerrilla warfare to obtain
outside mediation in ending their dispute with the north. But the north has
resisted external pressure for a negotiated settlement.

Law-abiding Swiss are bracing themselves for further news of corruption. Mr
Hansrudi Muller, the Zurich prosecutor, said in an interview in the Sunday
newspaper Sonntags Zeitung that he was 'almost certain' at least one more
case would be uncovered this year. Two new cases of public sector wrongdoing
emerged last week. Five Swiss government internal auditors are under
investigation on suspicion of taking money in return for favours to
government suppliers.
Meanwhile, three Zurich motor vehicle bureau officers are under arrest for
having taken small bribes to issue incomplete vehicle registration papers.
These papers enabled the recipients to falsify documents on used cars
exported to Africa. Two weeks ago, formal charges were laid against eight
people, including a prominent magazine publisher, for allegedly bribing Mr
Raphael Huber, Zurich canton's former restaurant and bar inspector. Two
weeks ago, the head of a corruption ring in Fribourg who had bribed the
canton's finance director and police chief was sentenced to 27 months' jail.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Carbon emissions show decline
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World emissions of carbon dioxide from energy use, thought to be the main
cause of global warming, have begun to show a slight decline, according to
the London-based World Energy Council. In a report to be published shortly,
WEC says that CO emissions were equivalent to 6.09bn tonnes of carbon last
year, down from 6.106bn in 1992. The fall was due mainly to a sharp decline
of 249m tonnes in emissions from the former communist countries of eastern
Europe. This more than offset the increase of 162m tonnes in emissions from
the fast growing Asia-Pacific region.
Emissions were also up in North America, the Middle East and Africa. But
they were down in western Europe, mainly because of reduced coal consumption
in Germany, the UK and Italy. The WEC says the declines in Europe may be
temporary because the continent is moving out of recession. Nevertheless,
the figures 'reinforce the view that increases in carbon dioxide have been
partly reversed, and atmospheric concentration increases have recently
slowed down'. The report says the Asia-Pacific region will have to be the
focus of future efforts to reduce emissions.

The presidents of Russia and Ukraine yesterday said they planned to sign a
new agreement on the Black Sea fleet which would settle its disputed future.
'We are determined to conclude talks on the Black Sea fleet as soon as
possible and to sign an agreement which will fully meet the interests of the
fraternal Russian and Ukrainian nations,' said Mr Boris Yeltsin and
Ukraine's newly elected Mr Leonid Kuchma in a joint statement reported by
Itar-Tass news agency.
The row over ownership of the 800-vessel fleet is one of several that have
troubled relations between Russia and Ukraine since break-up of the Soviet
Union in 1991. Mr Yeltsin told Mr Kuchma soon after his victory over
President Leonid Kravchuk that he hoped his election would lead to an
improvement in ties between Moscow and Kiev. Mr Kuchma said during his
campaign Russia should be granted a lease on the Sevastopol naval base in
the Crimea.

Delegates to Nigeria's constitutional conference, assembled by the military
regime to draw up the programme for a return to civilian rule, are today
expected to call for the release of detained opposition leader Mr Moshood
Abiola in an effort to defuse the country's deepening crisis. A leading
delegate at the conference in central Nigeria is due to table a motion
asking the head of state, Gen Sani Abacha, to release Mr Abiola. The
opposition leader's trial for treason, under way in Abuja, was adjourned
last week until tomorrow amid violent clashes between armed police and
demonstrators. A four-week strike which has already forced a 300,000 barrels
a day cut in oil production - about 20 per cent of normal output - is set to
intensify this week. The Nigeria Labour Congress, which represents over 40
main trade unions, has called a national strike from Wednesday. The Rev
Jesse Jackson, sent by the White House last week to mediate in the crisis,
feared 'Nigeria only has a few more days to go, for the escalating tensions
might very well explode.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rocco Buttiglione, the philosopher admired by Pope John Paul II, has
become the new leader of Italy's Popular party (PPI), heir to the
long-ruling Christian Democrats whose party was dissolved in January. He was
elected in a bitterly contested run-off against Mr Nicola Mancino, the
former interior minister, winning 55 per cent of the votes at the end of a
special congress late on Friday. Mr Buttiglione, aged 46, has been in active
politics for only a year and made his reputation with his philosophical
writings about the relationship between Christianity and Marxism. His
victory represents a defeat for the left wing of the party. Mr Buttiglione
was one of those who argued the PPI should consider an alliance with Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia after the March general elections. But with
the Berlusconi government now weakened, he is unlikely to be so keen.
Mr Buttiglione's task will be to forge a new identity for the PPI, which was
born from the demoralising collapse of the discredited Christian Democrats.
Mr Mino Martinazoli, who engineered the transition from the old to the new
party, resigned in April after the PPI had been squeezed between the left
and right in the elections.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is to clamp down on foreign borrowings to avoid debt service problems,
following a central bank survey that found foreign debt would rise to
Dollars 100bn (Pounds 64.5bn) by the end of the year. The official Xinhua
news agency yesterday quoted an official of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange Control (Safec) as saying it was 'time for China to limit
its foreign borrowing and use as much direct overseas investment as
possible'.
Safec announced last month that China's foreign debt at the end of 1993 had
risen to Dollars 83.5bn. Its debt/service ratio was 7.7 per cent. China will
pay Dollars 20bn this year in principal and interest to service its foreign
debt. Safec estimates the 'debt repayment peak' will last for another 3-4
years.
Mr Tang Sining, a senior Safec economist, said foreign debt had 'expanded a
bit too fast' in recent years. 'It really deserves our attention that growth
of external debt has outpaced that of the national economy,' he said. China
announced recently that its foreign exchange reserves rose 50 per cent
during the first half of the year to Dollars 31.8bn. Slower growth in
imports contributed to the improvement in China's reserves.

FT  01 AUG 94 / International Press Review: Asean ministers face wrath of
Thai journalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's liberal newspapers have excelled themselves in their efforts to
embarrass the now not-so-liberal Thai government, which was host to the
annual meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) in
Bangkok over the past two weeks.
Visiting foreign ministers from Indonesia and Burma were greeted with
hundreds of column-inches about Indonesian brutality in East Timor, Burmese
military cruelty and editorials scoffing at the notion, put about by
authoritarian Asian governments, that human rights and democracy are
inappropriate for Asia.
Thai commentators were inspired by two events: Thailand invited Mr Ohn Gyaw,
foreign minister of the Burmese junta, to the Asean meeting, an honour which
some editorial writers felt was scarcely deserved; and the Thai authorities
made hamfisted attempts to stop an insignificant human rights conference,
deporting three foreigners and harassing the participants because they
wanted to discuss Burma and East Timor.
Thailand, said The Nation in an editorial, was foolishly giving in to the
'bully-boy tactics' of Indonesia in the name of Asean solidarity.
'It is high time that the regional grouping reviewed its concept of
'solidarity',' said The Nation. 'The events of the past three months clearly
show that Indonesia is using Asean as its platform to impose authoritarian
values over members which have different political systems.'
During the May 1992 crisis, in which Thai troops killed 50 demonstrators on
the streets of Bangkok, The Nation, an English-language newspaper, openly
opposed the Thai armed forces and supported pro-democracy activists. Its
support helped bring the present democratic government of Mr Chuan Leekpai
to power, and the paper believes it has the right to express disappointment
at his performance.
Mr Chuan, the newspaper said in another editorial, now seemed to think it
more important for Thailand to have good relations with Indonesia than to
care about human rights.
On the subject of bullying, Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister,
in an interview with the Bangkok Post, the other leading English-language
daily, said Indonesia was not a bully - it had simply informed Thailand
about the plans of some East Timor activists and had explained how offended
Indonesia would be if nothing was done to stop them.
While English-language newspapers in Thailand represent the views of liberal
academics and businessmen - half the readers are Thais - and take a close
interest in international affairs, the Thai-language press tends to be more
concerned by the shenanigans of Thai politicians and local crime stories.
Over the last two weeks the Thai papers have concentrated on the fate of two
politicians: one accused of international drug smuggling; the other,
suspected of buying votes by giving cash to Buddhist temples.
A Bangkok Post survey of ordinary people on the streets of the capital
suggested that the Thai papers were right to think their readers would not
be interested in the dry affairs of Asean. 'Asean? Is it a sports event? It
sounds familiar,' said Mr Sermsuk In-jan, a 50-year-old shop assistant.
But the dispute over human rights prompted by the Asean meeting did generate
heated debate in the Thai papers.
Siam Rath (Siam Nation) and Naew Na (Frontline) both supported the Thai
government's crackdown on dissidents. Thailand should not allow outsiders to
use the country as a venue for criticising neighbouring states, because the
national interest should have top priority, Siam Rath said in an editorial.
Liberal commentators rejected this sort of nationalism, declaring that
national pride meant standing up for what you believe in rather than
allowing your policies to be dictated by the sensitivities of other
governments.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission and leading
Socialist contender in the French presidential race, could beat Mr Jacques
Chirac, the centre-right leader and mayor of Paris, in next year's
presidential elections, but would lose to Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, according to the latest opinion poll.
The poll commissioned from the IFOP research consultancy for yesterday's
Journal du Dimanche newspaper, puts Mr Balladur in first place in the
presidential stakes, with the support of 17 per cent of the public, followed
by Mr Delors with 14 per cent and Mr Chirac with 11 per cent. Mr Bernard
Tapie, the beleaguered left-winger whose furniture last week was confiscated
by his bank, has held on to fourth place although the flood of publicity
over his financial problems now seems to be affecting his popularity.
Support for Mr Tapie has fallen to 7 per cent from 10 per cent over the past
month, according to the poll.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China will slash steel production by 1m tonnes this year in an effort to
bolster a sagging market. It is also squeezing imports, but is yet to
announce details of new import quotas.
The official Business Daily reported that the government would also purchase
rolled steel for its own reserves to reduce stockpiles.
Chinese steelmakers are facing a crisis, with demand faltering due to a cut
in construction. Low-priced imports from Japan and South Korea are also
posing problems.
China plans to produce 93m tonnes of steel this year which would make it the
world's biggest producer. At the end of May, stockpiles of steel had risen
to 4m tonnes, a 191 per cent increase over the same period last year.
Imports of steel in the first six months reached 10.68m tonnes in spite of
import curbs.
Talks between Japanese steel producers and a Chinese government import
agency collapsed last week on the issue of price and export levels. The
Japanese are threatening to export directly to Chinese consumers in defiance
of restrictions.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Far East office space shortage forces blue chips into
backrooms: Victor Mallet, Tony Walker and Andrew Taylor find rents are
outstripping those in the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, TONY WALKER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An acute shortage of city office space in rapidly emerging Far Eastern
economies has left international executives operating from converted rooms
in Vietnamese hotels with less-than-exotic names, such as the Army Hotel or
the Government Guest House.
More fortunate, or wealthier, executives are working from converted offices
in houses or crumbling villas, dating back to the French colonial era, after
installing electricity generators in the backyard.
Finding suitable premises to work and live is just as hard in China where
large numbers of executives have been forced to work from hotel rooms and
town houses.
A study by international property consultants Richard Ellis showed that
office rents in Beijing and Shanghai in China and Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City, in Vietnam are now higher than in London, Paris, New York and
Frankfurt. Only Tokyo and Hong Kong have higher rents.
In Beijing and Shanghai, office rents have soared by 30 per cent in the past
six months as a result of the accommodation shortage.
Ellis, which itself is working from converted offices in the Beijing Toronto
hotel in China's capital, says the pace of development in emerging economies
has been too slow to satisfy the high growth in demand from international
companies.
Mr Toby Anstruther, Vietnam representative of property consultants Brooke
Hillier Parker, says: 'You have Fortune 500 companies working out of chop
houses. IBM is sharing an office with a local Vietnamese company in a
house.'
The best villas in Saigon, part of the Ho Chi Minh City, have been rented by
the big Japanese trading companies, which began operating in Vietnam several
years before the arrival of most of their western competitors.
Developers are building furiously to catch up. In Ho Chi Minh City, one
block constructed by a Taiwanese developer is already open, and two others
are about to be completed by Hong Kong companies. A further two office
buildings are under development in Hanoi by Singapore and Hong Kong groups.
Rents are expected to range from about Dollars 40 (Pounds 25.80) per square
metre per month to Dollars 55 for high-quality offices - almost two thirds
more than equivalent rents in mid-town New York.
Companies and individuals in Shanghai, China's main financial centre, are
expected to pay a month's rent in advance just to appear on long waiting
lists for offices and apartments, says Mr Terry Merrifield a senior
executive of Seacliff which manages the Shanghai Centre, a large hotel and
office complex in demand from international companies.
When the centre opened in 1990, office rents were in the 'high Dollars 30s',
about one-third the present rate. A dozen organisations are currently on the
waiting list for offices with about 50 individuals waiting for apartments
which cost Dollars 6,000 per month.
Because of the housing shortage, some organisations were delaying sending
the families of employees to Shanghai. Companies also had deferred moves to
the city until the accommodation shortage eased, said Mr Merrifield .
Offices were expected to remain in short supply until 1997, by when 'the
pendulum should be swinging in the other direction'.
The situation is only slightly easier in Beijing where there also are long
waiting lists for prime office buildings, such as the China World tower
attached to the China World hotel.
Office space at China World costs about Dollars 85 per sq m. Reasonable
accommodation, however, can be acquired for about Dollars 60 per sq m per
month according to Mr Tom Whitten, representative in Beijing of the
China-Britain Trade Group (CBTG) an organisation to promote Sino-British
trade.
He says companies seeking to establish a presence in China should: 'come
early, put names on waiting and be prepared for a sizeable wait in a hotel.'
Hotel accommodation costs about Dollars 100 a day in Beijing. CBTG as an
interim measure offers a desk and a phone to members. There are other places
in Beijing such as the Regus centre at the Kempinski hotel which provides
short-term office space with secretarial services.
Apartment rents in Beijing range between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 10,000
but there have been large rent increases in the past year as demand has
risen fuelled by China's economic boom. It is a familiar story in many
rapidly growing Asian business centres.
Cities in south-east Asia accounted for eight out of the 11 most expensive
office locations according to the Richard Ellis study which compared
accommodation costs in 45 business centres.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has doubled anti-dumping duties on imports of Mexican cement despite
a Gatt panel ruling that the duties are illegal, Mexico told Gatt's
anti-dumping committee last week.
The US has refused to accept the ruling, which dates from July 1992, writes
Frances Williams in Geneva.
The independent panel said in its report that the procedures used by the US
authorities to determine dumping in this case breached Gatt rules. The panel
recommended that Mexican exporters should be refunded the anti-dumping
duties already paid.
Instead, Mexico said the duties had twice been increased from their original
level of 30.74 per cent to 61.85 per cent in May this year.
Urging adoption of the report, Mexico said there was currently a shortfall
in domestic US cement production. This, and the consequent high prices, had
prompted the National Association of Home Builders, representing 175,000
building companies in the US, to ask Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, to repeal the duties.

The US government netted over Dollars 617m (Pounds 398m) last week in the
Federal Communications Commission's first auction of the airwaves.
The Federal Communications Commission previously gave away radio band
licences through lotteries or hearings. However last year it was granted
congressional approval to auction exclusive rights to a range of new
frequencies for paging, telephone and voice and data communication systems.
First under the hammer were a set of 10 nationwide licences for personal
communications services, or 'narrow band services' including advanced paging
and wireless data transmission systems.
Paging Network of Virginia was among the biggest winners at the end of
bidding on Friday after five days and 47 rounds.
It outbid 26 competitors to acquire three licences - the maximum permitted
for single ownership - bidding Dollars 80m for each of two frequencies
allowing the greatest capabilities and Dollars 37m for a smaller band.
Capability is determined by band width.
KDM Messaging Company - backed mainly by US cellular giant McCaw Cellular
Communications - bought two of the five biggest bands at Dollars 80m each,
while Nationwide Wireless Network grabbed one at the same price and another
for Dollars 47m.

FT  01 AUG 94 / US takes hard line on 'dumping': Hopes raised by Uruguay
Round may be dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One achievement of the Uruguay Round was agreement on tighter restraints on
dumping and countervailing duty laws - actions that have increasingly become
weapons of choice for companies seeking protection from foreign imports.
But countries that thought their products would get a fairer deal in the US,
as a result, may have under-estimated the resourcefulness of US trade
lobbyists. A word here, a phrase there, inserted in the implementing
legislation for the Uruguay Round, means that foreign steel exporters and
other industries selling in the US market could still find themselves
subject to 'unfair trade' complaints and years of expensive litigation
before winning market access for their products.
A senior Administration official last week insisted that the US would abide
by the accord it signed in Marrakesh, setting the seal on the global trade
liberalising measures agreed in the Uruguay Round negotiations within the
framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'Consistent with the Gatt agreement is the right to have effective
anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws,' the official added.
Mr Gary Horlick, a Washington trade lawyer representing a large group of
manufacturers, said that US exporters were worried about 'anything the US
does which increases the likelihood of trade barriers'.
Such action, he said, 'can and will be used by other countries against our
exports - and the US government will not be able to defend us,' he said.
A rewrite of the US trade rules to comply with Uruguay Round is drawing to a
close. A House-Senate conference committee soon will meet to resolve
differences in the implementing legislation written in the House by the Ways
and Means Committee and in the Senate by the Finance Committee. Then the
entire implementing legislation will be on a 'fast-track' for Congressional
approval. The Administration will send it back to Congress for a simple
vote, with no amendmend allowed.
Trade lawyers from both sides of the issue have been fighting tooth and nail
for months.
Before the ink had dried on the Marrakesh accord, the Committee to Support
US Trade Laws had sprung into being. 'We do not intend to stand by passively
and allow our market to be eroded by dumped, injurious imports at the
expense of our workers and companies,' said Mr Joseph Avento, chairman of
Specialty Tubing Group, and a member of the committee.
Mostly the committee sought to limit the 'damage' inflicted on US trade laws
by pushing loopholes in the Gatt agreement to - and beyond - their limits.
There was even an attempt to get the government to repay US petitioners for
the cost of their legal fees out of dumping or countervailing duties
collected.
On the other side, exporters and importers of steel, textiles and other
products banded together to demand that the Administration honour both the
letter and spirit of Marrakesh - not incidentally because US companies have
become the most frequent targets of foreign anti-dumping actions.
The Administration rebuffed the most protectionist proposals from Congress,
but added some new ones of its own. Free traders were particularly outraged
about defeat of a provision that would have allowed the waiver of
anti-dumping and countervailing duties, for products in short supply,
In this case the Administration joined forces with the Committee to Support
US Trade Laws because, according to a senior official, high duties do not
prohibit supply - they simply make it cost more.
One provision in the implementing legislation likely to pass would allow the
imposition of countervailing duties to compensate for subsidies given to
businesses - such as British Steel - even though they were later privatised
and sold at market value.
Another provision provides a formula to determine the market share of
foreign companies, which would increase the likelihood of the International
Trade Commission ruling that a US company has been injured by dumping or
subsidies.
The ProTrade Group, a group of exporters, says there are more than 24
violations of the Gatt pact in the implementing legislation. These are
likely ultimately to be challenged under the new World Trade Organisation
(to replace Gatt), and if the US is found in the wrong, it will have to
either amend its law or pay compensation. That could mean one industry would
have to pay for the protection granted another.
Mr James Currie, deputy chief of the European Union delegation, expressed
concerns about protectionist tendencies in Congress.
'Some of the language going around at the moment would simply make it
impossible for goods - and particularly steel - to get access and compete
fairly in the US market,' he said. But he is 'relatively content' that the
Clinton administration will try to do its best to resist Congressional
pressure.
That the EU is not complaining more could be an indication that its own
implementing legislation is by no means free of protectionist distortion,
said one observer.
In the end, both the US and the EU could suffer as governments in the rest
of the world demonstrate that, where protection is concerned, they can be
just as creative.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Rabin urges Syria to make peace move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday urged Syria to make
the next moves towards peace in the Middle East, renewing his calls for
direct negotiations with the Syrian leadership and for a public gesture to
persuade the Israeli public that Damascus was serious about reaching a
settlement.
His remarks followed a summit in the Egyptian resort of Taba with Mr Hosni
Mubarak, the Egyptian president, who recently returned from talks in
Damascus with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader.
Senior Egyptian officials have recently played down Cairo's role in the
Syrian-Israeli track of the peace talks, saying it would be 'detrimental' to
open too many channels of negotiation.
The sole forum for talks between the sides at present is the energetic
shuttle diplomacy of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who is
due back to the region on August 8.
Talks between Syria and Israel have remained locked over the issue of the
Golan Heights, from which Syria is seeking a full military withdrawal.
Israel in turn wants Syria to open full trade and diplomatic relations.
Mr Mubarak told reporters that Syria would 'never accept any peace treaty
unless there is total withdrawal from the Golan Heights', repeating Mr
Assad's crucial position in the talks with Israel. However, the Egyptian
president also said that he believed Mr Assad would prove 'much more
flexible' during Mr Christopher's next visit, though he declined to
elaborate.
Mr Rabin, who had come to 'exchange perceptions' with Mr Mubarak, according
to Israeli officials, reiterated his frustration at Syria's unwillingness to
meet Israelis directly and renewed his call for high-level talks.
He said he understood that Israel would have to satisfy 'a few requirements'
to reach peace but said that the Israeli people first required a clear
signal of Syria's peaceable intent, and that he could not discuss the extent
of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights until 'I know what I get in
return'.
He said: 'Syria has to do something in its public diplomacy, its public
utterances that will bring the Israeli public to be convinced that Syria is
eager to have a peace.'
The two leaders said they also discussed the highly sensitive issue of
Jerusalem - a matter which was also central to talks Mr Mubarak held with
King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian leader, during a weekend trip to the Kingdom.
Both leaders emphasised that the final status of Jerusalem would be
addressed only in permanent status talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, which are due to begin in no later than two years. Mr Rabin
stressed that the recent acknowledgement of the special guardianship of King
Hussein of Jordan over Jerusalem - a matter deeply controversial with both
the Palestinians and some other Arab states - had not changed arrangements
in the city which had existed for the past 27 years.
Meanwhile, thousands of south Lebanese left their homes yesterday fearing an
Israeli strike against Hezbollah targets in retaliation for the recent spate
of anti-Jewish bombings.
Officials with Unifil, the United Nations observer force in the south, said
as many as 15,000 people - around 5 per cent of the population - had left
during the past week but said life continued largely as normal for those who
had stayed.
In Beirut, pro-Iranian Islamic militants said they would 'bombard
settlements' in northern Israel if the Jewish state launched retaliatory
attacks in the south.
This week marks the first anniversary of 'operation accountability' during
which Israel bombarded south Lebanon for a week in retaliation for Hezbollah
rocket attacks into north Israel. More than 120 people died in the
bombardment and 300,000 south Lebanese fled their homes.

FT  01 AUG 94 / RPF keen to establish credentials: Rwanda's rulers must
rebut claims they are a foreign occupation force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English phrase books are much in demand in francophone Rwanda these days as
job prospects with the new government may hinge on whether the candidate
masters the language of the country's new rulers, the Rwandan Patriotic
Front.
Because the RPF recruited extensively among Tutsi exiles living in Uganda to
launch the guerrilla war that brought it to power, it has been easy for the
ousted Hutu regime to portray the RPF as a foreign occupation force.
Gen Paul Kagame, the RPF's military commander, speaks no French, and cabinet
meetings are reported to be held in English for his benefit.
The language barrier is only one of many difficulties facing a two-week-old
government desperate to establish its legitimacy, both at home and abroad.
Despite the presence of Hutus in prominent posts, and a discourse of
national unity, Rwanda's new leaders have not been able to dispel fears
among the majority Hutu population that they will run a government by and
for Tutsis, in a throwback to Rwanda's feudal past.
But the international community, which watched the genocide of Rwanda's
Tutsi population in silence, is now eager to help without asking too many
questions of the new regime. The UN has launched a Dollars 435m (Pounds
280m) appeal to assist Rwanda's reconstruction and alleviate the plight of
2.5m Hutu refugees who fled in fear of RPF reprisals.
The US is set to launch a round-the-clock airlift operation to bring food,
medicines and water to the cholera-ridden refugee camps in Goma, Zaire.
Britain has volunteered to repair Rwanda's war-damaged roads and bridges.
Germany has offered to donate fully equipped radio stations to enable the
RPF-led government to broadcast its message of reconciliation to the masses
huddled outside its borders.
The RPF knows that unless it can convince the Hutu population to return, its
chances of restoring stability to Rwanda are slim.
No one is more aware of this than the defeated soldiers and militia of the
former Hutu regime, who are threatening to kill anyone who dares leave
Zaire's hellish refugee camps.
UN relief officials are increasingly uncomfortable with the presence of mass
murderers among the refugees they are trying to help.
'Unless the international community takes steps to bring those responsible
to justice, we will be accessories to their crimes,' says one frustrated aid
official. According to confidential UN reports, Hutu extremists have also
taken control of Benaco camp in Tanzania, the home of 430,000 Rwandan
refugees. Relief workers who tried to expel the extremists were physically
threatened and had to leave Benaco themselves.
The UN has appointed a special rapporteur on human rights to document abuses
in Rwanda. But Mr Rene Degni-Segui is still waiting for the resources with
which to carry out his job.
He has been allocated only one field officer to investigate the
circumstances in which more than 500,000 people died. 'We need investigative
judges, forensic experts, ballistic experts, military intelligence analysts,
and prosecutors who have dealt with war crimes in the past,' says Ms Karen
Kenny, the field officer. 'If we don't address the issue of genocide, how
can we ask the RPF to uphold international standards of justice?'
Already there are fears the new government may not be able to balance the
demand for justice against the need to promote national reconciliation. Mr
Degni-Segui is alarmed at reports of RPF forces carrying out summary
executions in Kigali. Other UN officers say returning refugees are being
herded into RPF-controlled encampments.
'Hutus believe the new government's entreaties are a trap, and that they
will be massacred if they return,' says Mr Stewart Wallis, overseas director
of the British charity Oxfam. 'Unless we have human rights monitors to
accompany them, aid stations along the route, and international jurors on
the ground to hear their testimony, Hutus will not return.'
Mr Wallis believes fewer than 200,000 refugees will leave Zaire of their own
accord. The majority will become permanent exiles, a hostile and
destabilising force surrounding the new Rwanda.
The new government is ill-equipped to deliver services even to the few
thousand refugees who have begun the return journey home. Cholera has taken
hold in Kigali, and dysentery may soon follow. The capital has only one
fully functional hospital, run by the International Committee for the Red
Cross. Power, water and telecommunication services have not yet been
restored.
'Rwanda has a government, but it does not yet have an administration,' says
Mr Peter Hansen, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs.
Most ministries consist of the minister and three or four civil servants
with little or no experience, he says.
The UN Development Programme is looking at how to put together a 'government
kit' which would give the RPF a working administration. Mr Charles Petrie of
the UN Rwanda Emergency Office said: 'We are planning to draft experts from
all over Africa who know how to rebuild a country from scratch.'

FT  01 AUG 94 / French may delay Rwanda pullout: UN reinforcements may not
arrive before deadline for France's withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday hinted he might
postpone the departure of some 2,000 French peacekeeping troops in
south-western Rwanda if the safety of civilians were at risk.
Aid agencies have been urging the French to stay beyond the expiry of their
UN mandate on August 22 to prevent another mass exodus of Hutu refugees into
Zaire.
Mr Balladur, who was on a visit to Goma, in Zaire, to inspect the pullout of
troops, said: 'If we felt our action (withdrawal) could make the situation
more fragile and cause new unrest, a new exodus, that would certainly weigh
upon our decision.' He was speaking after touring the civilian safe havens
created by France's Operation Turquoise in Rwanda.
The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, which took power in Rwanda two weeks
ago, claims sovereignty over the French-controlled territory but has avoided
entering the area so as not to sow panic among the 2m Hutus who have sought
sanctuary in the French zone. The RPF has, however, asked the French forces
to disarm Hutu militia and former government soldiers who have taken refuge
behind French lines.
South-western Rwanda was the scene of some of the worst massacres
perpetrated by Hutu extremists against the minority Tutsi community. Fewer
than 12,000 Tutsis survive in an area where more than 100,000 once lived.
UN officials believe reinforcements from other countries are unlikely to
arrive in time to replace the French by the August 22 deadline. 'Rwanda may
suffer another humanitarian catastrophe unless the international community
can pull itself together in the next few days,' Mr Peter Hansen, UN
under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said in Nairobi. He said
the response of western countries to a UN appeal for an enlarged
peacekeeping operation in Rwanda had been 'pathetic'.
Goma was chosen as the main base for France's Operation Turquoise but the
intervention has been eclipsed by the needs of 1.2m Hutus who invaded the
border town following the RPF victory in Rwanda. Mr Balladur confirmed that
France would leave logistics units in Goma to support the relief operation
for the refugees.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, made a separate visit to Goma
yesterday to step up US assistance to hundreds of thousands of Rwandan
refugees at risk from cholera, dysentery and starvation. He inspected a US
water purification plant on the shores of Lake Kivu, which is only operating
at half capacity because there are not enough tankers available to deliver
clean water to the camps. Mr Perry also visited Kigali, the Rwandan capital,
where US troops are set to start a round-the-clock airlift for the Rwandan
refugees.
'We should be able to more than double the flow almost immediately of
supplies into Goma by using the Kigali airport,' he said. He is expected to
report on the aid effort to President Bill Clinton, who asked Congress on
Friday to provide an additional Dollars 320m (Pounds 206m) for Rwanda's
humanitarian crisis.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Talks hold Balkan war at bay - for a while
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of war spreading through former Yugoslavia has been staved off,
but only a small amount of time, perhaps just a few weeks, has been gained.
That was the gloomy prospect to emerge from the weekend's talks in Geneva
among the five-nation 'contact group' on Bosnia.
Foreign ministers from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany, plus
Greece as outgoing EU chairman, met to select a mix of carrots and sticks to
drive on their peace initiative, slow to move forward since its birth last
month. They were also keen to prevent the Balkan conflict from poisoning
their relations with one another.
The plan would in effect divide Bosnia between the Serbs and a Moslem-Croat
alliance, with the Serbs cutting their share of territory from 70 to 49 per
cent. Faced with a 'yes' from Bosnia's Moslem leaders and a virtual 'no'
from the Bosnian Serbs, the ministers agreed on a gradual escalation of
pressure, while keeping the door open.
They pledged to reinforce and broaden the flagging regime of sanctions
against the Yugoslav republic (now made up of Serbia and Montenegro); and
also to police more strictly Bosnia's exclusion zones designed to protect
Moslems.
A new resolution on sanctions could be presented to the Security Council
within a week, and by the end of this month, Nato should have devised a way
to use more air power against the Serbs without leaving UN's ground troops
too vulnerable.
As part of the attempt to reinforce sanctions, the ministers pledged to
approach Serbia's neighbours and offer financial compensation in return for
policing borders more tightly.
The US delegation, led by the secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher,
came away from Geneva frustrated because of the mildness of the proposed
action against the Serbs.
In a bow to congressional pressure for a unilateral US move to permit arms
supplies to the Moslems, Mr Christopher said: 'We are not prepared to see
this process strung out indefinitely. We cannot continue this situation
where the victims are punished by the arms embargo and are denied the right
to defend themselves.'
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, retorted that 'hot-heads'
in the Moscow parliament would respond to any unilateral US move by pulling
out of economic sanctions against the Serbs. It was clear in Geneva that
Russia feels no enthusiasm whatsoever for the idea of intensifying economic
pressure on Serb leaders in Belgrade, who are viewed in Moscow as a helpful
influence on their kinsmen in Bosnia.
Mr Kozyrev did grudgingly sign up to the principle of tightening existing
sanctions and exclusion zones; but he saw it as a necessary price for
damping US zeal for the idea of allowing arms supplies to the Moslems. The
Russian minister views the 'arm-the-Moslems' slogan with unmitigated dismay,
and this alarm is broadly shared by the governments of Britain and France.
All three governments made it clear they would withdrew their troops, which
form the mainstay of the UN's peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, in
the event of conflict reigniting and spreading.
Because the contact group's map was presented on a 'take-it-or-leave-it'
basis, there seems to be little room for the Serbs to modify their position
and parry international anger - except through outright acceptance.
Yet senior UK officials did see some scope for further negotiations at the
margins of the plan. The contact group will not change its territorial
proposals, but in principle the parties could do so by mutual agreement,
they point out.
Yet even in the unlikely event of the Serbs coming round to virtual
acceptance of the plan, the Bosnian government is likely - to judge from the
statements of Moslem commanders - to seek ways of wriggling out of its own
commitment. So the danger of an intensified war, which could spread
northwards to Croatia and possibly southwards, to pit Slavs against
Albanians, will not go away; it seems to weigh more heavily on European
governments than the US.
Where US politicians cling tenaciously to belief in 'righting wrongs', the
foreign ministries of Europe have taken a more cautious attitude, stressing
the need to limit damage and avoid further bloodshed.
The Geneva meeting threw up repeated examples of a contrast in approaches
between the US on one hand and all the Europeans - British, French and
Russian - on the other.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, both made
the point that disagreements over Bosnia among the the big powers have had
some disastrous consequences in the past.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Russian 'working poor' increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing number of Russian workers are receiving no wages for months at
a time, creating a 'working poor' in enterprises deep in debt and often
barely able to continue production.
The working poor, a class likely to continue to grow as credits for
enterprises are slashed, have been highlighted by Goskomstat, the state
statistics office, which suggests that workers at 33,000 enterprises, of
which 20,000 are collective farms or agro-industrial corporations, regularly
receive no pay for months at a time.
The overall indebtedness of enterprises to their workers in the Russian
economy stands at around Rbs3,400bn, and is growing steadily - by 16 per
cent in June alone.
The hardest hit regions appear to be Siberia and the far north.
In seperate figures produced last week by the Labour Ministry, the number of
Russians living below the official poverty line or susbistence minimum is
24m, or 16.4 per cent of the population.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, was harangued by such workers on
his trip last week round Siberia, with women in one plant claiming to
receive only Rbs20,000 a week.
The Labour Ministry data indicates that 3 per cent of workers receive less
than Rbs61,500, the level below which absolute want is reckoned to exist.
People living below this are believed to spend 80 per cent of their income
on food.
As well as the absolute poverty suffered by the lowest paid section of the
populaion, the ministry figures show a rapidly widening gap between rich and
poor. The richest 10 per cent of the 148m Russians receive 23 per cent of
incomes, with the lowest 10 per cent receiving 3 per cent of incomes.
The Russian budget, approved this month by both houses of parliament, is
kept within the deficit limits agreed with the International Monetary Fund
only by the severest pruning of expenditure - increasingly showing up as
non-payment of wages.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Toubon vows to continue his war of words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Toubon, the French culture minister, yesterday vowed to continue
his controversial campaign to protect the French language by restricting the
use of foreign words despite the opposition of the Constitutional Council.
The council, the official body that assesses whether new legislation is
valid, this weekend stymied Mr Toubon's attempts at linguistic protectionism
by concluding that he was not legally entitled to forbid the public from
using certain words or phrases.
The council based its decision on the Declaration of the Rights of Man,
which dates from the 1789 French Revolution and states that 'The free
communication of thoughts and opinions is one of man's most precious rights:
each citizen should be able to speak, write and publish freely.'
Mr Toubon, whose language campaign was greeted by general scorn earning him
the nickname 'Mr Allgood' (English for 'Toubon'), said on French television
that the council's ruling was simply 'a technical setback'. 'People may
snigger and joke at Parisian dinner parties, but how many ordinary French
people actually go to fashionable dinners?' he added.
However Mr Toubon has been left with very little room for manoeuvre.
Originally he had intended that foreign words should be replaced in all
forms of public communication by the Gallic equivalents laid out in a
special glossary of 3,000 French words.
Following the council's ruling the use of this glossary will be limited to
public sector organisations, advertising and broadcast media. The failure to
use a suitable French word in public signs, advertisements and official
correspondence is punishable with a fine of up to FFr50,000 (Pounds 6,000).
But it will be left to the courts to decide whether the use of a foreign
word is legally permissible, thereby making it very difficult to apply Mr
Toubon's law in practice.
The council's decision has been received with relief in France. Scorn for
his language law has been only one source of criticism of Mr Toubon, whose
18-month career as arts minister has been clouded by unflattering
comparisons with that of his popular Socialist predecessor, Mr Jack Lang.
Mr Toubon's proposals, which form part of a general campaign of cultural
chauvinism including his anti-Hollywood lobby at last autumn's Gatt
negotiations and recent proposals to impose 'French music quotas' on radio
stations, were ridiculed in the media. Mr Toubon even faced the ignominy on
his recent birthday of hearing the guests at an official ceremony serenade
him with a chorus of 'Happy Birthday Mr Allgood'.
Le Journal du Dimanche, the popular Sunday paper, cheerfully hailed the
council's ruling as 'saying 'OK' to 'travelling', 'corner' and co]'. An
editorial in today's edition of Le Monde concluded 'Good sense has
triumphed'.

Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, faced with growing economic
sanctions, yesterday urged his kinsmen in Bosnia to accept an
internationally sponsored plan to end the civil war in their republic,
writes Bruce Clark.
It was the first time Mr Milosevic had expressed unequivocal backing for a
peace initiative designed by the 'contact group' of five big powers.
The group's foreign ministers conferred in Geneva at the weekend and pledged
to ratchet up punitive measures against the Serbs, both in Bosnia and in
Serbia, unless the plan was accepted. These did not include a lifting of the
ban on arms sales to Bosnia's Moslem-led government, an idea strongly
supported in the US.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday that Britain
still opposed rescinding the embargo but would not veto the move if other
countries insisted on it. He reaffirmed that Britain would pull out its
troops if arms sales to Bosnia were authorised and said there were already
serious concerns about the safety of the UK contingent.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has praised the Serbian
president for helping the peace process.
However senior British officials said the Milosevic administration was
continuing to supply the Bosnian Serbs with fuel extracted in
Serb-controlled areas of Croatia and then refined in Belgrade.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, complained that the
measures announced in Geneva were too mild to force a change in Serb
behaviour.
The five ministers pledged to tighten sanctions against Serbia, and ensure
tougher enforcement of the exclusion zones designed to protect Bosnian
Moslems. This could eventually lead to an intensified use of Nato air power
to protect Moslem safe havens. It might also lead to the establishment of
more 'exclusion zones' - where heavy artillery are subject to air strikes -
besides the two which exist already.
The ministers said they would insist on closer monitoring of Serbia's
borders, especially the frontier with the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia, through which goods have been passing.
Mr Izetbegovic deplored the fact that the ministers made no explicit
reference to military action against the Serbs, and questioned the
effectiveness of economic measures.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Berlusconi tries to escape a web of his own making: Italy's
PM now sees 'conflict of interest' dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silvio Berlusconi has finally recognised the obvious. In proposing a way to
distance himself from his Fininvest media empire, he has accepted that there
is a serious conflict of interest between his role as prime minister and his
ownership of Italy's second largest private business group.
Even before the media magnate became prime minister, he was warned of the
potential dangers arising from his conflicting interests as a businessman
and as a politician. His sole response was to name three lawyers - one of
whom had a direct link with Fininvest - to prepare a report by the end of
September.
Now circumstances have obliged him to anticipate their proposals and propose
a system of controls far more comprehensive than he would have liked.
The planned solution came on Friday, at the end of a week in which Mr
Berlusconi's credibility had been seriously damaged as his business empire
was placed under the microscope by Milan's anti-corruption magistrates.
The central aspect of Mr Berlusconi's scheme is to establish a five-member
commission, composed of the head of the anti-trust commission and the
chairman of the media watch-dog committee, plus three unnamed experts.
In tandem with the commission, an 'administrator', nominated by Mr
Berlusconi, would be created to monitor the management and strategy of
Fininvest, with powers to approve asset disposals. The commission, in turn,
would have the power to monitor all Fininvest activities and could reject
the choice of administrator.
His proposals have already come up against some hurdles and are likely to be
modified, given the opposition of his coalition partner, Mr Umberto Bossi,
the leader of the populist Northern League.
They have also run into constitutional objections from President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro. The president said it was outside his competence to name, in
conjunction with the speakers of the two houses of parliament, part of the
five-member commission to safeguard the conflict of interest.
The president appears to be hinting that he does not want to compromise his
impartiality by helping Mr Berlusconi solve a problem he should have
resolved before taking e.
Any future commission's ability to remedy the situation is also in question.
The US-style 'blind trust', which lets public officials hand over the
management of their assets in the form of stocks and shares, does not fit Mr
Berlusconi's unusual position as owner of a complex group active in
sensitive areas of the economy.
Fininvest, with a L11,600bn (Pounds 4.8bn) turnover and L3,800bn of net debt
at the end of 1993, is undergoing serious readjustment and requires an
active management, capable of strategic decisions on growth, asset disposals
and debt reduction.
While willing to let management operate independently under a system that
offers considerable flexibility and reasonably transparent controls, Mr
Berlusconi is not ready to distance himself from ownership.
Mr Franco Tato, who was brought in as chief executive under pressure from
creditor banks last October, has been restructuring Fininvest with a
relatively free hand, despite the presence of two of Mr Berlusconi's eldest
children, a cousin and his closest friend on the board.
The conflict of interest has not been in the management of the group but in
the way Mr Berlusconi has been seen to continue defending Fininvest.
This situation has been further complicated by the role of Forza Italia, the
political support movement backing Mr Berlusconi. It has been funded in part
by the Fininvest empire and is run almost entirely by people who were
employees until three months ago.
One of Forza Italia's most powerful figures is Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the
head of Publitalia, the group's advertising arm. Mr Berlusconi also hangs
onto his team of ex-Fininvest associates in the cabinet, all of whom have a
stake in the fortunes of the group. He wanted Mr Cesare Previti, his lawyer,
to be justice minister and only switched him to the defence portfolio after
objections about a conflict of interest.
Apart from those conflicts of interest which have already emerged, plenty of
others loom ahead. For example, Fininvest's three TV channels control 80 per
cent of commercial television and could be direct beneficiaries of any
change in status of the loss-making RAI, the state broadcasting
organisation; the liberalisation of state-run telecommunications could
countenance the use of telephone lines for TV image transmission as
canvassed by Fininvest; Fininvest's life assurance business stands to gain
from new legislation on pension funds.
With so many potential conflicts of interest, an active impartial commission
would slow the business of a Berlusconi government.
The existence of the impartial body will allow Mr Berlusconi's coalitition
partners a constant opportunity to refer government policy to the commission
by appealing against a conflict of interest. This, in turn, risks placing an
unfair 'political' burden on the commission. President Scalfaro is believed
to have voiced such a concern.
In saying he is willing to distance himself from Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi
has ruled out the idea of placing his share of the business in a trust or
foundation for his five children. The tax on such an operation would
reportedly be punitive. But even on Friday he still refused to give details
on the proprietary shares held by different members of the family.
Fininvest, founded in 1978, has an ownership structure geared to limit tax
liability. Through 22 'box' companies, the family owns 51 per cent of
Fininvest directly and the remainder through two fiduciaries, Servizio
Italia and Saf, set up by the Socialist-controlled BNL bank.
Mr Berlusconi has never said how much he personally owns of the empire he
founded, or what links remain between Fininvest and the construction and
newspaper interests hived off to his younger brother, Paolo, in 1992 for
anti-trust reasons.
Thus Italians do not know what exactly Mr Berlusconi is distancing himself
from, even if they take his word that he is the owner.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Moscow tries to limit MMM fallout: No taxpayers' money to
compensate those who bought shares in tottering company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government sought over the weekend to limit the damage caused by
the threatened collapse of the MMM finance house - in which millions have
invested in the hope of huge returns - by saying it would not use taxpayers'
money to compensate those who had gambled and lost on MMM shares.
The company, however, continued to proclaim its solvency, and yesterday
sought to prove it by raising the price of shares from the Rbs1,000 it had
announced on Friday - cut from the previous high of Rbs115,000 - to
Rbs1,125. It also told pensioners and invalids that it would redeem their
shares at the previous high price on the receipt of a written request.
The ground round the MMM office in a Moscow suburb yesterday was, once
again, crowded with people on a brilliant summer day - with touts doing
brisk business selling pensioners and invalids ordinary pieces of paper for
Rbs100 - a new high-water mark of the market economy - on which they could
write their requests for refunds. Mrs Frida Prosyanikova, a pensioner
receiving Rbs80,000 (about Pounds 27) a month, said she had one share for
which she had saved for a year, and did not know whether or not to sell it
or retain it in the hope of the shares climbing again.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, speaking from
Petrozavodsk in the Karelian republic, said there would be no compensation
because 'people could only be repaid by those who had not bought MMM shares'
 -showing a now typical concern for the interests of the taxpayer.
Ramming the point home in a TV interview on Saturday, Mr Andrei Kazmin, a
deputy finance minister, said, 'The market economy means above all the
direct personal responsibility of each individual.'
Mr Chernomyrdin softened the blow by acknowledging that the government was
at fault for failing to bring in legislation on the securities market, and
blamed the Finance Ministry and its senior officials for failing to use what
rules and regulations there were.
'We cannot stop people buying the shares but we were obliged to explain to
them what was behind this,' he said, and promised 'punishment' for those
responsible.
The Finance Ministry, now preparing a set of regulations in record time,
said it would insist on an audit of MMM and all similar companies now
operating in the market. One such company is Telemarket, whose shares fell
over the weekend from Rbs30,000 to Rbs16,000. However, it blamed the mass
media for continuing to broadcast and publish MMM advertisements after the
publication of a presidential decree in June offering investors protection
from irresponsible advertising.
For his part Mr Sergei Mavrodi, MMM chairman, promised a meeting with
representatives of the shareholders on Saturday, then failed to turn up. The
company says it will open its selling points tomorrow and again trade in the
shares at the new price of Rbs1,125.
The black market price of the old shares continued to enjoy a substantial
premium over the new issues, hovering between Rbs6,000 and Rbs8,000. This
was widely interpreted to indicate people's refusal to believe they will not
be redeemed.
A poll taken by the Institute of Sociology on Saturday gave some comfort to
the government, which has tended to be blamed for MMM's threatened crash
because of warnings it delivered on its viability 10 days ago. The poll
showed that 25 per cent of the Muscovites questioned said they would blame
the company for the crisis, while 21 per cent said the shareholders
'gullibility and naivety' were to blame - against 13 per cent blaming the
government and the taxation service.
The poll showed that only 7 per cent had investments in MMM, while 46 per
cent had shares in other companies - probably as a result of the widespread
distribution of shares during the first stage of the privatisation process.
Less than 2 per cent of shareholders, even MMM shareholders, said they would
contemplate protest action against the government if the company went
bankrupt.
The newspapers have largely reflected an anti-government tone in the affair,
with Nezavisimaya Gazeta, its sharpest critic, weighing in at the weekend
with a headline which read 'Mr Mavrodi had acted in the same way as Chubais
(the privatisation minister) but with more flair'. It quoted Mr Chubais
saying that 40m shareholders in privatised companies were now an
irresistible political force, and contrasted this with Mr Mavrodi saying his
shareholders were now also an aroused mass which could bring down any
government which gainsaid it.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Chechens under verbal attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chechnya, the rebel Russian republic in the north Caucasus, continued to be
under sustained rhetorical attack from the Russian government over the
weekend, in what appears to be preparation for either an armed intervention
by Russian forces or an effort to stimulate the Chechen opposition to stage
a coup.
Mr Umar Avturkhanov, head of the opposition Temporary Council for Chechnya,
was given prime time on Commonwealth TV on Saturday night to claim that the
Council was the rightful government of Chechnya - a broadcast which would
not have been seen in Chechnya itself because of the republic's decision to
jam Central TV programmes.
Mr Avturkhanov said neither he nor Russia wanted intervention by armed
forces from outside the republic - but 'The Russian authorities should
accept our request (for recognition). . . as the highest organ of power in
the republic'.
Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff for President Boris Yeltsin, accused
General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, of beheading his opponents
and putting the severed heads on display. The daily Komomolskaya Pravda said
that on Saturday three opposition activists were beheaded and their heads
set up on poles in the main square of the republic's capital, Grozny.
The opposition broadcast and Mr Filatov's comments came after the official
news agency Tass published a statement from the government on Friday
describing Gen Dudayev's rule as illegitimate and promising that the Russian
authorities would intervene to ensure the rule of law and the protection of
its citizens.
Chechnya, which declared independence in 1992 and has since defied all
efforts by Russia to bring it within the fold of the Russian Federation, is
widely seen in Russia as a state run by and for criminal gangs who prey off
Russian cities, especially Moscow and St Petersburg. Its gang warfare has
spread as far as Britain - where two Chechens were found murdered in a
London flat last year - and the country is believed to be a conduit for
drugs from the Caucasus and Central Asia into Europe.

FT  01 AUG 94 / BT urges shake-up of telecom regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rules governing UK broadcasting and telecommunications will need a radical
overhaul to manage the growth of advanced 'superhighway' services, according
to Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications.
Sir Iain called for a single 'communications regulator' as the telecoms,
computing and broadcasting industries converge, in place of the existing
array of regulators in each sector.
He also called for cable operators to be subject to similar regulatory curbs
to BT. Cable operators compete with BT, building local networks to offer
telecoms, TV and advanced inter-active services.
Sir Iain told the Financial Times that the 'ideal' regulatory structure
would take on the functions of Oftel, the telecoms watchdog; the Independent
Television Commission, which oversees part of the broadcasting industry; and
the regulatory duties of several government departments.
Sir Iain said the move might be driven by changes outside the UK, pointing
to the European Union's Bangemann report on European 'superhighways', which
raised the prospect of an EU-wide communications regulator.
Supporting a recent suggestion by Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of
Oftel, Sir Iain said that when the present price cap on BT retail prices
expires in 1997 it might be replaced with price restrictions on BT's network
charges but freedom for BT to set retail prices.
Mercury, BT's main competitor, already has more than a fifth of the market
for international calls, where the case for ending BT's retail price cap is
particularly strong.
Sir Iain called for such a regime to apply to all telecoms operators with
networks, 'rather than one which treated BT's network as a quasi-public
asset which others should have access to on privileged terms'. That raises
the prospect that BT might seek to retail services across the networks of
other operators, particularly those of cable operators, who by 1997 will
have several million subscribers and be offering inter-active services.
Sir Iain said BT would seek special protection for 'superhighway'
investments that upgraded its core network.

FT  01 AUG 94 / China suspends listing of new stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's beleaguered stock market regulators have suspended new stock
listings this year to brake the downward slide by the country's equity
markets.
China's A-share index for local investors in Shanghai, the country's main
exchange, closed at 333.92 on Friday, 80 per cent down from its February
1993 peak of 1,640.71.
The decision to stop new listings followed an emergency meeting between the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and stock market officials. It
reflects growing official concern at a disastrous loss of public confidence
in China's fledgling stock markets.
The freeze on new listings covers share issues delayed from last year and
those proposed for 1994. The commission had already slowed the listing
process but that had little effect on the markets.
The CSRC will seek to increase the number of institutional investors and
will encourage the establishment of Sino-foreign companies to channel funds
into the A-share market, which is restricted to local investors.
Among reasons identified by stock regulators for the market volatility is
the lack of a solid institutional base among investors. Most investors are
private individuals seeking short-term speculative gains.
China's securities regulators are also looking at schemes to pump money into
'selected securities institutions to enliven trading'.
The latest CSRC announcement made no mention of plans to combine A-shares
and B-shares to boost confidence in the market and increase turnover.
B-shares for foreigners are denominated in yuan but are traded in US and
Hong Kong dollars.
Foreign securities analysts say that while merging the A and B-share markets
in Shanghai and Shenzhen is desirable, it is not feasible as long as the
yuan is not fully convertible.
In continuing efforts to 'talk up' the markets, Mr Liu Hongru, chairman of
the CSRC, was quoted in the official media on Saturday as saying that China
would issue Dollars 1bn worth of B-shares for overseas investors in the
'coming years'.
Mr Liu said the timing of the shares would depend on 'market conditions' and
on companies' preparatory work. He also noted that foreign companies had
discussed listing in Shanghai and Shenzhen, depending on yuan
convertibility.
No timetable has been set for making the yuan convertible, but Chinese
officials say tentatively that they hope such a step can be achieved 'within
five years'.
Foreign institutions, including Japanese investment houses, have been buying
B-shares, but those markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen are jittery. Indexes
are down by some 30 per cent this year.
Regulators are seeking to put the best face on the collapse of the markets.
'The problems that have cropped up in the stock markets are ones in the
course of progress,' Xinhua quoted one official as saying.

FT  01 AUG 94 / Student loans may be sold off to cut education spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Government is considering privatising the Student Loans Company in
response to the prospect of a further Treasury squeeze on higher education
funding.
Ministers are studying two options for the organisation responsible for
administering loans to students in higher education: an outright
privatisation, probably via a sale to a group of banks; or, more probably,
securitising the company's debt.
Both would be designed to cut dramatically the up-front cost of the loan
operation, which on present plans will rise to Pounds 688m next year and
Pounds 900m in 1996-97.
The government plans to increase the proportion of students' living costs
funded by repayable loans by 10 per cent for each of the next three years
and to impose parallel cuts in student grant rates.
But the rapid rise in the number of students going into higher education and
the lengthy terms of repayment of the loans means that the finances of the
Student Loans Company, at present a government agency, will remain in
deficit for at least 10 years.
Former students do not begin repaying the loans until they have reached an
income threshold of 85 per cent of average earnings and the repayment rate
is pegged solely to the retail price index. So far more than a million loans
have been taken out. Treasury demands for a reduction in overall government
spending limits have put the Education Department under pressure to reduce
its higher education budget.
One option is to repeat the decision taken in the 1993 Budget to cap tuition
fees paid to the universities, removing the incentive for them to expand
departments and take on extra students. But in political terms removing the
cost of loans from the government's books would be a much more attractive
route.
In 1989 the main clearing banks rejected a government scheme under which
they would have administered the loans. But ministers believe the absence of
the feared political backlash against the loan system and the small
proportion of loan defaults might persuade financial institutions to rethink
their opposition.
Outright privatisation, however, would require legislation, deferring any
savings at least until 1996.
Securitisation of the debt - its sale to financial institutions at a
discount or with a Treasury guarantee - would also remove the cost from the
Treasury's books and could be done without legislation.
Such a move would be in line with the announcement last week by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, that all public expenditure demands should in
future be tested against the possibility of a privately financed
alternative.

FT  01 AUG 94 / US threatens sanctions on Japan: Tokyo given 60 days to meet
demands on market access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday launched trade sanction proceedings against Japan in an
effort to force the Tokyo government to open its market to imports of
telecom and medical equipment.
At the same time the US was on the brink of trade retaliation against Canada
as a deadline approached for resolving a row over Canadian wheat exports.
The worsening disputes are a test of Washington's resolve after much tough
talking about market access in Japan and about protecting US interests.
Japan now has 60 days to meet US demands or face the risk of higher tariffs
on selected Japanese exports to the US.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, formally set the sanction
proceedings under way by identifying Japanese government procurement
practices as discriminatory against imports of US telecom and medical
equipment. These are two fields where US producers claim they are highly
competitive but yet have been unable to make gains in the Japanese market.
Mr Kantor said he was acting in response to Japan's 'failure to address
long-standing discrimination against US suppliers'.
Talks over Canadian wheat exports to the US were still unresolved late
yesterday. A Canadian delegation had returned home after talks were broken
off, though the two sides maintained telephone contact in an attempt to
avert imminent US sanctions.
US farmers are upset at Canadian wheat exports to the US and claim the
Canadians are successful because of 'unfair trade' practices.
The US is reluctant to take action against Japan and Canada. Critics already
claim its tough approach to Japan has destabilised the two countries'
trading relationship and driven the yen up and the dollar down.
Retaliatory action against Japan or Canada, or both, would be the first
since the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation was signed
in Marrakesh earlier this year.
The US has only a flimsy rationale for limiting Canadian wheat exports.
The US International Trade Commission, acting on a request from President
Bill Clinton, recently found that Canada's wheat sales had damaged the US
price support programme. But three of the six commissioners found the harm
to be minimal and recommended only weak sanctions.
Mr Clinton is expected to decide as early as today what action, if any, to
take to curb wheat imports.
Even if there is retaliation, it might be temporary. The US law under which
the action would be taken will disappear in January when the new World Trade
Organisation comes into effect as successor to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
US and Japanese negotiators have been reporting progress in their row over
telecom and medical equipment - but not enough. Japan last week gave the US
a detailed compromise proposal containing elements of 'objective indicators
to measure progress' in market access, as demanded by the US.
Japanese negotiators had not held out much hope that this would be enough to
stave off the start of sanctions proceedings. As a result, Tokyo has been
calm in facing the prospect of trade sanctions proceedings being launched. A
foreign ministry official said yesterday Japan would continue to seek a
resolution to the issue within the framework talks on trade set in motion a
year ago.
Japan is resisting US demands for 'objective criteria' to measure improved
penetration of Japanese markets. Another difficulty is the US demand for a
pact calling for 'significant increases' in access and sales in Japan.

FT  30 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) BCCI official convicted of aiding profits fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 3rd August 1994) appended to this article.
A former senior official with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International was convicted yesterday at the Old Bailey of helping
dishonestly to boost the bank's profits by Pounds 250m.
Mr Imran Imam, a former accounts officer based at BCCI's London
headquarters, was convicted of one charge of conspiring to conceal
documents, two of conspiring to falsify records or documents and one of
furnishing false information. He was acquitted of one charge of furnishing
false information.
He was released on bail and will be sentenced next Wednesday.
The conviction of Mr Imam marks the fourth successful prosecution brought by
the Serious Fraud Office following its investigation into BCCI.
However the prosecution proved controversial, provoking the anger of US
prosecutors in the New York District Attorney's Office. They have relied
upon Mr Imam as a main witness in the US trials and felt his conviction
could taint his reputation as a possible witness.
Mr John Moscow, assistant district attorney, told a pre-trial hearing in
London that because the US authorities believed the SFO would use Mr Imam as
a witness - not put him on trial - they had given the SFO documents relating
to Mr Imam. The SFO denies giving an assurance that Mr Imam would not be
prosecuted.
Mr Imam worked closely with Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief
executive, and Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, its former president.
He helped to boost the bank's profits by falsifying documents relating to
loans totalling Dollars 2bn apparently made by BCCI to wealthy customers.
BCCI never intended these loans to be repaid but was able to claim it was
receiving income in the form of interest and fees from the transactions.
Mr Iman himself received interest-free loans from the bank which totalled
Pounds 1m.
Earlier this month the SFO secured the arrest of Mr Abbas Gokal, the head of
the Gulf Group, the international shipping and trade conglomerate which was
by far BCCI's largest customer.
Mr Gokal was arrested at Frankfurt airport by German police after the SFO
received reports that he had left Pakistan where he had remained, safe from
extradition, since 1991. Proceedings to extradite him to the UK have begun.
The SFO is also considering bringing charges against Mr Naqvi. This will
depend on events in the US where he is negotiating a plea-bargain deal with
federal prosecutors. He was also sentenced to 14 years imprisonment by the
Abu Dhabi authorities.
Previous SFO prosecutions over BCCI have led to the convictions of Mr Syed
Ali Akbar, a former head of the bank's treasury department, Mr Mohammed
Baqi, a former head of Attock Oil, and Mr Nazmu Virani, the former property
entrepreneur.
CORRECTION
In Saturday's report on the conviction of Mr Imran Imam, a former Bank of
Credit and Commerce International employee, for offences connected with the
inflation of the bank's profits, we reported he received an interest-free
loan from BCCI. Mr Imam's loan was not given on any preferential basis.

FT  30 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opening auctions of the new selling season in Australia brought a fresh rise
in wool prices this week, which continued and led to an increase in the
newly based market indicator of 7 cents, to close at 681 cents a kg. This
means an increase compared with the end of June of about 15 cents or 2.5%,
though adjustments make exact comparisons difficult. Wool at other auctions
this week, in New Zealand and of British wool in Bradford, showed a similar
or greater advance. Traders still indicate resistance to higher prices from
the retail end, despite the maintained upward trend and the relatively low
level of wool prices on any long term comparison. Holidays now affect many
of the leading wool processing countries in Europe but otherwise activity is
good.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Terrorist targets identified last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A security report identifying London's 'embassy row', which includes the
Israeli embassy, as a prime potential target for a car-bomb attack was given
to the royal household and to the Metropolitan Police at the end of last
year.
The 100-page risk analysis, which detailed the resurging threat of
fundamentalist groups opposed to peace moves in the Middle East, was
prepared by one of Britain's leading anti-terrorist experts.
It was commissioned by officials working for the royal family as part of a
security review of the state departments of Kensington Palace, which is
situated near the Israeli embassy.
The report's author, Major John Wyatt, was a serving officer in Ulster. His
private company, Search Training International, has advised businesses on
protection against terrorism and on security for the Crown Jewels.
Maj Wyatt said this week that he had been concerned about security being
relaxed prior to Tuesday's bomb at the Israeli embassy. However he added
that in his view 'no degree of risk analysis' could have prevented the
attack.
Nevertheless news of the report's existence will be an embarrassment to
security officials who have been criticised by the Israeli government for
ignoring requests for additional security after the July 18 bomb attack on
the central Jewish community building in Buenos Aires which killed at least
96 people.
Scotland Yard would not comment on the report but a police official
expressed surprise that a risk analysis for Kensington Palace on such a
sensitive subject should have been commissioned from a private consultancy
and not from the police or the intelligence agencies.
The report does not specifically refer to the Israeli embassy. However it
identifies the growing threat of terrorism by Iran and by fundamentalist
groups opposed to the Middle East peace moves.
According to the analysis, the threat had shifted from the US to Europe
following the bomb attack on New York's World Trade Centre.
Predictions of an upsurge in fundamentalist terrorism do not appear to have
been shared by MI5 and MI6, the intelligence agencies. Both appear to have
focused their attention on the threat posed by the IRA.

<TEXT>
The US will send troops into Rwanda to help boost emergency relief efforts
at the airport in the capital, Kigali. Pentagon officials said yesterday
that up to 200 troops would go to Kigali, but stressed they would be on a
humanitarian, rather than peacekeeping mission. At least 4,000 US troops are
already being sent to Zaire and Uganda to help deliver food, water and other
supplies to more than 1m Rwandan refugees who fled their homeland as rebels
won a bloody civil war. In another move to step up help, President Clinton
yesterday asked Congress to approve Dollars 320m of extra aid. Meanwhile, a
top United Nations aid official, Mr Peter Hansen, predicted Rwanda could see
yet another 'world record' refugee exodus when French troops pull out of
their south-western security zone next month. About 1.6m Rwandan Hutus have
taken refuge in the safe area set up by France, which says it will withdraw
its 2,500 troops by the time its UN mandate expires on August 22. The first
French troops left yesterday.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Spanish trawlers end blockade
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 300 Spanish trawlers yesterday ended a four-day blockade of most
north coast domestic ports, as well as of the border town of Hendaye in
France. The blockade was to protest against alleged illegal tuna fishing
practices by French vessels. The protest, which has severely affected
maritime traffic, including tourist-laden ferries, ended after the Madrid
government gave assurances it would insist on strict implementation of EU
fishing guidelines and closely monitor the quality of fish imported from
France. The 'tuna war', over French trawlers' use of drift nets to catch
tuna which is then exported to Spain, prompted clashes between the two
fleets earlier this month. The Spanish trawler fleet, which uses rods to
land tuna, claims the French vessels use nets longer than the 2.5km
permitted by the EU.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Such woolly ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once it was fur coats. Now, since fashion gurus have obscured the difference
between real and ersatz hides, it is woolly jumpers. Shops one thought of as
staid - the Scottish knitwear specialists, with their changeless tartan ties
and avuncular cardigans - have become targets of the Animal Rights Militia.
This is the organisation which gutted the Cambridge store of Edinburgh
Woollen Mills earlier in the month. The local animal rights spokesman
allocated precise credit for the action to a guerrilla sub-group of his
movement, known as the Justice Department. And justice, he said, had been
done on the grounds that 'sheep-shearing leaves sheep susceptible and cold
as a naked human.'
This was not an isolated incident. The Cambridge branch of Boots the
Chemists was set alight, and certain research units around Britain have
received a new sort of home-made bomb: an exploding mousetrap primed with
razor blades. This aims not only to remove the digits of those scientists
suspected of animal abuse, but also makes a statement on behalf of mice, so
often the choice for laboratory tests.
A flurry, then, of animal rights activity. There is nothing new in this. But
the extension of anathema-status to pullovers is new, and it is always
interesting to watch how the British deal with such issues, for the British
make it part of their self-definition that they are kind to animals when
others in Europe, especially southern Europe, are not.
This nationalistic pride was trumpeted during European negotiations about
rules for transporting livestock. Even those of us who like a good steak, it
seems, are concerned that the ox shall travel to his slaughter in decent
comfort.
Gourmets will point out that a well-rested beast tastes better, so this is
not pure charity; still, it is true that the British get angry about the
ill-treatment of animals, and in that sense the animal rights movement is
never entirely marginal.
Whether many wool-wearing people or even woolly liberals will ever feel pity
for chilly sheep is doubtful. But translating kindness towards animals into
justice for animals is something that we ought to take more seriously than
we do, and scientists, with distinguished exceptions, such as James Gaia
Lovelock, are too quiet about it.
Those activists who resort to pyromania are probably not the sort to engage
in rational argument. Yet it is a debate which used to be very much alive in
pagan philosophy. Pythagoras, who first articulated vegetarianism in the
sixth century BC, was only one of many thinkers who addressed animal rights.
But Christian theologians from St Augustine onwards have quelled the issue,
being content to accept the animal kingdom as a part of creation subordinate
to human needs. According to St Augustine, if we took the commandment 'Thou
shalt not kill' as an injunction not to slaughter animals, we should also
have to prohibit ourselves from uprooting parsnips.
This is what logicians call a slide. To say that one move will lead to
another is a familiar method for blocking moral progress. Faced with a man
who believes that sheep should not be shorn, we might then insist that he
abstain from the consumption of honey, milk and eggs - all of which have
been regarded as theft by some legally-minded purists - and, like St
Augustine, challenge him to wrench a happy parsnip from the earth.
The application of human justice to the animal world hinges, as Richard
Sorabji demonstrated recently in Animal Minds and Human Morals (Duckworth),
on how far we consider animals to share in the human capacity for reason.
Charles Darwin believed that there was no human trait which could not be
found reflected in one animal or another; but modern scientists, following
Aristotle, have been forced to use an exclusion zone based on a
technicality. The technicality is that animals have no syntax. It follows
that if a creature cannot construct a sentence, then we are at liberty to do
with it what we will in the slaughterhouse or the research institute.
Consideration of babies, parrots and chimpanzees will immediately generate
worries about the absolute logic of this technicality. Indeed, it is hard to
see what relevance it has in a debate which is primarily about pain and the
capacity of living things to feel it.
Pythagoras stopped a man beating a dog because he recognised in the dog's
yelps the voice of an old friend. Most of us, if we think about it, will
admit unease about testing chemicals on beagles. That does not mean,
necessarily, that we would not wish chemicals to be tried on rats, nor that
we should charitably prefer to wear nylon rather than wool.
What matters is that we give the matter some thought. In that sense, one has
to feel grateful for the occasional arson attack. Crass as they are, such
actions are not unfounded. They rightly make us think.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Just a handful of dust: A look at the fuss over Michael
Atherton's behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not necessary to travel very far from Britain to realise what a very
strange place it must seem to foreigners. To spend two weeks in the south of
France is to be regaled with the most hair-raising stories of local
corruption.
Fingers point at this or that new development which would never have been
allowed but for an even larger than usual bribe. The strange thing is that
the local politicians who take these payments - no names here, I am afraid -
are often spoken of extremely warmly.
After one such encounter I returned to our rented villa and tuned into
British satellite television news. Almost the entire bulletin was devoted to
the fact that two Conservative MPs had been paid Pounds 1,000 each in return
for asking a parliamentary question.
Not very seemly, I agree, but southern French heads would shake in disbelief
at an entire national news bulletin being dominated by such an item,
particularly as it was generally agreed that the two MPs had broken no law.
On my return to Britain I discovered that the newspapers were dominated by
another story of less than global significance: a young man was being
excoriated by every columnist of note for putting his hand in his pocket and
rubbing a bit of dirt on a ball.
True, the man in question, Michael Atherton, is captain of the English
cricket team, and his action, during a Test match against South Africa,
appeared to infringe one of the less well-drafted laws - never say 'rules' -
of cricket.
But I am sure that it is not just over-exposure to the heady air of southern
French corruption which makes me think there is something absurd in the
extent to which Atherton's folly has been elevated to the level of a
national scandal, with leader writers being obliged to decide what
retribution the readers of The Daily Brute or Beast would wish to see
exacted upon a man, it is generally admitted, of outstanding qualities.
Some calls for Atherton's resignation, such as from the BBC's cricket
correspondent, Jonathan Agnew, are doubtless sincerely felt. But there is a
self-serving element here which goes beyond cant and hypocrisy.
It is that the newspapers love a story to be as big as possible, and that
there is nothing bigger than an English cricket captain being sacked. It is
also true that the press, like all good story-tellers, require a beginning,
a middle and an end. First, with the aid of cameras, they find something
out.
Next they expose the malfeasance to public scrutiny and ridicule. Finally
the evil-doer must admit the enormity of his error and resign, thus proving
that the press were all along justified in their hysteria.
We saw the same process in the case of Tory minister David Mellor (sin:
adultery), who lost the game, and in the case of BBC supremo John Birt (sin:
dodgy accountancy), who won.
Those who win are highly embarrassing for the press, as The Times has
discovered with John Major, who has survived its repeated assertion that he
will not survive as prime minister with something bordering on insouciance.
Generally the press have a stock response if one of those who were told to
resign succeeds in not doing so. It is that standards of moral probity in
British public life have declined lamentably.
Older heads are fond of recalling the case of Sir Thomas Dugdale who
resigned, 40 years ago, as minister of agriculture in the wake of the
Crichel Down affair, in which the wrong-doing was wholly that of ministry
officials. Sir Thomas declared that he was the minister responsible, and
must fall on his sword - or plough.
Which leaves me with one dangerously subversive thought. When was the last
time that a newspaper editor resigned because of a blunder that he had
committed (it does happen)?
Or when, in the late lamented style of the late lamented Sir Thomas, did a
newspaper editor last resign because of some wrong-doing on the part of one
of his minions? Answers on a (very small) French postcard, please.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Private View: Man who gave his life to Churchill - Sir
Winston's biographer, Martin Gilbert, talks about his own career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everything is there, wrote one reviewer, including Churchill's laundry list.
But it is not true, says Martin Gilbert, the English historian who holds the
record for the world's longest biography.
'No laundry lists appear in any of my volumes,' he said. 'It was a funny
myth, you see. The reviewer had read in a newspaper cutting something that
was true - that when I was going through the Churchill archive for 1934 I
found a laundry list from Beirut and this alerted me to the fact that he had
been in Beirut, which was not in any other biography.'
Martin Gilbert started work on Sir Winston Churchill more than 30 years ago.
Recruited by Winston's son, Randolph, he assisted with two volumes of
narrative and four of documentation. After Randolph's death, he added six
more volumes of biography and nine of documents. The tenth companion volume
comes out in November, which will bring the grand total of pages to 22,643
and of words to 9,694,000. And there are six volumes still to come - another
three or four years' hard work.
Gilbert has just published an entertaining bird's eye view of his literary
behemoth, a sort of biographer's autobiography, called In Search of
Churchill. But it was in search of Churchill's biographer, a much more
enigmatic figure, that I panted up Hampstead Hill in north London.
I found him in his word factory, a large study at the back of the house. A
fax machine buzzed and clattered in the corner. He seemed cautious but
friendly, displaying the mild awkwardness of one who has spent many hours in
solitary intellectual confinement.
The greatest living expert has his quirks. To devote almost an entire life
to the story of another man, however great, might be counted one of them.
Another is maps. Ever since he had to study the Schleswig-Holstein question
in his schooldays, Gilbert has been fascinated by them. He lists 'drawing
maps' as his recreation.
It is obvious that Gilbert has suffered: from those who use his material to
write hostile biographies of Sir Winston, even more from those who twist the
facts to suit their revisionist purposes, and from those who accuse him of
publishing millions of words without ever arriving at a real portrait.
For a while he evaded my attempts to get him to define his relationship with
his subject. Only when I asked if he dreamed about Churchill did he come out
of his shell.
'I don't. I don't think I am in any way obsessed by him. But I do get quite
agitated if I read something about him which I know to be untrue and somehow
to be absurdly untrue, or something very negative which I know to be
ridiculous.'
Examples, he said, included the assertions that Churchill was a racist, that
he was a warmonger, that he was always anti-Soviet, that he was against the
miners in the 1926 General Strike. 'Any historical figure is very much at
the mercy of current fashion, of a clever, knocking attitude, or of some
brilliant misportrayal - as I would see it,' he said.
To illustrate, he mentioned a recent biography which quoted the phrase 'war
attracts my mind' from one of Churchill's letters to his wife Clementine.
This was written after watching German army manoeuvres before the first
world war, said Gilbert, who promptly recited the full quotation by heart:
'Much as war attracts me, fascinates my mind by its tremendous combination,
I can feel here in the midst of arms more than ever before what vile and
utter folly and barbarism it all is.'
'The author must have had the full letter because I published it,' he added.
Do you write to the papers?
'No, I don't write to the papers. I'm not his defence lawyer. I'm not
defending him in a court of law. I'm not obliged, when some of these
controversial books come out, to defend him or express an opinion.
'Indeed there are things in my books which have become the basis of the
attacks on him. If that's recognised, it's pleasing. I don't have to feel
agitated because people take a different point of view.'
Have you left certain things out because they were interesting to voyeurs
but not to historians?
'No. Once or twice it was the exact reverse.' He described an occasion
during the war when Churchill was drunk and expressing outlandish opinions.
'They were not relevant to the conduct of the war, but I felt I had to bring
it in because it is part of him. It took place. It was true.'
You have been unusually trusted by your witnesses, I said, especially by
people wanting to put the record straight. Did you feel handicapped by their
trust?
'Not at all. Sometimes it worked the other way. People confided negative
things. It's not that I became the repository of Churchill-lovers. Even
within the family there were those with very critical views.'
Do you yourself have strong feelings about Churchill?
'I suppose I do. I do feel that some of the things that he fought for and
worked for, spent his waking hours trying to do, were important.'
That he was a great man?
'That he was a great man. And therefore I do get quite upset if the whole of
his life's endeavour is undermined. After all, I've spent quite a lot of my
life trying to establish what his life's endeavour was.'
So what were Churchill's faults?
'His tremendous lack of sensitivity to the attitudes of others. I deal with
that in every government department he had. He would bully, bruise and
batter others in his determination to make his point.'
General Sir Edward Spears, who knew Churchill during the first world war,
saw a different fault. It was, he told Gilbert innocently, that Winston was
'too fond of Jews'.
'One reviewer said that, as a Jew, I had a natural sympathy for the underdog
and was therefore overswayed by the fact that Churchill was against
dictators and expressed sympathy for victims. I think that's too subtle.
After all, you don't have to be Jewish to pay heed to the victims of
totalitarianism.'
I asked Gilbert if he had, after all, written a history rather than a
biography.
That could not be true, he replied. It was a 'life in the round', about
Churchill's personality, emotions, feelings and motivation as well as the
events in which he played a part.
It was the biographer's job to bring out such things as Churchill's capacity
for alienating people. But it was quite wrong for a biographer to deploy
evidence - let alone doctor it - to support his own opinion of his subject.
Why did you go to such lengths as to track down the estate agent who sold
him Chartwell? Some people would call that obsessive.
'No, no. It's my professional approach really, my academic training.'
Gilbert said he learned his methods from A J P Taylor, his tutor at Oxford,
a brilliant exploiter of public archives and private diaries.
Do you think there is such a thing as the truth?
'Yes, there is historical truth. But if truth is a building it has two
things undermining it: one is perspective, and one is the lack of evidence.
I do believe there is such a thing as true history, but it's not necessarily
tremendously exciting or revelatory. It's not the history of the conspiracy,
the secret.'
There must have been times, I said, when you wished you had never started.
The hardest part, he said, was tracking down those who in the 1930s had kept
Churchill supplied with government secrets, allowing him to campaign against
appeasement. One thing that kept him going throughout was the false picture
being painted by others.
In your desire to correct have you not become seen as an apologist?
'People are wrong in saying that somehow I am Churchill's partisan. They are
mistaking partisanship which excludes evidence for an attempt to tell the
story as it actually was.'
But isn't someone who spends 30 years of his life on a biography bound to be
partisan?
'I don't think so. He must have certain feelings which encourage him to get
to the bottom of it. Suppose I had done Hitler. I can envisage being just as
thorough and not coming out as an apologist of Hitler.'
In writing such a book, I suggested Gilbert had put himself at the mercy of
reviewers since few non-historians would read it.
He agreed and talked of a 'Berlin Wall' between a writer and his readers.
Some reviewers, he said, 'make you weep with pleasure and delight. With
others you think this man is simply not writing about my work.' Whichever
the case, readers of the work were greatly outnumbered by readers of
reviews.
For instance, the historian Philip Ziegler had described the work as
'monocular'. 'It wasn't even ill-meant. It was a phrase, quite a clever
phrase. I'm not quite sure what it means but it has that slight pejorative
thing. So hundreds of thousands of people will say 'Ah, yes, well, that's
Gilbert. He's monocular.' So my portrait in the round, as I believe it to
be, somehow doesn't exist in those readers' perceptions.'
So you feel you have acquired the opposite label from the one you have
earned?
'Yes, but I think you have to step back and say 'I'm not spending my
professional life in order to get a good label or run away from a bad one.'
It's unfortunate and sometimes it's rather painful but, you know, that's not
the object of the exercise.'
What will you do next?
'I haven't decided. When I was appointed to succeed Randolph I was about to
write the biography of Cripps. But now there is one.'
You can pick and choose, can't you?
'I have been so spoilt by archives that I think I could only choose somebody
whose archival impact was enormous.'
Do you mean Stalin?
Gilbert paused. 'No. I think, I'll leave Stalin to friends and colleagues.
No. I was thinking of some British figure. But I haven't one in mind.'
He smiled. 'All suggestions gratefully received.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Cathedrals take the road to Rouen - William Packer
admires Monet's masterpieces in situ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have always been artists who have engaged themselves, at least
loosely, with the idea of the series. The natural narrative of the lives of
the saints is an obvious example, as is the regular return to a particular
theme or image - the self-portraits of Rembrandt and Van Gogh, or the
near-formulaic landscapes of Hobbema or Turner.
But the insistent return to the particular image and its re-statement in its
identical format is something that we now recognise as being peculiar to the
art of the modern period. Indeed we have grown so used to it by now as a
convention of modernism that we hardly notice it. The conceptualism of the
late 20th century, so dear to our contemporary critical, avant-garde hearts,
could not get by without it.
Malevich, the Russian suprematist, who had seen the two examples of Monet's
Rouen cathedral facades in the Pushkin museum in Moscow before the
Revolution, was moved by the experience to say that 'Monet's cathedral has a
capital importance for the history of art and forces entire generations to
change their conceptions.'
Now, to brand Claude Monet as a pioneer of conceptual art would be perhaps a
shade mischievous, but it remains most certainly true that of all the great
artists of Impressionism and post-Impressionism he was the pioneer in the
practice of working thus closely in series. Furthermore, to take any of the
paintings from those series that became the determining feature of his later
career - the poplars, the hayricks, the Thames at Westminster, the pools and
water lillies, and of course the cathedral facades - and consider them not
simply but within the context of its particular group is inevitably to take
into account certain near-conceptual questions and assumptions.
For what we have are images that if they differ at all, they do so only
marginally and to little material effect in the bare terms of what they
superficially represent. Yet the differences between them are manifest, and
of the first importance to any direct experience, as much physical as
imaginative, of the works themselves. Elusive and imponderable as they are,
such differences register the shifting, delicate nuances of personal
response, ours and the artist's together, to the fleeting moment and passing
of time. There on the canvas is the stroke of the brush, and the
accumulation of paint that marks and records it and makes it permanent. And
there, in the mind as in the eye, is the conjuration of something altogether
more intangible and ephemeral, as the shadows pass across those immovable,
ever-changing arcades and pinnacles of the old cathedral - now light, now
dark, now yellow, pink, blue, morning and evening.
Monet knew Normandy well, especially the coast between Etretat and Dieppe,
and had often passed through Rouen. He had discovered Giverny, down the
Seine north west of Paris, in the early 1880s, and in 1890 bought the house
where he was to live for the rest of his life. He began at once to build the
water-garden which was to be the greatest and most compulsive of his
subjects, but his garden, as would any other, took time to grow. Besides, he
was never its prisoner and Rouen was less than forty miles away towards the
sea. He paid his first extended working visit to the city in 1892, returned
in 1893 and in the spring of 1894 embarked upon the series of cathedral
facades that, but for the later Nympheas, would be the greatest of them all.
He made 30 paintings in all, of which 20 were shown in Paris the following
summer by his dealer, Durand-Ruel. Monet's old friend, Georges Clemenceau,
saw at once that the state should buy the lot, le pacquet, and addressed
himself in no uncertain terms to the president of the Republic, Felix Faure,
to say so. But the moment passed. Inevitably they were dispersed, all but
ten of the original 30 eventually fetching up in public collections around
the world, but only seven of them in France. Eleven were brought together in
1990 for the Royal Academy's spectacularly successful exhibition of the
several 'Series of Monet,' and now 16 are being shown in Rouen, the first
time in a century so many have been reunited, and where better than in the
city of their making.
All conform more or less to the same format, more tall than wide and never
much more than three feet by two. The two earliest are exceptional in that
they concentrate less on the fabric of the cathedral itself than on the old
houses clustering round the foot of the corner tower that were destroyed in
the last war. For the rest, it is the facade proper that dominates, at first
full frontal, looking straight at the high-pointed gothic porch and round
west window, and then fixing on the more oblique and famous view that slants
across from the south west. And always the emphasis is across and upwards,
the ground incidental where it is described at all, the image ever more
suggestive, abstracted, hinted at rather than described. Pink fuses with
ochre, grey with violet, yellow with orange, the cathedral itself seeming to
dissolve into exquisitely covered smoke or mist, as it were a most
substantial pageant, faded. These paintings are indeed such stuff as dreams
are made on.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Drowned Out' at the Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of Birmingham Symphony made their second Prom appearance on
Thursday, bringing with them Mark-Anthony Turnage's almost-new Drowned Out.
He has been their resident composer for four years (courtesy of the
Radcliffe Trust), and Drowned Out was the final fruit of that happy
association.
The slightly jokey title belies the character of the music, for the
inspiration came from William Golding's Pincher Martin - in which the whole
novel consists of a life-in-flashbacks going through the mind of a drowning
man. Turnage's piece begins with sombre, 'submerged' chords and a slow
lament (saxophones are prominent, as usual with this composer). As the music
develops speed and fury, the suggestion of a rite is never lost; much of it
is underpinned by a fierce, repetitive beat, and it rises to several brassy
climaxes.
At last it declines into a chastened elegy, with morose clarinet. In all
this, there is a strict economy of material, carefully rotated and varied.
Perhaps the musical tension falters in two or three places, but the whole is
cogent enough. Certainly it marks a new stage in Turnage's command.
Drowned Out was not exactly flattered by its place in the programme,
following upon the 1926 Tapiola of Sibelius - a work of similar proportions
and severity, but by an old master. Rattle has been conducting that since
1979, and his hand with it is utterly assured. Some Sibelians draw it out
more grimly, but Rattle's unhesitating way with it sacrificed nothing.
Towards the end, the violins brilliantly suggested a driving Arctic
blizzard, through which the oracular brass stood firm.
One surprise: a quick passage in it suddenly and infallibly recalled
Debussy's La Mer (1905). That has not struck me before; was Rattle
deliberately pointing it up? (And was it a bit of composer's larceny?) Later
we were to hear La Mer itself, in a beautifully prepared performance that
wanted only a greater weight of strings than the CBSO can supply. From where
I sat, at least, they were sometimes submerged altogether.
As nearly always, Rattle seemed to have designed his programme to make
interesting points. The odd piece out - but not out of place - was
Messiaen's 1936 cycle of songs for his first wife, Poemes pour Mi, in his
much later orchestration (which Rattle rendered as delicately as possible).
There is a hothouse air about them, but in Maria Ewing's performance they
were hard to resist.
Miss Ewing was in lovely, velvet-voiced form, and obviously determined to
make the songs tell without the slightest forcing. If she lacked the full
power for a couple of places, she wisely refused to risk going through her
tone; we missed nothing, and the spell remained unbroken. She sang the cycle
by heart (no mean challenge), and illuminated it with a few simple gestures.
There have been past occasions when one felt that she was trying too hard
for theatrical effect - too much platform-drama, too many vocal tricks. Not
here: she had judged what the songs require to a nicety, and rendered them
with an air of dewy freshness. If that was a trick, it succeeded completely.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Sleeping Beauty' retains its purity - Clement Crisp
sees two fine performances from ENB soloists Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sleeping Beauty is the one, and supreme, masterpiece of 19th century
ballet that has come down to us in something like its original form. Or,
more accurately, is still available to us in a decently original form if a
producer has sufficient humility to respect what Petipa and Tchaikovsky
created. Other texts, from Giselle to Swan Lake, are variously corrupt and,
like tottering old ladies, are just waiting to be mugged by ballet's eager
gang of ruffians. And they do not wait in vain.
Beauty, because it is so massive in its forces, seems to be reasonably
protected, though there have been some pretty nasty attacks in recent years.
English National Ballet's staging - I reported on its first performance last
autumn - is by Ronald Hynd. Most of the proper (ie Royal Ballet in 1946)
text is honoured. Innovations are not crass. There is sometimes too much
clutter of activity - the old repertory, as the Kirov has persuasively shown
us, demands less rather than more to make its best effects - but what we see
is Beauty and not some Frankenstein mishap. Visually it has a certain
fairy-tale glamour, and the permanent setting is skilled, but it is still
far too bright. Peter Docherty's costuming suffers from the dreadful
qualities of man-made fibres, which are unyielding and un-nuanced in their
response to light and to movement. Natural materials may be a financial
menace, but they soften, flow, take on gentler shapes and a more responsive
lustre. Away with nylon.
To end its Coliseum performances this week, ENB has brought Beauty for a
first London showing. On Wednesday it was dominated and made memorable by
the performances of Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur. Miss Oaks has seemed in the
past the prettiest of dancers, but one whose gifts are for light-weight
roles. Her Aurora is clearly the fruit of serious work - it is technically
bright, clear, fluent and results in a portrait of a young princess having
beguiling charm of feeling, as of style. It is not a grand reading, though
effects are often prodigious, as in the wonderfully secure and
long-sustained balances, with nary a wobble. Miss Oaks brings sweetness,
youthful grace, even innocence, to the part. Sometimes she is too
ingratiating - passages when she lets the dance and her own natural
distinction speak are more effective than those in which she plays to her
suitors and to us - but it is an entirely delightful, honourable view of the
greatest challenge a ballerina can know. She has grown up as an artist.
I have been fortunate to have seen two ideal interpretations of the role of
Prince Florimund in half a century of looking at this ballet. Anton Dolin in
1948 - returning to Covent Garden with Markova - took to the stage in the
hunting scene with a dignity and grace of manner that were astonishing. In
1961, in the Kirov's ideal production, Oleg Sokolov was a figure of
Apollonian beauty - noble in manner, noble in dancing. I have measured every
other player against these. On Wednesday Thomas Edur matched these great
examplars of the danse noble. His manner is courteous, unforced. Character
is immediately established, as he avoids a persistent mistress, or stands
slightly remote amid his entourage. Temperament is touched with melancholy.
His dancing, despite the waders he must wear, is fluent, angelically
phrased. It is an astonishing impersonation, because as perfect as we have
right to expect in ballet's imperfect world.
In the wedding celebrations, his dancing is large in scale, shaped in long
easy sequences, phrase-endings beautifully melting. And there is neither
bombast, nor trickery, nor one iota of vulgarity in anything we see. It is
the dancing of a true heir to those real, if subliminal, traditions of
behaviour that take our balletic princes back to their actual historical
forebear, Louis XIV.
Company support is bright - and in the behaviour of King Florestan and his
courtiers, positively lurid. I liked Susan Jaffe as a serene, brilliant
Lilac Fairy, and salute James Supervia as a wonderfully convincing Tutor to
the prince, looking like Dr Johnson, and giving the role dignity. For fellow
admirers of King Herod, I record that there are infants in the Prologue
whose little runs and expressions of terror at the appearance of Carabosse
confirm us in our belief about the proper fate for stage-tots.
English National Ballet's summer season is sponsored by Nomura. Sleeping
Beauty continues at the Coliseum this week; then opens the ENB season at the
Royal Festival Hall from August 1.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Pop 'Establishment' left out in the cold - The Mercury
Prize is likely to raise some hackles in the music industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What would we do without arts prizes? The Turner gets the conceptualists and
the painters at each other's throats and the Booker sets post-modernists
against readers. And now the Mercury Prize for the British pop album of the
year is shaping up nicely to make many music people very cross. This is the
third year in which ten albums have been short listed by 'experts' to
compete for Pounds 25,000 - and a barrage of promotional opportunities.
Inevitably the award goes to a band that hardly needs it - last year Suede
generously gave the money away, although, like the 1992 winner Primal
Scream, it probably expected a bigger career boost from the prize than
actually happened. This year's ten albums suggest the careful mix and match
of a finely balanced committee. There is a representative from most of the
myriad faces of pop - except one.
There is no room for the Establishment. Albums by the Rolling Stones, Elvis
Costello and Kate Bush made the final 20, and then stalled. Pink Floyd
failed to get even that far. The Mercury is obviously going in for a bit of
proselytising, for the shock of the new, but in the most balanced way.
So what is on offer? The only big name listed is Paul Weller who, with Wild
Wood, has contributed the whimsical hippy album. This is what happens to
abrasive young punkers when the pop business gets to them, especially in the
wallet. The lyrics go nowhere, slowly, and the melodies come packaged from
some Californian dream factory. What a contrast this is to the punk album on
the list, from the Ulster band Therapy. Troublegum hits you like a
sledgehammer, and does not loosen its grip through a welter of songs which
are almost a parody of life seen from the gutter. So much youthful angst, so
much raw energy and power - it is as stimulating as Weller is soporific.
The inevitable black soul entry this year is Shara Nelson with What Silence
Knows. She has more genuine emotion than last year's representative of this
form, Dina Carroll, and seems equally happy with the heart-torn ballad and
the old fashioned disco whirl.
This is much easier listening that the pseudo-classical contestant, Michael
Nyman's The Piano Concerto which shares the CD with TGV, his pean to the
French express train. Nyman takes a tiny little tune and adds layer after
layer of sound, breaking the back of the simple melody. The Piano Concerto
was originally the soundtrack of Jane Campion's movie The Piano and has that
unneccessary, background, feel to it.
There must be an album to keep the largest sector of the pop buying public,
young girls, happy, and naturally Take That's Everything Changes makes the
top ten. Gary Barlow writes some very infectious songs: indeed the band is
much better than its hunk poster image, and if Take That are very clever
they could avoid the inevitable three year life span that dogs pretty boy
bands and become a serious music making machine.
Old rockers will like Ian McNabb's Head Like a Rock, which keeps the Bruce
Springsteen tradition alive. Little surprise that it was recorded in LA with
Neil Young's backing band, Crazy Horse. With its crashing chords and
harmonious melodies, this will restore the faith of jaded 30 year olds in
the redemptive power of pop.
Naturally there has to be a 'British' pop album and what better than Blur's
Parklife. This is how todays youth likes to see itself: urban, street wise,
funky, and basically light hearted. There is something of Madness, something
of Squeeze in this generous hotchpotch of 16 songs. It is slightly too sharp
for its own naivety, but anyone wanting a musical commentary on Major's
Britain could hardly do better.
When the young are not being cheeky they are dancing, and the three dance
albums included once again neatly cover the musical range. His'n'hers by
Pulp is what might happen at a suburban diso when filtered through the ears
of an imaginative spectator; Music for the Jilted Generation by The Prodigy
is hard core techno rave, pretty unrelieved, insistent, body jerking, stuff;
and M-People's Elegant Slumming is the type of disco music loved both by
inveterate clubbers and the Christmas office party crowd.
To build up more excitement before the announcement on September 13, the
organisers of the Mercury Prize have persuaded William Hill to give odds on
the contestants. Blur is favourite at 2-1, with Take That at 7-2. My choice
would be M-People (5-1), not because it is likely to win  - it is too light
heartedly predictable to carry weight with the judges - but because it has
all the virtues of good pop: immediate accessibility, a wonderful beat, and
insidiously memorable melodies. You recognise such hit singles from it as
'One Night in Heaven' and 'Moving on Up' from their opening bars because
they are the songs that are played in the boutiques, the hairdressers, the
sounds of the age.
The Mercury Prize helps to give the chaotic pop world some shape and
substance but it still seems to skim the surface of the art form. No regrets
at the failure of dreary, one dimensional, rappers to make the list, but why
no jazz, currently enjoying yet another revival; or big band blues; or
country? Still the sampler, which includes a track from each album, should
be out in the next two weeks, and gives an instant run-down on the current
state of British pop.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Codes of honour put to the test - 'Le Cid' at the
Cottesloe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sculptural horses frozen in mid-gallop hover above the stage; two huge
gilded frames turn the action into a picture - one empty, the other
containing a transparent mirror where characters can see themselves and
through which others can loom. Is someone recalling the famous, or infamous,
ENO Masked Ball? Designer Peter J. Davidson is certainly an old opera hand.
But, despite these visual echoes, Jonathan Kent's production of Corneille's
Le Cid at the National Theatre's Cottesloe comes up with nothing so
revolutionary.
The French Classical theatre is notoriously hard to bring off in English.
'Le style, c'est tout,' and that's the trouble. Even replacing the six-beat
alexandrine with the traditional English pentameter leaves us with the
problem of rhyme. We associate rhyming couplets with pantomime, with
facetiousness, the intentionally frivolous and unintentionally bathetic. Of
course, there are some successful translations, notably in Moliere and
versions of Corneille by Ranjit Bolt. Bolt provides the translation for this
Cid, much of it good, no-nonsense rhyming pentameters, getting over the
nitty-gritty of the love-versus-duty plot. Some rhymes have a period
flexibility ('pursuit/driven to't'), some are more strained ('by it/right').
Some have the fatal ring of a McGonagal: 'Two kings were captured on a
single day/Nothing could stand in the young hero's way.' But surely not on
the banks of the silvery Tay.
More interestingly, and perhaps disturbingly, Bolt has compromised with the
English sense of the ridiculous. Where the French grand siecle postures,
preens and poses, English theatre cultivates the pragmatic. Le Cid portrays
the anguished application of a code of honour unstoppably unleashed when the
father of our hero is mortally insulted by the father of the hero's
betrothed. A blood feud results. Rodrigo (the Cid) kills his future
father-in-law which miffs his fiancee Ximena no end. She in turn demands
vengeance though she still adores him. English couplets certainly deflate
the pomposity but reduce the nobly eloquent protagonists to the level of
garrulous mafiosi caught up in a mindlessly murderous tit-for-tat to be
terminated when nanny bangs their heads together.
Bolt seeks to suspend our disbelief, perhaps simply to keep our interest, by
introducing a sardonic element of - could it be? - mockery in the figure of
the Castilian king, whom Bernard Lloyd plays disastrously well. Urbane,
witty, dry, fatally gifted with common sense, he gently ends the giddy
vortex of honour-bound vengefulness that the ranting Ximena and the
sorrowful Cid are caught up in, even using the word 'pointless' of the
characters' guiding principles. The trouble is that once you think about it
in these terms it undermines the whole previous 100 minutes . . .
Kent's production, on the other hand, initially takes the piece seriously,
inspiring some stately tableaux in Mark Henderson's dramatically dimming
lighting and good romantic playing from the cast. In the title-role Duncan
Bell looks every inch and sounds every diphthong the young gallant torn
between love and a code of behaviour that makes political correctness look
like Liberty Hall. Susan Lynch is a promising if coarse-grained Ximena:
strong, rather tough, featured, she tends to yell at moments of stress.
Crudeness of attack, far from adding to the very real intensity she
generates, merely leaves one wishing for tighter control and discipline.
Translation and possibly production seem to resign themselves to audience
laughter at Ximena's bull-in-a-china-shop love-and-death emotionalism. The
nice indication of her hysteria, when she refers to the sword of the Cid's
opponent as 'still bloody' gets overlooked in the general conviction that
she is almost off her rocker. It may be one way to express Corneille's
dramatic vibrancy to a sceptical British audience, but I wonder whether it
is the right one.
Costumed as for Spain's Golden Age (Philip II going on Cervantes), the
company do their best with actresses as distinguished as Faith Brook and
June Watson looking concerned as confidantes. As the squabbling fathers who
trigger the tragedy, Edward de Souza and Alan MacNaughtan are snarling,
toothless old curs, not too stiff in the joints that they cannot destroy
their children's happiness for their own pride, capable of the bland vanity
of such lines as 'Prove yourself to be/A worthy son to such a man as me'.
The real heroine emerges from the shadows of a sub-plot, that phenomenon
detested by French classicism. Samantha Bond brings tragic dignity to the
figure of the Infanta, the king's daughter who loves Rodrigo but, knowing
marriage to be impossible for reasons of rank, does all she can to throw him
together with Ximena. She is left at the play's guardedly happy ending
rocking silently in pain, an indication of how the piece might still move if
all parties shared the same attitude towards it. If you see Cid, tell him.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Oddities in demand - In a difficult year for the
salerooms - as stock markets plummeted just before important auctions took
place - Antony Thorncroft senses some optimism in the air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So it is steady as she goes. This week the leading auction houses totted up
their takings for the season and cheered themselves up - just. Sales at
Sotheby's were 19 per cent higher at Pounds 919m, while Christie's managed a
14 per cent lift to Pounds 781m. In dollar terms the results were not quite
so impressive (rises of 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively), and these
days the big salerooms think in dollars. But they are entitled to put the
best gloss possible on what has been a mildly encouraging year.
As Sotheby's president DeDe Brooks says 'The best we could hope for was a
good strong climb back. If we could grow by this rate every year we would be
ecstatic. We've had some wonderful goods last season but prices have not
moved much'.
Sales might still be less than half the level achieved in the annus
mirabilis of 1989-90 (when will Sotheby's match the Dollars 3.2b it recorded
then?) but at least the worst is definitely over. A year ago the auction
houses expected trade to pick up faster than it has, but they were basically
very unlucky over the timing of their biggest auctions of the season, the
important Impressionist and Modern picture sales in New York and London in
May and June.
The autumn sales in the sector had been encouraging, with Sotheby's
recording what turned out to be the highest price paid during the season of
Dollars 13.75m (Pounds 9.34m) for one of Matisse's experimental cut outs.
Their success lured on to the market some good - as well as some flashy and
well hawked - pictures, which Sotheby's and Christie's fought over with all
the cut-throat intensity that characterised the hyped up market of the late
1980s. To secure works by Monet, Gauguin, Sisley and Cezanne Christie's in
New York gave the heirs of the late Neil McConnell a non-refundable advance
in the region of Dollars 11m.
Unfortunately the stock markets in New York and London went into free fall
just before both sets of auctions. The super rich caught fright and decided
they could live without art. Christie's received the coldest blast and its
sales were very disappointing. It failed to recoup its gamble on the
McConnell pictures and presumably still has an unsold Cezanne in its strong
room.
Sotheby's managed to get away its two major works in London, paintings by
Manet and Monet, for Pounds 4.4m and Pounds 4.8m, and could claim a success.
But this is still a weak market. In the late 1980s the auction houses raced
ahead by selling Impressionist and modern art at ever rising prices (to a
peak of Dollars 82.5m for a Van Gogh), usually to the Japanese. This sector
accounted for over half their turnover. It now contributes nearer a quarter,
and there are some doubts as to whether Impressionist paintings will return
to the levels of 1989-90 for a decade.
Fortunately there will always be people who buy art because they love it,
and they have become more active again in the past year. The prices that
sellers were prepared to accept (or that were forced on them by auction
houses desperate to boost sales) came into balance with the selective purses
of potential buyers.
The feature of the season was the brisk trade in low and medium priced
antiques. After all, the economy is improving; there is a great deal of
money around in the City and elsewhere; and there is little attraction in
storing it away at low interest rates. Lloyds is still not a major factor in
bringing goods on to the market, although Phillips was helped by a spate of
house sales when families sold up to meet tax demands. Such auctions
invariably exceed their estimates and they helped raise Phillips turnover by
12.5 per cent in 1993-94 to Pounds 88m.
But the real star among the medium-sized auction houses was Christie's South
Kensington which added 28 per cent to its turnover, weighing in with an
impressive Pounds 50m. There were its usual idiosyncratic records - Pounds
39,600 for a camera (although it was gold plated); Pounds 203,500 for a car
number plate, K1 NGS; and Pounds 22,100 for a Walt Disney poster.
Competition is becoming intense in this sector. This week Bonhams, which had
another excellent year with a 21 per cent jump in sales to almost Pounds
34m, raised its charge to buyers from 10 to 15 per cent of the hammer price,
the same level as Sotheby's and Christie's. It has been forced to do so
because its rivals are involved in a price war when pitching to sellers,
cutting their charges from the traditional 10 per cent premium in their
keenness to secure goods for sale. Bonhams was losing out and reckons it
must be more flexible in its terms for sellers if it is to continue to grow.
Along with the malaise in post-1870 art (and to a lesser extent among Old
Masters which have become a tricky market, despite the remarkable Pounds
4.2m paid at Sotheby's for a landscape by the Dutch 17th century artist
Aelbert Cuyp), and the improving demand below the Pounds 10,000 a lot level,
there were three other noteworthy features to the season - the strong demand
for furniture; the premium carried by anything odd and exceptional; and the
growing importance of South East Asia to the future of the art market.
Unlike pictures, furniture is essential to life, so why not buy antique
examples which can be cheaper than contemporary and have a tradition of
holding, or increasing, in value? This message has got home, not least among
recipients of City bonuses. Christie's furniture sales were up 44 per cent
last season, with record prices set for pieces designed by Chippendale and
Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
If recent buyers of post-1870 art are licking their wounds there always
seems to be bidders for unusual masterpieces. The most surprising price of
the season was the Pounds 7.7m paid at Christie's for part of an Assyrian
relief of the 7th century BC which had lain ignored for decades at Canford
School. Equally bizarre was the Pounds 441,500 paid for a 12th century
carved 'unicorn' horn. Less surprising perhaps was the record Pounds 2.4m
which secured a bronze lion from Moorish Spain, a record for any Islamic
work of art. Sotheby's secured a record of Pounds 188,500 for a 20th century
doll and Pounds 276,000 for a Purcell manuscript.
Christie's, and to a lesser extent, Sotheby's, are looking towards South
East Asia to provide the next major boost in the increasingly international
art market. Its chief executive Christopher Davidge reckons that already up
to 15 per cent of its turnover comes from collectors there, and he
anticipates holding auctions in China within five years. With its dynamic
economy and the world's longest tradition of appreciating works of art,
China could become the driving force of the market by the first decade of
the next millennium.
At the moment the mainland Chinese are interested primarily in stamps,
jewellery , watches, jade, and Chinese paintings. If they follow the pattern
of the Chinese of Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, oriental ceramics and
bronzes should be next on their collecting list. A taste for Impressionist
art, to say nothing of Old Masters, may take a generation to develop, but in
the meantime the auction houses will be doing everything in their power to
speed up the process.

DREAMERS by Elaine Feinstein Macmillan Pounds 15.99, 339 pages
CONSEQUENCES by Helen Muir Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 15.99, 231 pages
Elaine Feinstein's last novel, Loving Brecht, was a delicate, low-key
evocation of a city, Berlin, in a period of turmoil. It approached its
subject glancingly, telling the story of the playwright Bertolt Brecht
through the eyes of a nightclub singer who had a long affair with him.
Feinstein's new novel, Dreamers, is also about a city, this time
19th-century Vienna. It is more obviously historical, opening like an old
Hollywood movie with the announcement of a date - 1848, year of revolutions
 -which tells us what kind of narrative to expect.
This is followed by a piece of celluloid scene-setting, a portentous
authorial announcement which cries out for accompanying martial music: 'It
was a February morning in Vienna. The wind was blowing savagely from the
east and a little snow was settling on the domes of green and bronze in the
First District'. From this panoramic view, Feinstein sweeps down to focus
first on the houses, cake shops and coffee houses of the rich, then on the
servants who are hard at work ministering to them.
These cinematic techniques are used throughout the book, cutting abruptly
from the grandest of town houses to the garrets of the poor, from noisy
crowd scenes to a child's deathbed. Most of Feinstein's characters are
Jewish and her ambitious aim is to plot their struggle to survive and
prosper as Metternich is overthrown and a new, more liberal order seems to
be in the making in Austria.
Unfortunately, Dreamers has more than technique in common with the Hollywood
costume dramas of the 1930s and '40s. People rush in and out making terse
announcements: 'Revolution in Paris. Barricades have gone up in the streets.
Royal troops have fired on the crowd.'
The chief characters are a lovely but mysterious orphan, Clara, who cannot
remember her origins; a child prodigy, Joseph, whose talent in playing the
violin elevates him to international stardom; and Anton, the literary,
left-leaning son of a fabulously wealthy banker. The novel spans 16 years of
their lives without ever really bringing them alive as they move on and off
Feinstein's richly-decorated sets like pretty, lovingly-crafted puppets.
Helen Muir's novel is constructed not like a Hollywood costume drama but a
TV soap opera. Its characters are as unlikely as those in Dreamers; and its
title, Consequences, suggests that they are all taking part in an elaborate
comedy of manners.
Muir is best at dialogue, especially the jerky speech of a woman who has
summoned up the courage to call a man who might not be interested in her:
'Hello. I wondered how you were. You . . . you said you were going to ring
me but you haven't. You sound a bit muffled at your end. Can you hear me?
Have you got somebody there?'
Most of the characters meet at a ghastly singles club off the Cromwell Road,
the men looking for sex and the women seeking something more romantic. Yet
the novel cannot decide whether its keynote is farce or pathos, cruelly
guying a character on one page and a moment later soliciting sympathy on his
or her behalf.
Much of the plot stems from an incident at the club in which Leonard, a
narcoleptic cartoon animator, tramples on his dancing partner, an
overdressed blonde in grey lame who turns out to be a captain in the Life
Guards. These are easy targets and it is a pity that Muir has settled for
belly laughs rather than something which might really engage readers'
hearts.

EMINENT CHURCHILLIANS by Andrew Roberts Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 354
pages
Three years ago Andrew Roberts made his mark as a historian with his
admirable biography of Lord Halifax, the man who very nearly became
Britain's wartime prime minister instead of Winston Churchill. He is
currently writing a much-needed new biography of Lord Salisbury. Meanwhile,
he has produced a pot-stirrer which should help keep his name in lights.
Eminent Churchillians is modelled on Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians,
first published in 1918, and Roberts fully acknowledges the debt. Strachey
introduced a new form of biographical writing: subjective, selective and
short, and by no means wholly dependent on narrative. In his own words, he
sought 'a brevity which excludes everything that is redundant and nothing
that is significant'. He could praise as well as blame.
Roberts has many of the same qualities: incisive use of quotations, telling
anecdotes and acquaintance with out of the way sources, especially diaries.
Yet there is one huge difference. There was recognisably a Victorian era;
there was no such thing as a recognisably Churchillian era.
Churchill was a man who, had it not been for the second world war, would
have gone down as a political failure. Even then, he was defeated in the
general election of 1945. When he came back in 1951, it was fairly well
known that - to put it mildly - he was too old for the job. To call all that
the Churchillian era is stretching historical licence. Much of the period
might as well have been called the coalition era or even the Attlee era,
which then led quite naturally to Butskellism: 'wartime' and 'postwar' are
the simplest terms of all. The insistence that there was something
distinctly Churchillian mars the book.
There is another fault. Roberts poses as a radical revisionist and, had he
written 20 years ago, perhaps he would have been. In fact, he specialises in
soft targets: King George VI, Lord Mountbatten, Sir Walter Monckton and Sir
Arthur Bryant. I have not come across anyone for at least 15 years who
regards any member of that quartet with uncritical admiration.
Roberts treats the king relatively gently, more sniping than shooting. He
accuses him of naivete and writing a 'fourth-form geography essay' after a
meeting with Roosevelt. Yet if we have a hereditary monarchy, it is
unreasonable to expect that they will all take firsts at Cambridge. The
royal family's move to keep most of the dethroned sovereigns of Europe out
of Britain - criticised by Roberts - seems rather astute.
Despite the fact that he was at least as much an Attlee man as a
Churchillian, Mountbatten receives 80 pages. His vanity and care for his own
reputation are undisputed. Yet, as Roberts writes, ultimately that
reputation must stand on his record as the last Viceroy of India. Roberts
condemns him for his acceleration of independence and partition.
Others will reach their own judgments. Despite the violence, it still seems
one of the wisest decisions by the postwar British government (ie not by
Mountbatten alone). One might look (as Roberts does not) at how other
European countries tried to defend their overseas possessions after the time
to leave: in France there was near civil war. Roberts appears to think that
if Britain had stayed in India longer, and used air power to quell local
difficulties, it might have been possible to impose democracy on the British
parts of Africa.
Still, all that is hypothetical. The Roberts case against Walter Monckton is
that he was too much of a charmer. As minister of labour, he always sought
to resolve industrial disputes by splitting the difference between the
employers' offer and the unions' demands. That is true, but was very much
the climate of the time. Monckton's successor was Iain Macleod; he regarded
Monckton as a hero. No-one then thought of trade union reforms a la
Thatcher, just as (unmentioned by Roberts) no-one thought of Britain joining
the original Common Market.
Arthur Bryant, as a fellow historian, is easy meat. Roberts tells the story
of how close Bryant was to fascism right up to the war. There was a serious
move to have him interned, but another historian, the now Lord Dacre,
advised the authorities not to worry because Bryant would 'change with the
times', which he duly did.
The Dacre story is one of the best in the book. There is some other
political tittle-tattle of the kind that will be enjoyed by those who like
the diaries of Chips Channon and Alan Clark. But there is also a nasty
streak. Historians should not seek to get away with statements like 'Murphy
was an active homosexual and extreme left-winger' without some elucidation,
and the claim that Rab Butler's move to the Board of Education was the
'wartime political equivalent of Port Stanley' reminds one of Lord Tebbit's
recent remark that being president of the European Commission is like being
chairman of Basingtoke Council. Indeed there is a touch of Tebbit - 'the
semi house-trained polecat' as Michael Foot called him - throughout Eminent
Churchillians. On to Salisbury before it becomes catching.

GALILEO: A LIFE by James Reston Jnr Cassell Pounds 18.99, 319 pages
We read for many reasons, most of them not very lofty. Among the more
significant are these two: that we need to understand ourselves, and to know
our world. With the exception of Barbara Cartland-style pulp, most books do
something for us in one or other direction. Great literature is great
because it does much in both.
But great literature does not come off the presses every day. We could
survive on a diet of mere competence - novels a shade thin; poetry a touch
too strained - but our usual resource is to return to the classics, which
have that status because they satisfy us richly.
There is however another resource, and it constitutes the most rapidly
growing literary genre of the 20th century: biography. Biography fully meets
the two needs noted, satisfying them through our curiosity about the lives,
times and circumstances of our fellows. It is an essential human trait to
gossip, to eavesdrop, spy and pry; and it is essential because without it
none of us could be fully human or social. The only way we have of
interpreting ourselves and others, and therefore of finding our way through
the vast fabric of relationships that constitutes the social world, is to be
primed with insight into human nature and its variety. Gossip is vital;
literature, biography and history are gossip writ large; we therefore cannot
live without them.
Anyone's life is interesting, even that of a village Hampden in a
sequestered vale. But to read about great lives, lives which change the
world, is to get not just biography but history. Galileo Galilei's life is
historic in just this way. If any one man acted as doorman to the modern
world, he has an excellent claim to the title. In this readable,
characteristic example of the American style in popular biography, James
Reston takes us through Galileo's tale, hooking it firmly to events in the
contemporary world: the flight of the spacecraft Galileo to Jupiter, still
taking place as this is written, and the decision of the Vatican in 1992 to
acknowledge its fault in ill-treating Galileo three and a half centuries
ago, by dragging him before the Inquisition, humiliating and imprisoning
him.
Indeed Galileo's story is a microcosm of the epic struggle between science
and religion. Galileo was inquisitive, inventive, mathematically adept. He
was fascinated by the view above him in the clear Italian night sky. He
perfected the telescope, and terrified the church by revealing more stars
than had been guessed before, hitherto unseen satellites orbiting other
planets, valleys and mountains on the surface of our moon.
Because scripture taught that the earth sits immovably in the centre of the
universe, whose celestial spheres are driven round by angels, the church
could not tolerate this new vertiginous cosmology. It threatened their
authority. By threats and intimidation, Pope Urban VIII forced Galileo to
recant his espousal of the Copernican system. That the church should only
come to its own recantation in 1992 speaks volumes about the conflict of
faith and reason.
Galileo was the son of a court musician who made some of the earliest
experiments in opera. Galilei pere had his son educated at the famous abbey
of Vallombrosa, and then rescued him from a desire to remain there as a
monk. As ever with fathers, he wished Galileo to follow a profession, and
enrolled him at Pisa University to study medicine. But Galileo's heart lay
in mathematics. By persistence and chutzpah he secured a lectureship first
at Pisa and then at the more prestigious Padua University, and launched
himself on his razor-edge dance of danger with the Inquisition.
Galileo not only made discoveries of the first importance in astronomy and
physics - especially in the laws of motion, thus breaking the stranglehold
of Aristotelian ideas - but he was also an inventive genius. He devised
pendulums for clocks, ways of improving telescopes, instruments for
measuring pulse-rate and temperature. His telescopic discoveries made him an
international star; despite disgrace by the Inquisition he had
correspondents and visitors from all over Europe, including among the latter
Thomas Hobbes and John Milton - who set the fallen Lucifer's realm in a
Tuscan landscape. All this is told in easy style by Reston, who is a
novelist as well as a biographer, and uses those techniques to recreate mood
and circumstance. Most of the many books about Galileo are not quite so
pool-side as this, being more scholarly and philosophical; which is a reason
for welcoming Reston's offering, as a pleasant introduction to an important
life.

THE TORY VIEW OF LANDSCAPE by Nigel Everett Yale University Press Pounds 35,
248 pages
I am a real Tory. I was brought up on Henty, John Buchan and Jane's Fighting
Ships. I believe, not assertively but in a relaxed and natural way that my
country is the best, the most congenial place to live, the land whose
preservation is worth any sacrifice.
This attitude, and the sense of decorum that goes with it, was devastated by
the Great War. It survived into the 1930s (when at the age of six I read my
first 'book' - in popular parlance the term now denotes a soft-bound comic -
King Solomon's Mines) only in reflex, and was all but demolished by the
great Labour landslide of 1945.
The Conservative Party did not just 'adapt'; it changed practically
everything except its name. Through Macmillan's soft-optioneering, Heath's
balance-sheet corporatism to Thatcher's 'market' brutality.
So what are we? We can always buy an 'image', I suppose, from a good PR
firm. And keep them on a retainer to tune and burnish it. But with loss of
identity comes loss of confidence, then loss of nerve (and if you do not
believe this just watch what happens to the Labour Party over the next
couple of years).
Yet now a wonderful book has appeared, which illuminates our Party from an
unusual angle. There is barely one word of politics in the text - but the
combination of history, aesthetics and scholarship provide a deep well from
which real Tories can draw inspiration.
The essential theme is a recurrent one. With England seen as a noble estate,
and the landed interest in general as its ancient defenders, the image of a
country house amid old plantations and well managed farms easily comes to
convey a wide range of sentimental and political meaning. It seems to
represent the real England, besieged by ugly, alien and inhuman forces of
change. The traditional country house can be portrayed as an ancient centre
of order, cultivation and disinterestedness.
Nigel Everett illustrates this thesis by drawing on the writings - fiction
as well as records and surveys - of successive periods as well as the art,
the paintings, the architecture and the gardens. He never proselytises.
Indeed, it is not always certain which 'side' he is on. All the better. The
reader has to think, make his own judgments, which in the very nature of
things, alter as the evidence accumulates.
There is a permanent tension, between the ancient traditions and their
benign stability, and the ever present threat of degradation. Human greed,
'short-termism', the strong exploiting the weak beyond endurance, are
pollutants every bit as damaging as an overdose of nitrates.
Take this verity: 'Old England - slow, dignified, shaded, and beautiful with
the public wandering freely through a variety of landscapes - has given way
to the modern world of assertive privacy, ugliness and tension'.
How true this is of practically anywhere in the south-east today. 'Modern
World'? You mean nose-to-tail traffic, Wimpy bars, police sirens,
ghetto-blasters, farm shops selling 'early' potatoes flown in from Cyprus?
Well, no. This passage is a commentary on Humphrey Repton's illustrated
notebook, published in 1792, when we were congratulating ourselves that the
social harmony of our own kingdom was preserving us from the horrors of the
jacquerie.
And there are other precursors. Here is Adam Smith (but I doubt if the
wording is either familiar or congenial to the existing membership of that
'institute' which bears his name): 'A profitable speculation is presented as
a public good because growth will stimulate demand, and everywhere diffuse
comfort and improvement. No patriot or man of feeling could therefore oppose
it (But) the nature of this growth, in opposition, for example to older
ideas such as cultivation, is that it is at once undirected and infinitely
self-generating in the endless demand for all the useless things in the
world . . .'
As early as 1830 Cobbett was remarking that the (peasant) labourer was ' . .
. more comfortable where there are woods, forests and wild places, hedges
commons and grassy lanes. His situation is at its worst where there are
areas of high fertility devoted almost entirely to corn'.
There are dark passages, it is true, in the history of Conservative
magistracy. And none more terrible than the Highland clearances whose
evidence in Sutherland, even to this day, can be seen in the pleasing
homesteads, idyllically situated at the water's edge, burned by fire often
started when the crofters' families were still inside, by the Dukes'
militia.
But in the main our country was uniquely favoured in the temperate nature of
its climate, its constitution, its manners, and its agriculturally based
wealth. Comfort coincided with virtue, beauty, liberty, and easy social
relations.
Tories (real Tories) can still draw encouragement from this. It remains a
basic truth, deeply implanted in the subconscious of very many of our
people. But if we are to draw full advantage therefrom we do need at times
great patience - mirroring that of Nature herself.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Dispatches: A journey to the heart of Zionism - Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is a brief but significant route. It
is more than a road. It is a road heavily annotated, a road turned
scripture.
First you pass a Trappist monastery; then a British garrison fort, still
trim and intact; then, less pristine, a Crusader castle; and then, amid
eucalyptus trees planted on steep hillsides by Jewish settlers in the last
century, you see more recent wreckage: burnt-out tanks, rusted vehicles and
the skewed limbs of derelict artillery. These are not eyesores but studied
relics of Israeli and Arab claims to Jerusalem. You are headed for a dearly
disputed place.
The harbingers of Jerusalem seem half-designed to heighten your first visit.
And if you arrive with no more than a childhood, chapel-bred vision of it,
Jerusalem, at a distance, is entirely gratifying.
It is golden. Ronald Storrs, when appointed British military governor of the
city in 1917, must have had those hymns of heavenly Jerusalem echoing in his
mind when, like Bernard of Cluny, he indicated that he wanted a radiant
focus for contemplation.
He ordered that all planning permission oblige the use of local stone. And
it is a law that still prevails: there are new buildings rising wherever one
looks in Jerusalem. Even the most brutal high-rise hotel is clad with the
local pink-to-amber stone. The city glows.
I walked into old Jerusalem, as the pilgrims traditionally do, by the Jaffa
gate. Inside an hour I realised that the hymns in my life had not properly
prepared me. The topography of green hills and city walls is, not
surprisingly, all wrong.
But no Christian with a priming of aesthetic sensibility can fail to cringe
at the Gospel theme-park created here. It is largely 19th century work, now
invested with the fripperies of late 20th century tourism.
Having run the gauntlet of hawkers to reach the Holy Sepulchre, there is no
sanctuary; Calvary is a palace of gaudy altars, tombs, cisterns and
grottoes, in the precincts of which six separate Christian factions
sedulously compete for the pilgrim's custom. I suffered as two rival guides
bartered their prices for the Via Dolorosa, before making my own sad way to
Gethsemane.
Some dignity and loveliness are retained by the Mount of Olives. Yet the
verdict must be that Christian Jerusalem is not so much golden as brassy.
One progresses, at least architecturally, to the Dome of the Rock. The
Christian guidebooks admit that the Dome is an outstanding example of
Islamic design, and together with the nearby al-Aqsa Mosque offers a
marvellous panorama, up on the parapet of what used to be Herod's great
temple.
But the ambling, camcording hordes of the Gospel theme-park tend not to make
it up here. It is the third holiest site of Islam. Perhaps the most sensible
reaction of the non-Moslem is not to moralise on the impossibility of peace
here, but to do as Winston Churchill did in 1922. Having briskly set up the
principality of Transjordan, he went to the Rock and set up his easel.
With a recent call from Yasser Arafat for a jihad or holy war on Jerusalem
causing much chatter in Israel - in Israel, everyone is a member of the
chattering class - I was not alarmed to be thoroughly frisked before
approaching the Wailing Wall, which completes the religious Disneyland that
is the old city of Jerusalem.
Under the colossal blocks of the western side of Herod's temple, which the
Romans ruined 2,000 years ago, Jews - mostly black-clad and Orthodox:
black-clad because they are still mourning the temple's loss - muttered and
prayed.
Mount Zion itself is only a few minutes away. But I now understood why
Zionism, the movement which launched the concept of Israel about a century
ago, is essentially secular. Theodor Herzl, who convened the first Zionist
congress at Basle in 1897, toyed with both Argentina and Uganda as potential
homes for the Jews.
Jerusalem is a significant city only for fundamentalist Christians,
fundamentalist Moslems and fundamentalist Jews. Zionists prefer it to be
theirs, as they prefer Palestine to Argentina. But to become a convert to
Zionism, you must move on from Jerusalem.
Looking at a map, the state of Israel is really just as Balfour described
it: 'a small notch' surrounded by vast tracts of Arabia. When one discovers
how much of that small notch is desert, the geopolitical complaint that
animates so many Zionists - why do the Arabs begrudge us this tiny
territory, when they have so much? - is difficult to discard.
I travelled down to the northerly part of the Negev desert. Invited to
lecture at the newish Ben Gurion University at Beersheba, my only briefing
was not to bother with a jacket or tie for the occasion.
True, it was powerfully hot, even within this oasis. But the advice to leave
jacket and tie at home was not given solely out of solicitude for my
comfort. It was also a deferral to the shirt-sleeves, no-nonsense persona of
Ben Gurion - Labour leader of Israel, with one interruption, from 1948 to
1963 - and the pioneer ambience of this town.
I took it to be a model of Zionist aims. New inhabitants arrive on an almost
weekly basis. New houses, new roads, new schools are accordingly
constructed. The university specialises in research on water extraction. At
Beersheba, the desert is in retreat.
I slept on the sofa of an Auschwitz survivor: an impressively hedonistic
Transylvanian woman, whose compensation pension from the German government
helps keep her drinks cabinet stocked. She swept aside my suggestion that
life in this desert outpost might be dull.
'Nonsense,' she boomed. 'We have more concerts here than we can go to.
Didn't you know that every plane-load of Russian Jews brings us a new
orchestra?'
It is a familiar joke in Israel, that Russian Jewry - pouring into the
country at such a rate that supermarket milk cartons carry Cyrillic
instructions - are all professors and piano-tuners. And there was a genuine
sense of mystery, among the people I talked to, about the economics of this
sustained influx. There is no evident onset of unemployment, in spite of the
continued use of cheap Arab labour for most manual work.
Hebrew is taught by a patently successful intensive technique (in spite of
the milk cartons): voluble and abrasive as Israelis famously are, their
discordance is minimal. And they know it.
As befitted a visitor to Ben Gurion University, I was taken to a nearby
kibbutz. I had already learned to recognise a kibbutznik when I saw one: any
young person who looks as though he or she has drunk vinegar for breakfast.
The system breeds seriousness.
Many of those raised by kibbutz collectivism go on to hold high office in
Israel. The reason why many Israeli cabinet ministers carry the air of those
who know how to plough a field is that many Israeli cabinet ministers have
indeed ploughed fields in their time.
Since 1967 and the occupation of the West Bank, this kibbutz can no longer
be described as a border settlement; but the laager mentality of its workers
persists insofar as each takes a turn at guard duty, and immediately
adjacent to the school is a large concrete bunker.
My shirt-sleeved host and I inspected dozens of bright little kibbutz-reared
piglets, which brought more confirmation of the secular basis to Zionism.
'How could anyone regard these creatures as unclean?' we agreed. And, at a
communal supper, as we talked about the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the
fall-off in Russian arms supplies to Syria and the consequently predicted
evacuation of the Golan Heights, I gathered a further truth about Zionism.
Namely, that Zionism is not strictly a nationalistic movement. Patriotic,
yes; but not nationalistic. Zionists have sought a space for Jews in which
Jews can be Jewish without looking over their shoulders, a community in
which Jews are, at last, not a minority. To yield up the Golan Heights is
not a matter of national pride, but strategy. If it is safe to do so, it can
be done. What is important is that Israel - the notch - survives.
Clues to its survival can be gleaned at Masada, a natural fortress
monumentalised by one of the world's great megalomaniacs, occupied by
fanatics and besieged by history's most dedicated imperialists.
Few archaeological sites match Masada for dramatic scenery and storyline.
Looking down from the Herodian fastness from which Jewish zealots resisted
Roman rule, one is morbidly entranced by the relics of a terrible narrative.
Ringed by copybook Roman encampments - all visible from above - and
bombarded by siege engines, the zealots could do no more than watch the
Romans build an enormous earthen ramp up to their walls. On the eve of the
breach, they committed mass suicide.
Why the Romans expended such effort to trap less than 1,000 militants is a
question that still perplexes ancient historians. But modern Israelis see
the paradigm clearly enough: recruits to the Armour Corps are sworn in at
this site. The oath is hinged with implicit vengeance. 'Masada must never
happen again.'
Most Zionists would admit that the zealots of Masada were, like their
ultra-Orthodox counterparts today, the sort of Jews who would despise any
secular state. But that does not prevent Masada from serving both as an
emblem and as a cautionary metaphor for modern Israel.
Most Israelis know the site well, and they are easy to distinguish from
other visitors: as some people carry mobile phones, so Israelis carry
machine-guns. The very excavation of the site, 30 years ago, was an
operation that owed more to military logistics than archaeological
expertise. And one does not have to travel very far from Masada to join the
ambience of virtual combat: checkpoints and barbed wire replace mudpack
therapies as the litoral road along the Dead Sea gets closer to Palestinian
Jericho.
Other memorials in Israel may speed an impartial visitor more swiftly into
sympathy with the Zionist cause but Masada put the seal on my conversion.
Its strength as an epitome does not lie with the historical identity of
those who occupied it: fundamentalists, whether Jewish or Moslem, may yet
wreck the state of Israel. Nor can it be said to provide a precedent for a
Jewish state in this part of the world: 2,000 years ago, 'Judaea' was never
a nation in the modern sense, and neither, come to that, was Palestine.
What Masada stands for is the endurance of a culture. It is, in
archaeological form, a centre of gravity for whatever it is that defines
Judaism, whatever that is - an essence, a cement that unites people to fight
for themselves. Those without such bonds will come away from old Masada, and
new Israel, with some relief, but more envy.

FT  30 JUL 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Welcome snow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are currently in South America.
Heini Kempel was pleased to see the snow-laden clouds. The snow, he said,
was desperately needed. The contrast between the rain-sodden Gran Catedral
of the last few days and the same resort under snow was stark.
Before the snow, the ski schools - five major ones and innumerable splinter
groups - at South America's biggest and oldest ski area, near San Carlos de
Bariloche, had been in disarray trying to cope with thousands of students on
coach tours from Buenos Aires.
The tira bolas, or snowball throwers, flock to Argentina's ski areas in the
school holidays, and ride to the mountain-top to admire the view. 'Normally
we persuade quite a few to try skiing while they're here, and many return
the following year on a proper skiing holiday,' says Kempel, director of the
Escuela Esqui Catedral, the main ski school at Gran Catedral.
But the weather has been a big problem: 'We've been losing so much
business,' he says.
Heini, one of the Argentine demonstration team's crack skiers, is a real
find. He leaps to his feet in restaurants and bars at the slightest query
about technique and delivers an impassioned half-hour impromptu ski lesson.
The Argentines have an impressive ski school programme, and he is not slow
to criticise the Swiss and the French.
This year we have skied with instructors from 11 countries, all with
different ideas about technique.
With 50 runs, 32 lifts and a vertical drop of 3,280ft, Bariloche is an
excellent ski area. The planned new jumbo gondolas, the much bigger cable
car (the present one holds only 25) and two high-speed quad chairs should
substantially improve it.
The resort's first cable car sank to the bottom of the Atlantic after a
cargo ship from Italy was sunk at the start of the second world war. They
had to wait 11 years for a replacement.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Motoring: A hot hatch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why have a family hatchback that looks exactly what it is when you could
have one, still with five doors and four seats, that could be taken for
Pounds 30,000-worth of high performance coupe?
That is the rationale behind Mazda's new 323 which goes on sale in Britain
on August 17, priced from Pounds 11,995 upwards.
The launch of the 323 is another sign of Mazda's determination to become the
chief niche marketeer in the world. It knows it will never be a VW or Ford,
Toyota or Fiat in production volume so it is aiming to fill gaps.
Britain is the first European country to get the new 323. For the time
being, there are just three models - a 1.5-litre four-cylinder in GL and GLX
trim and a 2-litre V6 GLX. Three-door hatchback and four-door saloon
versions will follow later in the year when a 1.8-litre engine will also
become available.
There was a lot of design input into the new 323 from Mazda's research and
development facility in Frankfurt, as there had been earlier with the Xedos
6 and 9 models. The result is that the 323 feels a thoroughly European car
with all the finesse one expects of a Japanese product.
Mazda says its objective for the 323 was to combine sportiness with
refinement, individuality with concern for safety and environmental
protection. Don't they all say that nowadays? Of course they do. But, having
sampled 323 fastbacks with both engines, I can confirm their sporty handling
and mechanical refinement. As for their looks, I reckon nothing touches them
in their class.
I first drove the 1.5-litre GLX (Pounds 12,595). The engine, although
smaller than the old 323's 88 horsepower 1.6-litre, is slightly more
muscular, producing a silky 90 horsepower at 5,500rpm. Torque (pulling power
at a given engine speed) is unchanged. The 1.5 GLX rode comfortably and
demanded little gear changing in urban areas, handled nimbly on country
roads and cruised quietly on the motorway.
Delicate controls, effortless power-assisted steering and minimal
road-induced tyre noise made it a most relaxing car to travel in. The
driving position was comfortable although tall people of mature years may
find both front and back seats on the low side for easy entry and,
especially, egress.
I rated the performance and acceleration more than adequate. Mazda claims a
108mph/ 174kph maximum speed and 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration in 11.9
seconds. Fuel consumption should be up to 36mpg (7.85 l/100km) in normal
use.
The 323 V6 I tried next was a hotter property altogether, with 147
horsepower at 6000rpm and wide 50 series tyres on 16in alloy wheels.
It is much more expensive (Pounds 17,495), which puts it into VW Golf V6
territory. Top speed is a claimed 129mph (207kph), with 0-60mph (0-96kph)
acceleration in 9.4 seconds. Only uncharacteristically light-footed owners
should expect to see more than 31mpg (9.1 l/100km).
Naturally, it felt far more eager than the 1.5-litre 323 but - as usual - I
preferred the smaller engined car, which has taller and more resilient 70
series tyres on 13in wheels.
Squat and sporty tyres increase cornering power and make for nervously
responsive steering but they exact a comfort penalty. Although it was fine
on a smooth motorway, the V6's ride was much more knobbly at low speeds and
there was a lot of tyre roar on coarsely textured surfaces.
All 323s have power-operated front windows, mirrors and radio aerial, a
pollen filter and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Driver's and front passenger's
airbags are standard on the 1.5i GLX and 2.0i V6 but not on the 1.5i GL. A
five-speed manual gearbox is standard on all 323s.
Mazda says the boot has class-leading volume but it looked too narrow to
pass my 'two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys' test and has an
exceptionally deep rear sill. Neither of which, I suspect, will do anything
to harm sales of this most glamorous looking hatchback.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Sailing: Old money in Newport - The New York Yacht Club is
150
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newport 100 years ago was New York-by-the-sea. When hot, humid summer came,
the affluent closed up the brownstone houses on Fifth or Madison and came to
Rhode Island.
Nothing much has changed, least of all the family names. This week the New
York Yacht Club has been celebrating its 150th birthday (being the NYYC, of
course, it has to be the tongue-knotting Sesquicentennial Regatta). When the
result lists go up, a du Pont can be found next to a Doubleday.
As the yachts headed out into Naragansett Sound all the chatter and pointing
was towards the yellow-painted house on the headland. As a dynastic town
Newport loves nothing better than a will, and Jackie Kennedy's had just been
published. Hammersmith Farm, the seaside retreat where the young Jacqueline
Bouvier spent her childhood riding ponies and sailing, came to symbolise the
Kennedy presence in Newport.
After her marriage to John F Kennedy at St Mary's Church, the wedding party
was held at this glorious pale yellow mansion overlooking the Atlantic. Once
JFK became president, the house became the summer White House for the first
family.
Of course, it is no more a farm than Blenheim is a country rectory. That is
another quaint Newport custom. The Italianate palaces out on Ocean Drive,
built at the turn of the century for families such as Vanderbilt or Astor,
are invariably known as 'cottages'. When probate was granted and 'the farm'
was left to step-brother Hugh Auchinloss, le tout Newport heaved a discreet
collective sigh. The two Kennedy children had been bequeathed the other
waterfont property on Martha's Vineyard 50 miles away. That should keep the
paparazzi out of town for another generation.
As the sporting home of the fabled America's Cup for 100 years or so, one
might have supposed that Newport and the club might have grown used to the
media. After all, Harold Vanderbilt, racing Sir Thomas Lipton for the oldest
trophy in international competition, was hardly low-profile, even in the
1930s.
Then, as now, the NYYC simply adopted a marvellous disdain. Journalists
wanting to cover this week's splendid and historic regatta were told that it
was private, 'by invitation only'. Race results, numerical tables of times
and handicaps with as much flavour as packet soup, would be available from a
subfusc office in a shopping mall.
Perhaps they should not have been so discreet. When the club let its hair
down, the scenes were wondrous to behold. The steep sloping lawns in front
of Harbour Court, the waterfront mansion it calls home, became impromptu
grass slides for younger crew and, after cocktails, their parents.
Many yachting enthusiasts from around the world were sharing the magic of
Newport for the first time. The NYYC had invited sailors from clubs such as
the Royal Yacht Squadron and Royal Thames Yacht Club to come and race with
them.
'We've been almost a year building up to this and I think its bloody
marvellous,' said Mike Slade, a London property man and owner of Longobarda,
one of the world's top maxi yachts.
If that sounds a lot of preparation for a week's sailing, consider that the
80ft Longobarda sails with a crew of 24, a mixture of family, friends and
professional racers. In her wake follows a baggage train of spare sails,
ropes, and even carbon fibre to repair the hull should it prove necessary.
Surely Slade, who heads Helical Bar, fits into the classic definition of
yacht-racing as tearing up Pounds 20 notes under a shower.
Slade bristles, in his amiable way. 'This, believe it or not, is a business.
She's available for major regattas at Dollars 50,000 a week and we'll do
two, maybe three, charters this year,' he said. 'It should cover the running
costs.'
Next week Longobarda sails for Australia and a customer who wants to race
the Sydney-Hobart classic in December.
Bill Koch, the US amateur sailor who won the America's Cup two years ago
after an expenditure of treasure that startled even the battle-hardened, is
in Newport with two yachts and a cast of thousands. Next spring Koch defends
the America's Cup with an all-woman crew, a radical move that has shaken the
NYYC, who cannot quite make up their minds even about lady members.
Thirty-four athletic women, ranging from top dinghy helms to Olympic rowers,
are racing Koch's crack maxi Matador2. He had her brought out of storage in
Antibes especially.
Koch himself, an engagingly diffident, self-deprecating individual and one
of the richest men in America, has brought a classic 12-metre, Kiwi Magic,
over from New Zealand solely for the week. At the two rented crew houses a
marquee has had to be erected to host dinner for the crews, coaches, and
hangers-on.
'We won't spend anything like we did in the last Cup,' said Koch, patting
what he likes to call his Dollars 68m belt buckle. The logoed clip on his
belt is from the 1992 America3 campaign: Dollars 68m was the net cost, after
deducting sponsorship.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Gardening: Just dying for a drink - Robin Lane Fox is trying
to beat the weather in his corner of Oxfordshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rain has been circling around Britain but it refuses to land on my
garden. I am living like the ancient men of Santorini. On their Greek
island, they are said to have endured a drought for seven years because they
did not do what a god had told them. Since June 3, it has rained once in my
Oxfordshire garden and the phloxes are hating it.
The Santorini solution was to uproot part of the male population and send
them away.
The exiles from the drought found a new home in Libya. Later, their new city
was famous for saffron crocus, which they had either taken with them or had
sent on by a subsequent boat.
Should I wrap-up my crocuses and make a bolt for it? Dry weather sorts out
keen gardeners from the rest but, unless it lasts for another six years, it
will not make me uproot. However, it will teach us all some basic truths
about gardening.
The first is about weeds. You may wonder why serious gardeners are so keen
to pull them out or poison them. The answer is not just visual or
psychological. Weeds compete for water and if you let them run around, as
the mindless school of 'green' gardening commands, the results show in a dry
spell. Weeds make drought worse.
The second truth is about roots. Theoretical experts sometimes like to tell
us that there is no point in watering plants during dry weather or in
feeding them through their leaves.
I believe this to be non-gardeners' rubbish. It does not distinguish between
newly-planted and established plants, between deep and shallow roots and
between loose notions of 'plant food' and their need to drink.
Probably, we can make little difference to an established tree which is
beginning to flag in hot weather, even if we water it for half a day. We
can, however, save newly-planted trees, shrubs and border plants and we must
do so, extending our saving act to anything up to three years old.
We must also remember that some plants send fine roots along the surface and
are always the better for a soaking. Others will either push - or be coaxed
into pushing - their roots down to a depth where they can draw on cool
reserves.
Even so, it is quite wrong to tell gardeners that these sorts of plant can
be left alone. In their early years, they also need support from us, whether
hostas or hellebores, and only then will they push down and need no further
assistance. If a recently-planted hosta or day lily is flagging, for
heaven's sake water it at once.
Droughts also deny our plants their 'food'. The basic fact is that plants
cannot eat, although writers and advertisers imply that they can. They are
sustained by liquid intake and uptake.
Experts may argue that attempts to spray fertiliser in a liquid form on to a
plant's leaves are unsatisfactory because so little hits the target and is
taken up. From my constant experience and counter-experiment, I know that
their argument is not one for inaction. Those plants which are excluded from
this treatment are noticeably worse.
Lastly, the matter of leaves and toughness. All around you, you will see
once again the evidence that plants with silver, furry, thickly-coated
leaves are surviving without any particular trouble. They remind you of the
value of matching a plant's natural preference to its predicament in your
garden if you want a trouble-free life.
I notice the relative happiness of my trees with glossy green or grey
leaves, the alders, the ornamental pears and particular forms of Sorbus. I
also notice the exceptional happiness of the blue-flowered, grey-leaved
Teucrium and the flourishing of all forms of Salvia.
If the ancient men of Santorini had grown the curious green and black Salvia
discolor and the lovely half-hardy new Indigo Spires, they would have packed
them off to Libya with the crocus.
If I have to bolt for it, this type of plant is the one which I would take
to a second home and a new start on the Mediterranean fringe.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Property: The Caribbean's allure - A look at the growing
accessibility of a rich man's playground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Caribbean has long been the playground of the rich. But as the cost of
flights has fallen and the islands have become more developed, the
possibility of buying property in the Caribbean has been opened up to larger
numbers.
The allure of the Caribbean, with its white sands, turquoise seas and
carefree atmosphere, is such that even casual visitors are persuaded to buy
holiday homes there.
The range of property on offer is large: from luxurious villas offering
privacy and exclusiveness, to modest apartments in resorts boasting discos
and casinos. Buyers can walk into ready-furnished villas or else they can
start from scratch on a plot of their own.
Potential buyers can choose between bustling islands like Antigua, where it
is possible to party every night, to tiny, exclusive islands which are
peaceful and charming. Recluses can play the part of Robinson Crusoe by
buying their own private islands. In the British Virgin Islands, for
instance, Green Cay and Sandy Spit - a one-acre island rimmed by white sands
and reefs - is being offered for sale by Smiths Gore at Dollars 1.7m.
Property values are now back to 1984 levels having fallen 40 per cent since
the boom in 1987-1989, when values were supported by an influx of money from
high earners abroad. Some of the most expensive properties are not bargains,
however. 'People who are not forced to sell are not prepared to drop the
price,' says Fred Connell, of Smiths Gore, property consultants.
Caribbean islands vary greatly in their terrains, atmosphere and languages,
typically English, French and Dutch. Barbados, which ranks as one of the
most sophisticated, well-established and expensive of the Caribbean islands,
is the most popular for British buyers, followed by the British Virgin
Islands, St Lucia and Antigua.
Most potential buyers of Caribbean property want to visit a number of
islands before making a decision. 'People investigating buying properties in
the Caribbean take their time,' says John German, of Cluttons.
He is marketing property on the island of Providenciales in the Turks and
Caicos Islands, an English-speaking island known for its scuba diving. The
Richmond Hill Estates, for example, has eight four-bedroom, three-bathroom
villas for sale, half a mile from the sea, in a complex with tennis court
and swimming pool for sale for Dollars 265,000 (Pounds 171,000). Beach-front
property is more expensive: the asking price for a three-bedroom beach-front
property is Dollars 950,000. The company is also acting for Isles Bay
Plantation in Montserrat, a British colony, 27 miles south-west of Antigua.
Isles Bay Planation has two remaining houses for sale, although it has
additional sites awaiting development. The villas are Caribbean style,
complete with verandas, shaded loggias, double-height ceilings and natural
timbers.
Prices ranges from Dollars 300,000 for a two-bedroom house to Dollars
695,000 for a five-bedroom house. Management charges are about Dollars 6,000
a year for looking after the houses, pools, gardens and rentals for the
owners. Montserrat has just abolished exchanges controls, which will allow
buyers to raise a mortgage in US dollars at far cheaper rates than Eastern
Caribbean dollars.
Nearby Antigua is more highly developed. The island, which was colonised in
1623 by English settlers, boasts 365 beaches and a developed tourist
industry with plenty of restaurants, car hire, golf and scuba diving
facilities. The building boom, which began in the mid-1980s, together with
the sharp decline in the market, has left an abundance of property, at a
range of prices.
At the market's cheaper end, buyers could consider Jolly Harbour, on the
west coast of Antigua. The project, which was developed by Dr Alfred Erhart,
a Swiss entrepreneur who pioneered mass market tourism in Majorca, is one of
the largest developments in the Caribbean.
The 500-acre scheme, centred around a marina, comprises 500 two-bedroom
terraced houses - each with a private jetty. The villas cost around Dollars
125,000; the management charge is currently Dollars 120 a month. Plots of
land are for sale for hundreds more houses.
Round the coast, the St James's Club village on Mamora Bay consists of 73
two-bedroom villas, set in tropical gardens with three swimming pools.
Prices range from Dollars 350,000 to Dollars 475,000. Service charges are
about Dollars 1,200 a month; insurance is about Dollars 2,000 dollars a
year.
Jumby Bay Island is an island of 300 acres two miles north of Antigua. The
shortage of rain is a boon to holiday makers although it gives the place an
arid appearance.
Jumby Bay prides itself on its quiet exclusiveness, which is reinforced by
the absence of television, radio and telephones from the island. It has 12
villas for sale at prices between Dollars 1.2m and Dollars 1.5m. Its
beach-front villas are clusters of buildings around a terraced patio
sheltered by a large umbrella roof.
The majority of developers offer to organise rentals for purchasers, which
will help them with their running costs. These are often heavy because of
high local taxation and high repair and maintenance bills.
'If you want to let the property, it is best to buy near a golf course,
marina or holiday cottage complex,' says Allan Lazurus, of Prime Property
Services. The best chances of obtaining a letting are in the high season
between November and May.
But the charm of the islands should not seduce potential buyers into
ignoring the possible disadvantages of buying property in the Caribbean.
'Our advice is to buy with no expectation of economic return,' says Connell.
'If you can get a holiday home to keep its value, you have done quite well.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Travel: Charm amid the Algarve frenzy - In spite of British
incursions, Albufeira retains its character
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN COURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We lingered at the shoe stall for a moment too long. 'You, my friend. What
size? What size you?' barked a burly woman as she marched up to us. She
gripped my wife's arm tightly. '3,500 escudos . . . 3,000 . . . 2,500,' the
woman growled, thinking our attempts to walk away were merely a ploy.
'Good shoe. This very good leather', she said through her moustache, and
bent a moccasin back and forth in powerful hands.
Her stand was the nearest to the road at the edge of the gypsy market, sited
in a field just outside Albufeira, on Portugal's Algarve coast. We later saw
the woman and a male accomplice selling loafers to an elderly, gangling
American, whom they hauled in and out of a chair like a puppet while he
tried the shoes on.
In all, there were around 100 stalls at the market, offering shoes, shirts,
pottery, rabbits, leather bags, underwear, salted codfish, dried beans and
three-piece suites. There was plenty of flotsam and jetsam: Portuguese-made
shoes, blouses, rugs from India, and towels decorated with the Manchester
United crest.
Most of the traders had dark curly hair and swarthy skin. It was not
difficult to imagine in them the blood of the Moors who once dominated the
region, and gave the Algarve its name (their term al gharb meaning the
western land).
Behind the gypsies' vans, women washed clothes, and cooked food on primus
stoves. Children ran around. Scrawny dogs, chained to the vans, lay quiet in
the dust.
We found three stalls run by expatriate British. There was a couple selling
T-shirts from a red van, a woman selling miniature paintings, and a man
making jewellery from old coins. In the end we bought some ceramics, a bag
of monkey-nuts, and two T-shirts from the British couple - but no shoes.
Until a few years ago, Albufeira was a fishing village. Now it is a growing
town. Shops, bars, supermarkets, hotels and 'aparthotels' are stacked on top
of each other, scrambling up the hill away from the sea.
In spite of this frenzy of development, the narrow lanes in the town centre
retain their charm. Small terraces of white-walled cottages suddenly open
out to a magnificent view of the Atlantic. The smell of wood-smoke mingles
with the warm sea breeze.
You get to the beach via a tunnel which has been cut through the cliffs.
There were about a dozen fishing-boats beached on the sand. During the day,
the fishermen mended and baited their nets. At night they went out into the
bay, their lights twinkling on the horizon under the bright stars.
One morning we went down to the harbour to watch the boats return. The men
piloted their craft through the surf and into the sand at the sea's edge. A
tractor hauled the boats up the shore.
A few locals, along with a knot of tourists and stray dogs, gathered around
a boat that had come to rest on the beach. Two fishermen, stocky and
stubby-fingered, with hands and faces like dark leather, squatted in the
hull, sorting through their catch. They took sole and sea bream up to the
fish market, leaving the onlookers to take their pick of the rest.
Eels and sardines - still wriggling and twitching - were stuffed into
carrier bags. No-one was interested, though, in the two squid that lay in
the bottom of the boat, puffing flabbily, slowly dying without water. When
the fishermen returned, those who had helped themselves to the catch paid
up. The small crowd then drifted across the sand to another crew that had
just come ashore.
At Albufeira, the distance fish travel from the net to the table is short.
There is a restaurant right above the fish market, and the attractive,
compact quayside is crammed with outdoor tables.
The long, sandy beaches of the Algarve are excellent for a day's walking.
One morning we set off to walk along the coastal footpath from Albufeira
east towards Vilamoura. The air was fresh, and the slight chill was slowly
giving way to spring warmth. Once we had left the main beach at Albufeira
there were very few people around. We walked barefoot through the surf.
From the beach, the sharp outlines of white-washed walls dazzled against the
deep blue sky. Crumbling ochre cliffs rose from the long stretches of sand.
The cliffs were thickly covered with a succulent plant with fleshy,
wedge-like leaves. Its flowers, shaped like sea anemones, slowly opened to
the sun. Trees stuck out from the cliff-tops at bizarre angles; at their
feet were spiky plants with curling blade-shaped leaves, standing sentry.
Everywhere, the sea was eating into the coastline, turning it into a
honeycomb of crumbling caves and overhanging ledges. Along the beach there
were large and newly arrived-looking boulders. Where the beach became
impassable, the path went up over the cliffs.
We came across three men in waders dredging for shellfish. They were slowly
dragging box-shaped nets through the sand. The waves washed away the sand,
leaving the shellfish at the bottom of the net. It looked hot, grinding
work. By the middle of the day, each had harvested less than a bucketful.
The furthest point east on our walk was the village of Olhos d'Agua. Its
seaside stalls were opening for the summer season. There was also a bar, run
by British expatriates, offering pale ale and strawberries with cream.
We sat at a shaded table outside, and ordered sardines with salad. We should
have known better. When the sardines arrived, they had not been grilled in
the local style. They were done in batter, and served with sliced white
bread. The only thing missing was the chips.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Travel: Cote d'Azur of the Arctic - Nicholas Woodsworth
drives through dull Lapland to the dazzling Lofoten Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Home of rivers, lakes and virgin forests, home of the hardy Lapp and vast
herds of reindeer, Lapland, I have to admit, sounds like an interesting
place. Do not believe a word. The attractions of Lapland are for the most
part as imaginary as its most famous resident, Santa Claus, who each year
leaves the Finnish postal service holding 500,000 letters addressed to him.
I had spent two long summer days driving across arctic Scandinavia and was
ready to scream with boredom. There may well have been all sorts of
fascinating things out there. Lapp folk music contests and endless boggy
back-packing trails are highly considered locally. Whatever their qualities,
they were hidden in drizzle behind the thick curtain of trees that, mile
after mile, hour after hour, hemmed in both sides of the highway.
It was not long before I began accepting any little diversion with
gratitude: small villages lost in the forest, their wooden houses sodden in
the rain, their pale-faced womenfolk grimly planting potatoes in muddy
plots; a contingent of the Finnish army, camouflaged in spruce branches and
clouds of mosquitoes, engaged in some sort of field drill; an electronic
pool game in a Swedish small-town take-away, intoning 'Stop talkin' and
start chalkin'' in a Clint Eastwood voice.
So endless, unchanging and empty were the forests of the north that,
listening to Maria Callas and dreaming of the Mediterranean, I missed a turn
and drove 100km to a dead end before I realised my mistake.
Great was my wonder and anticipation when, not far from the Norwegian border
at the end of the second day, I noticed the land beginning to lift and the
forest to thin out. Snaking between hills now, the road rose higher and
higher. In an hour I was above the tree-line; in another I was lost in a
chilly snow-covered desert of tall mountains.
Then, without warning, I was over a high pass and the road fell
precipitously to warmth and greenery. I took a deep breath of surprise.
Spread out in a jigsaw puzzle below me were the spectacular islands, sea and
fiords of the Norwegian far north.
Fly, take ship or, if you can stand it, drive. One way or another, the
coasts around the Lofoten Islands are worth any kind of effort. Wholly
surprised by their beauty, I realised where generations of European
holiday-makers may have gone wrong. Instead of working in grey northern
cities and massing each summer on hot, smelly beaches to the south, we
should do the opposite - live and work in the south and travel to the cool,
green north for holidays. The Lofotens are the Cote d'Azur of the Arctic.
Looking about as I motored down towards the water, it was not hard to
understand their attraction. People love mountains and people love the sea,
but rarely do they get them together, or in such generous proportions.
Wherever I gazed were steep peaks, their summits snowy and ragged-toothed,
their bases plunging into the deep indentations of the arctic sea.
Nor was this any ordinary arctic sea. Other places in the world at the same
high latitude - northern Alaska, Baffin Island, upper Siberia - are
virtually unlivable. But here, dwarfed by this huge and untamed background,
were snug seaside villages, neat homes and barns and boat-houses painted
bright red and surrounded by green fields and flower gardens.
The Lofotens are as full of life as Lapland is barren. When the rest of
Scandinavia is shivering in sub-zero winter, there are parts of the Lofoten
Islands that remain above freezing point. It is all due to that gigantic but
invisible natural heat source, the Gulf Stream.
On this particular day, though, not even the Gulf Stream was having an
effect on the gale blowing in from the open ocean. It spanked up white-caps
on the milky-blue fiords, lay dandelions flat against the ground and tugged
at the cod-fish hanging by their thousands from wooden racks near the shore.
Clouds rolled in and out, the sun advanced and fled. In the distance
shifting fields of light played on sea and mountain snow. It made for a
splendidly savage, wind-whipped day.
Five of the seven islands that make up the twisted string of the Lofoten
group are connected by bridge, tunnel or short ferry ride. Ahead of me lay
400km of superb scenery. I took my time; in the arctic summer, when the sun
never sets, there is plenty of time.
In the town of Svolvaer I bought an island guide at a bookshop and asked the
attendant what people did through the long dark months of winter when the
sun never rises. There are not that many possibilities, it seems. 'Shovel
snow, drink beer, watch football and make babies,' she replied without a
moment's reflection.
In Sortland I spent a sleepless and sun-filled night in a hotel room where
the curtains failed to keep out the light. Confusion continued when I came
down to a vast Norwegian breakfast that was more like dinner: cheeses,
meats, sliced vegetables and more kinds of herring - in brine, in vinegar or
with curry or spicy tomato sauce - than I knew existed.
In the village of Eggum on the 'outside' - the term islanders use for the
rough unprotected waters of the open ocean - I spent an afternoon strolling
the pebble beach to the sound of great arctic combers rolling in. In
Nusfjord on the 'inside,' by the calm waters of West Fiord, I watched
fishermen taking cod down from the drying racks; they may look like inedible
slabs of timber but, rehydrated, they end up on the plates of southern
Europeans who judge them a delicacy.
The further out I went on the islands, the taller became the mountains, the
wilder the landscape. Finally, on Moskenes, I stopped at the fishing huts of
Sivert Sivertsen.
Barrel-chested Sivertsen went to sea when he was 14 and has been fishing
ever since. Arctic fishing, most of which takes place in the winter, is a
gruelling, merciless profession and today, at 57, Sivertsen has slowed a
little. In his 32ft boat, the Nyboen, he used to catch 40 tonnes of cod a
year and more. Today, with a cod quota in force, he is only allowed to take
17 tonnes, and spends fewer weeks at sea. He fills in the extra time looking
after guests in his rorbu and taking them out sports fishing.
Rorbu are found in almost all seaside Lofoten villages. Small wooden huts
built on piles over the water, they are used by fishermen in winter. In
summer they are let out to tourists, and make some of the most comfortable
and picturesque accommodation on the islands. I stayed a couple of days in
one of Sivertsen's snug self-catering rorbu in the village of Reine, and
found myself not wanting to leave.
Outside, against the backdrop of the black mountain that hangs over the
village, water lapped against the rocks, gulls cried and boats came and
went. Inside, I sat in my little kitchen trying to figure out a way to cook
a 6lb cod.
When we set off in the Nyboen that morning, Sivertsen had told me that fish
were not as numerous as they used to be. I had difficulty imagining how it
used to be, for we had no sooner put a line over the side and begun jigging
it up and down than we had a cod.
I fried it in batter, and for the first time in my life found out how fish
and chips should taste. I began thinking of ways to get fresh cod off the
Lofoten Islands, out of Scandinavia and down to the little chippy at the end
of my street in London. Information on the Lofoten Islands can be had by
contacting the Lofoten Tourist Board, Svolvaer, Norway, tel: 7-60- 73000,
fax: 7-60-73001. Rorbu accommodation can be difficult in high summer and
should be booked beforehand. Sivert Sivertsen can be contacted in Reine on
7-60-92239.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Travel: Keep on the right tracks in Europe - Practical
Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not long ago I took a train trip from the bottom end of Europe to the top,
from Marseilles to Helsinki, writes Nicholas Woodsworth. I did it because I
had time - the journey, with a 12-hour stop in Copenhagen, required four
different trains, two ferries, and took 63 hours.
I also did it because it was cheaper than flying: less than half the price.
But most of all I did it because I enjoy trains.
There is perhaps not as much romance in European train travel as there was
50 years ago. But it still has its pleasures. Apart from some horrendous
delays, atrociously cramped seating and one or two dodgy landings, I cannot
say I have any clear and lasting memories of airports or flights I have
taken; such things are anonymous and without character.
Yet I clearly remember train trips from years ago. If you want a physical
sense of Europe, a feeling for changes in its climate and countryside and
cities, if you enjoy chance encounters with its inhabitants, then trains are
the best way to see the continent.
Old tales of Italian peasants exuding garlic in stuffy compartments during
interminable journeys are no longer worth telling. Rail commuters in Britain
may have continuing grounds for complaint, but European mainland rail travel
is now seen as the transport of the future - services and networks on the
whole are comfortable, reliable and fast.
The French TGV - train de grande vitesse - that I took between Marseilles
and Paris, for example, takes just a little over four hours, and from city
centre to city centre rivals flying for rapidity.
While most of the hardware on the continental rail network is impressive, I
found the software - the vital information necessary to a complex network -
less satisfactory.
It may vary from country to country, but railway employees throughout the
continent seem to regard the provision of travel information as a special
favour. In Marseilles the man behind the counter was too hot and bothered to
look into an alternative to the inconvenient routing he first suggested.
Even in Copenhagen station, that model of Nordic efficiency, I was sold a
ticket for a service that did not exist at the time promised. On the German
train to Denmark, I saw an elderly American couple come close to nervous
collapse because their carriage attendant had failed to tell them that the
train split at Aachen. They emerged from a dining car in the wrong half to
find their carriage, with all their documents and belongings, heading in the
other direction.
The essential act, then, before boarding a train or buying a ticket is to
check and recheck. Euro City, Euro Night, Inter City Express, Inter Region -
there are scores of different types of trains.
Do not worry about making a nuisance of yourself; ask about the most
convenient departure times, connections and routings. Language problems,
guaranteed in many smaller or rural stations on the continent, can only make
matters more difficult. But a bit of polite perseverance can make all the
difference.
Perhaps the best place to begin is the International Rail Centre in London's
Victoria Station (tel: 071-834 2345). For those planning a set itinerary in
Europe, or wanting to avoid on-the-spot language problems, Thomas Cook
publishes a European timetable, updated monthly, available at bookshops or
by phoning 0733- 268943. The same company also publishes On the Rails Around
Europe (Pounds 9.95), a rail-travel guide separately detailing more than 40
different routes.
It is worth finding out, too, about discounts on standard tickets, and, for
those making extended tours, rail passes: these can offer real savings.
Discounts are available for senior citizens, students and children, and
often for travel outside peak and weekend travel periods.
There is a great range of rail passes such as the Eurail, available only to
those living outside Europe, which offers anything from 15 days of
first-class travel for Dollars 498 (Pounds 321) to three months for Dollars
1,398.
For Europeans a variety of passes exists, none of which offers the same
comprehensiveness. For those under 26, the Inter-rail pass offers unlimited
second-class rail travel through most countries in Europe for Pounds 249 a
month.
The Inter-rail 26+ pass, at Pounds 269 a month, offers unlimited travel to
those of any age, but is not valid for Iberia, Belgium, France, Italy or
Switzerland. However, most European countries, including those just
mentioned, provide savings on their own national railways with the
awkwardly-called Euro-Domino Freedom passes.
If you are contemplating a longer trip across Europe, chances are you will
find yourself on an over-night train. The charms of falling asleep to the
sound of turning wheels has been exaggerated.
After three nights of station shunting, customs checks and snoring
passengers, I rolled into Helsinki feeling not entirely rested. Make sure
you take ear-plugs.
You are more likely to get a better sleep in a proper sleeping car than in
couchettes, which are much cheaper and provide four to six berths for mixed
sexes in a converted day-time compartment. Pillows and sleeping-bag-style
sheets are sometimes made of disposable material, and I found the bunks
short and narrow.
Far more comfortable are single-sex sleeping compartments, with a maximum of
three berths and the possibility, in some first-class compartments, of
individual accommodation. You get a proper bed and, if you like, the
attentions of a steward. While most overnight trains offer dining-car
services, he will bring you drinks in the evening and breakfast in the
morning.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Cookery: Feasts from the deli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lure of the stove fades fast in hot weather. Good eating still appeals -
providing the dishes are light and fresh, not stodgy or creamy - but the
less cooking involved the better. This is a time when good shopping comes to
the fore and classy offerings from the delicatessen seem worth their weight
in gold.
As good fortune would have it, the hot spell in southern England has
coincided with the arrival in the UK of some fine foods from Italy.
Masseria is a small estate in Apulia, the heel of Italy. Its artisanal
products are strictly seasonal and quantities are limited. Own-grown
vegetables ripened in the southern sun are a speciality. Harvested in small
batches when at their peak, they are cooked and preserved within hours, and
this freshness is evident in the eating.
Unusual offerings include a vibrant green pasta sauce, made from the cooked
and pureed tips of a sort of wild broccoli, cime di rapa. Even more
noteworthy is a range of antipasti vegetables preserved in olive oil.
Of these the grilled wedges of artichoke are truly outstanding: the firm
sweet texture of the fresh vegetable is retained and the delicate artichoke
flavour shines through.
They are quite unlike most other preserved artichokes, which tend to be soft
verging on soggy and mildly sozzled with an overdose of vinegar.
These Masseria artichokes are in their prime now, having been picked,
grilled and bottled just recently. As the months go by they will soften a
little. But supplies of this year's crop will be snapped up and eaten long
before that happens.
Any day now Masseria grilled baby onions will come on stream. By September
sun-dried red peppers will be harvested, bottled and ready for sale, as will
lampasconi (delicately flavoured hyacinth-like wild bulbs). Treats to look
forward to.
September will also see the arrival in Britain of the new season's peperoni
farciti, an exquisite offering from Roi of Liguria. These stuffed peppers,
which I sampled at last year's harvest, are tiny round medium-hot peppers,
each carefully stuffed with whole anchovy fillets and capers, packed in
Roi's delicate extra virgin olive oil.
Like Masseria's grilled artichokes, Roi's stuffed peppers are a star product
to which I could easily become addicted. Try either or both of them with a
few slices of good ham, a hard-boiled egg or two and a smattering of fresh
chopped herbs. Perfect for lunch in the garden.
Sardinia is uncharted gastronomic territory so far as most Britons are
concerned. But not for long, as some of the best of the island's produce is
just beginning to trickle into the British marketplace.
San Giuliano, near Alghero, northern Sardinia, produces a commendable
selection of vegetable antipasti preserved in olive oil, that includes wild
cardoons, antunna mushrooms (a member of the oyster mushroom family
indigenous to Sardinia), and sun-dried tomatoes stuffed with anchovies,
herbs and spices.
There is also a San Giuliano extra virgin olive oil which, at less than
Pounds 6 per litre, strikes me as a very agreeable, very affordable everyday
olive oil; while from Sartos and San Raimondo in middle and southern
Sardinia respectively come prize-winning fruttato olive oils.
Casar's canned vegetables, from the Cagliari region in the south, include
excellent pulses: canned lentils, borlotti and, best of all, large mealy
white beans known as fagioli di spagna. The canned plum tomato products are
the best I have come across.
The Sardinians, like the British, are notably sweet-toothed. Some of their
biscuits and sweetmeats are Arab influenced. High fruit content jams include
a fine bilberry. Intensely flavoured hazels, almonds, walnuts and sultanas
stored in honey are especially delicious. This is an ancient preservation
method almost forgotten elsewhere.
Long-keeping foods are a hallmark of Sardinian cuisine. Traditional island
breads include pane carasau, colloquially known as carta di musica, or music
paper. Crackling, parchment-thin, it will keep for up to a year after
baking.
Even longer lasting is botarga, the salted and dried roe of mullet or blue
fin tuna. This fishy treat is Sardinia's greatest delicacy and is so
intensely savoury that only minute quantities are needed to kick-start the
appetite. Just as well, for it is a luxury item in the caviar and truffle
price bracket, food for high days and holidays.
One classic (and effortless) way to serve botarga is shaved wafer thin or
grated to a powder, sprinkled over a generous handful of rocket or broken
pieces of carta di musica drizzled with olive oil. (The poor man's version
substitutes sea salt for botarga.)
This is a splendid dish for reviving jaded appetites on summer days, when I
might preface it with a thirst-quenching soup, well chilled and agreeably
thin - made perhaps with Sardinian canned tomatoes, sieved to a puree,
generously diluted with light stock or iced water, enriched with a splash of
olive oil and aromatised with crushed fennel seeds and a sliver of garlic.

Roi, contact Danmar International. Tel: 081-844 1494. Fax: 081-751 1436.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Highland regiments hear the last post: The Queen's Own
Highlanders fear peace-time defeat. Christian Tyler visits the regiment on
the eve of amalgamation with the Gordons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER

<TEXT>
Silver goblets are carefully set in front of each officer's place along the
polished mess-table. But closer inspection shows their design is not
uniform. The first is embossed with a stag's head, the next with a thistle
and crown - and so on, alternately, around the table.
Like the clash of green and red tartan in the paintings on the walls, the
goblets proclaim the amalgamation 33 years ago of two clan regiments, the
Seaforth Highlanders and Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.
Today the product of that merger stands on the brink of another merger. The
Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) will acquire more goblets,
more tartan, more customs, when they are united this September with the
Gordon Highlanders from the Grampian region to the east, foreigners from
Aberdeen with strange accents and - so it is rumoured - Danish blood.
More than 30 British regiments are being reduced or merged in the present
round of cuts, to predictable cries of pain. Some soldiers see in this the
beginning of the end of a regimental system which is reputedly the envy of
the world.
To the men of the Queen's Own Highlanders a stroke of the pen in Whitehall
feels like a bayonet in the guts, for Highland soldiers enjoy more than a
shared history and regimental loyalty: they are bound, in a way English
regiments no longer are, by ties of territory, clan and family.
While the rest of the British army struggles towards the classless society,
theirs remains in some respects a feudal world. The officers - some still
lairds in uniform - are mostly the well-spoken products of English public
schools. As one young bachelor officer quipped when asked where he came
from: 'The Highlands of Chelsea.' They command men they call 'jocks' who in
civilian life could easily be their estate workers or gamekeepers.
Highland regiments enjoy a cachet unlike other infantry units. There are few
sights more stirring than a Highland regiment on ceremonial parade: a
moustachioed pipe major at the head, feather bonnets nodding, kilts
swinging, kettle-drums rattling and bagpipes wailing. A piece of theatre,
maybe, but more than that - an expression of collective pride powerful
enough to silence the most sceptical voice.
That pride was poignantly displayed recently when old soldiers of the
Seaforth Highlanders commemorated the 200th anniversary of the raising of
the 78th Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs), their regimental ancestor, by
Francis Humberston Mackenzie, Lord Seaforth.
In untypically brilliant sunshine, with the tops of Ben Wyvis uncovered
behind them, they marched in column of three behind a pipe band of their own
veterans through the streets of Dingwall on the Cromarty Firth. On the same
day, at the southern end of the Great Glen, another band of old soldiers was
parading through Fort William in memory of Alan Cameron of Erracht, founder
of the 79th Cameronian Volunteers.
Poignant, too, was the moment in the chapel of Fort George, the 18th century
garrison which juts into the Moray Firth near Inverness, when the regimental
chaplain, the Rev James Harkness, quoted from Isaiah: 'Consider the rock
from which you are hewn, the quarry from which you are dug.' Watched by
their colonel-in-chief, Prince Philip, the two clans combined for Beating
the Retreat at the Cameron Barracks in Inverness, marching off to the air of
the Mackenzie chiefs, Cabar Feidh, while the setting sun glared from the red
sandstone of the barracks. It was spirited but solemn: a celebration, and a
funeral march.
A campaign to prevent the merger was launched by old soldiers on both sides,
but apparently too late to have effect. The 'old and bold', as the Queen's
Own Highlanders call their veterans, say the merger is unfair on two counts:
that the QOH has barely digested its last amalgamation and that it is being
penalised for the Gordons' recruitment difficulties. They hoped - still hope
 -that a big UN peace-keeping force will be called for in Bosnia, further
stretching an already overstretched British army and thus saving their
battalion.
There is resentment about those regiments which, because of political
influence or logistical need, will come through diminished but undiluted.
'The politicians seem more worried about the Highlanders of Kathmandu, the
Gurkhas, than us,' said Col Andrew Duncan, a former commander of the
regiment. 'And why should there be three battalions of paratroopers when you
cannot safely parachute into battle ever again?'
Sgt John Rattray , a master tailor, complained: 'We don't have enough people
in Parliament. There's quite a lot of feeling that the Black Watch and
Argylls should have been disbanded - they're no Highlanders.' The Black
Watch, he explained, persecuted the Jacobites in the early 18th century and
were known as 'the English police'. The Massacre of Glencoe has not been
forgotten.
The regiment's commanding officer, and future commander of 'The Highlanders'
is Lt Col Hugh Monro whose brother was CO before him and whose father is Sir
Hector Monro, a minister in the Scottish Office. 'My principal concern is
not kilts and customs,' he said briskly, 'but people.'
His problem is to maintain morale through a reduction of the 565-strong
battalion which will hurt the careers of his officers and NCOs and threaten
unemployment for his men. 'If I was a retired officer it would be extremely
upsetting,' he added. 'I am upset, but I haven't got time to be upset.
Anyway, it would need a miracle to prevent it now.'
Highland soldiers regard themselves as special. Their martial tradition is
one reason. They make tough infantrymen, said Col Duncan, a legacy of the
era when they were required 'only to walk bravely forward, shoot their
muskets, and die when hit.' Yet they do not foster a cult of toughness like
the self-proclaimed elite units.
They are violent when roused, boisterous when drunk and need a lot of
disciplining. They are used to military service: regiments like the
Seaforths and Camerons were raised by their clan chiefs as much as anything
to provide employment. And they are used to dying. The entire adult male
population of Ullapool, the fishing port in the north-west Highlands, was
killed in the two world wars, according to Major-General John Hopkinson,
another former Seaforth and now Colonel of the Regiment.
'The jocks are fine soldiers, but a nightmare in camp', said Major Douglas
Hay of 'D' company, glowing with pride after watching his men win the
battalion soccer tournament in a cup final played at high speed and with
considerable ferocity. 'Everyone in the army says his battalion's the best.
The only difference is that in the Queen's Own Highlanders we know we are
the best]'.
Overt class distinction seems to bother no-one in the battalion. 'Jocks
expect officers to be different,' said a lance-corporal. In spite of it  -
no, because of it - officers and men alike boast of the familiarity
permitted. A sergeant explained that the relationship is less stiff-necked
than elsewhere in the army. Banter was tolerated short of insubordination
and jocks knew where the line was drawn. There is one club for the wives of
all ranks.
'Our sarn'ts (sergeants') mess is the oldest in the army. They are all real
gentlemen,' said Monro. 'Class is not important in this mess either. It's
performance.' These days, he said, respect had to be earned. 'There is no
room any longer for the chap who can hide behind a name or what he thinks he
is.'
Family connections and family feeling are the glue that binds these soldiers
together. Many have followed brothers, fathers, grandfathers into the
regiment. 'It's all to do with family,' said an NCO storeman from Fort
William. In one company there had been no fewer than six brothers serving
together.
Major Mike Wimberley, the second in command, was born in London and grew up
in Sussex. But he has a Cameron tartan plaid spread over his desk: he is the
fifth generation to join the regiment. For him, it is an extension of family
life. 'The hardest thing to face,' he said, 'is that someone wants to do
away with us, that someone can do away with the living thing that is a
regiment - that something created which works extremely well that can just
be wiped out at the drop of a pen. History doesn't count with government. It
doesn't matter a damn to them how long we have been around. What matters is
their ability to recruit and retain.'
The last serving Seaforth in the QOH is the quartermaster, Major Murdo
Macleod from the Isle of Lewis. He is old enough to remember babysitting a
little girl now married to one of the sergeants. 'When you leave a civilian
company,' he said, 'that's the end. But you are never, ever, retired from
the Queen's Own Highlanders.'
The last merger was made easier to digest by a posting to Singapore and
action in Brunei. Few doubt that the impending merger with the Gordons can
be made to work just as well, in spite of mutterings that their officers are
not of the same calibre and jokes about their tartan having a yellow streak.
Arguments about who will wear what, and when, in the new battalion have
largely been resolved. General Sir Peter Graham, colonel of the Gordons, was
rumoured to have threatened to fall on his sword if the Gordons lost the
kilt. So it will be Gordon kilts and Mackenzie trews for the soldiers, and
Cameron kilts and Mackenzie trews for the pipers and drummers. In return the
Gordons will give up their cap badge - the everyday emblem of the modern
soldier - of stag's head and motto 'Bydand' ('abiding') for the QOH stag's
head with thistle and crown and Gaelic motto 'Cuidich'n Righ' (Help the
King).
Thus traditions will fuse and a new sustaining myth will have to be
invented. 'We will have no trouble creating a history for the Highlanders,'
said a QOH officer. 'But it has taken 20 years to get our identity accepted
locally. It will take another 30 years for the new one.'
But for how long can the regimental system survive such chopping and
dilution? Field-Marshal Lord Carver argued 25 years ago that infantry
regiments should be merged into a single corps. He has few supporters in the
QOH. 'It is important to go into battle with friends, not acquaintances - to
see the blue hackle,' said Capt Stuart Tootal, who saw action in the Gulf
war where three men of the battalion were killed in the notorious 'friendly
fire' incident. 'At the end of the day one of the biggest motivations is not
to let your mates down, and I firmly believe in that.'
Major Wimberley said: 'We have asked them if necessary to lay down their
lives for the Queen's Own Highlanders. You cannot easily ask them to switch
off and say Now I am a 'Highlander'.'
But there are some who feel the campaign against amalgamation is a case of
old buffers resisting the inevitable. They say the tradition of local
regiments, formalised only 100 years ago, is wasteful in peacetime and
inefficient in wartime, however good it may be for esprit de corps. With
many regiments, like the QOH, down to a single battalion the rationale is
still further weakened.
'Why not put all the Highland battalions into one regiment?' suggested a QOH
dissenter. 'You could say they should have gone even further.' No doubt they
wanted to, but did not dare.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Glenturret's variety - Whisky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the Scottish mainland few whisky distilleries are good to look at. The
need to increase capacity during the boom years in the 1960s and 1970s
transformed most of the primitive industrial sites into complexes of
buildings looking more like factories.
The pagoda roofs on the maltings were levelled when the decision was made to
bring in malt from elsewhere. In other cases, old warehouses were cleared
when companies elected to age their stocks centrally, rather than at the
distillery itself.
If you do not want to take my word for it, go to the Glenlivet: you will
soon see that the best view is from the inside, looking out.
Yet there are a few notable exceptions. One of these is Strathisla in Keith.
Then there are the two smallest distilleries in the Highlands, in many ways
two working museums: Edradour, in Pitlochry, and Glenturret, just outside
Crieff.
Glenturret lays some claim to being the oldest distillery in Scotland. The
River Turret was particularly favoured by illicit distillers in the 18th
century and it is believed that whisky was being made on the site of the
present buildings as early as 1717.
The shell of the distillery dates back to 1775, half a century before the
relaxation of the duties on distilled spirits which created so many of the
larger operations on the mainland.
Glenturret continued to produce whisky until the 1920s. In 1927 the stills
fell silent and remained so for 30 years. During this time the distillery
was stripped of its equipment. Then, in 1957, the buildings were acquired by
a Glasgow whisky broker called James Fairlie.
Fairlie was bored by his work, and was looking for a more interesting line
of business. He did not have a lot of money but he managed to get the place
up and running by signing a number of hire-purchase deals. In that way he
was able to acquire a functioning Porteous grist mill and a couple of
secondhand stills.
Fairlie kept Glenturret going until 1981 by selling his whisky to big
companies for use in blended whisky. In that year Cointreau bought him out.
Ten years later, Glenturret reverted to Scottish ownership when Cointreau's
masters, Remy-Martin, did a share deal with the Highland Group. James
Fairlie stayed on until 1990. Since then his son, Peter, has been in charge.
Glenturret still fills casks for other companies, but its strong point is
how much it uses its own resources to good effect.
Its Highland position, just below the Turret Loch, attracts around 200,000
tourists every year. For a small fee they are able to pop into the
distillery and watch whisky production in miniature.
The mash tun, for example, is so small there that it is stirred manually by
a man with a paddle. The wash still, the most important of the two stills so
far as quality is concerned, was replaced by a rather more sophisticated
machine in the mid-1970s, but the old spirit still continues to be used.
Outside in the yard lie the casks in which the whisky spends its long years
of maturation. Most of them are American wood 'hoggies', constructed in
Scotland from imported barrel staves. Old sherry butts from Spain are also
in evidence.
Scotland's smallest distillery, Edradour, pours all its production into one
malt. Glenturret takes another path altogether. It bottles seven or eight
different whiskies as well as a painfully sweet liqueur.
Glenturret is a heavy whisky and this is already noticeable on the basic
eight-year-old with its honey and butter aromas. Outside the distillery it
is the 12-year-old which one sees on sale most often. This is a mite peatier
with a certain smokiness on the nose.
My favourite of the younger whiskies is the 15-year-old, with hints of
honeycomb and preserved fruits. This also comes in a high-strength version -
50 per cent alcohol by volume - with fruity, heathery notes.
Then come a series of weird bottlings. A 'copperlustre flagon' revealed a
21-year-old whisky smelling of varnish. The varnish aroma was probably
caused by sherry, but it was far from being my favourite in the range.
Another 21-year-old came in an expensive-looking cut-glass decanter. Again,
this had matured in sherry wood. A third 21-year-old had been bottled at 43
per cent. This was a better balanced whisky with some attractive floral
notes.
Finally, there were three older whiskies from the golden age: the 1960s.
This was the time when the whisky business was getting the best casks -
before demand outstripped the supply of decent wood. The 25-year-old at 43
per cent was clearly from a bourbon cask. It smelled of sugar and butter
being creamed together. A 1966 (27 years in cask) at 45.7 per cent was
fruitier with a slight touch of that enchanting apricot and ginger character
which is called rancio in Cognac. The 1966 Classic Vintage at 40 per cent
had even more rancio character.
Information: Glenturret is open to the public all year round but opening
times are restricted in January and February. Tel: 0764-656565. There is a
bar and two restaurants on site which specialise in Scottish food liberally
doused in whisky.

FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: Shoes that trod the hippy trail -
Birkenstocks are both fashionable and comfortable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are some products which have relevance and value regardless of time
and fashion. Birkenstock shoes are such a product.
Whether you are three years old and not very steady on your feet, or 80 and
feeling frail, Birkenstock will make sure you are happily and comfortably
shod. In between these two extremes, Voguettes rush around town wearing
Birkenstocks and the most laid-back, comfortable-looking guest at a London
summer drinks party recently was a chic visitor from Florida's Key West
sporting a soft, linen suit, collarless linen shirt and . . . yes . . .
Birkenstocks.
Birkenstocks were the original hippy shoe bought by free-loving Woodstock
fans, earnest ramblers and vegans who delighted in the plastic versions. Now
they have suddenly become transformed from merely practical footwear into
cult status.
In the summer of 1991, The Face magazine showed the then unknown Kate Moss
wearing them in photographs by Corinne Day and made all the style
cognoscente take notice.
Hotshot designers began to take the basic models and customise them for
their catwalk shows - Perry Ellis added pink satin and diamante buckles
while Kohji Tatsuno showed them in glittery silver.
Today much of their charm lies in their universality - they are that elusive
product, both widely accessible and infinitely chic.
By the footwear standards of today they are modestly priced ranging from
Pounds 19.95 to Pounds 69.95.
Their fans are legion. Harrison Ford, Whoopi Goldberg, Joan Bakewell, Koo
Stark, Victoria Wood, Julie Walters and Maggie Smith all saunter around in
them.
For those who have never heard the name, Birkenstock is a German shoe
company dating back to the 18th century. It rose to modest fame in the 1960s
when Karl Birkenstock combined the arched insoles with a footbed and straps,
creating the now familiar sandal.
This sole (or 'footbed') is the shoe's chief distinguishing characteristic
and the source of its particular comfort. It is made from cork (recyclable,
of course) and moulds and supports the foot.
Those who are new to Birkenstocks say it can take a while to become
accustomed to the toe grips and the arch support but, once hooked, you
becomes a life-long wearer.
In winter Birkenstock aficionados swap the open sandal for the closed-in
shoe styles with names such as Boston or London.
There are still ranges for vegans, made with no animal products, but the
model most favoured by the chic set is the Arizona, in leather and suede at
Pounds 49.95. This chimes perfectly with the 1990s feel for natural linens
and eco-friendly products.
The Natural Shoe Store, which sells them in the UK, prefers customers to
come in and be properly fitted but, as there are just three branches (21
Neal Street, London WC2; 325 Kings Road, London SW3; and 22, Princes Square,
Buchanan Street, Glasgow) it recognises that not everyone can easily reach
them, so it has just launched a mail order catalogue.
This catalogue lists all the styles, prices and materials and includes
charts to enable you to trace your foot shape precisely.
Do not be worried that at first sight the shoe or sandal seems alarmingly
large - this is part of the support system. Try them on a soft carpet before
rejecting them. Ring 0800-132-194 for a free catalogue.

FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: London shops to stock Kiehl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The second time I went to New York (the first time I was too green) I headed
straight over to the Bowery and dived into Kiehl's. At the time it was one
of the world's best-kept beauty secrets, a cult shop for models, make-up
artists, actresses, fashion designers and everybody else in the know.
There I stocked up on Ultra Facial Moisturiser, Light Nourishing Eye cream,
Shine 'N' Lite Groom (the explanation for many a New York model's shiny
tresses) and goodness knows what else. Ever since, friends going to and fro
are given orders and I stock up whenever I am there myself.
Now, four shops in London will be selling selections from Kiehl. Of course
it will not be quite the same as visiting that strange old apothecary in the
Bowery, dipping into those lotions and potions in their plain jars and
bottles.
The shops that will stock them are: Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1X
7XL; Smile (Hair Salon), 434 King's Road, London SW10 0LJ; Fourth Floor
(Hair Salon), Northington Street, London WC1N 2JG and Matches, 13 Hill
Street, Richmond, Surrey, TW9 1FX.
Kiehl's in Manhattan (109 Third Avenue, New York) also operates a worldwide
mail order service and a hotline: 212-677-3171.

FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: The coolest ways to fight the summer heat -
Lucia van der Post becomes a fan fan and finds that Y-fronts have shrunk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am one of the last of those Luddites who prefer fresh air and open windows
to air-conditioning. To me, not the least of the charms of third world
countries is their tendency to have hotels where you can still open windows
by hand and can figure out how the taps turn on without the aid of an
instruction manual.
But, thanks to the recent heat wave in the south of England, even I have
begun to think that maybe a little cooling air around the house might not
come amiss. In Britain's climate a complete air-conditioning system, with
attendant costs and disruption to the household, would scarcely seem
worthwhile. But for the sort of sultry nights and stifling days that we have
been having recently, a portable fan can make a lot of difference for a
comparatively small outlay.
You could spend as little as Pounds 16.99 for a small clip-on plastic fan by
Pifco (clip it to desk or bedside table) or as much as Pounds 138.75 for the
largest floor-standing Cinni. Cinni is the label most approved of by the
style police, a classic of the world of whirring air, trailing overtones of
ethnic chic, made as it is in India. It is, however, quite noisy, although I
find the steady whirr quite soothing, romantic almost, reminding me as it
does of tropical nights and sultry B-movies.
Made of metal, either shiny chrome or painted matt black, there are
table-top models (Pounds 82.50) and the 4ft high pedestal version (Pounds
185) which could cool a good-sized room. Stocks of Cinni fans are running
low in many of their usual outlets (Harrods, John Lewis) but the Freud Shop,
198 Shaftesbury Avenue, London WC2 (tel: 071-831 1071) has a good supply.
Xpelair offers a rather charmingly straightforward fan of the sort that is
found in offices and hospitals up and down the UK. It is defiantly untrendy
and no-nonsense to look at and does the job of moving the air around very
efficiently. The noise level varies but the two and three-speed models are
quiet enough for bedrooms if kept at the lowest speed. Higher speeds are
noisy but move more air. Sizes range from small table-top models just 8in in
diameter to a pedestal version 16in in diameter and 60in high
The funkiest fan, though, has to be the one Viking Direct (suppliers of
office equipment) is giving away free if - here's the catch - you spend
Pounds 150 on one of its computers first. It looks as though it has been
designed by Ettore Sotsass of Memphis fame, has the visual charm of a small
sculpture and runs on batteries - you simply press a button and it produces
a pleasing whirring and cooling of the air. It is small enough (about 18ins
high) to be very portable. (Tel: 0800-424444).
Those heading for enclosed spaces such as operas, theatres or tented
marquees (last Sunday the temperature in the Cartier tent at Smiths' Lawn
was reckoned to have risen to 110`F and it certainly felt like it) might
like to have their own little folding fan.
The Spotted Duck, 115 Fulham Road, London SW6, has a beautifully carved
sandalwood version which smells exotically of spice as you wave it about. It
costs Pounds 2.50.
Fans mounted on the ceiling can be less intrusive and they are usually less
noisy. The Xpelair version, called Whispair, is probably the most
sophisticated and it does the job of circulating air very well. Sizes range
from 36in diameter to 60in, with a drop down from the ceiling of 10in to
30in. All are the same price, Pounds 78.52 and the essential control switch
is Pounds 18.77. Bemco is the wholesaler and it will be happy to give
details of local stockists (tel: 081-874 0404).
Those hankering for a bit Somerset Maugham-style colonial romance might look
at colonial-style ceiling fans with brass bodies and rattan blades. These
cost Pounds 99.50 from Christopher Wray Lighting of 600 Kings Road, London
SW6.
For serious air cooling, the most popular portable domestic device is the
Holiday One refrigerated air conditioner unit made by Carrier. It normally
costs Pounds 1,135 (currently Pounds 999 in Selfridge's sale) and will cool
a fair-sized room.
Most mechanical oscillating fans operate by moving existing air around but,
for those who have been suffering from pollution this summer, it is worth
knowing that there are ways of improving the quality of the air itself.
Valerie Taplin, who runs the Air Improvement Centre at 23 Denbigh Street,
London SW1, says that the levels of air pollution have brought her many new
customers this summer, many looking for cleaner air.
Her air purifiers sell at prices ranging from Pounds 50 for the smallest to
Pounds 500, depending almost wholly upon size and capacity. These are
basically boxes which are plugged into a socket and suck in dirty air at the
back and expel clean air through the front, ionising it on the way. Most
have two filters - a carbon filter which takes out gaseous pollution (car
exhaust, fumes and the like) and an electret filter that takes out
particulate pollution (unburned hydrocarbons, soot, lead oxide from traffic
exhaust). The ioniser recharges the air and revitalises it, putting back in
the negative ions (which Valerie Taplin describes as being like 'vitamins of
the air') which polluted city air is low in.
These air purifiers do not cool the air but make a difference to those with
breathing problems. Valerie Taplin offers an emergency service for those in
distress - she has delivered humidifiers in the middle of the night to a
tracheotomy patient, an opera singer and many asthmatics.
Come the hot weather, though, it is inevitable that the shops are out of
fans - just as you can seldom buy a bikini when the summer is at its height
('Modom, they were all sold out in January'), or a hay fever remedy in the
hay fever season ('everybody has been asking for it,' was my local chemist's
excuse for being out of Beconase). My advice is this  - never mind if your
local high street is looking like a frozen tundra, buy a good fan if you see
it and next time the weather is sweltering you will be smiling.
*****
Good news for chaps: the new improved Y-front by Jockey is about to hit the
shops. Now you might think that there was little anyone could do with
Y-fronts, that they were one of those all-time classics that should not be
tampered with.
But I have to tell you, you would be wrong.
The boys at Lyle &amp; Scott are very excited by their recent discovery that
there have been serious flaws in all previous thinking about sizing - no
one, it seems, had ever bothered to measure this rather intimate area
correctly.
As a result Y-fronts, in common with all other underpants, were simply
enlarged proportionally all round as they moved from little waists of 26 to
gigantic ones of 54. After getting wives, girlfriends and even boyfriends to
take a host of measurements, they discovered that while tums and bottoms
varied hugely in size other measurements (most importantly the one from the
navel to the top of the pubic bone) varied by an infinitesimal amount.
As a result, the portion of the underpants that covers waists and bottoms is
now sized appropriately while other measurements, from the middle down to
the pubic bone, remain more or less static. This, it seems - and here I have
to rely on the reports of the panel - results in much greater comfort and
makes sure the double gusset is in perfect alignment.
The new Y-front incorporates all the classic features of the old - in
particular the waist-band (as integral to the design as the bumper is to the
BMW). Made of woven elastic which has great flexibility (did you know your
waist can expand by up to 5in when you sit down?) it is the key to the
Jockey design.
Whereas most men's underpants are sized simply as S, M, L and XL, the Jockey
Y-front is sized in inches all the way from 32in to 58in (Marks and
Spencer's XL Y-fronts go up to 48 inches).
It is still made from fine ribbed 100 per cent cotton, just as it was on
that momentous day in 1935 when Marshall Fields of Chicago filled a window
with the new Y-front underpants and sold out by mid-day. At Pounds 4.25 for
a classic brief (three for Pounds 10.99) it still represents value for
money.

Making my own necklaces has not been the kind of occupational therapy that I
have ever aspired to. But Janet Coles sells beads of such beauty and
diversity that she could tempt me. Her mail order brochure is beautifully
produced - the beads presented in an ordered fashion with plenty of ideas
for creating necklaces, jewellery and bracelets, writes Lucia van der Post.
You do not need to be a Flintstones fan to appreciate the latest collection
 -all ancient stones, prehistoric-style pendants and neolithic-style
necklaces. Necklaces shown here can all be made with materials bought from
Janet Coles - either by mail order (Perdiswell Cottage, Bilford Road,
Worcester, WR3 8QA, 0905- 755888) or from her shop, Janet Coles Bead
Emporium, 128 Notting Hill Gate, London W11. Pendants in kit form are Pounds
5, made-up about Pounds 7. Chunky necklaces cost between Pounds 9.95 and
Pounds 21 in kits, and Pounds 13.50-Pounds 25 made-up.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Small Business: Private life in Prague - A look at a couple
who found a gold lining in the velvet revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly after Prague's 'velvet revolution' of November 1989 an enterprising
Welsh bride, and her chartered accountant husband, started hawking brightly
coloured T-shirts from a rucksack to the first tourists to this baroque
jewel of a city.
Four years later, Melissa Woolf runs eight strategically-placed 'Melissa'
stores along the city's main tourist routes. She still hangs T-shirts from
racks on the white-washed walls of her shops. But her main business, worth
more than Pounds 2m last year, is selling Czech toys and exquisite Bohemian
glassware.
Her husband, James, has become one of Prague's biggest property developers.
His company, Flow East, refurbished 60 city centre properties last year,
turning crowded flats into smart offices and apartments and buying new homes
for former tenants in the suburbs.
The Woolfs came to Prague in 1990. They were unimpressed by the prospects in
recession-hit Britain and intrigued by media coverage of enthusiastic crowds
milling in squares of baroque beauty and the possibilities offered in a
post-communist state. They found the opportunities the opening-up of a
centrally planned economy presented for service industries such as tourism,
retailing and property development. Their entrepreneurial flair and
willingness to work a seven-day week has allowed both to build successful
businesses.
'I now employ 117 people full-time. I visit every shop at least once a day
and spend two or three days a week on the road talking to suppliers and
placing orders,' says Melissa. She buys what she likes, and when she really
takes a fancy to a product, such as the wooden puzzle toys on display in her
shop on the approach to the historic Charles Bridge, she buys a stake in the
company.
James helps with the accounts and the property transactions. But apart from
that, the two run their business lives separately.
James works from offices in his own refurbished building close to the city
centre shared with tenants as varied as Saatchi and Saatchi, the German
Tourist agency, two banks and lots of lawyers.
'I started operating on the principle that incoming foreign companies and
local entrepreneurs would want to locate themselves in the heart of this
beautiful but long-neglected city,' he says.
'After investing heavily up front, however, most foreign companies are
cutting back on expensive expatriate employees and training locals. They
also expect rents and other expenses to be paid out of local income while
the supply of refurbished office space is increasing all the time. So
rentals have stabilised over,' he says.
Prague, he points out, is as big as a medium-sized British provincial city,
such as Ipswich. But Ipswich, and similar towns in western Europe, developed
on capitalist lines after the war.
Prague in 1990 was different. Once-elegant shops, apartments and other
properties were stolen from their owners, either by the Nazis after 1938, or
by the communists after the Prague coup of 1948. Most were roughly converted
into over-crowded communal flats, storehouses and the like, or allowed to
decay for 50 years.
One of the priorities of the Czech republic's free market-oriented
government has been to return as much property as possible to rightful
owners and sell state property. But the task is complicated. . To whom, for
example, should a property expropriated from a Jewish owner by the Nazis,
then sold and later confiscated by the communists, be returned?
So James decided to buy only fully restituted properties with a clear owner.
Once bought, his next problem is persuading tenants with low fixed rents to
leave.
For most life in the city centre means over-crowded, badly-maintained flats.
James employs a small staff to comb local newspapers for property in the
suburbs. James then buys on behalf of tenants who thus become owners of
their own homes - leaving him the empty buildings.
'The property market here is about buying, refurbishing and renting. A
resale market has not emerged yet, but it will,' he says.
Until capital value can be unlocked by resale, cashflow profit is ploughed
back into the business. It is a similar story for Melissa, whose company has
no debt and is financed from retained earnings.
'We have three Czech construction companies working for us full time and the
quality of their output is rising steadily. Many are Yugoslavs or Russians.
They work seven days a week, nights as well if required,' James says. 'It
takes only six to seven weeks to convert a flat in Prague which would take
three to four months in London.'
James looks after the legal and financial side of the business. His partner,
Stephen Davis, oversees the construction. Problems include finding good,
loyal staff - not easy with unemployment in Prague only 2.5 per cent - and
the bureaucracy. Companies employing more than 25 workers are subject to
wage control and there are fines for slow or non-payment of VAT at 23 per
cent.
Finance is less of a problem, thanks to the establishment of foreign banks.
'Komercni Banka, the biggest Czech bank, is only prepared to lend for a
maximum of four years at 14.5 per cent, or seven years by private treaty.
But why bother when you can get 10-year loans from German and Austrian banks
with less hassle? As for UK banks, they have missed out on this market
completely,' said James.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Second home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I intend to buy a second home in the south of England which will be solely
for my own use as a holiday home. In five years I intend to retire, sell my
present home and move into the second home as my main and only residence.
If house prices rise over the next five years, would a liability for capital
gains tax arise on the second home if it were sold after it had become by
main residence?
If there are tax implications, should I be making any 'main residence'
declarations to the Inland Revenue to minimise or avoid the liability?
The solicitor who acts for you in the purchase - will be able to guide you
on the question of the timing of main-residence notices (under section
222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). In the meantime, to
get an idea of the arbitrary rules laid down by parliament, ask your tax
office for the free leaflet CGT4.
Your solicitor's advice is likely to be broadly along the following lines:
1. A main-residence notice in favour of your present home should be lodged
fairly soon after completion of the purchase of your second home (and
certainly before the second anniversary of the purchase), retrospectively.
2. A notice of variation, in favour of your second home, should be lodged
(retrospectively) no later than the day on which you are sure that the
purchaser of your original home is not going to default.

answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Granny's houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughters have jointly inherited two properties from their grandmother.
These are valued at Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 28,000, with sitting tenants.
If one became vacant and was sold for approximately Pounds 50,000, how would
CGT be calculated? Would it make a difference if my daughters lived in the
house before selling?
Your daughters are deemed, for CGT purposes, to have acquired the houses at
their grandmother's death at probate value, broadly speaking. The solicitor
who acted for the executors will be able to give them the precise figures
for CGT purposes (it is rather surprising that he or she did not give them
the necessary information as a matter of course).
By living in the house in question, and giving judiciously timed
main-residence notices (first in favour of that house, and then in favour of
their present residence, probably, with appropriate periods of
retrospection), each of them could reduce her prospective CGT bill on the
sale of the house, without producing an unacceptable CGT bill upon any sale
of her present residence. It should be possible (as the law stands at
present) for the prospective CGT bill on the other inherited property to be
mitigated in a similar way.
The rules are complex and arbitrary. Your daughters should seek guidance
from the solicitor who acts for them in the house sale. As a first step,
they can ask their tax offices for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Capital gains
tax: owner-occupied houses) and CGT14 (Capital gain tax: an introduction).

FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Worthless certificates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I own 200 shares in Norton Group plc, which crashed last year with debts of
Pounds 7.5m. I understand that a Canadian entrepreneur has bought the old
Shenstone factory at a knock-down price. Is my share certificate worth
anything or should I frame it?
Your share certificate is almost certainly worthless. Unless it is
particularly artistic, framing would merely be throwing good money after
bad. (Murray Johnstone).
I hold shares in Ferranti which are obviously a total write-off. As I am
unable to dispose of these shares in the market:
1. By what procedure am I able to realise the losses for CGT purposes?
2. Could this be done on the last day of the present tax year to maximise
indexation benefit?
To qualify for maximum indexation and to minimise the risk of forfeiting all
indexation (by failing to get the claim into the inspector's hands by the
end of the tax year), you should, on Saturday, April 1 1995, write to your
tax office along the following lines:
'In accordance with section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992, I claim that the value of my holding of (state number) shares in
Ferranti International plc has become negligible, namely . . . , and that I
should therefore be treated as if I had sold that holding for that sum
today, April 1 1995, and had immediately reacquired it for that same sum, in
circumstances falling outside section 105(1) of the Act.'
If by chance you reach the Pounds 10,000 limit for indexation losses
(between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995, inclusive) as a result of actual
disposals etc, then the timing of your negligible-value claim will not
matter.
Some years ago I bought some shares in a company called Equity &amp; General
which went bankrupt and I have found out that the Inland Revenue declared
shares in this company to be of negligible value from 14 September 1990.
I have not previously entered the loss on my tax returns but now need to do
so. How do I do this? I would like to use part of the loss in the tax year
92/93 and part in the tax year 93/94. Is this possible and to what date
should I index the loss in each case.
The revised version of extrastatutory concession D28 (which permits
retrospective negligible-value claims) was published at the end of May. It
is too long to quote, so you should ask your tax office for a copy; if you
have any difficulty, write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Office,
Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB.
The new version of concession D28 appears to have been written in a hurry so
we shall not be surprised if you find it difficult to understand. Please
come back to us after reading it, with the full background facts, figures
and dates (including a note of what elections you have made - rebasing,
pooling etc.). Without precise data, we cannot say whether it is possible
for you to make a negligible-value claim for only part of the shareholding:
there is no universal answer, but the most common one is NO.
If the company no longer exists (if it has been struck off, for example),
you will automatically be deemed to have disposed of your shareholding on
the day on which it ceased to exist, by virtue of section 24(1) of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Accountant asks Pounds 200 to sign letter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago, my accountant arranged two policies for me, one an endowment,
the other whole of life. Now the endowment has matured, he proposes to
charge me 0.5 per cent on the proceeds for signing the maturity form.
His normal charge would be 1.1 per cent but, in view of the amount involved,
he expressed himself willing to take the lower charge. This would give him
Pounds 200 simply for signing the maturity form and a letter written by me
to the insurers. But I knew nothing of this charge until 10 years after
taking out the policies. Is this normal practice?
I have a further endowment policy written in trust which matures in four
years. This involves one (different) trustee to whom I wrote some time ago
but have received no reply. If he cannot be traced, how do I replace him?
Whether your accountant is entitled to charge a percentage on the policies'
proceeds depends on the agreement between you and him when the policies were
taken out.
If you are unhappy, the professional conduct department at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants might be able to assist you. The address is:
Gloucester House, 399 Silbury Boulevard, Milton Keynes, Bucks MK9 2HL.
You can replace trustees on the present policies by writing to the companies
concerned in order to verify who has the power to appoint trustees.
It might be possible that, as settlor, you have this power; if so, the
companies concerned could supply you with forms in order to make the
necessary change. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Questions of life and Aids - An HIV
test may still signify high risk in spite of a new ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tough discrimination policy of UK life offices against people who have
been tested for the HIV virus, which is thought to cause Aids, was
apparently relaxed this week and should lead to rate cuts for life assurance
policies and endowment mortgages.
But insurers may still regard those who have sought the test as high risk.
Although the information would not be on the proposal form, it is readily
available from applicants' GPs.
The controversial questions on HIV testing, introduced in 1987, asked if the
applicant had ever had a test for HIV or sexually transmitted diseases. The
Association of British Insurers this week said that insurers should withdraw
this question and instead ask if the applicant has ever had a positive test
result or undergone treatment for HIV or sexually transmitted diseases. The
ABI said it was prepared to change the wording because Aids-related claims
since 1987 - estimated at Pounds 50m - were much lower than expected.
Men and women who voluntarily sought the HIV test were classed as high risk
and either had to pay much higher premiums or in some cases were refused
cover. In 1988, when insurers' fears about Aids-related claims reached fever
pitch, premiums for young single men rocketed, whether or not they had been
tested. In that year the premium for an Allied Dunbar 10-year
convertible-term assurance policy with a sum assured of Pounds 100,000 for a
30-year-old man rose from Pounds 8.16 to Pounds 22.16 per month - an
increase of 270 per cent.
The same year Scottish Life doubled its monthly premium rates for younger
men while Friends Provident rates rose by 180 per cent.
The ABI says it expects some insurers to reduce these inflated rates now
that the need for large reserves was less critical. Shopping around for the
best value is still essential. Allied Dunbar now charges Pounds 14.80 for
the policy mentioned above and existing policyholders benefit from the
reduction, as well as new applicants.
Although you no longer need to answer the question on the life insurance
form asking whether you have had an HIV test, do not expect the company to
tell you that unasked. Our straw poll of companies the day after the ABI
announcement showed that most were uncertain about what they would do to
implement the change.
'Our underwriters will accept a questionnaire from an applicant who has
scored through the HIV/ Aids questions,' said Clerical Medical, but they
have not yet decided how salesmen should approach the subject. Abbey Life
will be sending a circular to its salesmen and they can meanwhile refer
questions back to head office.
Legal &amp; General plans to reconvene its Aids working party, and with charming
candour said that the speed of its own reaction would depend on whether the
competition seemed to be moving faster.
Even when insurers produce new forms which drop the question about
Aids-testing, they will still be able to find out whether you have had an
Aids-test from your GP's medical records. Ivan Massow, an independent
financial adviser who specialises in insurance for gay men, said: 'GPs
naturally will ask tested patients about their sexual history and number of
partners and this will go on file. All this information will be available to
the insurers.'
Every life insurance proposal form asks for permission to contact the
prospective client's GP - a practice condoned by the British Medical
Association (BMA) provided the patient has given consent. 'People have no
choice on the matter. You simply cannot get life assurance if you refuse
permission. A handful of GPs do not co-operate with insurers' requests but
most willingly oblige. With this right of access, insurers don't need to
rely on the proposal form - they can find out anyway,' said Massow.
Massow urged those who, for peace of mind, want an HIV test to continue to
use sexually transmitted diseases clinics where confidentially is protected
by criminal law.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A discreet lifting of the skirt -
The Professionals / Joanna Slaughter visits Cazenove in a series on private
client investment managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discretion is of prime importance in the private client department of
stockbroker Cazenove &amp; Co, so much so that the firm's partners decline to be
quoted by name in the press. As a spokesman says: 'We have never advertised.
But we must occasionally raise our profile.'
Cazenove's most public piece of profile-raising was probably the launch of
its unit trust subsidiary seven years ago, which one partner described as
'Cazenove lifting its skirts a little'. The skirt-lifting was designed to
provide the firm with a shop-window. The holdings in the core trust, the
Cazenove Portfolio Fund, which has a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000,
replicate those of a typical private client portfolio.
The private client division of Cazenove Fund Management uses unit trusts
where appropriate - a spokesman reckons a portfolio needs to be worth some
Pounds 1m before it justifies a direct investment in individual overseas
stocks - but its fund managers will not necessarily choose the house
collective funds for clients.
Cazenove &amp; Co is an independent partnership, wholly-owned by its 60
partners, and Cazenove Private Client Portfolio Management acts in an agency
capacity on behalf of its clients.
Four partners oversee the private client department, and 15 managers look
after clients' portfolios, assisted by nine deputies.
All new clients are interviewed by a partner, who assesses their investment
requirements, and places them with the fund manager most suited to them.
Private clients come from partners' families and friends, from the families
of companies that Cazenove has brought to the public, and from personal
introductions from solicitors and other advisers. Cazenove accepts new
clients only on a discretionary basis and they must use the firm's safe
custody arrangements.
There are no fixed fees. Clients pay a sliding scale of commission and a 0.1
per cent safe custody fee. Cazenove robustly defends its adherence to
traditional charging practices, arguing that a fixed annual fee 'encourages
you to do nothing for a client. We think commission is fairer to clients.'
Portfolio valuations that are sent to private clients, show the performance
on the first page; every transaction is itemised; and the client is provided
with an income audit trail.
The house investment style is described as 'international and
equity-orientated, tending to the conservative, with a little spice here and
there'.
The private client fund managers aim to create strong diversified equity
portfolios, and they have access to the research and resources of the whole
firm. The Cazenove UK investment research department follows some 350
companies, and Cazenove's position as a corporate broker provides a
ring-side seat for new and smaller companies.
Cazenove is broker to 51 companies in the FT-SE 100 share index, thus
providing private client managers with opportunities to meet these
managements. The firm has offices in North America, Europe, Japan, South
East Asia, Australia and South Africa, which feed macro-economic and
corporate information to the UK fund managers.
The managers looking after private clients have a daily briefing from
Cazenove &amp; Co, whose research department provides a list of recommended
stocks, but there is no compulsion to buy these.
The conclusions of the asset allocation committee, which meets every three
months, are tailored for each portfolio, in line with client requirements.
Currently the recommended private client portfolio weighting is 51 per cent
in UK equities, 6 per cent in Europe, 5 per cent in Japan, 5 per cent in the
Far East, 3 per cent in the US and 1 per cent in emerging markets. The
remaining 29 per cent is in cash and index-linked gilts.
The figure for cash is historically high but Cazenove has been cautious for
some time, partly due to uncertainties surrounding US interest rates and the
expectation that UK interest rates have bottomed out.
Cazenove is uncommon is imposing no minimum investment, and there is a huge
variation in the size of the private client portfolios. Sums of less than
Pounds 100,000 are likely to be directed to the unit trust subsidiary but
the spokesman says: 'We think it is quite inappropriate to have a minimum
investment written in stone. A young member of a family is not going to be
turned away, if he has only Pounds 50,000.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: 'Smug and greedy trusts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spotlight has been on the life industry debate over the disclosure of
charges. From next year, life companies will have to reveal to private
investors the amount of commission they pay to financial advisers for
selling their products.
Unit trusts, which also pay commission to financial intermediaries have so
far escaped the same scrutiny. However, a prominent figure in the unit trust
industry, Tim Miller of Portfolio Fund Management, believes that Britain's
unit trusts are smug and greedy and need to change radically if they are
ever to become mass-market investments.
Miller used to be marketing director at M &amp; G, the UK's largest unit trust
group, after being managing director of Framlington unit trusts. He believes
that a clear explanation of the risks, rewards and costs involved is the key
to attracting a broader public.
A working party of the Securities and Investments Board, the financial
services watchdog, is studying disclosure of unit trust commissions and
charges. Miller, who used to serve on it, says it could help both investors
and the industry by recommending that unit trusts adopt the style of
disclosure used in the US mutual fund industry. This would mean showing the
effect of charges over different periods of time using a standard growth
rate of 5 per cent for total return but not distinguishing between income
and capital growth.
'For many years, the unit trust industry has preened itself in comparison
with life companies because of the transparency and apparent low level of
its charges. But I think we may have been deluding ourselves,' says Miller.
The typical unit trust makes charges of 6 per cent initially and 1.25 per
cent annually, adding up to 31 percentage points over 20 years. This is more
than twice the total of 13.25 percentage points over 20 years which was the
limit in force before deregulation in 1979.
The dubious honour of running the highest-charging unit trust goes to Fimbra
member Knight Williams, according to the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds. Four of KW's in-house trusts charge 6.39 per cent
initially and 2.5 per cent annually, making a 20-year total of 56.39
percentage points - more than four times the pre-deregulation level.
The accompanying table shows a selection of low-charging unit trusts with
minimum investment levels low enough for personal investors.
Money market funds carry the lowest charges, followed by index-trackers  -
unit trusts which mirror the performance of a stock market index.
Although unit trust managers already have to declare initial and annual
charges, Miller says investors find the long-term effect of these apparently
small numbers hard to grasp.
Part of the reason is that, until recently, high charges have been masked by
long-term rates of return of between 10 and 15 per cent a year.
An annual charge of 1.25 per cent would knock 8 per cent off a 15 per cent
return but it would demolish 25 per cent from a 5 per cent return.
'The US system makes charging policies crystal clear and the result is
widespread competition on charges,' said Miller, who suggests that applying
the US system in Britain could help unit trusts gain investor-confidence and
increase their share of the savings market from the current 3 per cent to
something more like the 17 to 20 per cent savings market share of American
mutual funds.
The leading exponent of low-cost funds in the US is Vanguard group of Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania, now ranked second to Fidelity in size, having climbed
from Dollars 7bn assets under management in 1983 to around Dollars 114bn.
(In the same time, Fidelity grew from Dollars 20bn under management to
Dollars 221bn.)
Vanguard charges 0.4 per cent annually on equity funds against an industry
average of 1.34 per cent, and 0.26 per cent on bond funds against an
industry average of 0.65 per cent.
Last year, a comparison by Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based financial
services and information firm, found that Vanguard's bond funds had averaged
an annual return of 11.32 per cent over the past 10 years against Fidelity's
10.83 per cent, allowing for charges and expenses. Over five years,
Vanguard's return on bond funds was 11.23 per cent against Fidelity's 9.9
per cent.
But Fidelity was ahead on equity funds which had produced an average return
of 14.01 per cent over 10 years and 16.23 per cent over five years, against
Vanguard's 10.83 per cent and 12.52 per cent averages for the same periods.
Jack Bogle, chairman of Vanguard, is also a believer in the concept that a
randomly-selected portfolio of stocks often performs as well or better than
stocks picked by professional fund managers.
'Under good and bad management alike, a fund provides a gross return that is
reduced, dollar for dollar, by the cost incurred in its ownership,' he wrote
in a book published in the US (Bogle on Mutual Funds, Irwin). 'All other
things being equal, lower costs mean higher returns.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Lower fixed rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Investment Editor, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-rate investment accounts continue to be withdrawn or reduced and new
fixed rates are for shorter terms and at lower rates than of late.
New three-year fixed rates have been launched by Chelsea paying 7.75 per
cent yearly or 7.49 per cent monthly. Yorkshire is paying 8.00 per cent
yearly or 7.75 per cent monthly, which is currently the best rate on offer
although lower than the 8.50 per cent over four years it was offering
earlier in the week.
The trend continues through to Guaranteed Income Bonds. While the top
five-year rate remains at 7.75 per cent net from Eurolife, the majority of
institutions have reduced their long-term rates in recent weeks. However,
shorter-term rates of one year have been increased by Liberty Life and AIG
Life. The latter has also introduced a two-year bond for the first time,
with market leading rates.
The building societies now seem to be concentrating their efforts on the
authorised overdraft front. Halifax started the trend in June by announcing
a reduction in its authorised overdraft rate from July 1 to an effective
annual rate (EAR) of 12.4 per cent.
This was soon leapfrogged by Abbey National which reduced its rate to 9.9
per cent EAR. The Woolwich BS and Alliance &amp; Leicester have since reduced
their rates - down to 9.8 per cent EAR and 9.5 per cent EAR respectively.
Rates will also be down at the Nationwide from August 1 to 11.5 per cent EAR
(or 8.74 per cent if you have a Nationwide mortgage). Britannia will also be
reducing its authorised rate to 12.02 per cent EAR, although the Pounds 5
per month arrangement fee remains.

Why most people are paying less
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Competition, better underwriting and fewer thefts have been good news for
drivers. Over the past year, some motor insurance premiums have fallen by
between 5 and 10 per cent, according to Mark Wood, managing director of the
Automobile Association's insurance and financial services.
He says: 'The absolute incidence of motor crime reduced very sharply in 1993
and there has been a massive number of new market entrants, both from
continental Europe and new start-up operations. Traditional insurers have
been reducing prices and the new direct writers are paying to build up a
position in the market.'
Direct insurers sell their policies over the telephone, cutting out
middlemen, and probably account for around a third of the market. One of
them, Direct Line, is the largest motor insurer in the UK.
The irony is that although they started out as niche players, they now tend
to occupy the middle ground, leaving the niches to the conventional
insurance companies.
Michael Edwards, deputy managing director of The Insurance Service - the
direct insurance arm of Royal Insurance - says much of the cross-subsidy
between good and bad risks has been eliminated due to changes in
underwriting techniques in recent years. Inevitably, though, this has not
benefited everyone.
The virtual end of the 60-year-old knock-for-knock agreement - under which
insurers agreed to pay claims presented by their policyholders irrespective
of their responsibility for an accident - means that comprehensive drivers
are no longer subsidising third-party risks.
Many young drivers who had been shielded by their parents' insurance have
been hit hard, too. A survey in the latest edition of Which?, the Consumers'
Association magazine, shows that the cost of a policy for a man with an
expensive car, whose wife and son are also covered, has almost tripled over
the past two years.
Young drivers with high-value cars who arrange cover in their own names are
likely to find this very expensive. I asked three direct insurance companies
and three brokers to give quotations for a 24-year-old journalist with one
speeding conviction who was seeking comprehensive insurance for the first
time on a 1992 Ford Escort XR3i. One quotation was to be based on a south
London post code, the other on a post code in Norfolk.
Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance Service would not cover either
risk. AA Insurance quoted Pounds 4,355 (in London) and Pounds 3,282 (in
Norfolk), with a Pounds 175 compulsory excess. Telesure, the UK's first
telebroking company, produced rates of Pounds 3,508 (London) and Pounds
2,647 (Norfolk), but with a Pounds 350 excess. And Swinton quoted Pounds
4,086 (London) and Pounds 2,884 (Norfolk), with a Pounds 600 excess.
Many young drivers cut costs by taking third party - the legal minimum
protection - instead of comprehensive cover. Simon Ward, Telesure's managing
director, says this would cut the cost for the south London driver to Pounds
1,705.
Costs also fall when young motorists have established a no-claims driving
record. If the south London driver had completed four years without a claim,
the AA would have quoted a premium of Pounds 1,742.
No insurance company is a best buy for every risk, and drivers should not
accept the first quotation offered. Direct insurers tend to be around 10 per
cent cheaper on many standard risks but are unlikely to offer cover to
drivers who own high-value cars or who live in a high-risk area.
Edwards says his company will not quote on 10 to 12 per cent of motorists.
But Telesure scans 150 schemes from 32 insurers, and Ward believes it can
quote for 99 per cent of the motorists who come to it. Meanwhile, James
Duffell of Norwich Union - a broker-orientated company which does not have a
direct arm, says: 'We are much better for hot hatches, younger drivers and
executive cars.'
Like other insurers, Norwich also has such 'extras' as standard breakdown
cover for women and older drivers; no loading for un-garaged cars; and a
limited mileage policy that brings down costs for the occasional driver.
Although direct insurers are often the cheapest for the 'average' motorist,
this is not always the case. Insurance brokers gave seven out of the 21
lowest quotes, according to Which?
The tables show the 15 most competitive quotations obtained by the
Consumers' Association for a typical family car - in this case, a four-year
old Rover 820SE garaged overnight. The policy covers a 45-year-old manager
of a printing company (with a full licence and 25 years' driving experience)
and his wife. The driver has a full no-claims driving record, no accidents,
claims or convictions, and drives to work.
The Which? survey revealed huge premium variations, even for this standard
cover. While Swinton - a broker - quoted Pounds 219 for the lowest-risk
area, five insurers charged more than Pounds 500. Similarly, the cost of
cover at The Insurance Service for the highest-risk area was Pounds 395, but
premiums with the five dearest insurers topped Pounds 1,000. The Pearl
charged a staggering Pounds 2,431.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: What to look for in an insurer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of factors are taken into account in the calculation of car
insurance premiums, including the type of business the underwriting company
wants to attract. But while motorists cannot change their age, place of
residence or occupation, or even build a garage, simply to satisfy an
insurance company, there are ways to cut insurance costs.
Restrict the cover to named drivers, particularly if only you and your
spouse drive the car - this can cut costs by more than a third.
Fit a security system. But make sure the system you pick is approved by
insurers before it is installed.
Agree to a larger voluntary excess. Paying the first Pounds 100, Pounds 500
or more of every claim could reduce premiums considerably.
Settle for third party, fire and theft rather than a comprehensive policy if
you have a low-value car.
If you are a member of a union, or other professional or voluntary
organisation, or work for a large company, ask whether it has a group
discount scheme with a particular insurer.
Special deals can be found for many categories of driver. Different insurers
offer lower rates or tailor-made policies for women, the over 50s, public
sector employees, or drivers with a low annual mileage.
Cars more than 10 years old could be insured under a 'classic car' policy,
which is often cheaper but usually involves mileage limits.
If you have more than one car, some insurers will offer discounts when you
insure them all together, on the basis that you can only drive one car at a
time.
Motor insurance is sold in so many ways that drivers can find it difficult
to know where to look. Should they start by telephoning a direct insurer or
a centralised broker, or make their first port of call the traditional
high-street broker?
Wood says: 'Direct insurers pile it high and sell it cheap. But consumers
should look at the excesses; look at what is covered and not covered; and
ask a serious number of questions. Of course you should get a quotation from
a direct writer, but you should also ring an insurance broker.'
Price is not the only consideration, says Wood. 'If you have a claim, you
have an advocate with the insurance company if you have a broker. If you are
with a direct insurer you have to negotiate with the company by yourself.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Retail sales - Directors'
Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beginning of the week was marked by a high level of selling in blue chip
retailing companies. David Quarmby, one of the joint managing directors of J
Sainsbury, sold more than 35,000 shares at 393.5p, a total reduction of 27
per cent from his existing holding.
At Marks and Spencer, Andrew Stone sold more than 13,000 shares, a 15 per
cent reduction.
The largest sale of the week was not in a retailer, but at Granada Group.
Charles Allen, who heads up the television operations, sold 145,000 shares
at 537p. The company said the sale had been made to fund the purchase of a
house, but we note that the period of outperformance that the stock has
enjoyed over the past year, appears to be ending.
Nigel Alliance is already a substantial shareholder in N Brown Group, home
catalogue retailing company. His stake accounts for more than 12 per cent.
Last summer he sold a considerable amount of stock: 800,000 shares around
the 190p mark after adjusting for the one-for-one rights issue announced in
the middle of July. Since then he has been buying stock: 238,000 shares
around the 231p mark.
Johnston Group is a tightly-held stock in which family interests account for
almost 50 per cent of the equity. The last time Michael Johnston bought
stock was more than a year ago around the 114p mark. Since then, the
company's stock has outperformed the market by 70 per cent and analysts
forecast results moving from loss to profit this year.

First half results from British Petroleum, due on Tuesday, are expected to
show that the company remains on track to improve profitability and reduce
debt. Second quarter earnings on a replacement cost basis are predicted to
be in a range of Pounds 230m-Pounds 300m. BP should also benefit from the
recovery in crude oil prices, which have risen from a low last February of
around Dollars 12 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend to the present
level of more than Dollars 18.
Improvements in contract hire and coach distribution at T Cowie are expected
to lift interim pre-tax profits at the vehicle leasing and motor trading
group by about 27 per cent, due on Tuesday. The rise to nearly Pounds 20m is
likely to be fuelled mainly by the finance division, dominated by Cowie
Interleasing.
Opinions are divided on Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the conglomerate which
reports interims on Wednesday. The split follows the mixed trading statement
in May, which stressed a continuing malaise in the pig industry but a good
performance from UK timber. Forecasts range from Pounds 45m to Pounds 55m,
against Pounds 48.4m last time.
Wickes, DIY retailer, is forecast to announce a doubling of interim profits
on Wednesday from Pounds 4.1m to between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m before tax.
TI Group, the specialist engineering company, is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of up to Pounds 70m, against Pounds 62.8m, on Thursday. The
increase is likely to be dominated by Bundy, the automotive and
refrigeration tubing business.
On Monday Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, announces its
interim results. Analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profits range from Pounds
400m to Pounds 440m, well ahead of the Pounds 301m announced last year.
There is more disagreement about the interim dividend, with forecasts
varying from 4.6p to 5.6p, against 4.15p.
On Tuesday, National Westminster Bank is expected to report first-half
pre-tax profits of Pounds 600m-Pounds 727m. The lowest estimate for the
interim dividend puts it at 6.4p per share - the same as last year - the
highest is for 7.5p.

Pillar Property Investments is coming to the market valued at Pounds 169.7m.
Set up by British Aerospace and financial backers as a vulture fund to prey
on quality properties in 1991, it has Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan as
chairman and chief executive respectively.
Mould and Vaughan know about timing - they sold Arlington Securities, the
property company they founded, to BAe for Pounds 278m in 1989. It was this
expertise which led them to take the helm at Pillar.
A total of 60m shares at 150p have been placed with institutions, with 15m
subject to clawback for the public offer. This represents only a 5 per cent
discount to the group's net asset value. The price is full, reflecting the
quality of Pillar's Pounds 352m portfolio.
Applications must be in by August 5 and dealing will begin on August 15. BZW
underwrote the offer.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Water shares offer stable income on
tap - What the new price regime means for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water investors should be feeling rather pleased following the announcement
this week of a new price regime for the UK's 31 water and sewerage
companies.
While the industry regulator has set tougher price limits for the companies,
he has managed to leave enough leeway on average to give better returns to
shareholders than those expected just a week ago.
Ian Byatt, director-general of the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), has set
the price increases for the next 10 years at an average 1 percentage point
above inflation - a formula known as the K factor. This compares with an
average 5 per cent a year since privatisation in 1989.
The increase has been heavily weighted towards the first five years, with an
average K of 1.4 for 1995-2000 falling to 0.4 to 2005. This is when
companies will need the highest price rises to fund the vast capital
spending programme necessary to bring the industry up to EU standards.
Byatt's tougher approach on the second five years is certain to be the
subject of another review in 1999, rendering those figures almost
irrelevant.
While the price limits for 1995 to 2000 fall roughly in the middle of
analysts' expectations, Byatt's trick was to reduce substantially the
capital spending burden faced by water companies. Instead of the Pounds 16bn
which they had realistically expected - although this was not what they told
the regulator in their submissions - Byatt's negotiations with the
government brought the figure down to Pounds 14bn.
The reduction is due both to deferring some spending and squeezing budgets
for elements such as population growth.
Ofwat's pronouncements were greeted as tough but fair by nine of the 10
water and sewerage companies. The one exception is South West Water, which
has enjoyed a K factor of 11.5 for the last three years due to the vast
amount of spending it faces to clean up its extensive coastline.
To almost universal surprise, South West was given a K of just 1.5 for 1995
and 1 for 1996-2000 on the back of virtually halved capital expenditure. The
group, which argues Byatt has not allowed enough capital spending to fund
future obligations, is challenging his decision at the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Nevertheless, the other water companies were relieved. Indeed, companies
such as Thames Water - widely regarded to have been given more stringent
targets - were confident of achieving what they called 'satisfactory returns
to shareholders'.
Analysts define 'satisfactory' as dividend growth approaching an annual rate
of 4 per cent above inflation for the sector as a whole, against
expectations before the review of 3 per cent.
The price review's findings make the sector look much more attractive in
terms of returning a stable income. Some analysts question, however, whether
investors should get over-excited about the sector's prospects. 'You have to
ask whether it will out-perform the market over the next few months,' says
Mr Bill Dale, an analyst with S G Warburg Securities. While the equity
market will be driven by recovery, the risks such as increasing
environmental legislation continue to affect water shares.
The case for water investment becomes stronger when looking at individual
companies. Following the review, they can be placed in four categories:
The Winners - Anglian and Southern. Both have been given high K factors
relative to their capital spend. Anglian's K factor was in line with
estimates, but the capital spend has been sharply cut from a forecast Pounds
1.95bn to Pounds 1.4bn. Southern also comes up trumps with a K factor at the
top end of the range and authorised commitments at Pounds 1.2bn - bang in
the middle of expectations.
Second Place - North West, Severn Trent, Northumbrian, Welsh. North West,
identified as one of the most efficient companies on water and waste, is
already boasting about having beaten Byatt's efficiency target of 1 per cent
cost savings a year.
Severn Trent, which is not heavily exposed to the expensive coastal clean-up
legislation, got a decent K of 0.5, on squeezed capital expenditure of
Pounds 1.9bn. Northumbrian is confident it can live with the tough targets
it has been set, even though rated by Byatt as one of the least efficient on
water and sewerage services. Although Welsh was given a positive K of 0.5
against expectations of a negative number, it still has tough efficiency
targets. Nevertheless it has a strong balance sheet.
Rest of the pack - Wessex, Thames and Yorkshire. Wessex received a K roughly
in line with expectations at 1.5 and was slightly squeezed on spending with
capital expenditure of Pounds 500m. Yet increasingly the future of this
company will depend on its waste management business.
Thames and Yorkshire appear to have been given challenging targets.
Left behind - South West Water. It is pointless to consider the K of 0.5
given to South West until the MMC has a chance to examine Byatt's reasoning.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Action group enters fray - Knight
Williams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle lines are drawn between Knight Williams, one of the UK's largest
independent financial advisers, selling mainly to the retired, and its most
disgruntled customers, the Knight Williams Investors Action Group.
The field is also strewn with MPs, the Treasury, the Consumers' Association,
the Securities and Investments Board which is the chief regulator for
financial services, and Fimbra, the self-regulating body for independent
financial advisers.
What is it all about?
The MPs, who include Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, last week
tabled an all-party early day motion in the House of Commons. It read: 'This
house is concerned by the number of complaints received from constituents,
many of them retired people, who are dissatisfied at the service they have
received from Knight Williams which has resulted in constituents suffering
varying degrees of loss. It is also concerned about the apparent inability
of the Sib and Fimbra to bring full light to bear on the subject and urges
the government to institute a thorough inquiry into the whole matter.'
The action group has submitted an analysis of 125 complaints to the
Treasury.
What does KW say?
It has accused three of the MPs - John Gunnell, Sir Anthony Grant and Sir
Geoffrey Johnson Smith - of having vested interests in signing the early-day
motion, because of their links respectively with Yorkshire Fund managers,
Barclays Bank and Eagle Star. It says these are competitors which could view
KW as a 'potential acquisition'.
What is their response?
Eagle Star: 'The concept of being in competition with KW is a very fanciful
notion - we are chalk and cheese.' Barclays: 'We don't see ourselves as
competitors of KW and it is mischievous to suggest that.'
What are investors' complaints?
The action group is giving no details because it does not want KW to 'pick
people off one by one.' However, KW has been the subject of considerable
press criticism. Which?, the Consumer Association's monthly magazine, has
run case studies involving accusations of inappropriate investments,
'churning' - encouraging customers to sell their investments needlessly and
buy KW funds to earn the adviser commission - and of lack of independence.
Its target market, the elderly, is seen as very vulnerable to abuse.
Charges on its unit trusts are the highest in the industry with an initial
charge of 6.39 per cent and an annual charge of 2.5 per cent.
What is KW's reply?
It says some customers panicked and sold after world markets fell in the
aftermath of the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait but that those who stayed
with KW have more than made good their losses.
It also says that complaints are small compared to its customer base of
24,000; of the 218 Fimbra-registered complaints, it has been found at fault
in 21. However, Fimbra suggested that it strengthen its compliance function
with an appointment which had Fimbra's approval. KW recently appointed Colin
Pinnell, formerly head of legal services at Fimbra, to oversee its legal and
compliance department.
KW says its charges are not high when you compare them to the discretionary
portfolio management service of any broker. More than 80 per cent of its
customers are put into its funds.
I thought you said it was an IFA?
Under the current rules, an IFA (and many stockbrokers are IFAs) can run
in-house funds and advise their clients to invest in them. Fimbra is meant
to monitor any potential conflict of interest. KW, which used to pay its
advisers higher commission for selling KW funds than others, stopped this
last year and, since March, says it has put its 120 or so advisers on
salaries.
It says that since it gets other investment houses (including James Capel,
Gerrard Vivian Gray, Mercury, Lazard, Schroder and Baring), to manage the
funds in a way similar to broker bond funds, it fulfils its role as an IFA.
What are broker bonds?
With a broker bond fund, clients' money is invested in life insurance funds
and unit trusts. The idea is that the intermediary can switch cheaply
between companies to catch the best sectors.
The Sib nearly outlawed broker funds in 1990 because of a potential conflict
of interest for the intermediary, worries about investment performance and
double charging - the investor pays the fund manager and the intermediary.
Surely what matters in the end is investment performance?
Yes, but high annual charges eat into a greater proportion of a fund's
return. The table shows the performance of Knight Williams' largest fund,
Global Income and Growth, with about Pounds 300m. Its performance is not out
of line with the average broker life fund but it has been beaten by the FT-A
World Index and the average unit and investment trust (apart from over one
year, when KW beat the average unit trust). Over five years, a building
society investment would have proved more profitable.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Key to a cheap M-reg - Bethan Hutton
explains that you save money if you do not own your car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This August, record numbers of new cars are expected to be driven away from
showrooms by people who do not own them.
Britain is not about to suffer an upsurge of car crime. Many of this year's
M-reg cars will be acquired by consumers using personal contract purchase
(PCP) schemes, which allow you to drive off in a new car every two or three
years, without ever paying the entire cost.
PCP is the fastest-growing way of buying a new car. Ford introduced its
Options plan in 1990, and says it expects Options purchases to account for
more than half its sales within two years. All the big manufacturers have
their own versions, together with some finance houses which run schemes for
dealerships.
From September, Midland plans to operate the first independent PCP scheme
aimed at consumers. It will offer holders of Midland credit cards a
telephone-based scheme operated by its car finance subsidiary, Swan
National, which can be used to finance any make of car.
All PCP schemes work in roughly the same way:
Dealer and customer agree a price - for example, Pounds 13,581 for a
Vauxhall Cavalier 1.8 GLS.
Customer pays a deposit or trades in another car - eg 30 per cent deposit on
the Cavalier (Pounds 4,074) leaves a balance of Pounds 9,507.
Dealer works out a 'future value' - what the car is expected to be worth
second-hand at the end of the agreement, which can last between one and four
years. The Cavalier should have a residual value of Pounds 5,839 after two
years.
Customer makes monthly payments composed of interest on the whole balance,
plus repayments of the difference between the car's price (less deposit) and
the future value - Pounds 3,668 in the Cavalier's case. Payments are Pounds
214 a month for two years, at an APR of 9.7 per cent.
At the end of the agreement, the customer can choose to: pay the balance
(the 'future value'), and own the car outright; hand back the keys and walk
away, having, in effect, hired the car for a few years; or swap the car for
a new one, using any excess over the predicted future value as a deposit.
Most drivers take the last option.
The attraction of PCP is that monthly payments are lower than with a
straight loan or hire purchase, where you repay the entire cost of the car
over the term of the agreement.
If you want to use PCP to roll over to a new car every few years, it is
important to pick a car with a high resale value. With PCP, you pay for the
depreciation plus interest, never the residual value. Monthly payments could
be lower with a more expensive car which keeps its value well, rather than a
cheaper car which depreciates rapidly. Midland says it will be able to give
independent advice on precisely that.
The most important factor in the amount you pay is probably not the car's
price or its future value, but the interest rate.
Take the example of an identical Ford Mondeo GLX 1.8, bought using Ford's
own Options scheme, or Midland's new Carchoice. Ford estimates the
on-the-road price at Pounds 14,160, and the future value at Pounds 6,385
after two years. Midland's figures are a similar, Pounds 14,084 and Pounds
6,636 respectively.
But based on a 30 per cent deposit and mileage of 12,000 a year, the monthly
repayments work out very different, at Pounds 250 with the Options plan, and
Pounds 175 with Midland. This is mainly due to the different APRs: 15.8 per
cent with Ford, and 5.8 per cent with Midland. All the savings you bargain
so hard for can be wiped out by an extra few percentage points on the APR.
As the table illustrates, even among six of the best car loans available
from high-street names, the total repaid on a Pounds 5,000 loan can vary by
as much as Pounds 242. So finding the right finance deal can save you even
more money than finding the lowest-priced car.
PCP is not the right choice for everyone. It is usually available only on
new cars, or sometimes those up to two or three years old. If you want to
buy a car outright, it may not be convenient to have to pay a large lump sum
after two or three years. Agreed future values only apply if the car is in
good condition, and has kept within certain mileage limits - usually 6,000
to 12,000 miles a year.
At this time of year, banks and building societies trumpet their discounts
and offers on personal loans to attract car buyers. Do not ignore the
finance offered by car dealers. There are 0 per cent finance offers around,
though you usually need to make a 50 per cent deposit and pay the balance
over 12 months.
Neil Tomkin of Lombard North Central, a large finance house, says it is a
myth that buyers with cash from a personal loan have more bargaining power
to push down the price of a new car.
Dealers' margins have shrunk, leaving them less room for manoeuvre, but
Tomkin argues that buyers may actually get a better deal on a car if they
take the dealer's own credit. The dealer earns commission on the finance as
well as the car, and could possibly afford to trim the car's price a little
more.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets: Fretting over whether the price is right - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How can the shares of a small grocery chain such as William Low nearly
double in value within a fortnight? Easy: when Britain's biggest food
retailer, J. Sainsbury, decides to change the habits of a lifetime and enter
a bidding battle to prevent Tesco, its main rival, from snapping up the
struggling Scottish company.
Analysts fluently reel off reasons why the majors are keen to get their
hands on Wm Low: it offers a shortcut to a strong market position and
distribution network in Scotland, where it is increasingly difficult to
obtain planning permission for more stores.
Yet a fortnight ago these strategic assets were scarcely reflected in the
Dundee group's share price, which had languished as the market focused on
its shrinking sales and profit margins. The episode is a useful reminder
that markets must try to combine judgments of both underlying value and
short-term trading performance and outlook - and how inexact the results can
be.
The disparity between the current buoyancy of corporate results and
increasing concern over some fundamental aspects of the UK economy explains
the twitchy mood of the City, even although the FT-SE 100 index has now
bounced by 206 points from its June low point of 2877.
This week Imperial Chemical Industries increased its pre-tax profits by 40
per cent and the UK's largest chemicals company hailed 'the first tangible
signs of a widespread recovery in our worldwide markets.'
Lloyds Bank got the clearing banks' reporting season off to a solid start by
confirming a sharp drop in bad debt provisions, but subdued demand for loans
suggests customers will not forget the harsh lesson of recession in a hurry.
Even beleaguered BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group,
was able to increase profits in spite of the growing backlash against
smoking in the US.
An important cloud overhanging the equity market was dispelled on Thursday,
when the new price regime for the privatised water companies was revealed.
Although the controls - known as K-factors - limit future price increases to
1 percentage point a year above inflation, analysts quickly concluded that
most of the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies would be able to
maintain dividend increases of 3 or 4 percentage points above inflation.
However, the City's underlying nervousness had been demonstrated the
previous day, when the FT-SE 100 shed 34.9 points to drop back through the
3,100 mark. The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial
trends survey showed that improving exports were contributing to the fastest
rise in order books for almost six years. But analysts were more concerned
by indications that UK interest rates might have to be tightened sooner
rather than later.
Inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector picked up over the
quarter, and relatively weak investment intentions fuelled fears that
bottlenecks are developing. As the chart shows, capacity utilisation rates
showed a further increase in July - and are already running well above their
long-run average.
The percentage balance of firms expecting to increase their expenditure on
plant and machinery over the next 12 months was plus 6 per cent in July,
compared with plus 4 per cent in April, so the capacity shortfall will not
be quickly made good.
The broker USB warns: 'This suggests that manufacturing industry has a
woefully inadequate capital base, which could act as a severe constraint on
future output growth. If demand growth remains strong, it is likely to fuel
rising inflationary pressures and a burgeoning current account deficit.'
The CBI survey showed that most British companies have not adjusted their
investment criteria for low inflation and interest rates, in spite of
warnings from the government that this is stifling investment. Many
companies still demand that investment projects should either yield a rate
of return above 20 per cent, or pay back the investment within three years.
Companies also assume the government will not deliver its inflation promise.
Their average prediction for inflation when considering investment projects
is 5 per cent, compared with the government's target of bringing it below
2.5 per cent by the end of the parliament.
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, has cited the expectation of
higher inflation as one factor that would call for tighter monetary policy.
The market again took fright yesterday afternoon, when the Bank sold
short-term Treasury bills at rates of up to 5.75 per cent - half a
percentage point above the level of base rates. Some traders took this as a
signal that UK interest rates were about to rise and the FT-SE 100 at one
point had shed 37.5 points. It recovered to close just 13.3 points down on
the day, as analysts concluded that the Bank had probably not been trying to
send any such signal.
However, it seems clear that concern over the timing and impact of the next
rise in interest rates will continue to limit the pace of the market's
advance - even if companies continue to report solid increases in profits
and dividends.
Next week's quarterly inflation bulletin is likely to emphasise the Bank's
continuing hard line on monetary policy.
Meanwhile, this weekend one can only envy the shareholders of Wm Low, who
wait to see which suitor will stuff most cash into their pockets. Investors
in Sainsbury, Tesco and the other large food chains are likely to be less
sanguine. The enthusiasm with which this battle has been joined suggests
that even the UK's most successful food retailers now face a much tougher
and more competitive future.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: ICI finds the right chemistry -
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ronnie Hampel, Imperial Chemical Industries' cheery chief executive, had
rather more spring in his step than usual on Thursday.
After four years of upheaval involving a threatened takeover bid,
rationalisation and restructuring, and the largest demerger in UK corporate
history, Hampel could argue ICI was back on course. Pre-tax profits were up
40 per cent.
Hampel was actually rather surprised by the results. 'If you'd asked me if
40 per cent was achievable even three months ago I would have said no,' he
confessed.
He said he had been surprised by the strong sales growth and the speed
rationalisation had saved the group money.
The spectacular sales growth in the second quarter had caught him on the
hop, he admitted. The increase showed 'the first tangible signs of a
widespread recovery in our worldwide markets. This is an increasingly robust
performance from all our businesses,' he said.
Group turnover was up an impressive 9 per cent. Continental European sales
increased 10 per cent, compared with a flat first quarter, while UK sales
rose 13 per cent.
The sales recovery should help ICI's profits. The company is highly geared.
Once it has covered its high fixed costs, any additional revenue should
quickly drop to the bottom-line.
But Hampel was cautious. Some trends were sustainable, he admitted. Prices
of PVC and methanol were rising and there were clear signs of recovery
around the globe.
'There's been an upturn, but not as strong as might be deduced from our
figures,' he stressed.
There were plenty of one-off events, he explained. The UK fertilisers
business, long a drain on ICI's profits, was breaking even thanks to a
collapse in Russian exports. That was unlikely to continue, he said.
Sales on the Continent had risen so fast, not because of a marked upturn,
but because US companies had been exporting less, allowing ICI to gain
market share. Some customers had been stocking up to avoid price increases.
And much of the group's sales growth was thanks to increased capacity in its
core areas.
'The present rate of growth is clearly unsustainable,' he concluded.
In addition, the cost-cutting programme, which contributed about half of the
40 per cent rise of profits, is beginning to run out of steam.
Hampel estimated that the programme had saved more than Pounds 210m during
the first half, and that the savings target of Pounds 490m next year was
within reach, he said. Indeed, cost-cutting had been achieved faster than
expected, said Hampel. This might well have been the consequence of the
demerger which had allowed managers to focus more clearly. ICI was now
looking a far tighter ship.
The group would continue to look for savings, said Hampel. But analysts
wonder how much more can go.
Earnings growth will increasingly have to be driven by the recovery and
additional investments. The company is betting on areas where it believes it
has a technological edge, such as CFC-substitutes and PET and PTA, materials
for plastic bottles and polyester. It is also betting on Asia-Pacific where
last year, for the first time ever, the group invested more than in the UK.
Meanwhile, the group continues to move away from commodity petrochemicals.
Hampel repeated his view that ICI would never again build an ethylene plant,
and would consider offers for a stake of the Teesside plant, Europe's
largest ethylene plant, and fourth most efficient. The group was still
looking at the possibility of selling the joint-venture PVC business.
ICI's strategy looks sound. Its focus since the demerger is undoubtedly
tighter. The outlook seems good. The problem for investors is that ICI's
shares have outperformed the London stock market by 13 per cent since the
beginning of the year. Those holding the shares should hang on. Those
without have, for moment, missed the boat.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets: Inventories fever disperses doldrums - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the middle of the summer doldrums it usually requires something important
for Wall Street traders to suddenly stop talking about the exciting issues
of the day, which this week were - in no particular order - the impending
baseball strike, the OJ Simpson case, and the state of Cindy Crawford's
marriage.
It happened yesterday, however, and few could have guessed what it would be
that so excited the traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and
in the dealing rooms around Wall Street. Was it a presidential scandal? No.
An invasion of Haiti? Wrong. A bank collapse? Think again.
The subject of everyone's discussions on Wall Street yesterday was
inventories. Or, as the economics dictionary describes them: 'stocks of raw
materials, work in progress and finished goods.' Exciting, isn't it?
While inventories do not normally make pulses race. Wall Street economists
had palpitations yesterday when the second quarter economic growth figures
were released. The data showed a 3.7 per cent rise in gross domestic product
between April and June, a figure that was at the bottom end of market
expectations.
The real story, however, was in the inventories data. According to the
Commerce Department, the value of inventories jumped Dollars 27.9bn to
Dollars 58.5bn, the biggest increase in three years.
The rise was so large that it accounted for 2.2 percentage points of the 3.7
per cent gain in GDP. In other words, economic growth rose handsomely in the
second quarter less because demand for goods climbed, but more because
companies bought materials that never left the factory floor or produced
goods that never left the shelves. In fact, demand growth was relatively
weak - final sales of domestic product rose only 1.5 per cent in the
quarter.
A big build-up of inventories usually means one of two things. Either, the
build-up was voluntary as companies produced more goods to meet an
anticipated peak in demand. Or, it was involuntary as companies were left
with an unexpectedly large amount of unsold goods because demand weakened.
If it was the former, then it suggests that the economy will continue to
grow strongly. If it was the latter, then it suggests the economy is slowing
down, probably because of the recent rise in interest rates.
Which of the two factors were at work was the question everyone was asking
on Wall Street. Elias Bikhazi, an economist at Deutsche Bank, asked: 'Does
it constitute an overhang for the second half?' John Ryding senior economist
at Bear Stearns, said: 'The question is, were the inventory accumulations
unwanted?' And Ken Maryland of Society National Bank commented: 'I've got to
believe in some quarters it was unwelcome.'
The bond market, typically, wasted little time worrying about what the
answer might be. It decided that inventories rose in the second quarter
because demand had slowed unexpectedly. This could only be good news for
investors in fixed-income securities, who fear that rising economic growth
will push up inflation, which undermines the value of their investments.
The rush to buy bonds in the wake of this calculation lifted the 30-year
government bond almost one and a half points during the morning, and pushed
the yield - a key determinant of long-term interest rates - down from 7.55
per cent to 7.41 per cent.
Share prices rallied along with bonds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbing 30 points as equity investors bet that the apparent slowdown in
economic growth indicated by the jump in inventories would dissuade the
Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again. The Fed's open market
committee is due to meet on August 16, and most economists were thinking
this week that it would vote to raise rates one more time. The inventories
data, however, have given the economists cause to think again.
Yet, not everyone on Wall Street was convinced that the rise in inventories
was good news for bonds and stocks. A few discordant voices pointed out that
the bulk of the rise in inventories was at the wholesale trade level, which
is largely imported products.
'That's a sign that companies are buying goods ahead of price increases,'
explained Mike Strauss, an economist at Yamaichi International. In other
words, inventories rose not because of slower domestic demand, but because
US companies were stockpiling materials and goods produced abroad before
prices went up.
Strauss, however, was in a minority. For most on Wall Street, inventories
were up because demand was down. This suggested interest rates probably
would not go up, so bond yields should go down, and stocks up.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets: Water: half full or half empty? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's spurt of relief in water company shares prompts two thoughts.
First, it is a classic example of investors being more worried by
anticipation of bad news than by the news itself. Secondly, many water
shares still look sound long term value.
Investors were - rightly - afraid that this week's new price caps for water
companies (see page IV) would make it harder for the companies to continue
paying out such munificent dividends. Brokers' analysts had done lots of
pretty accurate sums about what regulator Ian Byatt would decide. But
investors still held off until they knew for sure. Once the bogey could be
viewed in plain daylight, it looked far less frightening.
Speculators who bought ahead of the review will generally have done well -
but not if they bought South West, which fell because its price cap was
tougher than expected. Moral, if you are going to speculate, go for a spread
of shares - unless you are sure of your ground.
What matters to more serious investors is the outlook for water shares now.
The sector dividend yield is more than 5.1 per cent compared with 3.8 per
cent for the market. Yesterday many investors were arguing that most of the
shares (but not the luckless South West) had a bit further to go short term
 -although prices were racing ahead as they talked. Ten per cent is probably
the limit. But long term prospects make them look a solid investment.
Some analysts reckon the water companies have scope to increase dividends by
over 4 per cent (inflation-adjusted) a year over the next five years. And
the bigger increases may come through in the early years. Not bad, given the
lack of commercial risk.
Laterally minded investors also bought regional electricity shares after the
water report. That is too simplistic. There may be a case for electricity
shares, but do not base it on water.
The Great British Public is thoroughly confused by the Great British
Financial services industry. People are worried that they do not understand
enough about more complicated products such as personal pensions to make an
intelligent choice themselves. They think it vital that a financial adviser
should be strictly independent, but very hard to find such independent
advice.
These are some of the findings from the National Consumer Council's new MORI
survey into what people think of personal financial services. The Council
describes the lack of consumer confidence as 'worrying'. But in many ways it
is rather encouraging.
For the public is right to be puzzled by many of the 'products' being sold.
It is also right to be suspicious of many of the people selling those
products.
Consumers have read all the stories about mis-selling of personal pensions,
abysmal life insurance surrender values, and ignorant salesmen. And they
understand that any salesman who is paid mainly or exclusively by commission
must find it hard to give genuinely independent advice.
Hence their worry. But hence also the first stirrings of change in a
minority of life insurance companies. Only this week Norwich Union switched
its sales agents from commission to salaries.
If commission is the root of all evil, do not waste time persuading your
sales staff to rise above it - just remove the temptation.
Costs and commissions are investors' foes. Here is another example of costs
at work.
Pension top-ups, cosily known as additional voluntary contributions (AVCs),
may be a good idea, but you need to watch what you are contributing to.
A new survey from actuaries Watsons* confirms one longstanding worry
(Weekend FT, April 9, page III). If you opt for a free-standing AVC you may
well get a worse result than if you take what your employer offers. For
charges are likely to be up to twice as high.
Additional contributions seldom go into the main pension scheme: they are
run separately. All companies with standard pension schemes have to offer an
AVC, and most employers mop up the charges of the scheme. So assuming the
underlying investments produce the same stockmarket performance in both
cases, the in-house AVC is bound to give a better result.
That does not, though, mean that you should opt for a company AVC
regardless. It depends what the company is offering. Some merely provide
building society linked schemes - which may suit people very close to
retirement, but not those with several years to go.
But if your employer offers a good with-profit or unit linked scheme run by
a financial company with a good record, that will probably be a better
choice than a free standing scheme.
As Watsons suggests, the best of all worlds is an employer which offers its
employees a choice of AVCs.
Advertising is an alternative scapegoat for financial upsets. How about a
switch to the new Russian system? Businesses can only advertise actual
dividend and interest rates paid in the past. Now there is a creative
challenge.

<TEXT>
Norwich Union, the big UK insurer, has switched its life and pensions sales
agents from commission to salaries. In March the insurer announced that it
was suspending its entire sales force for a month for retraining, after the
life industry's regulator identified breakdowns in management control.
Instead of being paid by commission on the policies they sell, sales agents
will receive a basic annual salary of Pounds 12,000 as well as commission.
The number of branch offices is to be cut from 25 to 13.

Fewer homebuyers were in arrears with their mortgages at the end of June
than six months earlier: 142,230 were more than 12 months behind with
payments, compared with 151,810 at the end of 1993. Shorter-term arrears
also showed an improvement.
But lenders warned that rumoured government plans to cut back income support
payments to unemployed homeowners could lead to a resurgence of payment

FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Best June on record for unit trust
sales - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts had their best June on record, with net sales of Pounds 1.1bn -
50 per cent up on Pounds 726m in May. The June figure was almost 80 per cent
higher than that for June last year, when net sales totalled Pounds 610m.
Less than half the net sales last month were to the retail sector - the
lowest proportion so far this year - with the rest bought by institutions,
the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said.
The best-selling sectors among retail investors were UK growth, followed by
UK equity income and international growth. Net sales of unit-trust personal
equity plans were Pounds 1.11bn for the second quarter, down from Pounds
1.55bn for the first quarter, which is the traditionally busy
end-of-tax-year sales period.

FT  30 JUL 94 / England: the west's one-party state: Over the last century
the Tories have ruled Britain longer than the Communists ruled Russia.
Andrew Adonis explains how they did it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be interesting to be the last of the Conservatives. I foresee that
will be our fate.
Such was the private prediction of Britain's longest-serving, and arguably
most successful, Conservative leader of the past century. It was not
Margaret Thatcher but the Marquess of Salisbury, prime minister for 13 years
at the zenith of Victorian Britain's imperial power between 1885 and 1902.
No modern Tory leader, least of all Baroness Thatcher, would express such
forebodings, even in private. Not in their gloomiest moods contemplating
opposition to a Blair Labour government do Tories fear for the annihilation
of their party. The 'Canadian scenario' - the ruling Conservatives were
reduced to just two seats in last year's Canadian general election - is
nothing but a party game in Britain (name the two Tory MPs you would like to
see survive).
The reason for this goes to the heart of contemporary English culture and
politics. Since Lord Salisbury's day the Tories have, above all, been the
voice of the English middle class. As that class has grown, and its values
and aspirations permeated English society at large, the strength and inner
self-confidence of the Tories has increased.
Not that the Tories were previously weak. The Conservative party is the
oldest and most successful political party in any western democracy. It has
governed Britain for 76 of the 110 years since the creation of the mass
electorate in 1884 - longer than the Communists ruled Russia, but with the
inconvenience of 29 free elections in between.
Why, then, do the Tories appear so adrift? John Major's failings and
survival prospects have preoccupied the Westminster world since the day he
succeeded Thatcher - a grey man leading a grey cabinet, dominated by
uninspiring political managers whose driving ambition is to stay in office.
Some believe that the Tory malaise goes far deeper. In a recent pamphlet,
John Gray, the political philosopher, argues that British Conservatism has
committed suicide on the altar of free market economics. 'Traditional
conservatism no longer exists in Britain,' he claims. 'It is dead - killed
off by the radical market liberalism which the Tories adopted in the late
1970s, and which has governed the policies of successive Conservative
governments since that time.'
The idea is appealing. Insofar as 'Majorism' represents a programme, it is
the dregs of Thatcherism - taking privatisation to lengths Thatcher dared
not go (the railways and the Post Office), and advancing remorselessly with
public sector reforms - notably in health and education - launched in the
mid-1980s.
However, Gray is on shaky ground in arguing that modern Toryism is
'thoroughly uncongenial to the tolerant and sceptical temper of the British
electorate,' and that the Conservatives are bound to reap the electoral
whirlwind. The likelihood of a Tory defeat is the wisdom of the political
establishment, whose horizons rarely extend beyond the latest opinion poll,
by-election or leadership change. But an historical perspective puts the
Tories' present predicament in a different frame.
In the first place, there is no such thing as the 'British electorate'. For
much of the last century Scotland, Wales and (Northern) Ireland have refused
to conform to the English pattern. Scotland and Wales have been markedly
less Tory than England. Until the inter-war years their professional
classes, never fully anglicised and more collectivist-minded, looked mainly
to the Liberals for political careers. Since, the same impulses have led
them to Labour.
The Tories are the English National Party. 'My politics are described by one
word, and that word is ENGLAND,' Disraeli told his electors in 1832. Norman
Tebbit's Euro-sceptics could not put it better today. 'That word' has been
nothing but a boon to the Tories. Although it rarely speaks its name,
English nationalism is as potent a political force as its more naked
counterparts on mainland Europe, and England accounts for four-fifths of the
seats in the House of Commons.
Fighting the separatist tendencies of the other parties has always been a
prime source of Tory ideology and morale, from Gladstone's Irish Home Rule
plans of the 1880s to successive schemes for Scottish and Welsh devolution
supported by Liberals, Labour and Nationalists in recent decades.
For the Conservatives it was only a short step to fighting the Brussels
bureaucrats - or, at any rate, refusing to give in to them as much as the
other parties. It is potentially just as popular a cause in England.
Nationalism inevitably creates problems of government. Salisbury had to
govern Parnell's Ireland without too much repression. John Major cannot
afford total isolation in Brussels - and when Baroness Thatcher achieved
that, she had to go. Yet Tories have ever been masters at tempering visceral
campaign rhetoric with compromise in office.
Moreover, Tory England is expanding England. The last 30 years have seen a
sharp contraction in the manual working class, a population shift to the
home counties, and an inexorable rise in home ownership.
The 'salariat' comprised 18 per cent of the UK electorate in 1964; it now
extends to about a third (more in England), with the proportion of home
owners up from about one-third to two-thirds (ditto). Over the same period
the 'petty bourgeoisie' of small shopkeepers and other self-employed
tradespeople, consistently the most pro-Tory of social groups, has remained
a solid 10 per cent of the electorate.
England now has more actors than miners, and each parliamentary boundary
review sees a redistribution of seats from the cities to the suburbs.
The Tories have long been the party of home-owning suburbans. Lord Salisbury
called it 'villa Toryism,' and favoured single-member parliamentary seats as
the best means of isolating it from less reliable - but often still pro-Tory
 -urban working-class districts. Most of today's English electorate are
villa Tories in lifestyle and aspirations.
Villa Tories do not invariably vote Tory. In mid-term local and European
elections they have always been liable to defect en masse - particularly, in
southern England, to the various incarnations of the Liberal party. Since
the mid-1970s the Liberal Democrats, as they have become, have garnered a
sizeable vote, appealing particularly to non-metropolitan manual workers and
public-sector professionals anxious for more public spending. Tony Blair's
Labour party will mine the same seam.
It is important, however, to understand the strength of the Tory bedrock.
The Conservatives have never polled less than 40 per cent of the English
vote in a general election. Exclude the inner cities, and at the last
election they took more than half the vote across England. Under a similar
electoral system to the UK's, France's ruling Gaullists triumphed in last
year's French election with the support of a mere 28 per cent of the
electorate.
Furthermore, the non-Tory vote is deeply divided - and divided most of all
on the issue of opposing the Conservatives. Since the 1950s about half the
Liberal vote has typically been second preference Tory: the rise of the
Liberals in the last 20 years signifies, above all, a decline of support for
Labour among the English electorate.
True, Liberal MPs and activists have typically been closer to Labour than
the Tories, but knowing their electorate to be more ambivalent they have
been wary of saying so. Even now, with policy divisions between Liberal
Democrats and Labour infinitesimally small, the two parties glare at each
other across a raised drawbridge.
What, then, of Gray's notion that under Thatcher the Tories converted to a
radical variant of market liberalism profoundly offensive to the English
middle class?
The Conservatives have, in fact, long been the party of market liberalism.
Back in the late 18th century William Pitt's Tory party was committed -
until deflected by the wars against revolutionary France - to tax cuts and
an assault on tariffs and budget deficits.
The early 19th century saw a struggle between the free market and the
landlord consciences of the party. It was resolved in favour of the free
marketeers by Sir Robert Peel's repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. This
established the Tories' commitment to minimum levels of taxation and
economic intervention consistent with the winning of wars and elections,
although trade protectionism continued to be an issue.
Disraeli's 'one nation' rhetoric in the 1870s was a smokescreen for a social
policy consisting of two essential and enduring principles: the
identification of the Tories as the party of all property-owners, not just
landlords; and the trumping of whichever social reforms - enacted or likely
 -of the party's Labour or Liberal opponents were judged necessary for
electoral success.
Under Salisbury that meant upholding Gladstone's extension of the franchise.
Under Stanley Baldwin, in the inter-war years, it meant accepting a social
safety net. After the second world war it meant preserving the welfare
state.
What happened in the 1980s was not a conversion to market liberalism, but a
social change within the Tory elite which strengthened its startling
discovery that the party had become Britain's natural governing force. A new
self-confidence, bolstered by Thatcher's leadership, led the party to
espouse its market liberalism more forcefully than it had done for decades.
The social transformation was dramatic. In 1939, the Tory party's 400 MPs
included just 10 solicitors, eight accountants and four teachers. 'When the
call came to me to form a government,' recalled Baldwin of his first
government in 1923, 'one of my first thoughts was that it should be a
government of which Harrow should not be ashamed.'
Tory cabinets were stuffed with aristocrats and their close relations as
late as Harold Macmillan's premiership in the early 1960s. Macmillan's
successor was the 14th Earl of Home, and most of the old brigade survived
under his successor, Edward Heath.
Neither Thatcher (Grantham High) nor Major (Rutlish Grammar) were - or are -
much concerned at the shame of Harrow and Eton. Under Thatcher, the sons of
teachers, doctors, mainstream professionals and small tradesmen largely
replaced the landowners, barristers and wealthy businessmen on the Tory
benches in the House of Commons, and followed them into government. The
result is a Tory elite more representative of its electorate than ever in
the party's history. Major is its apotheosis.
For all its new-found radicalism, the new Tory elite has been wary of
reining back the public sector. Privatisation and the curbing of trade
unions, policies popular or at least inoffensive to middle England, have
been the most radical changes of the last decade. By contrast, spending on
state benefits, education and health services has risen broadly in line with
the expectations of the Tory middle classes.
Kenneth Clarke (Nottingham High School, Cambridge University), the
archetypal modern Tory MP, addressed four-square the question of the middle
classes and public spending in a recent lecture which brilliantly exhibited
the sensitivity of the modern Tory antenna. 'It is idle to think that middle
England does not sometimes feel worried,' he declared. 'Providing a sense of
security in an uncertain and changing world has nothing to do with
feathering middle England' - which, of course, is just what middle England
likes to think. Indeed, the greatest 1980s catastrophe - the poll tax -
occurred because Thatcher was too mindful of the raw prejudices of middle
England's home-owning ratepayers.
Clarke put his finger on the nub of Tory vulnerability in the next decade -
English middle-class insecurity in the face of employment uncertainties and
flat or falling house prices.
There is nothing new in such middle-class anguish, as a brief glance at
Agatha Christie's detective novels will confirm. In the past, however,
middle England looked to the Tories as a guardian from insecurity - in
particular from the evils, real and imagined, of Liberal and Labour
governments. Now, middle England appears to be laying the blame for its
insecurity at the feet of a Tory government. Just possibly, if the angst
persists, a new model Labour party renouncing redistributive socialism and
led by an impeccable public schoolboy could become the repository of middle
English anguish in a general election.
It is a paradox that successful Conservative parties are rarely conservative
in practice, since without a capacity to adapt to change they could never
succeed for long in government. Their conservatism lies in their rhetoric
and the emotional loyalties they inspire. For summer reading, Tony Blair
could do worse than a biography and collected speeches of Lord Salisbury.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Long View: Rates on the turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is now almost six months since UK short-term interest rates were
controversially cut, amid disagreement between the Treasury and the Bank of
England and in the immediate wake of the initial tightening of dollar rates
by the US Federal Reserve.
A good deal of economic recovery and growth has flowed under the bridge
since, making an early rise in UK rates look much more likely, although
there was only confusion in the money markets yesterday afternoon as the
Bank apparently tried to distance itself from a sudden rise in Treasury bill
rates.
Any official rise confirmed at the beginning of next week - maybe of half a
percentage point - would be the first after 15 consecutive cuts since the
peak of the last interest rate cycle was reached at 15 per cent in 1989. No
acceleration of inflation is yet visible: the latest underlying rate is no
more than 2.4 per cent, and the upward pressures, when they arrive, are
likely to prove modest. However, inflation can only be beaten from the
front, not in arrears.
The British economy is now growing quite fast - by 3.3 per cent in the
second quarter, which on past form for this stage of the economic cycle is
likely to be an underestimate by the official statisticians. In such a
context this week's quarterly industrial trends survey from the CBI for July
upset the markets by highlighting the ingrained inflationary bias in
Britain's industrial economy. Capacity utilisation is already at
historically high levels; investment intentions are quite subdued.
Britain's manufacturing industry is today dominated by dogged survivors.
Most of the expansionists and optimists went out of business years ago. The
rest have cut capacity and slashed costs and have waited impatiently in
their trenches for a revival in demand. They now plan to raise their prices
and boost their profits - at least, that is the intention of a significant
balance of companies surveyed by the CBI. The same message comes from a
separate survey, showing a sharp rise in the purchasing managers' price
index for July. There is little obvious sign of companies that intend to
increase output and cut prices - outside Wapping, anyway.
If this price-based commercial strategy works it will prove inflationary. A
price-led recovery would surely drag up pay, currently growing at a fairly
modest 3 3/4 per cent. Profits are already reaching a 30-year high as a
proportion of national income. More likely, the strategy will not work but
will lead straight to a more potent problem - a balance of payments crisis.
This is because in an open economy foreign-made imports which are not having
their prices raised will increase their market share - and anyway, domestic
supply will prove inadequate.
A strong cyclical surge in profits is built into the expectations of the
stock market. The renewed weakness of the gilt-edged market this week, when
the Bank of England's 300th birthday celebrations on Wednesday were slightly
dampened by the disappointing response to that day's gilt auction, has
undermined the valuation of equities.
For instance, the yield ratio between long-dated gilts and equities has
widened to nearly 2.3, which is looking stretched. Moreover the real yield
gap between equities and index-linked gilts, which normally wobbles around a
positive 0.5 per cent, is slightly negative. The last time this happened was
in 1987, when the reverse gap reached a full percentage point shortly before
the stock market crashed in October that year.
In early 1987 expectations of growth in profits and dividends were very high
 -justifiably. Dividends grew by 15 per cent that year. Even so, the bubble
of overvaluation soon burst. This time analysts appear to be expecting
profits growth of at least 15 per cent both this year and next, with
year-on-year dividend growth rising from its current 7 per cent to maybe 9
per cent - a healthy advance in real terms, assuming inflation stays low. So
looking two years ahead the All-Share Index could be yielding a prospective
4.5 per cent, in which case the challenge of index-linked gilts returning
3.9 per cent real, as they now do, would look quite weak.
But the tension between the inflationary enthusiasm of the securities
markets and the anti-inflationary zeal of the authorities is becoming
charged. Implied inflation in the gilt market is now more than 4 1/2 per
cent. This week the Bank of England offered straight 16-year fixed-coupon
paper, which was what the market was supposedly waiting for. But the issue
barely got away and bidders were immediately showing a 1.5 per cent loss.
One problem may be a shortage of domestic buying power, at a time when the
foreigners are sitting on their hands. Life assurance companies, the biggest
domestic buyers of gilts, have seen their new business fall away - by 20 per
cent in the first half for the Prudential, by 17 per cent for Legal &amp;
General. Pension funds have very little cash flow, and can only buy gilts by
selling equities.
But the more fundamental point is that this is a bad time in the cycle for
bonds. When equity dividend expectations are so high a yield of even 8 1/2
per cent-plus on gilts seems tame. The market seems quickly to have
forgotten the scare over Stephen Dorrell and his hints at extra taxes on
dividends; Dorrell has anyway been reshuffled to a safe distance from the
Treasury.
At some point, perhaps imminently, the Bank of England may have to seize the
initiative and put short-term rates up. It has to cool down economic growth
to a pace - under 3 per cent - which the capacity-constrained UK economy can
handle. It will have to try to convince industry - though this will take
years - that rapid, sustainable growth can only come through raising
productivity and building more factories, not from jacking up margins.
The UK equity market, however, has jumped on to a time loop back to the
1980s, and is thoroughly enjoying the ride. But that time machine could
generate higher interest rates too.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Craxi sentenced to 8 1/2 years for bank fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The former Socialist premier Bettino Craxi was sentenced to 8 1/2 years in
jail for fraudulent bankruptcy in the 1982 collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano.
A similar sentence was handed out to Claudio Martelli, former Socialist
justice minister and one-time heir to Mr Craxi. Since February Mr Craxi has
been living at his seaside villa in Tunisia. He still has the right to
appeal.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Berlusconi proposes special body to prevent conflicts of
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday announced the creation of a special
commission to distance his business interests in the Fininvest media empire
from his role as Italian prime minister.
But the decision was taken without direct consultation with President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro, the president's office said last night.
It came just after Mr Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, surrendered to
anti-corruption magistrates in Milan to answer charges of paying bribes to
members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police.
Mr Berlusconi's move, designed to avoid an increasingly damaging conflict of
interest that has undermined the credibility of his government, was greeted
with cautious relief by the financial markets. The lira strengthened
marginally and rose above L1,000 to the D-Mark.
Outlining his initiative, a grim-faced Mr Berlusconi implicitly admitted he
had underestimated the problems created by his ownership of Fininvest.
Supporters and opponents agreed he had bought some breathing space for his
embattled government. But President Scalfaro's stance, indicating he would
reserve his judgment until he had seen Mr Berlusconi's proposal, created
some uncertainty about how the proposal could be made into law.
Under Mr Berlusconi's plan, Mr Scalfaro - in conjunction with the speakers
of the two houses of parliament - will nominate a five-person special
commission. The commission will include the head of the media watchdog body
and the chairman of the anti-trust commission.
The new authority will monitor all potential conflicts of interest that
might affect government business and the affairs of the Fininvest group,
Italy's second-largest private holding with turnover of L11,600bn (Pounds
4.8bn) and net debts of L3,800bn in 1993.
The commission will supervise the activities of an administrator, appointed
by Mr Berlusconi, whose task will be to look after the prime minister's
proprietary interests in Fininvest.
Last night, Mr Paolo Berlusconi's lawyers were quoted by Ansa, the national
news agency, as saying their client had admitted paying L330m to the Guardia
di Finanza over inspections of the balance sheets of three Fininvest
companies.

FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Food retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Things have reached a pretty pass in the UK grocery industry when the two
biggest chains believe the best means of expanding is to scrap over a small
Scottish retailer such as William Low. But that battle may yet be seen as
the last hurrah of industry consolidation heralding a more mature era.
Scotland is the last area of the country to be carved up. It is significant
that both bidders highlight the need to recycle rather than add capacity.
All superstore groups are scaling back their once manic opening programmes -
although that partly reflects a stricter planning regime. The average cost
of superstores has fallen. The big groups are depreciating their assets more
prudently, providing greater comfort about the quality of future earnings.
The superstore chains have stamped their authority on the market by trimming
prices - albeit at a cost to their gross margins. Diversification plans are
developing in product ranges, geographical areas and store formats. Add the
accelerating economic recovery and it is easy to understand why the sector
has outperformed by 12 per cent over the past three months.
But the dawn of that new era may prove false. Asda and Gateway, which
started the pricing turbulence last year, may now be appreciating the
relative price stability. But Kwik Save could prove the next disruptive
force. Squeezed between the hard discounters and superstores, it may be
tempted to give deep price cuts another go.

FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Housing market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong recovery in the UK economy has barely touched the housing market.
The prospect of a turn in the interest rate cycle must raise doubts among
householders about whether it ever will. Although a small rise in short-term
rates would not much affect the cost of mortgage borrowing, it would damage
consumer confidence. Next week's house price figures from the Halifax and
Nationwide building societies are unlikely to be encouraging.
This is curious. On various affordability indices, houses are 'cheaper' than
for many years. Demographics suggest there should also be plenty of eager
first-time buyers. But several factors are deadening the market. Real income
growth has been dented by tax rises. The rise in long bond yields has
already pushed up the costs of fixed-rate mortgages to new borrowers by
about 2 1/2 percentage points. More houseowners may have been sprung from
the negative equity trap but they still have no equity from which to gear up
and climb the housing ladder. Mortgage repossessions have fallen sharply
from their peak but are still running at a historically high level.
But maybe the real culprit is the government. In 1975 it was generous enough
to pay 40 per cent of all mortgage interest payments. Last year that figure
had dropped to 10 per cent. That other fuel of house market prices -
negative real interest rates - has also been eliminated. Such economic
virtue is, of course, commendable. But it has a price.

FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However hard it tries, Lloyds Bank seems to find it difficult to shake off
the image of producing high returns but limited prospect of organic growth.
The bank says it is starting to see faint signs of higher volume, but its
first half presented a familiar picture. Though operating income before
provisions rose, this largely reflected continuing tight control over costs
and the reinvestment of retained earnings, which boosted interest income.
The loan book was slightly lower than a year ago. Lloyds must ask itself how
this poor underlying picture squares with its net return on shareholders'
funds of 22 per cent.
The bank's answer for the time being is that it would be wrong to sacrifice
return unless it was sure higher business volume would compensate for loss
of margin. In other words Sir Brian Pitman, its chief executive, is not
about to start the price war many observers of UK banking fear. Whether his
competitors will let him go on reaping such high returns is another matter.
The most dangerous time will be when loan demand picks up, making
competition for market share more worthwhile.
It would be better for Lloyds if Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were in the bag
before this happened. C&amp;G's low-cost operation will provide a sure defence
against the price-cutters. Lloyds had nothing new to say on C&amp;G yesterday.
But if the bid process falters, its shares would surely fall much further
than the 3 per cent witnessed after its mildly disappointing dividend rise.

FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Tender feelings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England must have known that yesterday's Treasury bill auction
would cause a stir. Since three-month money market rates have crept up over
the past week, it had an awkward choice. It could withdraw the tender, in
which case it might be accused of forfeiting credibility by resisting upward
pressure on rates. Or it could proceed on schedule, in which case the
markets might assume it was somehow endorsing higher rates. In the event it
chose to do the latter but offset the signal effect by dealing shortly
afterwards at its normal rate in the money market.
Such a sophisticated approach may seem natural to an organisation with 300
years of experience. But the simple message that no interest rate signal was
intended was lost on the broader market. Instead it concluded that the Old
Lady was finally losing her grip. Much as the Bank prizes its discretion
over the timing of interest rate changes, the uncertainty could have been
avoided if decisions taken at the monthly meeting between the chancellor and
the governor - most recently on Thursday - were implemented at once. The
Bank's right to choose the moment supposedly reflects its technical grasp,
but it did not show much talent in this regard yesterday.
Moreover, the authorities may be missing an opportunity if they have decided
to leave rates alone. Though the markets may have read too much inflationary
risk into this week's CBI quarterly trends survey, policy should aim to
pre-empt any acceleration of price rises before it actually happens.
Parliament is now in recess and no gilts auction is on the cards for August.
There could hardly be a better time to move, especially since the markets
will remain restive until the authorities finally show their hand.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Procter steps up attack on Unilever's Persil Power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble has unleashed a new attack on Unilever, its arch-rival in
the soap wars, with an exhibition of more frayed and washed-out boxer shorts
plus full-page advertisements today in UK newspapers knocking Unilever's
new-generation soap powder.
Procter paraded the shorts yesterday - as well as pyjamas and a garish shirt
 -in a series of photo-sessions and media briefings highlighting the results
of independent tests carried out on Unilever's 'rebalanced' version of its
recently launched Persil Power.
The Persil Power formula was amended following Procter's original claim that
the detergent's manganese-based 'accelerator' could damage clothes after
frequent washing. Procter said yesterday that new test results showed that
even the weakened version of the detergent could cause damage.
The newspaper advertisements placed by Procter do not name Persil Power, but
state that 'only Ariel (Procter's soap powder) washes so clean yet so safe'
and that Ariel 'does not contain the accelerator'. The advertisements warn
the public that even if they switch brands, 'manganese accelerator residues
can be left on your clothes', and continue to cause colour fading.
Procter says it has been warning the public about the product - also
marketed as Omo Power and Skip Power elsewhere in Europe - because it does
not want to be blamed for any damage.
Unilever claims that Procter's actions stem from the fact that it, too,
plans to launch a new-generation detergent in the autumn; while Ariel Future
will not contain the manganese-based product, it will be promoted as having
very similar characteristics to Persil Power, Unilever says.
Unilever said yesterday that Procter's latest test results - conducted by
independent test house the British Textile Technology Group - were 'very old
hat'.
The test data, collected in laboratory conditions, were not as valid as
Unilever's field trials which had been entirely successful, the company
said. Earlier this month, Unilever published extracts of independent tests
it had commissioned which were said to prove the detergent's safety and
effectiveness.
The Consumers' Association, the UK consumer group, is currently testing
Persil Power and results are due in about 10 weeks. Marks and Spencer, which
manufactured some of the garments used in the tests, is also scrutinising
the product.
Meanwhile, the UK tabloid press is beginning to turn Persil Power into the
'galloping gangrene' of the detergent world. This week The Sun has had tales
of silk boxer shorts being 'eaten'.

FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): GDP details prompt strong
rally in Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks rallied yesterday after the Commerce Department announced that the
economy had grown at a slower rate than expected during the second quarter,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.67 higher at 3,764.50, climbing
to its highest closing level since June 17. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 was 4.02 ahead at 458.26, as advancing issues on the Big Board
swamped declines by an eight-to-three margin. NYSE volume was a moderate
271m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 3.81 at 437.69,
and the Nasdaq composite surged 9.73, or 1.37 per cent, to 722.16.
At the opening, stocks were fast off the mark. Investors were relieved by
the earlier announcement that gross domestic product in the second three
months of year had grown at a rate of 3.7 per cent, slightly less than
forecast.
The news deflated growing concern over the potential of a
stronger-than-expected reading to damage share prices. Amid the relief,
analysts began to re-evaluate the strength of the economy going into the
third quarter, given a big jump in inventories. The likelihood of an early
rise in interest rates diminished.
The strategic thinking in the US Treasury market followed the same path. As
a consequence, prices on the benchmark 30-year security soared and the yield
plunged 17 basis points to 7.38 per cent as traders rushed in to cover their
bets that the GDP data would exceed expectations.
Amid the fanfare, bearish news from Chicago purchasing managers, suggesting
higher price pressures in the manufacturing sector, was largely ignored.
With fears over rates put aside, at least temporarily, stocks which are most
sensitive to broad economic trends advanced. Among the Dow industrials,
Caterpillar climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 108 3/8 , International Paper
gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 72 7/8 and Alcoa added Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 78 1/4 . The improving fundamental outlook gave a lift to
semi-conductor stocks, too. Texas Instruments jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to
Dollars 78 5/8 , Micron Technology gained Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 37 3/8
and Novellus Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/4 .
Earnings news continued to trickle into Wall Street. LTV, a leading steel
maker, was marked up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 18 3/4 after posting net
income of 40 cents a share, nearly double the consensus forecast. Inland
Steel pushed Dollars 1 1/8 ahead to Dollars 38. The gains followed JP
Morgan's recommendation to buy steel issues because of an expected price
increase from Chrysler.
On the negative side, Aetna surprised Wall Street by taking a Dollars 64m
charge to cover pollution-related claims in the second quarter. The stock
dropped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 on the news.
On the Nasdaq, Thursday's speculation about a possible takeover of
Intergroup Healthcare proved to be prescient, as Foundation Health agreed to
buy the company through a Dollars 750m stock swap. Shares in Intergroup
surged a further Dollars 10 1/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 , adding about 50 per cent
to their value in two sessions. Foundation dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars
32 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto stocks ended the week on a winning note, rising 0.70 per cent, in
moderate trading.
The TSE-300 composite index gained 29.16 points, or 0.70 per cent, to
4,178.97. On the week, the index was up about 3 points.
Advances led declines 449 to 295, volume fell to 55.26m shares from 59.69m
on Thursday. Trading value was CDollars 533.0m compared with CDollars
626.1m.
All but one of the 14 stock groups increased, with mining and real estate
adding 1.47 per cent and 1.30 per cent.
The Toronto market will be closed Monday for a holiday.
Mexico
Equities closed higher on investor optimism over the forthcoming general
election and a better-than-expected batch of second-quarter company reports.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares gained 33.12 points, or 1.36 per cent, to
close at 2,462.27 after peaking at 2,487.51 mid-morning.
Analysts said the rises of recent days are based on greater confidence that
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party will win Aug 21 presidential
and legislative elections.

FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion pressures S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares came under pressure in afternoon Johannesburg as sellers
gathered after the bullion price failed to recover from overnight lows.
Other shares also drifted lower but no real selling was seen as sentiment
held up after Wall Street gained overnight and posted gains in early trade
yesterday. The overall index finished 20 softer at 5,652, industrials lost
27 to 6,407 and golds fell 28 at 2,138.
Few fresh factors emerged to influence direction in the slow pre-weekend
atmosphere.
Gencor continued to tend softer as demand slowed after the announcement of
its purchase of Billiton. It was 5 cents softer at R11.90.
Anglos added R3 to R249, De Beers was 75 cents lower at R111 after falling
on Nasdaq, and SAB fell R1 to R87.
Remgro shed 50 cents to R25.50 and Barlows made 25 cents to R34 in a late
rally. Lonrho picked up 30 cents to of Thursday's losses to R9.75.
Vaal Reefs shed R4 to R406 and Kloof was 50 cents off at R58.50.

FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar strength gives support
to the continent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US played a major factor in lifting sentiment across the continent
yesterday.
FRANKFURT closed the official session with a 1 per cent gain in the Dax
index, but was barely changed on the week. The index ended up 23.83 at
2,146.64. In the after market the Ibis moved ahead to 2,152.19.
There have been additions to those brokers turning positive on the German
market. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck is hopeful of a summer rally, noting
that the market made a 6 per cent gain during July, while Mr Julian Callow
at Kleinwort Benson looks at a discount rate of 4 per cent by the end of the
year, helped by favourable inflation and monetary data.
Sector rises were seen in those areas which have been strong over the past
week, including Deutsche Bank, up DM3 at DM731.50, which led the way with
results on Tuesday. Lehman Brothers, although confident about the bank,
thought that there was greater upside to be seen elsewhere, particularly in
Dresdner which 'commands a price to cash flow multiple of 3.9, compared with
4.8 at Deutsche'. Consequently, Lehman maintained its neutral, low risk
rating.
The vehicle sector improved further: Daimler up DM18.50 at DM*02.50, BMW up
DM4 at DM867.00 and Volkswagen DM5 firmer at DM502. James Capel recommended
a switch out of Daimler into BMW, but maintained its strong position on VW.
MILAN found some reassurance in the day's political developments and shares
recouped part of the sharp losses seen earlier in the week.
The announcement that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, planned to
separate his political and business roles, together with news that his
brother had turned himself in to magistrates both helped to calm the nervous
market. The Comit index rose 13.97 or 2 per cent to 709.76, but was still
2.9 per cent lower on the week, reflecting the sharp falls on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
Industrial stocks lead a broad-based upswing, with Fiat adding L150 to
L6,940 and Pirelli adding L80 to L2,885.
Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International commented that Fiat was
benefiting from its positive performance in its home market and joint
ventures abroad while there appeared to be a fundamental review taking place
of Pirelli's prospects, which included its commanding position in the fast
growing Brazilian market.
'The strong performance of corporate Italy is a welcome diversion from the
market turbulence seen this week, which clearly came about through broader
issues regarding the control of public finances,' he said.
PARIS was a late closing beneficiary of the US currency. The CAC-40 index
increased 21.56 or 1 per cent to 2,074.99, up 1 per cent on the day and 1.6
per cent on the week.
Roussel Uclaf was a strong performer, the shares up FFr32 to FFr603
following results which came out after the close on Thursday. Commenting on
the data Goldman Sachs said that the first half figures were better than
expected and highlighted the positive fundamentals which supported that
company - strong underlying pharmaceutical growth, significant restructuring
benefits, potential synergies with Hoechst, the parent company, strong
financials and considerable overall scope for margin expansion.
Eurotunnel rose FFr1.35 to FFr26.95, with some unconfirmed reports
suggesting that a limited and restricted allocation passenger service might
start later in the summer.
ZURICH was helped ahead by the firm dollar and prices received a further
boost during the afternoon from the positive reaction of US markets to the
the day's GDP figures. The SMI index rose 20.2 to 2,579.5, but was 0.7 per
cent lower on the week.
Investors continued to display a cautious approach to the banks, ahead of
half year details from Credit Suisse which came after the market had closed.
CS Holding bearers, however, still added SFr6 to SFr571 while UBS, reporting
half year figures next week, also rose SFr6 to SFr1,181.
Roche certificates picked up SFr30 of recent losses to SFr5,320.
Cyclicals put in a strong performance with Brown Boveri adding SFr16 to
SFr1,229, Sulzer putting on SFr11 to SFr965 and Alusuisse rising SFr17 to
SFr702.
Ares-Serono bearers put on another SFr30 to SFr730 after Thursday's 16.5 per
cent surge which followed news from Biogen, the US group, of positive
prospects for its beta interferon treatment for multiple sclerosis. Ares is
developing its own beta interferon treatment and also has the patent for the
production process.
AMSTERDAM made forward progress helped by late strength in the dollar,
leading the AEX index up 2.99 to 408.21 on the day and 1.2 per cent on the
week.
There were further gains among the cyclicals with DSM and Akzo Nobel again
featuring among the most heavily traded issues. Both groups are expected to
announce generally encouraging results next week, helped by an improvement
in the chemical sector overall. DSM put on Fl 1.40 to Fl 142.90 and Akzo
made Fl 1.90 to Fl 214.40.
A solid rise was seen in Hoogovens, the metals company, again on the
likelihood that earnings will be boosted by prospects for economic recovery.
The shares closed at a new year's high of Fl 79.50, up Fl 2.30.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by declining interest rates and confidence on the
outlook for corporate earnings. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 1.1 per
cent to 1,464.2, little changed on the week.
Volvo was a favourite among investors, up SKr15 to SKr760.
MADRID posted a 1.3 per cent rise with the lower than expected US GDP data
bringing a rush of demand during the afternoon. The general index rose 4.16
to 313.70 in solid turnover of Pta29.7bn.
Electrical stocks were the strongest sector with Endesa rising 3 per cent to
Pta6,130.

FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Renewed buying helps
Nikkei erase week's losses
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by public funds supported share prices and the Nikkei average, which
has been depressed by overseas selling, erased most of the week's losses,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 201.54 to 20,449.39, marginally lower than last
Friday's close of 20,462.89.
The index fell to a day's low of 20,318.16 in the early afternoon before
rising above the 20,500 level for the first time in a week to 20,517.10, the
day's peak.
The fall in the yen against the dollar encouraged dealers and individual
investors, while public fund managers were seen buying export-oriented
stocks in the afternoon. But volume totaled 273.7m shares against 286m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 15.95 to 1,637.41 while the
Nikkei 300 gained 2.83 to 297.16.
Gainers led losers by 799 to 199 with 156 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.64 to 1,333.79.
Traders said investor confidence had improved as the Nikkei has remained
above the 20,000 level.
However, trading was expected to stay within a narrow range next week as
most market participants are reluctant to buy stocks aggressively at higher
levels.
Export oriented stocks, which had been hit by selling from overseas
investors, gained ground. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6
to Y733 and Hitachi Y13 to Y965.
Nissan Motor rose Y22 to Y770 and precision machinery companies also
improved, with Canon up Y10 to Y1,710 and Minolta adding Y10 to Y525.
Profit-taking hit Ihara Chemical Industry, which rose Thursday on
speculative buying. The stock fell Y30 to Y1,270.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 237.68 to 22,736.49 in volume of 14.4m
shares.
Roundup
A positive mood prevailed in much of the region.
TAIPEI advanced 1.6 per cent on the day on purchases of plastics,
electronics and financial sector stocks, so ending a two-day correction. The
weighted index gained 107.27 to 6,749.40, 4 per cent ahead on the week.
Turnover was TDollars 100.5bn.
Leading computer makers Microtek International and First International
Computer both rose by the daily permitted seven per cent limit, gaining
TDollars 3.30 to TDollars 50.50 and TDollars 6 to TDollars 92 respectively.
Plastic stocks were strong on expectations of continuing international
demand for petrochemicals, with Taiwan Styrene Monomer gaining TDollars 6 to
TDollars 93.
SYDNEY climbed to its highest level in seven trading days, as sentiment was
boosted by options-related trade and encouraging economic data.
The All Ordinaries index rose 19.4 to 2,061.5, up 0.5 per cent this week.
Turnover was ADollars 740.8m.
Brokers said news that the current account deficit, which narrowed to a
seasonally adjusted ADollars 1.439bn in June, from ADollars 1.699bn in May,
was at the lower end of market expectations.
Foster's Brewing dominated volume with 30.8m shares exchanged. The stock
rose 2 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to ADollars 1.12, with most of the major
broking houses involved in heavy options-related trade.
Among gold stocks, Pacific Placer surged 22 cents to a five-week high of
ADollars 33.45 and Poseidon Gold added 9 cents to ADollars 3.38, its highest
share price in 14 weeks.
North Flinders Mines, which earlier reported a 47 per cent rise in annual
net profit to ADollars 30.01 million, was steady at ADollars 8.35.
HONG KONG finished moderately higher after profit-takers pared early gains
and the Hang Seng index added 80.15 to 9,482.81, for a 3.6 per cent rise on
the week. Fund buyers had pushed the index to a high of 9,525 before profits
were taken.
Preliminary turnover dropped sharply to HKDollars 4.26bn from Thursday's
HKDollars 6.54bn.
Among blue chips, HSBC rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 93.00 and Swire
Pacific gained HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 63.50.
Property developers also performed well with Cheung Kong advancing 60 cents
to HKDollars 37.90 and Sun Hung Kai Properties climbing 65 to HKDollars
50.25. But the real estate investor, Hong Kong Land, was a target of
profit-taking, losing 15 cents to HKDollars 20.50.
KUALA LUMPUR overcame a round of profit-taking and continued its advance for
the sixth straight day.
The composite index closed 1.21 higher 1,027.51, taking the week's rise to
2.7 per cent.
Volume swelled to 215m shares from Thursday's 159m, boosted by a
lower-than-expected inflation figure for June and overnight gains in Wall
Street.
Pan Malaysia Cement jumped 76 cents to MDollars 5.60 after its announcement
of a two-for-one bonus issue.
SEOUL finished higher after an afternoon spurt, led by gains in several blue
chips and banking issues and the composite index closed 7.45 higher at
933.65, 0.6 per cent down on the week.
Posco and Samsung Electronics were limit up, adding Won25,000 each to
Won73,400 and Won91,000 respectively.
SINGAPORE came back from its intraday high, while trade in Malaysian stocks
dealt over the counter benefited from renewed rumours of an impending
election announcement in Malaysia.
Some resurgent interest from Japanese funds in Singapore bank stocks was
reported although brokers were still mixed on the market's near-term
outlook, seeing a prolonged consolidation still on the cards.
The Straits Times Industrials index closed 5.18 higher at 2,206.42, little
changed on the week.
MANILA finished slightly higher as PLDT and Philippine National Bank showed
strength. The composite index put on 12.07 to 2,803.21, up 3.4 per cent
across the week. Turnover was 1.26bn.
WELLINGTON improved on light volume, the NZSE-40 capital index up 18.23 at
2,027.18, unchanged on the week.
Telecom rose 10 cents to NZDollars 4.78 ahead of going ex dividend on
Monday.
SHANGHAI's A index fell another 7.38 or 2.2 per cent to close at a new
record low of 328.84. The decline came ahead of a statement from the stock
exchange authorities announcing a suspension of the issue and listing of new
shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the rest of this year, in an effort to
stabilise and standardise the markets.

FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: RTZ wanted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, jumped 10 1/2 to 862 1/2 p on news of
an expansion at its Escondida mine in Chile.
RTZ has a 30 per cent stake in the mine which is expected to become the
world's single biggest copper producer in two years time. Last year, the
mine contributed Pounds 36m to RTZ's net earnings of Pounds 373m but some
analysts believe the impact will be less marked than initial figures
suggest. SG Warburg argues that it will only increase earnings per share by
four per cent and not until the end of the decade.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome jumped 8 to 639p as the US Food and Drug
Administration's advisory committee recommended approval of its
controversial anti-AIDS treatment for reducing the risk of transferring the
HIV virus from mothers to babies. Also, Paribas issued a buy note arguing
that the recent figures highlighted the company's solid performance in a
difficult environment and the shares were trading at an unjustifiably high
discount to the market and sector.
Profit-takers were out in force in the water sector reversing several of the
sharp gains seen following the issuing of the Ofwat report on Thursday. But
other stocks remained firm amid a flurry of broker recommendations in
response to what was considered a highly favourable document from the
industry regulator.
Among the fallers, Welsh tumbled 17 to 621p, Yorkshire 13 to 543p, and
Severn Trent 16 to 556p. After the market closed the latter group's agm
heard that sales and profits for the first quarter to June were running
ahead of levels for the same period a year previously. Northumbrian was the
best performer, adding 8 to 635p.
Motor dealer Lex Service, which reported disappointing figures earlier this
week, languished 13 to 424p.
Electricals group Delta lost 6 to 504p on fears of stiff competition in one
of its key markets following Thursday's Pounds 96.1m recommended offer by
Hanson for Scholes, a rival to Delta.
Transport and property group P&amp;O tumbled 15 1/2 to 657 1/2 p following a
press report of a formal investigation by US authorities into whether the
Trans-Atlantic Agreement (on routes and rates) has engaged in
anti-competitive practices. P&amp;O operates container ships on the route.
However, one analyst said: 'There is little to worry about since profits
from those operations are tiny.'
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved 8 ahead to 314p, after reports that
a joint French and British government committee awarded it a provisional
licence to operate a limited passenger service.
Profit-taking in BAA left shares in the UK airports group 20 lower at 953p,
after an Pounds 11m jump in first quarter profits to Pounds 111m.
Charterhouse Tilney continues to favour the stock and upgraded its full year
profits estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 366m. Mr Mike Stoddart at the
broker, said the adjustment was to reflect, 'strong traffic growth and the
confirmation that trading is in line with expectations.'
A positive agm statement from BPB, the building materials group, saw the
shares appreciate 2 to 332p. The chairman told shareholders that a trend of
better sales volumes seen last year had continued into the first quarter of
the current financial year.
BT shares shaded 6 1/2 to 369p, with Morgan Stanley moving to a hold on the
stock.

FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food sector active
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The turbulence surrounding the dramatic bid developments continued to
reverberate through the food sector, although turnover was well below
Thursday's hectic session. The focus of attention remained on whether Tesco
would return to the fray to counter J Sainsbury's Pounds 210m bid for
William Low. The Scottish retailer, which had climbed 60p in the first four
sessions of the week, was steadier yesterday closing a penny down at 323p,
still well above Sainsbury's 305p cash offer. However, turnover, below
recent levels which had peaked on Thursday at 11m shares, totalled just over
500,000 yesterday.
However, the support for the price, continues to point to the market's
expectation that Tesco will come back with a higher offer. Analysts
suggested a counter-offer of around 325p a share - although there were also
a few siren voices hinting of a Tesco withdrawal. Shares in Tesco, which
began the saga two weeks ago with an agreed Pounds 154m for Low, slipped 1
1/2 to 231 1/2 p. Sainsbury also weakened, closing 3 1/2 to 407 1/2 p.
The spotlight also fell on William Morrison Supermarkets, the shares being
bid up 5 1/2 to 139 1/2 p with turnover a sprightly 2.1m. But food
specialists were highly sceptical of the speculation, in view of the large,
albeit minority, shareholding by the Morrison family.

FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds fails to please
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After reporting a 21 per cent rise in profits, Lloyds Bank saw its share
price fall sharply as the market reacted sourly to the underlying factors.
The high street bank's figures came in at Pounds 605m against Pounds 498m
last time and a dividend of 7.5p. The consensus forecast was for a profit of
around Pounds 610m and a dividend of 7.6p to 7.8p but the real concern was
over underlying profits.
Analyst Mr Martin Hughes of Credit Lyonnais Laing who maintains an
unfavourable view of Lloyds said; 'This is the third half year of reporting
that Lloyds have had nothing to say in terms of growth.' There was also
disappointment that the bank did not say more over progress on the bid for
the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society.
A number of City analysts are understood to be preparing swingeing forecast
downgrades for the full year and for 1995 and could lop 15 per cent off
their estimates. The current year consensus of Pounds 1,340m this year is
expected to come down to Pounds 1,100m while next year's forecasts are seen
to be moving down from around Pounds 1,440m to about Pounds 1,200m.
The share price was immediately marked lower to stave off a wall of selling.
Although turnover reached 4.5m by the close dealers expected the move away
from Lloyds to continue for some time. They said a number of investors were
sitting on their holdings until the shares recovered slightly.
The shares ended the day 18 lower at 544p with both Credit Lyonnais Laing
and Smith New Court recommending a switch into Barclays. The latter which
reports on August 9, saw its shares climb 9 to 554p.

FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sudden interest rate fear upsets
confidence - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market had the wind taken out of its sails yesterday by the
turmoil in gilt-edged stocks which culminated in warning cries that the
authorities planned a 'pre-emptive strike' by raising base rates without
waiting for inflationary pressures to force the decision on them.
The FT-SE 100 Index was down by 26.2 in late afternoon after the authorities
had apparently condoned a rise in UK Treasury bill rates to 5.75 per cent
from the existing 4.99 per cent rate. Such a move has traditionally been the
warning for a base rate hike, but uncertainty still prevailed when markets
closed in London. The Treasury bill move was not the only factor disturbing
interest rate assumptions yesterday. But London was helped at the close by
firmness in US Federal bonds after favourable news on US gross domestic
product growth in the second quarter.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,082.6 for a net loss on the
day of 13.3 points. Trading volume was not particularly heavy and there were
no signs of undue selling. Most strategists continued to doubt whether the
authorities intend to raise base rates in the short term, but pointed to
Wednesday's money market repurchase operation as the nearest indication of
policy.
By the end of the session, short-dated government bonds, the most closely
linked to base rate expectations, had fallen by nearly half a point. Longer
dates, however, ended an erratic day with gains of around  3/8 as investors
took the view that an early increase in base rates would take the steam out
of inflationary pressures. The late advance in long dated gilts proved no
help to the equity sector, although a gain of 23 Dow points in early trading
on Wall Street did give some relief to a somewhat confused London stock
market.
Equities opened formly, helped by the confident trend in utility stocks
following the Ofwat price review of the water industry companies and by
Thursday's half time results from ICI.
Encouraged also by initial gains in stock index futures, the Footsie
advanced by more than 11 points. The banking sector turned easier, however,
as interim results from Lloyds Bank failed to please the analysts.
But gains were soon reversed when by what appeared to be an unfortunate leak
of the latest British Purchasing Managers' Index, showing it at a record
high of 62.2 per cent in July; the index itself was then published, a day
earlier than expected.
This whiff of inflation quickly hit bond prices and equities soon followed
them downwards, with futures markets, as usual, setting the trend. From then
on, the stock market remained in thrall to gilts and to developments on the
interest rate front.
A further cause for worry came when the market remembered that the Bank of
England Quarterly Bulletin is due on Wednesday and may well bring stronger
comments on inflation prospects from the Bank.
At last night's close, the FT-SE 100 Index was about one per cent down over
the week, with yesterday's fall contributing substantially to the week's
loss of 32 points. Most equity strategists, while accepting that base rates
are likely to move up before the end of the year, had been doubtful that any
early move was on the cards; however, yesterday's developments may inspire
some hurried rethinking of opinions.
Equity trading volume has remained good, with retail or customer business
worth Pounds 1.39bn on Thursday. Seaq turnover reached 507.8m shares
yesterday, compared with 657m in the previous session. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index eased 2.6 to 3,640.2 yesterday, with second line stocks providing 56
per cent of total market volume.

FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures closed above the day's low point after a volatile
session dominated by worries over interest rates and weakness in the fixed
interest markets, writes Joel Kibazo.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Futures plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of an imminent rise in UK base rates caused panic selling of short
sterling futures yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Massive volumes were traded and price movements were also exceptionally
large. The December contract traded nearly 110,000 lots and there was a 48
basis point spread between the high and the low prices for the day.
The December contract settled at 93.27, suggesting the market believes
interest rates will rise by 1.5 percentage points by the end of the year.
These developments over-shadowed the release of the US 2nd quarter GDP
figure, which rose by 3.7 per cent. This was below market expectations and
this took some of the sheen off the dollar which had risen above Y100 on
Thursday evening for the first time in a month.
The dollar finished in London at Y100.175, down from a high for the day of
Y100.57 . Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5888, off a high of DM1.5985
before the GDP release.
The prospect of higher interest rates bolstered sterling which rose more
than two pfennigs on the day to finish in London at DM2.4413 from DM2.4195.
It was also  1/2 cent firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5366
from Dollars 1.5319.
The market's problems arose from confusing interest rate signals emanating
from the Bank of England. In its weekly Treasury bill operations, the Bank
accepted a highest bid of 5.7558 per cent -  1/2 per cent above the current
base rate, and around  3/4 of a percentage point up on the week.
This led the market to believe that the Bank of England was signalling an
imminent tightening of policy.
In its daily operations, however, the Bank provided assistance at the
established rate of 5 5/32 per cent. This left the market totally confused
as to what the Bank was trying to tell it.
The net effect of yesterday's transactions is that the Bank has borrowed
money at 5.75 per cent and lent it at 5 5/32 per cent. This is an untenable
situation beyond the very short term, and either market rates will have to
drop back towards the Bank rate, or it will have to be raised.
Analysts were split as to whether the Bank was trying to signal higher
rates, or had made a mess of the Treasury bill tender by not realising the
confusion it would create by accepting a 5.75 per cent rate.
Although interbank rates had climbed sharply during the days following the
CBI survey, and a buoyant purchasing managers index yesterday, the Bank's
hands were not tied. It could either have pulled the auction, as it has done
in the past, or intervened on its own account to knock out the highest bids.
Traders in the futures market said the market went 'absolutely ballistic'.
Trading conditions were 'right up there with the ERM chaos' said one dealer.
Sterling rose on hopes of higher rates, but analysts warned that it was
vulnerable to a heavy sell-off next week should the Bank disappoint the
market by not tightening policy.
Not only would rates be lower than expected, but the Bank's credibility
would be damaged. Similar confusion in February about the handling of a base
rate rise led to heavy selling of sterling.

FT  30 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of all grades of pepper rose considerably this week, reports Man
Producten. Indonesian shippers were most reluctant to offer any white pepper
because of disappointing and delayed arrivals of new crop and this helped to
push prices up by USDollars 250 to Dollars 300 a tonne. Spot white was on
offer at Dollars 3,300 and prompt shipment at Dollars 3,150, c and f. Black
pepper prices were also firmer across the board. Rising demand coupled with
limited supplies from most origins pushed prices to new highs. Black pepper
of fair average quality for spot delivery reached about Dollars 1,850 a
tonne and better grades were traded at about Dollars 2,000. In the US market
the spot price exceeded 90 cents a pound.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper leads rally at LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange copper market ended the week in a more
constructive mood as speculative buying repaired some of the damage done by
earlier heavy selling.
US investment funds were again the driving force behind a Dollars 100-plus
plunge that took the three months delivery price below Dollars 2,400 a tonne
at one point on Wednesday. The later recovery, which was capped by
resistance at Dollars 2,450, left the price Dollars 72 down on the week at
Dollars 2,442.50 a tonne. Dealers told the Reuters news agency that this
reflected an 'unsurprising' technical correction.
Copper's rally helped to stiffen other LME contracts, notably aluminium,
which was also aided by another big drawdown from exchange warehouse stocks.
The 16,525-tonne fall to 2,523,950 tonnes took the total stocks decline from
the mid-June peak to 137,575 tonnes. The three months price closed yesterday
at Dollars 1,478.50 a tonne, still Dollars 31.50 down on the week but
Dollars 54.50 above Wednesday's low.
Other base metals also moved off their lows, but only Lead and nickel ended
the week with net gains.
In contrast, the platinum price was in retreat on Thursday and yesterday
from 3 1/2 -year highs reached earlier in the week.
The surge to Dollars 427.50 a troy ounce was prompted by comments made in
Tokyo by Mr Michael Steel, market research director of Johnson Matthey, the
world's biggest platinum marketing group. In a Reuter interview he suggested
that Japan might this year import record quantities of platinum and its
sister metal palladium (both are used in motor exhaust catalysts) and that
the world platinum supply surplus might disappear by 1995. That also helped
to lift the palladium price to a five-year high.
Platinum had become overbought, however, and by yesterday's afternoon
'fixing' at the London bullion market the price was back to Dollars 419.50
an ounce, up Dollars 8 on the week.
Gold had been towed along in the wake of the platinum group metals but the
dollar's late strength brought a reaction in the price, which ended 80 cents
lower on balance at Dollars 383.90 an ounce, Dollars 5.45 off its midweek
peak.
Coffee remained the most volatile of the commodity markets with it's prices
fluctuating in the wide trading range created by the spectacular gains that
followed recent Brazilian frosts.
The September futures price at the London Commodity Exchange touched bottom
on Monday at Dollars 3,362 a tonne as traders awaited publication of the
official assessment of the damage done by the frosts and analysts reduced
their damage estimates.
When the official assessment came on Tuesday night it showed a coffee bean
loss at the top end of the range of analysts' estimates and future's prices
recovered somewhat. But the sellers were soon back in the driving seat and,
with no more frost thought likely this weekend, the September futures
position closed yesterday at Dollars 3,415 a tonne, down Dollars 43 on the
day and Dollars 213 on the week.
The Brazilian industry and commerce ministry put the frost losses from the
1995-96 coffee crop, which had previously been projected at 26.5m bags (60kg
each) at nearly 11m bags, or 40 per cent. Analysts revised estimates had
mostly been between 6m and 9m bags.
Industry and commerce minister Frederico Robalinho said the official figures
were preliminary, but added 'they will only change a little'.

FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Two US healthcare groups agree
to Dollars 720m merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The spate of mergers among health maintenance organisations (HMOs) in the US
continued yesterday with the announcement of a Dollars 720m all-stock merger
of two groups with operations concentrated in western states.
Foundation Health, a company based in California which has recently
concluded a series of acquisitions in the south-east, said it had reached
agreement to acquire Arizona-based Intergroup Healthcare. It is to pay
Dollars 444m in stock for Thomas-Davis Medical Centres, which owns 63 per
cent of Intergroup. In addition, Foundation is offering a choice of ordinary
stock or convertible preference shares to holders of the remaining
Intergroup shares.
Together, the two would cover 1m individuals through their HMO operations
and have annual revenues of Dollars 2.4bn, creating a company in the top
dozen of that US sector.
HMOs are rapidly replacing traditional health insurance companies in the US.
Unlike insurers, they actively manage the provision of healthcare to the
individuals they cover in order to bring down costs.
The wave of acquisitions in the sector marks an attempt by the bigger
organisations to spread their administrative and marketing costs across a
bigger customer base, to increase their bargaining power with healthcare
providers such as hospitals and to extend their networks into other regions
in the country.
The Intergroup deal appeared to mark the growing competition to acquire
smaller HMOs. The price being offered was well ahead of market expectations
the day before, when Intergroup confirmed it was in discussions with an
unnamed bidder. Yesterday morning, its shares closed at Dollars 57 5/8 , up
Dollars 10 1/8 , to Dollars 58 after a jump of Dollars 9 1/2 the day before.
Foundation said the stock it had to issue in the deal would cut its earnings
per share by 35 cents next year. But it expected lower costs and the
opportunity to sell new services to Intergroup's customers.

FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hazardous waste charge dents
Aetna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expected liabilities from the clean-up of hazardous waste sites pushed net
income at Aetna, the US insurance group, down 8 per cent in its latest
quarter, compared with a year before.
Concern that the company may harbour other pollution-related liabilities
pushed Aetna's share price down Dollars 4 3/8 , or nearly 8 per cent, to
Dollars 51 1/2 , by the close in New York yesterday. Uncertainty about the
scale of environmental clean-up costs remains the biggest concern
overhanging the US property-casualty insurance industry.
The Connecticut-based company said in the three months to the end of June it
had set aside additional reserves to cover environmental indemnity claims,
resulting in an after-tax charge of Dollars 64m.
The unexpected charge led to a Dollars 32m operating loss in Aetna's
commercial property/casualty business during the second quarter, compared
with a profit of Dollars 25m a year before.
The losses were offset in part by advances in life and health insurance
businesses, as well as financial services.

WMX Technologies, the international waste hauler based in Chicago, plans to
buy back all of the publicly-held shares of Chemical Waste Management, its
hazardous waste handling subsidiary, through an exchange of stock,
essentially merging the two companies.
The company said it was planning a review of its operations, hinting that it
may undergo a second restructuring in as many years.
WMX Technologies, formerly known as Waste Management, intends to issue 12.1m
shares, valued at nearly Dollars 353m, to regain full ownership of Chemical
Waste Management in a tax-free transaction.
Chemical Waste Management shares closed up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 8 5/8
yesterday, while WMX Technologies were unchanged at Dollars 29 1/8 .
WMX already owns 78.6 per cent of Chemical Waste's outstanding shares and
intends to exchange 0.27 of its own shares for each one share of Chemical
Waste's common stock it does not own. Chemical Waste's public shareholders
need to approve the transaction.

FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull reduces loss to
FFr843m in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the state-controlled French computer company, yesterday said it
had brought its net current loss for the first half of this year down to
FFr843m (Dollars 152m), or less than half its FFr1.98bn loss for the same
period of 1993.
Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, president, claimed his goal for the group to
break even on its operational results for the whole of 1994 'now appears
achieveable', and Bull was 'now positioned for privatisation'.
The European Commission has still to rule on whether the French government
can go ahead with a FFr2.5bn capital increase for Bull, and whether a
similar FFr7bn allocation last year to Bull was permissible.
Bull has said it needs this aid to counter the effect of chronic past
losses. The latest sharp reduction in Bull's losses will not necessarily
weaken French arguments in Brussels for the state aid, which can perhaps now
more plausibly be represented as a rational investment rather than money
disappearing into a bottomless pit.
Bull reduced its operating loss to FFr433m in the first six months of this
year, compared with FFr1.2bn in the same period a year earlier. Turnover
rose 11 per cent to FFr13.85bn, with the strongest growth recorded in the
personal computer division of Zenith Data System whose sales rose 55 per
cent on a year earlier. Bull said stringent cost and salary restraints
accounted for the improvement.
Last month, the French government invited tenders for banks to act as
advisers on Bull's privatisation. At the same time Mr Descarpentries has
tried to reinforce the group's links with NEC of Japan which holds a 4.4 per
cent stake in Bull.

Profits at Sapporo Beer, the Japanese brewer, rose sharply for the first six
months to June due to a rise in demand and a decline in operational costs.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits rose 41.2 per cent from a year earlier to
Y6.9bn (Dollars 66.4m) on a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y267.4bn.
After-tax profits rose 8.9 per cent to Y3.2bn. Sales of the company's
mainstay beer rose 3 per cent to Y238.1bn, with sales volume increasing 1
per cent. Operating profits rose 51 per cent to Y11.2bn due to a Y5bn cut in
material, distribution, and advertising costs.
The company expects full-year pre-tax profits to rise 4 per cent to Y11.5bn
on a 9 per cent increase in sales to Y620bn.

FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Austrian bank hit by trading
income drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditanstalt-Bankverein (CA), the Austrian bank in the midst of
privatisation negotiations, has reported a 17 per cent decline in pre-tax
profit in the first half to Sch1.9bn (Dollars 165m) due to a steep fall in
trading income.
Meanwhile, the Austrian finance ministry has decided to commission an
investment bank to evaluate bids by CS Holding of Switzerland and a
consortium of Austrian, Italian and German investors for a large portion of
the government's 70 per cent voting stake in CA.
A decision is expected after the Austrian general elections on October 9.
CA, Austria's second largest bank, said it expected an improvement in
second-half trading and net interest income, but forecast pre-tax profit for
the full year would be lower than last year's record Sch5.4bn. However, it
was confident that net income would be higher as a result of lower
provisions for bad loans.
CA saw income from own account trading slide 45 per cent to Sch455m in the
first six months of 1994. The bank's so-called partial operating profit,
which excludes trading, was up 11.7 per cent to Sch1.35bn.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive, said provisions in the first half
were less than Sch1.5bn compared with Sch3.8bn in the whole of last year.
Total assets at the end of June at Sch573.4bn were only 2 per cent higher
than at the end of 1993.
Precise consolidated results were not available, but CA said its group
pre-tax profit was down 13 per cent to just over Sch2.6bn.

<TEXT>
The go-ahead has been given for a further expansion of the Escondida copper
mine in Chile at a cost of USDollars 520m. It will make Escondida the
world's biggest copper mine by mid-1996 and also turn Broken Hill
Proprietary, which entered the business only five years ago, into the
world's leading producer of traded copper.
RTZ of the UK, the world's biggest mining company and one of the partners in
Escondida, will move ahead of Phelps Dodge, the biggest US copper producer
and be not far behind Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group that currently
heads the world copper production league.
The new expansion will lift Escondida's annual production capacity from
480,000 tonnes of copper to an average of 800,000 tonnes.
Construction will start immediately. The increased tonnage will start to
build up from the second half of next year and output at the higher level
will last to 2000.
Escondida will increase supply of copper concentrate (an intermediate
material) to local smelters - among them those owned by Enami, Codelco and
Refimet. Following expansion, about 30 per cent of the mine's production
will be refined in Chile.
Production started at the Dollars 824m Escondida open pit mine in 1990, and
has been expanded twice - costing Dollars 76m and Dollars 200m respectively.
BHP, Australia's biggest company, owns 57.5 per cent; RTZ has 30 per cent; a
Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi, 10 per cent; and International
Finance Corporation, 2.5 per cent.
The news left BHP shares 32 cents higher at ADollars 19.02 in Australia
yesterday, in a generally firmer market.
RTZ pointed out that Escondida produced about 389,000 tonnes of copper last
year and contributed Pounds 36m (Dollars 55.4m) to RTZ's net earnings
totalling Pounds 373m.

FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Credit Suisse falls 27% to
SFr1.8bn

Credit Suisse, flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group, has
kicked off the big Swiss banks' interim result season with a disappointing
27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to SFr1.76bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
A 35 per cent decline in income from trading to SFr949m was accompanied by a
15 per cent drop in net interest income to SFr1.29bn. Of the bank's three
main sources of earnings, only commission business showed growth, advancing
10 per cent to SFr1.35bn.
The group gave no figure for net income, but said it was slightly down on
the result in the comparative period dueto a less acute need for provisions
for bad loans.
Of the big three Swiss banks, Credit Suisse is known as the most dependent
on trading of foreign exchange, precious metals, interest rate instruments
and securities.
Last year, with all markets rising, this was the group's largest source of
income, accounting for 37 per cent of total receipts.
The bank said income from foreign exchange, precious metal and banknote
trading in the first half remained only slightly below last year's level,
but the slump in international stock and bond markets hit hard.
The decline in net interest income was attributed to narrower interest rate
margins, especially in the Swiss market, and to stagnant lending volumes.
Credit Suisse said interest margins were extraordinarily high in the first
half of 1993.
The June 30 balance sheet showed a SFr3.6bn decline in lendings to
SFr120.3bn since the end of 1993, but the bank said this was due to the
weakness of the US dollar.
The contribution from Credit Suisse Financial Products, the bank's 50 per
cent-owned derivatives house, 'matched last year's extremely good results'.
But earnings of Swiss Volksbank, acquired last year by CS Holding and now
consolidated with Credit Suisse, 'are not yet satisfactory'.
Vontobel, the Zurich-based private banking and asset management group,
reporting interim figures for the first time, posted net income of SFr19.8m
in the first six months of 1994.
No comparative figures were given. In the full year 1993, the group had net
income of SFr40.1m.
The group said it suffered a loss of SFr5.7m on trading of its own
securities holdings in the first half.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: H&amp;C cuts plantations link with Dollars 273m
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield yesterday closed the book on almost a century of
history with the announcement that it had sold its Indonesian plantations to
a group of four Indonesian businessmen for Dollars 273m (Pounds 176m) cash.
The disposal has been expected for some time. Harrisons, which began life in
the 19th century as a tea trader, has been steadily severing its traditional
links since the late 1980s.
Harrison's 19 Indonesian estates, producing palm oil, rubber, cocoa, copra,
tea and coffee, are by far the most profitable of the company's remaining
plantations. They were nationalised by the Indonesian government in 1964,
but returned to Harrison's ownership in 1969.
Last year they contributed Pounds 18.1m of the reported Pounds 24m in
plantation operating profits.
The group retains a 57 per cent stake in palm oil plantations in Papua New
Guinea.
Mr Bill Turcan, the new chief executive, said Harrisons had got the best
possible price against a background of rising palm oil prices.
The proceeds would be used to reduce short-term debt, he said, with the
balance put on deposit. If the sale had been completed in the last financial
year, debt would have been reduced to Pounds 91m to give gearing of 14 per
cent compared with the reported 48 per cent.
Earnings would have been diluted by about 0.5p.
The company would be publishing pro forma accounts for shareholders when it
reported its interim results on Wednesday, Mr Turcan said.
The disposal is part of Harrisons' strategy to reposition its businesses.
However, it was also forced on the group in part by the Indonesian
president's decree that at least 20 per cent of the business had to be sold
to Indonesian nationals. Harrisons had been preparing for a flotation in
1996, but decided to sell the whole operation after several approaches.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Future worries affect the present - A look
at the clearers' prospects in the wake of Lloyds' results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the basis that it is better for a company's share price to travel
hopefully than to arrive, yesterday was a predictably bad day for UK banks.
Lloyds' arrival at the point of a high return on equity, huge cash flows and
a large dividend rise was greeted by a sharp fall in its shares.
The interim reporting season of the clearing banks, which was started by
Lloyds and will continue next week with Abbey National and National
Westminster, will show an industry in exceptionally good shape. But it will
also indicate reasons why most investors think the future will be tougher.
If there were no worries about that, Lloyds' 22 per cent return on equity
would appear manna from heaven. 'You rub your eyes at the returns,' says Mr
Chris Ellerton, banking analyst at SG Warburg. 'The sector cannot sustain a
return like that, or everyone would want to start a bank.'
One reason that the banks' results are likely to be so good is that bad
debts are now falling quickly. The credit quality of UK companies improved
strongly in the first half - shown by the fall in Lloyds' specific bad debt
provisions for large corporate lending to Pounds 7m, against Pounds 38m.
Bank shares have already fallen sharply this year. This is largely because
of tightening US monetary policy, which brought an end to UK interest rate
falls. The shares of HSBC Holdings - parent of Midland Bank - and Standard
Chartered have also been badly affected by unsettled Asia Pacific markets.
The shares have also responded adversely to the belief that banks face
testing times. They could ratchet up earnings during the recession by
increasing charges and loan margins. But analysts and investors now think
that their high profits and capital will be frittered away in competition.
Lloyds' results reinforced this impression in a number of ways:
The bank's loans and advances to customers fell from Pounds 39.2bn at the
year-end to Pounds 38bn at the end of June. Loan demand has been subdued
despite the recovery, although Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive,
said a rise in demand for loans was likely to give the bank 'a tail-wind' by
the year-end.
It added a further half percentage point to its tier one ratio of capital to
risk-weighted assets, taking it to 7.1 per cent. It could be taken to less
than 5 per cent by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester acquisition, but it is a sign
that other banks will soon build up capital well in excess of their needs.
Fees and commissions were flat, rising only from Pounds 656m to Pounds 695m.
The rise in fees was one of the main methods by which banks improved
operating income in the early 1990s, taking the opportunity presented by
either losses or slim profits to re-price services to companies and
individuals.
Net interest income in the UK retail banking and insurance business fell
marginally, from Pounds 661m to Pounds 655m. The bank's mortgage balances
grew faster than the industry as a whole, but suffered an erosion in
margins. Sir Brian emphasised the extreme price sensitivity of the mortgage
market.
Taken together, analysts argue that this means banks are building up cash
for which they have no use. It will either find an outlet in acquisitions
similar to Lloyds' purchase of C&amp;G, or will be handed back to shareholders,
or will be used to pay for price competition to gain market share.
Lloyds mooted all three possibilities yesterday, although it sounded
unenthusiastic about the second. Sir Robin Ibbs, chairman, said that it
might buy back shares as a means of distributing capital in the medium-term,
but only 'if we found there was no better way of using the money'.
The possibility of price competition was openly discussed by Sir Brian, who
said Lloyds might lower the gap between the cost of equity - currently at 12
per cent - and the return on its equity by lowering prices. However, it
would only do so if it calculated that volumes would rise to compensate.
In practice, analysts believe that banks will have little choice but to
succumb to price competition in an overcrowded retail market. Mr Ellerton
cites the example of a colleague charged a 43 per cent annual percentage
rate of interest on his Pounds 500 mortgage, after taking fees into account.
'A lot of the charges they stuck on in the recession will unwind now. They
just will not be able to hold them,' he says. Mr Ellerton says that
lower-cost financial services producers such as Lloyds and C&amp;G will initiate
price wars because they will be able to bear competition more readily.
This provides an uncertain future for bank dividends, after the large
increases paid out by several at the full-year.
Such is the expectation generated by banks' capital strength that Lloyds' 14
per cent rise was greeted with derision yesterday. That will not have
comforted the banks yet to report.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Retail growth helps BAA to Pounds 111m in
first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rapidly increasing retail income helped BAA turn in an 11 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 111m for the first quarter to June 30.
Turnover rose 5 per cent from Pounds 291m to Pounds 305m.
The largest increase came from retail revenue, up 8.5 per cent at Pounds
125m, in spite of the ongoing programme of redeveloping terminal facilities.
The company has completed the extension of the retail areas at Terminals 3
and 4 at Heathrow, where double digit increases were achieved.
It is now implementing a rolling expansion programme which will provide it
with 900,000 sq ft of retail space by 1997. It currently has 600,000 sq ft
of shopping space.
Passenger numbers grew by 6 per cent to 22.1m during the quarter, and the
company, which operates seven UK airports, is predicting that traffic growth
will be maintained at between 5 and 6 per cent for the current year.
In the most recent set of statistics, for June, growth in passenger
throughput had accelerated to 9 per cent.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, said: 'Our strategy of developing the core
business, building revenue and controlling costs has enabled us to
capitalise on this growth and this confirms our confidence in the prospects
for the next nine months and beyond.'
He said Gatwick had recorded its strongest growth for three years, due to
increasing charter traffic.
Revenues from airport charges rose 5.6 per cent to Pounds 117m, while
airport property income improved 11 per cent to Pounds 40m (Pounds 36m), as
new facilities came on stream.
Capital expenditure increased by 73 per cent to Pounds 88m, reflecting the
Pounds 1.4bn spending programme announced earlier this year. This included a
substantial increase in spending on the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express, the
high speed rail link to London's Paddington station due for completion in
1997.
Earnings per share were 8p (7.2p).
The share price fell 20p to 953p on profit taking, but analysts maintained
their full year forecasts, with expectations of about Pounds 370m for the
year to end-March.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw buys more dealerships for
Pounds 5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evans Halshaw, the motor distributor, is expanding further from its West
Midlands base with the acquisition for Pounds 5.7m of GT Cars Group, a
private company with seven dealerships in the east Midlands and South
Yorkshire.
The purchase, foreshadowed in June when Evans Halshaw launched a Pounds 29m
rights issue, completes an acquisitions programme which, in the last year,
has more than doubled its number of dealerships to 90.
'We need to spend the next 12 to 18 months consolidating what we've got,'
said Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman.
Consideration for GT is Pounds 750,000 in cash, Pounds 2.7m in loan notes
and the issue of 495,050 new shares at 454 1/2 p each, a premium of 11 1/2 p
on yesterday's closing share price.
In a separate transaction, Evans Halshaw is paying Pounds 1m in loan notes
for the freehold of three sites which GT holds under lease.
In the 1993 year, GT reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 662,000 on turnover
of Pounds 41.2m.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lower bad debts boost N of England Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North of England Building Society, which is planning to merge with Northern
Rock, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.21m for the six months
to June 30, an increase of 6.8 per cent on the comparable Pounds 7.7m.
The rise was largely due to a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts
from Pounds 787,000 to Pounds 327,000.
New gross lending fell to Pounds 61m over the period, sharply down on the
Pounds 77.4m advanced in the first half of 1993.
The decline compared with the sector average which showed a slight rise in
gross lending.
The society experienced a net outflow of funds totalling Pounds 12.6m,
against an inflow of Pounds 28.3m. Total assets rose slightly over the six
months from Pounds 1.509bn at the start of the year to stand at Pounds
1.514bn, compared with Pounds 1.49bn a year earlier.
Mr Ronald Shiel, chairman, said that the merger with Northern Rock, the 11th
largest society, had taken much time and effort since its announcement at
the start of May.
He acknowledged that activity in the lending and savings market had been at
a low level, and said that competition had been intense for what business
was available.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new investment trust specialising in small companies traded under Stock
Exchange Rule 4.2 - until recently known as Rule 535.2 - has raised Pounds
19m through an institutional placing.
The Beacon Investment Trust is to be managed by Rutherford Asset Management,
joining a stable of trusts concentrating on smaller companies. Beacon will
seek to exploit the opportunities created by London's commitment to develop
the Rule 4.2 market, seen as a successor to the USM.
Shares in the trust will be eligible for inclusion in personal equity plans,
which should boost its appeal to private investors.
The shares have been issued at 100p, having an initial net asset value of at
least 96.5p, with one warrant attached to every five shares. The trust will
have an initial life of 10 years. Dealings are due to start on August 8.
The Rule 4.2 market is a more lightly regulated and cheaper home for small
company shares than the Official List. It originally operated by means of
matched bargains, but there is growing involvement by marketmakers.
Companies using the trading facility include football clubs and Weetabix.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds Bank's chief executive, yesterday expressed
confidence that the bank would have sufficient capital to buy Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society without difficulty given its strong cash flow,
writes John Gapper.
Shareholders' equity grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 3.37bn over the six
months to June 30 1994 and a further Pounds 800m was raised in loan capital.
The interim dividend is increased by 14 per cent to 7.5p, payable from
earnings per share ahead 15 per cent to 27.1p.
Analysts estimated that the bank's tier one ratio of core capital to
risk-weighted assets would fall to about 5 per cent if the cash was paid
immediately, but Sir Brian said the bank could release further problem
country debt provisions.
Pre-tax profits from UK retail banking and insurance rose to Pounds 198m
(Pounds 130m) after a fall in debt provisions from Pounds 233m to Pounds
182m. Corporate banking and treasury profits rose from Pounds 108m to Pounds
171m with provisions falling to Pounds 7m (Pounds 38m).
Profits from private banking and financial services rose slightly to Pounds
53m (Pounds 51m). Sir Brian said this was because charges depended on the
value of assets managed, and these had been affected by financial markets
turmoil.
The overall group net interest margin fell to 3.28 per cent (3.33 per cent),
despite a slight rise in the domestic margin to 3.98 per cent (3.97 per
cent). Sir Brian said this was because of growth in overseas assets.
Balances in non interest-bearing current accounts rose to Pounds 3.9bn
(Pounds 3.5bn), while money invested in savings and investment accounts fell
from Pounds 10bn to Pounds 9.3bn.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Tesco considers next move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City analysts were divided yesterday over whether Tesco was likely to
re-enter the takeover battle for Wm Low following J Sainsbury's bid of 305p
a share for the Scottish supermarket group on Thursday.
After Tesco's failure to respond immediately with a higher bid, and reports
that its directors and advisers were locked in meetings yesterday, there
were suggestions that the UK's second-largest food retailer was wavering
over whether to raise its offer.
Tesco is thought to have expected a bid from Sainsbury of about 280p a
share, and has been wrong footed by the 305p offer, which valued Wm Low at
Pounds 210m - a 36 per cent premium to Tesco's original agreed offer of 225p
a share, worth Pounds 154m.
'I don't think Tesco had really thought through the implications of
Sainsbury coming back at that price,' said one analyst.
A source close to Tesco hinted the company was anxious not to be seen to
have been pushed into overpaying for the 57-store Wm Low group.
Most analysts, however, still believe Tesco will make a bid of about 325p a
share on Monday or Tuesday. That would leave Sainsbury with the choice of
whether to push the price to 350p or more.
Others are convinced Tesco will itself bid 350p in an attempt to guarantee
victory.
'I think Tesco will bid 350p on Monday,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retailing
analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'I am beginning to wonder if Sainsbury would then
come back at 400p.'
Shares in Wm Low fell 1p to 323p.
However, shares in Wm Morrison, the north of England-based superstore group,
gained 5 1/2 p to 139 1/2 p yesterday amid speculation that it might become
a takeover target.

A legal settlement of Pounds 325,000 helped William Ransom increase pre-tax
profit by 13 per cent, from Pounds 817,000 to Pounds 925,000, despite a fall
in turnover from Pounds 7.19m to Pounds 6.83m.
The settlement related to an abortive move to Biggleswade for the
pharmaceutical products maker.

FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Gt Southern up 11% as SCI buys more shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Southern Group, the besieged UK funeral company, yesterday announced
an 11 per cent increase in interim profits and urged shareholders to ignore
the current offer by Service Corporation International, the US funeral
group.
However, SCI executives will fly into London on Sunday night presaging an
expected increase in their 600p a share bid for Britain's third largest
funeral operator.
Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, president of SCI, described the latest document by
Great Southern as 'pathetic'. His company bought a further 1.6 per cent of
the company's convertible shares yesterday, showing SCI's commitment to the
bid.
However, the bid remains opposed by JD Field, Great Southern's largest
shareholder, which owns 56 per cent. Members of the Field family, and the
trustees which control 70 per cent of JD Field, met yesterday to discuss
SCI's offer.
Mr Christopher Stainforth, managing director of corporate finance at
Guinness Mahon, JD Field's advisers, said: 'Everyone is agreed that anything
close to Pounds 6 is just not enough.'
Great Southern's Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 3.45m) pre-tax profit for the half
year to June 30 was set against a 2.5 per cent decline in the mortality
rate, and operating profits from its core business of retail funeral
services fell to Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 2.38m).
The crematoria and cemeteries operations increased profits to Pounds 1.12m
(Pounds 1.02m), but the main contributor to growth was its pre-paid funeral
business, Chosen Heritage. Great Southern sold 10,500 (9,600) funeral plans
in the first half and has started booking profits from the actuarial surplus
of funds held from these plans, set against the anticipated costs of the
funerals. This contributed Pounds 774,000 (Pounds 552,000 restated).
Earnings per share were 19.7p (17.6p) and an interim dividend of 4.5p (4p)
is declared. An increased final is forecast for a 14p (12.2p) total.
SCI only records profits from its 'pre-need' policies upon completion of the
actual burial, and it has attacked Great Southern's accounting treatment.
SCI has another week to increase its offer.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Last tango in the Middle East: A look at Syria's role in the
peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the pomp and publicity of the White House garden ceremony on Monday,
when King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister,
signed an end to a 46-year-old state of war on a sunlit table, the focus of
the peace process returns to the Middle East. This time it disappears behind
the firmly closed doors of the presidential palace high on the hills
overlooking Damascus.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is expected in Syria again as
early as next week, just over a fortnight after his last round of talks with
President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader. The visit is a clear attempt to
use the fresh momentum of this week's signing to push along the Syrian track
of the three-year-old Middle East peace process, which has proved the
slowest.
Mr Christopher will be hoping Mr Assad has read the signals from the White
House. The Syrian leader, who is seeking closer ties with the US and the
removal of his country from America's list of state sponsors of terrorism,
will have seen the warmth of the reception for King Hussein, who appeared to
have erased the damage done to US-Jordanian relations during the Gulf war.
He will have seen that peace brings material rewards - in Jordan's case, US
promises of military aid and debt relief worth Dollars 700m. Mr Christopher
might additionally hope that Syria will feel left behind in the peace
process, and that Mr Assad might quicken his step in the negotiations. For
as Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday that the sides
still remained far apart: 'Right now it's not a tango, it's not a dance
between the two (parties).'
Mr Assad will have digested these developments, though close diplomatic and
academic observers doubt whether he is susceptible to pressure on the basis
that he is being 'left behind'. One senior western diplomat suggests that a
man famous for sitting ramrod-straight for hours during diplomatic meetings
to convey the impression of implacable strength and resolution would not
give any sign of being hurried, even if he felt it.
In any case, he adds: 'Assad's patience is legendary, and if Syria has
already waited 27 years to get back the Golan Heights, then why not wait a
few more if that's what it takes to get the right deal?' The area between
Israel and Syria, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
forms the heart of the antagonism between the two countries.
Further, while King Hussein accelerated his talks with the Israelis partly
to prevent the risk that his kingdom might be marginalised in the peace
process, Mr Assad harbours no such worries. He knows that both Israel and
the US consider Syria the crucial component in any overarching regional
peace deal. The other headline Middle Eastern events of the past week amply
suggest the reasons why - and why the Israeli-Syrian track of the talks is
proving the most complex and slowest to show progress.
The two bombings against Jewish targets in London this week, which left 19
wounded, and the car bomb which killed 96 in an anti-Jewish raid in Buenos
Aires on July 18, were brutal reminders that deadly and efficient opponents
both of Israel and of the peace negotiations remain at large. Whether the
Lebanese militant Islamic group Hizbollah was behind some or all of the
attacks, or whether the plots were ultimately hatched in the Iranian
capital, Tehran, as Israel charges, is still to be discovered.
There is reason to suspect the Iranian-backed Hizbollah, despite its denials
of involvement in any of these recent attacks. It claimed responsibility for
bombing Jewish targets in Argentina in 1992.
Moreover, it swore only last month that it would use its own 'long arms' to
exact revenge for an Israeli attack on a Hizbollah training camp deep in the
Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon, in which 30 of its fighters were killed.
As long as Iran remains hostile to any peace with Israel and capable at
least of inspiring acts of anti-Jewish terror, there is little Israel or the
US can do to banish the threat of such outrages altogether. But the
possibility of neutralising, or at least containing, such threats under the
present peace process lies largely in Mr Assad's hands.
For one thing, Mr Assad has shown that he can effectively contain
Hizbollah's threat to Israel from south Lebanon. While the group is
supported by Iran, its main camps in Lebanon operate largely in Syrian-held
areas of the Bekaa Valley and its arms must pass through Damascus. Last
year, when Israel pounded south Lebanon for a week in retaliation for
Hizbollah rocket attacks into northern Israel, Mr Assad's intervention
secured a 'gentleman's agreement' that such attacks would cease. That
agreement has essentially held.
While Israeli troops remain inside their self-declared 15km-deep 'security
zone' in south Lebanon, neither Syria nor the Lebanese government will act
to deprive Hizbollah of arms, which the group says it is using against an
occupying force. But few in Damascus or Beirut doubt that if and when an
Israeli withdrawal is agreed under an eventual regional peace plan, Lebanese
troops, backed by the 35,000 Syrian troops in the country, will disarm and
close down Hizbollah as a violent threat to Israel.
Moreover, it is widely thought that Mr Assad would be able to exert his
authority over Hizbollah without damaging his friendly relations with Iran.
The Iranians have few friends among Arab states and are antithetical towards
making peace with Israel. 'The Iranians have already said that, if Syria
made peace, Iran would continue to treat it differently from the other Arab
states such as Egypt,' says Mr Shahram Chubin, an Iran analyst at the
Institute of International Studies in Geneva.
Several European diplomats in Damascus believe Syria has already reached an
understanding with Iran that Tehran would cease to provide military support
for Hizbollah in the event of a Syrian-Israeli peace.
Syria's potential role as an intermediary and interlocutor with Iran is
almost certainly something Mr Assad hopes the US will acknowledge and,
perhaps, reward.
His influence over Hizbollah is a bargaining card that Mr Assad is playing
cannily as he negotiates with the Israelis for their withdrawal from the
Golan Heights. In return, Israel is seeking a Syrian commitment to a 'full'
peace of open borders, trade and normalised diplomatic relations.
Finding a formula to resolve the impasse over a 'full' Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights in exchange for a 'full' Syrian peace with Israel is
in itself a considerable diplomatic challenge. The return of the Golan is
paramount for Mr Assad. But a solution to this problem alone is unlikely to
satisfy him if it does not also bring a wider acknowledgement of Syria's
importance as a regional power. His price for containing Hizbollah in any
peace is likely to be some US-Israeli recognition of continued Syrian
influence in Lebanon.
The detailed progress of negotiations between Syria and Israel is difficult
to interpret while both sides remain silent. But Mr Christopher's return to
Damascus indicates that the US believes Mr Assad is prepared to move the
talks forward. For Mr Assad to receive him suggests Mr Christopher is not
arriving empty-handed.
US promises of improved relations and material aid, though, are unlikely to
bring Mr Assad to the White House lawns with Mr Rabin. According to one
western ambassador: 'Assad would never be willing to give up certain
political principles just to get some money.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment most pressing economic
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As large suppliers of capital equipment in the UK, we have noted with
interest the attention given this week to the subject of investment and are
delighted that, at long last, the matter is becoming more important ('CBI
urges tax changes to aid investment', July 28).
Given the fact that we have such beneficial economic conditions, it should
be of great concern for the longer term that the Confederation of British
Industry trends survey showed such a small number of manufacturers planning
to invest in plant and machinery in the future. The UK has always been the
poor relation of the developed economies as far as investment is concerned.
UK machine tool manufacturers are doing extremely well on the back of strong
growth overseas, while the UK market remains relatively poor. Without
vitally needed investment in high technology, plant and equipment, UK
manufacturing cannot hope to close the 25 per cent gap in productivity which
the government identified in the recent white paper. While a highly skilled
workforce is of course essential, it becomes academic if it has to work on
outdated equipment. We agree completely with the need to be competitive, to
be benchmarked against our foreign competition and the need to increase our
productivity, but all are fundamentally relative to investment.
Manufacturing investment should be the most important economic issue facing
the UK today. The chancellor should use his forthcoming budget to address
the UK's investment deficiency as low interest rates and inflation are
obviously not sufficient for growth.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not on a ballot paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN A NEWBOULD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In common with many shareholders who bought shares in the privatisation
of the water industry, I have just received from Yorkshire Water the annual
report, notice of the annual general meeting and the form of proxy. I was
extremely concerned that, on the form of proxy, the company had authorised
the words 'Not recommended by the directors' against the side of item 7,
'Election of Mrs D Scott'.
In common with Mrs Scott, who made a statement advocating her election, the
directors of the company have had an ample opportunity to make a statement
of their reasons for opposing the resolution, in the notice of the annual
general meeting.
In my opinion, to add such a statement to a ballot paper is an abuse of the
traditions of the ballot procedures in all elections held in the UK.
If such practices are to become common place within public company
elections, I trust that other small shareholders will join with me in
pressing parliament to amend the Company's Act to outlaw such statements on
the ballot paper.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Programme changed so that young
people have appropriate training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T J POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write in response to your article 'Training cuts 'cause destitution'
' (July 22). In the interests of providing a balanced view, I would make the
following points. Funding for the joint venture, known as Job, between the
Children's Society and the Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise
Council was ended because a detailed audit by the GNTEC revealed that the
young people were not receiving the training and guidance needed to achieve
their full potential.
As a result the trainees were transferred on to integrated programmes where
it was felt they would receive improved quality training.
The important point here is that they were transferred to training companies
with both the experience and expertise to work with people with additional
needs and achieve positive outcomes from their training. Each trainee is
offered access to qualified professionals who guide, counsel and monitor all
aspects of their development.
In our view, the combination of an integrated environment backed by
professional counselling gives young people with additional needs the best
possible preparation to successfully enter the world of work.
A number of trainees from the original scheme have subsequently achieved
qualifications and jobs.
One of the many obligations that Tecs have is for the health and safety of
trainees, and this aspect was taken into consideration in arriving at our
decision.
The GNTEC was recently commended by the National Council for Voluntary
Services for its work with additional needs groups.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Air France support should be decided
on a commercial basis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MIKE WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Flight plan for Air France' (July 25), you argue
that state aid to Air France should be tied to a deadline for the full
privatisation of Air France. Why wait until after the provision of state
aid? As you rightly say, the lack of a market for shares in Air France makes
it difficult to judge whether state aid is being granted on commercial
terms. However, if Air France were privatised, the market could decide
whether or not it was a sensible commercial decision to invest another
FFr20bn in Air France. If it is a sensible commercial decision, then the
funds could be raised on the markets; if it is not, then the funds would not
be forthcoming.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Knives out at heartbreak hotel: A look at Forte's renewed
effort to take full control of the Savoy group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New money against old. A thrusting immigrant family takes on England's most
venerable institutions. The drive for profit collides with the preservation
of genteel tradition.
It is not just newspapers which have discerned elemental conflicts in
Forte's 13-year struggle to acquire the Savoy group, whose hotels include
the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught. The protagonists appear to enjoy
casting themselves in these roles too.
They did so during the initial eight-year takeover battle, which culminated
in Forte acquiring 68 per cent of Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of the
vote. They continued to do so, usually in private, during the uneasy truce
after Forte's agreement in 1989 not to raise its stake for five years in
return for two seats on the Savoy board.
And in the days before this week's Savoy board meeting, which announced
Forte was seeking allies among smaller shareholding trusts, leaders of both
camps gave further insights into how they like to be seen.
At a hoteliers' luncheon, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte and son of its
Italian immigrant founder, said he had no difficulty passing the 'cricket
test' set by Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, sitting
beside him. Italy, he said, did not play cricket.
The Fortes are proud of their passionate loyalty to two countries. Italy
might not play cricket, but it does play football. Lord Forte, Rocco's
85-year old father, says he would cheer Italy if they played England at
Wembley and England if the game was in Rome.
The leaders of the Savoy have no need of such fine distinctions, being
firmly rooted in British soil. Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director,
this week told a tourist gathering of his memories of picnics on the rocks
of Stonehenge, before motorways and public toilets damaged this ancient
English mystery.
When Lord Forte said in his autobiography that the father of Sir Hugh
Wontner, Savoy president until his death in 1992, was of Hungarian origin,
he received an angry letter from the Savoy's lawyers. Lord Forte admitted
his mistake.
None of the insults traded during the takeover battle of the 1980s have been
forgotten and few have been forgiven. It was not just Mr Shepard's assertion
that stewardship of Savoy's hotels could not be entrusted to 'a vast combine
which, among other things, runs service stations on the main arterial
roads'.
What rankles more was Sir Hugh's remark to Mr Forte after Forte's initial
failure to win control that 'I've always thought Italians made good hotel
managers.'
Now, however, long-time observers of the battle believe Forte wants to
reduce the acrimony.
Instead of bickering, the whole Savoy board should recognise that the
running of the group can be improved. Savoy made pre-tax profits of only
Pounds 725,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 83m, after recording a loss
of Pounds 1.4m in 1992.
Mr Forte has put to one side his desire to place Forte's most exclusive
hotels in a joint company with the Savoy. Despite reports that Forte wants
to put the Savoy hotels into its international booking system, detailed
discussions on this have not taken place.
The City was wrong in its view that there was no legal reason for Savoy to
make this week's announcement that Forte was seeking an alliance with
minority shareholding trusts. The Savoy board's legal advice was that the
statement had to be made because speculation was rife.
If Forte wants to proceed on a more friendly basis, some industry observers
say it has a strange way of showing it. At this week's board meeting, Mr
Forte blocked the appointment of Sir Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome
Trust, as Savoy chairman. He even refused to agree to have Sir Roger on the
board as a non-executive director, saying no changes should take place
during discussion of the group's future.
Mr Forte's attempt to win over the trustees - who have enough voting shares
to give him overall control - seems his best option at the moment. The 1989
peace agreement specified Forte would not increase its stake for five years
and would give 12 months' notice if it wanted to do so.
The 12-month notice requirement remains even after the five-year period ends
this November. Giving notice would cause the share price to rise, making a
purchase more expensive. With the trustees' backing, Mr Forte would win
control without having to spend another penny.
There have been times when Mr Forte would have been happy to sell the Savoy
stake, but there have been no buyers. The Aga Khan is believed to have
expressed an interest but nothing came of it.
Forte has tried to buy other luxury hotel groups instead. It was the
favourite to take over Ciga, the Italian chain, but was defeated earlier
this year by ITT Sheraton of the US. It is currently bidding against Accor
of France to buy Meridien, the French chain.
Apart from the prestige Savoy would bring to Forte, there is also the
satisfaction it would give to its founder. Lord Forte proposed to his wife
in the Savoy and spent part of his honeymoon there. Nevertheless, in his
autobiography, Lord Forte said that, while any hotel group would be proud to
own such prestigious hotels, 'I don't need the Savoy Group to crown my
career. I have enough already of which to be proud.'
While that is certainly true, 13 years is a long time to spend chasing
something one does not need. Forte is unlikely to walk away now. Whether in
acrimony or at peace, the two sides appear stuck with one another for some
years yet.

FT  30 JUL 94 / The Possessed: A look at the power of television to help
create a consumer society in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an advertisement for the collapsed MMM finance house - still running on
Russian television as thousands of jittery investors crowd about its
outer-Moscow offices seeking to cash their shares at virtually any price -
Lenya Golubkov, the commercial's central character, is in California with
his brother Ivan. They are at the football match between Russia and
Argentina which destroyed the former's dreams of taking the World Cup.
The commentary is jokey, the camera shots are quick and quirky. The main
point is that Ivan is in despair - not over the Russian team's performance,
but because Lenya, who has funded the trip, has done so because he has put
his money into MMM shares - while Ivan, a working stiff all his life, still
has nothing.
As General Electric hired a clean-cut, right-thinking, second-rank actor
named Reagan with which to identify its products in the 1950s and 1960s; as
Oxo built up the middle-class English personality of Katie to drive home the
essential goodness of its product, so Bakhyt Kilibayev, the Kazakh director
of the Lenya series created a one-representing-all working-class character,
whose job as an excavator driver is abandoned for a life of wealth and
leisure through his embrace of MMM.
MMM, launched by Mr Sergei Mavrodi, had huge success this year by selling
shares in itself. It quoted its own rocketing share prices - from 1,600
roubles (about USDollars I) in February to more than 100,000 roubles this
week - to an ever-widening circle of buyers. Whether they numbered the 2m
which the Kommersant Daily estimated this week or the 10m claimed by Mr
Mavrodi, the figure is still larger than the Russian army. Since MMM seemed
to have no means of making money other than the constant selling of its
rapidly-rising shares, it was widely assumed to be a pyramid company funding
new business with old receipts. After a triple salvo of government warnings
on its solvency it admitted its virtual collapse yesterday, telling
investors it had nearly run out of cash and offering them a paltry 950
roubles (US40 cents) per share.
However, Mr Mavrodi has not given up. He has launched a political campaign
against the government itself, threatening to stir his shareholders to
revolt, or at least to sign a petition calling for a referendum on the
government's competence. Significantly, he used Lenya in this piece of lese
majeste: 'So the authorities don't like Lenya Golubkov and Marina Sergeyevna
(a family friend)? But do Lenya Golubkov and Marina Sergeyevna like these
same authorities?' - an explicit effort to equate Lenya and Marina with
Russia's anti-government citizenry.
Lenya, as projected by Mr Kilibayev, is a figure in transition - as most
Russians are. A simple if shrewd man in an extended family, his 'life' is
crazy, impulsive, and when not caught up in outings to California and to
Paris, is lived largely on and around the couch from which he and his
extended family watch TV.
Putting a TV in the commercials as well as the commercials on TV showed the
instinctive mastery which has distinguished the campaign. In the post-Soviet
period, the Russian channels old and new are a riot of raucous game shows,
western soap operas and films, and the remains of the rambling Soviet talk
programmes - and lengthy, frequent commercials, of which MMM's have been the
most frequent and the most vivid. Vivid most of all because - in contrast to
the many in which sleek young men in dinner jackets and women in shimmering,
close-fitted gowns slither round Japanese jeeps - it is both a slice of life
in the apartment block, and a send-up of it. It endorses both the common
feeling that we are all living through chaos where anything goes (and
therefore anything can be gained), and a cynical comment on just that view,
a shrug which says: so it's stupid, so it's crooked, so what?
When President Boris Yeltsin said Lenya got on his nerves, millions of
Lenyas were, according to the daily Izvestiya, insulted. When Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin warned Lenya (by name) that his dream time was coming to
an end, Mr Mavrodi went on the attack and threatened to end Mr
Chernomyrdin's power by the force of his aroused shareholders.
Mr Mavrodi's audacity is, through Lenya, to identify his TV character with
the undoubtedly deep feelings of resentment and frustration felt by ordinary
citizens when confronted with a country whose prestige and power has been
cut at a stroke, whose economy continues to decline, where crime is
exploding and fear of it is pervasive, and where the figures of authority
are routinely dismissed as venal and uncaring.
Lenya also touched a wide range of Russian references. An anonymous
psychiatrist, writing in the weekly Soversheno Sekretno, said that in his
couch-bound idleness and his production of fantasies, Lenya was a TV
recreation of facets of Oblomov - the central character of the eponymous
19th-century novel by Goncharov, one who gave his name to the phenomenon of
Oblomovism, or dreamy idleness.
But in his working-class past and his escape from it, Lenya proposes to
everybody the possibility of unshackling themselves from the previously
powerful, state-promoted myth of Soviet Citizen - proud yet obedient,
militant but in the direction determined by the party, having surpassed
class, want and individualism in pursuit of an ideal (and in part a reality)
of collective, all-encompassing security and social and intellectual
identity.
In its place is the crazy, self-interested, wealth-pursuing world of Lenya
Golubkov, where luck and nerve bring rewards to oneself and one's own. The
family was always a shelter for individuals against the relentless
collectivism of Soviet life. Now it drops its defences, and goes on the
offensive - a consumption offensive of the kind big stores from Istanbul to
Miami have noted with delight, as their cash registers ring to the sound of
Russian purchases.
Lenya Golubkov will last as an influence even though the company which gave
him birth has folded. He is the media image of the Russian coping with the
latest oppression, that of the world of consumption with its attendant
images, myths and falsehoods, its new liberations and new enslavements. He
is the proletarian turned consumer, the object of history struggling to be
its subject. Mr Mavrodi's threat to mobilise millions of Lenya's against the
state authorities is likely to be the last throw of a gambler with the chips
stacked against him. But he has helped unleash something bigger even than
the dreams he encouraged, and has now betrayed.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rising expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'In July the sun is hot. Is it shining? No it's not.' Flanders and Swann's
old advice for those planning their holidays in Britain is an equally good
guide for those fretting about the pace of the country's economic recovery.
True, the horizon remains unusually cloudless for an upturn which is two
years old. But the test of whether the government will allow it to overheat
lies ahead.
While the economy's worrier-in-chief, the Bank of England, was celebrating
its 300th birthday, others in the City this week did some worrying of their
own. This led to a significant fall in the price of UK government bonds. The
yield on a 10-year gilt-edged security had risen to over 8.6 per cent by the
end of the week, while Friday's money markets brimmed with expectations of
interest rate rises to come. Is this midsummer madness, or something a bit
more fundamental?
Wednesday's silly rumours, whether substantiated or not, that a Conservative
MEP had called for a hike in interest rates, would probably have received
less attention in cooler months. UK bonds were also partly suffering a
knock-on reaction from fears of inflation in the US. But the Confederation
of British Industry's Industrial Trends Survey for July, published on
Wednesday, helped fuel more home-grown fears that interest rates would need
to rise soon.
Receiving most of the attention were the survey's findings on manufacturing
capacity. The number of companies reporting that they were operating below
full capacity fell to 54 per cent, compared to 59 per cent four months ago.
The latter happens to be the long-term average rate. Slightly more firms
also fear that capacity will restrain their output in the coming months:
another warning.
Market speculation
Although there are some causes for concern, little in the survey points to
an imminent take-off in prices, as the authors themselves point out.
Similarly, the Treasury's monthly monetary report - released as the governor
of the Bank of England had his monthly meeting with the chancellor of
exchequer - provided the participants with few reasons for confirming the
financial markets' speculations. The narrow measure of money growth, though
still growing faster than its monitoring range, slowed slightly in June, to
6.8 per cent, while output price inflation, as reported earlier in the
month, remains at its lowest level since 1967.
Monetary authorities with less profligate histories might get away with
leaving things as they are. But British financial markets currently need
rather more persuading that Mr Clarke will hold fast to his medium-term
inflation targets. The gap between conventional and index-linked government
bonds, a rough guide to inflation expectations, indicates that the market
expects inflation to average over 4.6 per cent during the next five years,
considerably more than the government has promised.
Attaining greater long-term credibility will take more than the publication
of the two gentlemen's monthly conversations. It will mean showing a
willingness to act to slow price pressures, even when they remain beneath
the surface. The significant growth in commodity prices, as many have
remarked, is a potential source of such pressures. But these play a much
smaller role in determining production costs than pay.
Average earnings
At present, growth in average earnings remains moderate, at a yearly rate of
3 3/4 per cent, having been broadly flat over the past few months. This
should not breed complacency, however. For one things, average earnings are
not a complete measure of labour costs, since they exclude the cost of many
cash and non-cash benefits. As the pay research body, Industrial Relations
Services, points out in its latest monthly bulletin, several of these
excluded costs have been rising in recent months.
While overall employment growth has been slow to appear in this recovery,
the CBI's finding that a growing number of firms is experiencing skilled
labour shortages is also worth worrying about, even if the proportion of
affected firms remains below 10 per cent. Unskilled male unemployment at the
beginning of the 1990s was some five and a half times the figure for skilled
workers, compared to a ratio of three a decade earlier.
Wage developments in the months and years ahead will be the central test of
whether the UK economy is able to deliver a higher level of employment,
while keeping prices stable. But average earnings figures tend to lag behind
developments elsewhere. Mr Clarke does not have the luxury of waiting for
the figures to look significantly more alarming. If he is serious about
inflation, Conservative MPs hoping to escape the year without an interest
rate rise are likely to be disappointed. They may not even reach their party
conference unscathed. Sterling futures are discounting a significant rise in
base rates by the autumn. 'Bleak September, mist and mud, is enough to chill
the blood.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / A long and winding road: Should BT go down the superhighway?
Andrew Adonis looks at the telecommunications company's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'superhighways' of the future have nothing to do with eight-lane
motorways. They are sophisticated telecommunications networks connecting
living rooms and offices that will buzz with inter-active computer
terminals.
If some modern prophets are to be believed, home shopping, games, movies,
lessons, remote diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, information on
virtually anything could be available at the flick of a button, via
fibre-optic telecoms lines - providing a 'communicopia' of new services,
transforming work and leisure patterns.
Some believe the living room will ultimately double as the office for many,
perhaps most, people, as 'teleworking' spreads and commuting becomes a
minority activity.
For British Telecommunications, entering its second decade after
privatisation, assessing and successfully exploiting the growth of
superhighway services is a critical challenge. The task is still greater
because, at the same time, BT is fighting to protect its position in the
existing UK telephony market and attempting to turn itself into a global
company.
Phone boxes now work, call charges are falling, and service quality is far
higher than at the time of privatisation. But the UK's largest company
yearns to be the main UK provider of inter-active services in the next
millennium. 'We will become retailers of anything you can convert into
digital form,' says Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman.
Earning Pounds 60m of profit each week, BT has the resources necessary to
build a superhighway, and it is a match for any other telecoms company in
its access to technological know-how.
Yet for management and employees alike, BT's vision goes hand-in-hand with
deep frustrations. Besides mass redundancies, the company faces tougher
competition at home, a UK regulatory regime that it claims makes
superhighway investments uneconomic, and deep uncertainties about the
strength of demand for new inter-active services.
This week BT received a fillip when the House of Commons trade and industry
committee declared a 'information superhighway' a national priority and
called for a gradual lifting of the ban on BT providing broadcast
entertainment services to homes.
The government has yet to endorse that recommendation. But BT is planning on
the assumption that it will be able to offer a full range of inter-active
services by the late 1990s. It is currently undertaking technical trials at
Ipswich, to be followed next year by commercial trials of home shopping,
video-on-demand and other inter-active services with 2,500 customers in
Colchester. Dr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development, says the first
services could 'follow on from those trials'.
Yet even if regulatory hurdles are lifted, the demand for such services is
questionable. Teleworking has obvious attractions, but it is debatable
whether most businesses or individuals will think it desirable, let alone
feasible.
In the shorter term, it has yet to be shown that services targeted at
residential consumers across inter-active networks - such as home shopping,
teaching packages, video-on-demand and games - can be competitive. Existing
providers, such as video stores, and high-tech alternatives to the network
services, such as CD-Rom discs (advanced multi-media versions of compact
discs which run on personal computers), may be cheaper for consumers than
superhighways.
BT is finding it hard enough to persuade people to use normal home
telephones, which are currently engaged for an average of barely four
minutes a day. Persuading customers to use a telecoms terminal for expensive
multi-media wizardry is a speculative venture.
Furthermore, if telecoms operators can carve out a distinct niche for
inter-active home services, then the main gainers may not be BT but the
cable operators which have had a head start in building inter-active local
networks and already claim 750,000 TV subscribers. Should the cable
operators, mostly backed by large US groups, corner the market for domestic
inter-active services before BT has constructed its 'superhighway', there
may be no room for a BT fibre-optic local network offering the same
services.
All of which makes the battle between BT and its 130 telecoms competitors in
the UK - most of them licensed in the past three years - more than a
straight fight over the existing telephony market. BT still has an 85 per
cent market share but, says Sir Iain, 'this is a war of attrition, and our
strategy has to be to fight every inch of the way'.
To combat domestic competition, Sir Iain's strategy is to turn BT into a
marketing-led company with a reputation for quality. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's
managing director, tells the company's managers he wants BT to be the Marks
and Spencer of the UK telecoms industry. It is more than a quip. A
confidential report to the BT board last spring, based on a survey of
opinion formers, ranked BT's corporate image 7th out of 7 selected blue-chip
UK companies. The top-rated company, with favourable ratings from 91 per
cent of respondents (against 43 per cent for BT) was Marks and Spencer.
Tellingly, the most recent non-executive director to be appointed to the BT
board is Mr Keith Oates, deputy chairman of M&amp;S.
Mr Hepher's mission, strongly backed by Sir Iain, is to carry through a
cultural revolution, eliminating all trace of BT's old utility and monopoly
ethos. To lead the revolution Mr Hepher, an outsider recruited by Sir Iain
three years ago from Abbey Life, the insurance group, has been steadily
filling the top executive posts with fellow outsiders.
'We are continually winnowing out the old-style managers,' says Sir Iain,
emphasising that customer-responsiveness and an appreciation of the need for
change are the qualities he most values in his managers. BT's management
board, which Mr Hepher chairs, has been renamed the 'group quality council.'
Of its nine members, only two are career BT executives: the other seven are
recent recruits from companies as diverse as IBM, Black &amp; Decker, and US
West, the US regional phone company. Another former IBM executive, Mr Howard
Ford, has just been appointed to head Cellnet, BT's cellular network joint
venture with Securicor.
In the business sector, where Mercury, BT's main rival in the UK, is
well-established, Mr Hepher has been masterminding a 'win back' campaign,
emphasising the quality of BT service. In the domestic sector, a recent
marketing blitz has concentrated on getting people to realise how cheap it
is to use the phone. BT staff in all sectors are being familiarised in basic
marketing techniques.
The strategy appears to be bearing fruit. In the past year BT has increased
its inland traffic by 7 per cent and its international traffic by 5 per cent
 -more than compensating for the loss of business to Mercury, cable
operators, and other competitors. According to Robert Fleming, the brokers,
BT is adding phone connections at the rate of 100,000 a month, including
cellular and land-based lines, which is four times its rate of loss to cable
operators. Daiwa Research estimates that BT will still have 90 per cent of
local phone connections in 2000, and that its share of revenue will have
fallen only to about 80 per cent of the total.
As well as securing its future UK base, BT has set out to build a
significant international business. Abroad, as at home, its ambition is to
dominate. 'We would expect to be number one in the globalisation of
telecommunications,' says Sir Iain. 'A lot of it has to do with surprising
the enemy, then dislocating the enemy, then advancing into his territory.'
In June last year BT forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second
largest US operator. BT's strategy is to make Concert, its joint venture
with MCI, the main provider of international telecoms services to
multinationals, as corporate life becomes a true 'global village' which can
be serviced by single telecoms operators. The deal is an integral part of
BT's superhighways vision, piggy-backing advanced business services onto
networks operated mainly by other companies.
It faces tough competition abroad from AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, and
from the French and German state operators, which earlier this summer forged
a Dollars 4bn alliance with Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance
operator. But most observers put BT at least six months ahead of its
international rivals in terms of concrete services.
Sir Iain says BT has a a 'nuclear deterrent' - the possibility of using its
alliance with MCI to break the existing cartel of national telecoms
operators which keeps international phone calls artificially expensive. To
do so would be a huge gamble for BT, which gains from the existing
arrangements. But the dividends for the first operator to bust the cartel
could be equally large.
BT's global ambitions, however, may be held back by trouble on the home
front. It faces deep discontent among its workforce amid large scale
redundancies and continual management change. In the past four years BT has
shed a third of its workforce - 90,000 employees, more than the total
manpower of the Royal Air Force and Royal Marines combined. An employees'
meeting earlier this week brought the discontent into the open -
particularly among managers, who are bearing the brunt of this year's
redundancies. One graduate trainee said that she had joined the company with
28 others, but the best ten had now left.
'There is a time of a maximum uncertainty, when people know the numbers but
not what it is going to mean for them,' says Sir Iain. But it is not past.
Further massive redundancies are in the offing, and Sir Iain will give no
guarantee that compulsory redundancies will be avoided.
Yet nobody believes that the clock can be turned back. Privatisation,
competition and the convergence of media are facts of life, and BT's
managers realise they have no choice but to ensure the company is able to
take advantage of those changes - and exploit the arrival of the new
superhighways. In a recent book* examining BT's post-1984 experience, Mr
Kenneth Baker, the minister responsible for privatisation, recalls: 'when I
went to other European countries explaining liberalisation and
privatisation, I was treated as a sort of lunatic . . . who was breaking up
a natural monopoly'. Ten years on, the lunatics are triumphing the world
over.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Man in the News: More and less than the sum of his parts -
Henry Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Congressman Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican, is a former Rhodes scholar not
above occasionally flashing his erudition. His disquisition opening the
second day of the House banking committee's Whitewater hearings contained
references to ancient Egypt, Copernican astronomy and the American
revolution. Here, verbatim, is what he got in response.
'I will reserve for the record my observations on the history of the
Ptolemaic world and point out to the gentleman that, in geometry, foremost
mathematicians like Thales, who was most famous for saying that what one
fool could do another could too, always in bringing forth the geometric
basic truths, would always say QED - quod erat demonstrandum - that is, it
remains to be proved and now it has been proved. And what the gentleman has
said is, given his interpretation and prognostication of witnesses yet to be
heard or those that have been heard, and I was hoping that that would have
been a summing up at the end of the witnesses.'
That was pure Henry Barbosa Gonzalez: the hint of scholarship, the mangling
of the language, the iron fist in the courteous velvet glove. All these, and
quite a bit more, including a legendary temper, were on display this week.
The venerable chairman of the banking committee took it upon himself to
ensure that the first congressional crack at the tangled skein known
generically as Whitewater stuck to rules which he had been instrumental in
crafting and which were designed to limit any damage to a Democratic
president and White House. 'This is not a trial,' he declared on day one,
and then set out to be both judge and jury.
It was a performance that drove Republicans on the committee, including Mr
Leach, to paroxysms of frustration, as the chairman routinely gavelled them
out of order and cut them off when their allotted five minutes of
questioning had expired. It even elicited an editorial in the nominally
liberal New York Times, headlined 'Censorship, Gonzalez Style', complaining
that 'the irascible Texan has twisted the already stringent rules to make it
virtually impossible for members to develop a continuous, productive line of
inquiry into even the narrow matter at hand.' Even some Clinton supporters
wondered, privately, if he was not going too far.
Fitting Henry Gonzalez, 78 and in his 34th year in Congress, into a neat box
is not possible. He may be variously and accurately described as a pure
populist (he would abolish the Federal Reserve system, symbol of big money),
a blind Democratic partisan (he wanted to impeach Presidents Reagan and Bush
over the invasion of Grenada, Iran-Contra and the Gulf war), and a fearless
investigator (into failed savings and loans companies, BCCI and Iraq).
He is also well-read (fond of mixing Shakespeare and Mexican poetry),
incorruptible (he shuns the Washington social circuit and goes home most
weekends), a loose cannon (capable of abrupt changes of mind) and an
autocrat who more than once has decked a political critic with his fists. He
is in fact all of the above, but contradictions render him both more and
less than the sum of his parts.
He was born in San Antonio in 1916, five years after his family had fled
Mexico to escape Pancho Villa's revolution. His Basque ancestors had come to
Mexico in the 16th century and were big silver mine operators, with
political clout, but he was raised in straitened circumstances not improved
in the Depression.
Still, he acquired engineering and law degrees and entered social work. In
1956, he became the first Mexican-American in more than 100 years to be
elected to the Texas senate, making a name fighting discrimination and
poverty. After two failed bids for the governorship and Lyndon Johnson's old
House seat, he won a special election to Congress from San Antonio in 1961
and has not faced a serious challenge since.
Perhaps taking a cue from another legendary Texas populist, Wright Patman,
he made the banking committee, with its broad remit, the vehicle for his
congressional career, being elected chairman in 1989. In this role, Mr
Gonzalez's non-partisan side was apparent whenever financial malfeasance was
involved: four of the five US senators censured for taking payments from
Charles Keating, chairman of the defunct Lincoln savings and loan company,
were Democrats, while Clark Clifford, the Democratic lawyer, was not spared
over BCCI.
Curiously, whenever the committee is about its usual business, Mr Gonzalez
runs it loosely, often losing procedural votes in spite of its 30-20
Democratic majority and sometimes appearing uninterested in the substance of
legislation. One of the biggest admirers of his style as chairman used to be
Jim Leach, the ranking minority member.
On Whitewater, Mr Gonzalez initially resisted congressional hearings, saying
they would jeopardise inquiries by Robert Fiske, the special counsel.
Earlier this year he told Mr Leach it would be 'a cold day in Manila' before
he allowed his committee to get involved.
Just to rub it in, and breaching congressional decorum, he accused the mild
Iowan of being obdurate, premeditated and wilfully disobedient. Days later
he acceded to hearings, saying 'the country deserves a chance to expose the
Republican witch hunt for what it is'.
The problem for Mr Gonzalez is that he can only keep a lid on those
Whitewater matters before his panel. Leaks from other committee staffs are
rampant, though they have not amounted to much. Yesterday the Senate banking
committee got into the act under looser rules and under the direction of
Senator Don Riegle (coincidentally a Democratic member of the Keating Five
and Senator Al D'Amato (the New York Republican irreverently known as
Senator Quid Pro Quo).
Simultaneously, whatever the convincing protestations of innocence before
the banking committee this week by Lloyd Cutler and Bernard Nussbaum,
present and past White House counsel, trouble seems afoot at the Treasury.
Roger Altman, the deputy, and Ms Jean Hansen, the chief lawyer, both face
tough questioning next week and either could end up as a sacrificial lamb.
Yet it would require a wild stretch of the imagination to compare the week's
hearings, in terms of drama or content, to the great congressional fora of
the past - dealing with Watergate, Iran-Contra and the Clarence Thomas
nomination to the Supreme Court. Cable TV channels covered the hearings but
the commercial networks did not, though yesterday they suspended all regular
daytime programmes for a court appearance by O J Simpson.
Henry Gonzalez was not the only star of the week. His light-hearted foil,
Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, pricked Republican bubbles of
outrage and definitely produced the best one-liner after exchanges featuring
much legal jargon: 'I am waiting to be shown a redactive recusal.'
But the words most often heard came from the chair. 'The time of the
gentleman has expired.' It was, of course, not applied to himself.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Jump in cost of materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prices paid by manufac-turers for materials are rising sharply,
according to the latest purchasing managers' index, increasing fears that
inflation may be set to accelerate.
The purchasing managers' index, produced by the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, reached a record seasonally adjusted level of 62.2
per cent in July, from 61.3 per cent in June. The institute seasonally
adjusted the index for the first time in July - had it not done so, the
index would have recorded a small fall.
The index is a weighted average of several factors such as order books,
delivery times and prices. Any figure above 50 per cent indicates an
increase in activity over the previous month. The repeated highs achieved by
the index suggest that economic activity has been strengthening this year.
However, the strength of the economy is causing some capacity constraints
and price pressures. Suppliers' delivery times are lengthening as they
struggle to fulfil new orders. This in turn is putting upward pressure on
prices. The prices component of the index reached a record high in July,
with a price increase on items such as paper, packaging, timber, aluminium,
methanol and steel products.
The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly trends survey, published
earlier this week, also showed evidence of inflationary pressure, with an
increase in the number of companies planning to raise prices.
However, Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets,
downplayed the significance of the price findings. 'It tracks producer input
prices rather than output prices. All it is telling us is that commodity
prices have gone up, which we knew already.'
The institute, which interviewed 280 purchasing managers, also reported that
output is at its highest level since July 1991, and that recruitment rose
this month.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Tory whips aim to stem tide of defeats in Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government business managers plan a thorough overhaul of consultation and
information-gathering in the House of Lords in an effort to curb
embarrassing defeats.
By keeping its ear close to the ground, the energetic - and surprisingly
youthful - new government whips team in the upper house hopes to make sure
that potential flashpoints are defused early.
The initiative follows a session during which peers savaged the criminal
justice bill and other measures.
Last week's ministerial reshuffle included sweeping changes in the upper
house. Lord Cranborne, 47, replaced the 62-year-old Lord Wakeham as Lords
leader and five of the seven posts in the government whips' office changed
hands.
Lord Strathclyde, 34, the new chief whip, has served in four government
departments. The Earl of Arran, 56, the new deputy chief whip, is also an
experienced minister.
An early signal that Lord Cranborne is likely to devote more time than his
predecessor to hands-on management of the upper house came last week when
Downing Street announced that Mr David Hunt, chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, would become chairman of many of the cabinet committees
previously led by Lord Wakeham.
Among possible plans is the introduction of a more structured way for
backbench peers to get access to the leader of the house and the chief whip
over specific grievances.
By adopting a more rigorous approach than has been needed in the past,
business managers hope to ensure that Tory peers think long and hard before
voting against the government.
Some experienced Lords observers expect the authority of the new team to be
enhanced by the fact that both the house leader and the chief whip are
hereditary peers.
They say some peers were resentful that so many recent Lords leaders have
been relatively recent arrivals from the House of Commons.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the MP for Hove for more than 20 years, is to leave the
Commons at the next election.
Mr Sainsbury had a majority of 12,268 over Labour at the last election. He
resigned as industry minister in the reshuffle last week.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Lloyd's changes tack on three-year accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday signalled the probable end of the archaic
requirement for underwriting syndicates to report their results over a
three-year period.
The corporation said it was considering removing the financial practice
which is linked to nautical traditions as old as the 300-year-old insurance
market itself.
The move is partly a symbolic modernisation but is also likely to have
widespread implications in releasing profits more quickly to both corporate
capital and Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported
the market.
The practice of using three-year accounting periods for syndicates is rooted
in the origins of Lloyd's, which derived its business from insuring trading
ships on their voyages around the world.
Three years was the time it took before ocean-going vessels returned to dock
in England, at the end of which underwriters would know for certain the size
of any claims on which they were expected to pay.
Since then the range of insurance activities underwritten at Lloyd's has
diversified and the reasons for the practice have been lost in history.
Lloyd's said yesterday: 'A three-year return voyage to the Spice Islands
can't really be equated with an aircraft crash or the sales rep driving
around the M25 in a car.'
The Lloyd's market and regulatory boards have both in principle agreed to
allow syndicates to reduce the three-year accounting period to two years.
A further progression to one-year accounts - in line with the practice of
most companies and other organisations which issue financial statements - is
likely to follow.
The modification still requires the approval of the Lloyd's Council, which
meets next Wednesday, and further details are likely to be released by
October.
Under the changes - which will be voluntary - an interim payment from the
1993 underwriting year could be paid during 1995.
The first two-year accounting cycle would start with the 1994 year, allowing
it to close at the end of 1995 with profits distributed during 1996.
The result would be that loss-making Names would be able to offset their
outstanding losses more quickly against profits generated by the syndicates
of which they are members.
Some predictions suggest that across the market there will be modest losses
in 1992 but that 1993 is likely to be profitable after several years of
heavy losses.

FT  30 JUL 94 / DTI uncovers insolvency breaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 9 per cent of insolvency practitioners inspected by the Department of
Trade and Industry in the past year seriously breached their obligations
under the law, a report said yesterday.
Of 160 monitoring visits made in the 12 months to April, reports were
produced on 14 which identified 'significant compliance problems'.
The problems, all of which have been referred to the relevant professional
bodies for regulatory action, included subcontracting of work without
adequate controls and payments for the introduction of insolvency work.
In addition, a further six practitioners were subject to 'detailed special
inspections'. Eight practitioners were under inquiry at the end of the year;
another has been charged with criminal offences and is awaiting trial.
The details emerged, under the government's Next Steps programme, in the
annual report of the Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the DTI.
Other failures identified included poor financial records and failure to
keep adequate administrative records, including the approval of
remuneration.
The compliance failures come in spite of initia-tives over the past few
months by the insolvency profession to develop a self-regulatory regime as a
result of pressure from the Insolvency Service.
There were 1,961 licenced insolvency practitioners in the UK last year, down
from 1,993 in 1992. They come under the control of seven professional bodies
as well as some directly supervised by the DTI.
Mr Peter Joyce, inspector-general and chief executive of the Insolvency
Service, says in the report that it planned a further 'significant increase'
in the volume of prosecutions and disqualifications this year.
The comments follow a highly critical report last year by the National Audit
Office, the public spending watchdog, into the relatively low volume of
disqualifications.
Mr Joyce says the service 'continued to struggle to achieve its targets' in
the face of a backlog of 57,000 uncompleted case files of collapsed
companies and bankrupt individuals being examined in the middle of last
year.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Pension members win costs ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of pension schemes taking legal action over alleged mishandling of
fund assets were placed in a stronger position yesterday by a Court of
Appeal ruling that they can be awarded costs from pension funds before cases
reach court.
Three judges upheld a High Court decision granting a 'pre-emptive costs
order' to the beneficiaries of the pension scheme run by Melton Medes, a
trading conglomerate.
The members allege fund assets were improperly handled when a Pounds 5m loan
was made from the fund to the company and later repaid. They are claiming
Pounds 7m compensation.
The members have argued they could not pursue their case without the costs
order applied for after their union, the GPMU print union, had to stop
funding the action.
In reaching their decision the judges made clear they were responding to
concerns expressed by the pension law review committee headed by Professor
Roy Goode. The committee had called on the judiciary to set clear guidelines
for pre-emptive costs orders for pension case litigants.
Concern has centred on the inability of pension fund members to bring legal
action when they are ineligible for legal aid.
Lord Justice Hoffman warned that their decision might not be confined to
pension cases and could have implications for all trust litigation.

FT  30 JUL 94 / MPs urge more economic debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Tories are adding their weight to Labour calls for the government to
earmark more time for debating economic issues as part of a package of
parliamentary reforms.
Sir Terence Higgins, MP for Worthing and chairman of the liaison committee
of select-committee chairmen, is worried that the move to a unified Budget
has resulted in fewer appearances before MPs by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor.
Sir Terence, a highly respected senior backbencher, used a recent Commons
debate to say that he could not remember an occasion in the last 30 years
when a chancellor had gone as long as seven months without addressing the
Commons.
He described the move to a unified Budget as 'pretty disastrous' in
procedural terms. 'As a result of that change, opportunities to debate the
most important area of policy - economic policy - have been seriously
eroded,' Sir Terence said.
His comments come as talks between the two main parties aimed at coming up
with a package of procedural reforms are said to be making headway. Mr Tony
Newton, the leader of the Commons, told MPs before the summer recess that
'good progress' on identifying a package of reforms had been made - although
'a good deal of detailed work remains to be done'.
His feelings were echoed by Mr Nick Brown, his Labour shadow, who said he
hoped proposals could soon be put to MPs 'that may well apply in the next
session'.
The number of late-night sittings and the format of prime minister's
questions are understood to be among the subjects the two sides are
discussing.
The reform initiative followed a call by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
last month for some of parliament's antiquated procedures to be overhauled.
The government is hoping to introduce a controversial bill increasing
Britain's contribution to the European Union budget early in the next
parliamentary session, starting in November, having been prevented from
legislating in the last session by a dispute in the EU council of ministers.
The bill - giving force to changes in the EU's funding system in line with
the agreement at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 - is almost
certain to be opposed by Tory Euro-sceptics.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Court move on 'pirate' TV card ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading distributor of 'pirate' satellite television cards is going to the
High Court next week to try to win the right to sell the cards in the UK.
Mr David Lyons will ask permission to withdraw a voluntary undertaking not
to distribute the cards in the UK which he made pending the full hearing of
an action launched against him by British Sky Broadcasting. BSkyB said
yesterday it would vigorously resist any attempt to withdraw the
undertaking.
The High Court hearing follows an action in the Irish courts in January when
BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
stake - was refused a restraining order against Mr Lyons pending a full
trial.
BSkyB claimed its code had been copied by Mr Lyons, infringing its rights
under copyright law. The court rejected the claim because BSkyB had failed
to produce sufficient evidence that there had been an infringement of
copyright. Mr Lyons is seeking to raise the same issues in the High Court.
He said yesterday: 'If I win I will be able to sell cards outside News
Datacom (the News Corporation subsidiary that manufactures the smart cards
for Sky Television).'
BSkyB knocked out all the pirates in May when it distributed new, more
sophisticated cards, known as the series nine cards, to more than 3m
subscribers. Overnight, viewers with pirate cards were unable to watch
subscription channels. Since then, the pirates have been working to beat the
new BSkyB smart cards.
Mr Lyons said yesterday that he now had a card that would decode all BSkyB
channels and planned to start selling them in Ireland next week.
Last year the Financial Times wrote to Mr Lyons' company Satellite Decoding
Systems and bought a pirate decoder card which worked perfectly.
It is claimed that a number of other pirating systems are about to come on
the market. One, called Phoenix, can reactivate cancelled cards. Others, say
pirates, can upgrade legitimate basic BSkyB cards so that they can receive
every channel. The basic package costs Pounds 6.99 a month - the entire
package, Pounds 19.99.
BSkyB executives privately express scepticism that the new card has been
cracked by pirates.
BSkyB and News Datacom insist that they will continue to take a wide range
of legal and technical measures against the pirates. Distributing or using
pirate subscription television cards is illegal in the UK.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Car registrations 'set to beat 2m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing the UK's 7,000 franchised
dealers and other independent motor traders, yesterday raised its forecast
for new-car registrations this year to more than 2m.
The first 2m-plus projection to be made by a big industry association came
as dealers were engaged in a flurry of activity to deliver the first
M-registered cars to customers when the plate becomes legal at midnight on
Sunday.
The federation's latest figure of 2.01m units compares with its previous
forecast of between 1.8m and 1.9m. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, the largest trade and lobby organisation, is predicting 1.95m.
The federation's upward revision, the second this year, reflects consistent
buoyancy in the marketplace - but also 'intensive marketing activity by
manufacturers and dealers', said Mr Neil Marshall, the federation's policy
director. Mr Marshall said the activity was expected to 'force'
registrations beyond the 2m mark.
The federation would not clarify Mr Marshall's remarks, but it is understood
to have concluded that manufacturer pressure to 'move metal' is exaggerating
the true size of the market through dealers pre-registering cars without
buyers, and which may be later have to be sold as 'nearly-new' vehicles
through auctions and other outlets.
Registrations in the first half of this year have already reached 956,000
and the society has predicted 500,000 registrations for August - in spite of
a survey commissioned by National Breakdown showing more than half of
motorists want the annual registration change scrapped.
The survey found that 34 per cent of motorists considered it an 'excuse' for
the trade to increase prices, and 27 per cent viewed it as an 'exercise in
snobbery'.
Of the 500,000 August registrations expected, manufacturers' order books for
companies such as Citroen, Peugeot and Volkswagen indicate that more than
100,000 of the total will be diesel cars, confirming their status as the
fastest-growing sector of the car market.
According to Citroen, on some of its model ranges such as the ZX estate,
diesel versions are outselling their petrol equivalents.
In a further survey by Volkswagen, in which 63,000 car owners were
questioned, 10 per cent were found to drive diesel cars - but 30 per cent
said they would be buying a diesel when their car was replaced.
More than 340,000 diesel cars were sold in the UK last year.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is ending production of its Pounds 170,000 Corniche
convertible and similar Bentley Continental models after 23 years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for financial advisers, has become involved
in an apparent misunderstanding with one of its members - Knight Williams -
over the need for stronger compliance measures.
The regulator said it had suggested that Knight Williams' compliance
function should be strengthened with a senior appointment that had its
approval.
However, Mr John Williams, Knight Williams managing director, said the
recent appointment of Mr Colin Pinnell, formerly head of legal services at
Fimbra, to oversee its legal and compliance department had 'nothing to do
with any suggestion from Fimbra,' which had 'never said to us that we should
strengthen our team'.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Agency chief's dual role rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday admonished ministers for the way they handled a potential
conflict of interest over the government agency which regulates food
imports, James Blitz writes.
The Commons agriculture committee expressed concern in a report that a
conflict of interest could have arisen over the role of Mr John Ellis, the
chief executive of Fyffes, the banana importer, who is also chairman of the
Intervention Board Executive Agency.
Mr Ellis has chaired the intervention board for the past eight years. The
board, which is operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
administers the Common Agricultural Policy in the UK and issues licences for
food export and import.
The potential conflict of interest over his role arose last year when the
board was required to license banana imports following a European Union
directive. The committee said that this appeared to place Mr Ellis in an
'awkward position', as the Fyffes group is one of the largest importers of
bananas.
The committee said yesterday that it did not allege 'any impropriety
whatsoever' against Mr Ellis. It also noted that his job 'does not involve
him in day to-day operations of the agency', which has also ensured that Mr
Ellis does not see confidential papers relating to regulation of the banana
sector.
However, the committee said it was 'absolutely unacceptable' that a chairman
of the intervention board should be in a position where he was excluded from
the operations of the organisation in an important sector.
The MPs added: 'We recommend that (the ministry) take steps to ensure that
the problem is swiftly rectified and that no such potential conflict of
interest occur in senior positions in the future.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Group 4 to run middle-risk prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Group 4, the security company, increased its strong position in Britain's
emerging private prison market by winning the contract to run Buckley Hall
prison at Rochdale, Greater Manchester, yesterday.
Buckley Hall will house 350 medium-risk category C convicted prisoners,
helping to ease pressure on prison spaces in the north-west. Group 4 already
runs Wolds prison on Humberside and operates the service escorting prisoners
to court in the east midlands and Yorkshire.
The contract will be worth Pounds 33m over five years. Group 4's bid, which
was not the lowest, was selected over three others from the private sector
and a fourth from an in-house public-sector team.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, confirmed that the
in-house bid had been 'very good', and Ms Joan Ruddock, shadow home affairs
minister, immediately wrote to the government asking why it had been
rejected.
She said: 'Only last month the Commons public accounts committee discovered
that Group 4's running of Wolds was costing Pounds 1m more than its original
tender, yet today the government rewards the same private interests.'
Mr Lewis said the Prison Service had been spoilt for choice by the bids.
Growing experience of tendering to manage prisons was now generating
high-quality bids from both the private and public sectors.
Buckley Hall, a former junior detention centre, has been rebuilt in less
than a year to rehouse adult prisoners - making it Britain's fastest-built
jail in modern times. It will open in December, and create 150 full-time
jobs.
The award of the Buckley Hall contract marks the start of a further phase of
market testing of prison management and advancing private-sector
involvement.
Invitations to tender for two big prisons to be built in Liverpool and south
Wales have just gone out.
The private sector is being asked to finance, design, build and manage these
projects, and private prison operators are linking with construction
companies to prepare bids - Group 4 will be bidding in conjunction with
Tarmac.
The government also plans to ask the private sector to bid to manage some
established public prisons; the first one or two prisons selected for this
process will be named in the autumn.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Society man signs up for the club: The IoD's new
director-general is determined to make his mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the busy boss of a Pounds 35bn business, Mr Tim Melville-Ross could be
forgiven for not getting around to joining the Institute of Directors.
But he has been wise enough to sign up in good time for his arrival on
Monday as the institute's new director-general.
The one-time stockbroker and oil industry man who, for the past 10 years,
has been chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, admits to
finally enlisting only after the Pounds 180,000-a-year IoD job came up - but
before he knew he would get it.
He confessed: 'By the time anyone asked me if I was a member I was able to
answer 'yes' truthfully.'
Eyebrows have been raised about his readiness to step down from the top of
Britain's second-largest building society to run what some in the business
community regard as little more than a fancy club with grand ideas.
Mr Melville-Ross explained: 'I said when I became Nationwide chief executive
I would do it for 10 years. It was enough for me and enough for the
Nationwide.
'I did not then want to go and run another business in a narrow sense and
was looking for something which involved participating in the political
process.'
Mr Melville-Ross is keen to engage in public-policy debate and then to act
as a forceful advocate for IoD views. At 49, he takes over at the Pall Mall
headquarters from Mr Peter Morgan, a fiery, free-market salesman who
relished the opportunity to make waves.
His successor is a more considered, consensual, low-key sort of chap who,
nevertheless, is determined to leave his mark on an organisation which he
accepts may be widely misunderstood and underrated.
The new director-general, although anxious not to criticise his predecessor,
appears impatient with the lingering image of the IoD as a bolt-hole for
unreconstructed right-wingers. He intends it to be seen as a serious
champion of free enterprise and business integrity with views that count.
He added: 'The rightwing label is much abused. It is no longer a rightwing
proposition to say wealth creation is a good thing, provided you create it
within a defined set of civilised values.
'It is not rightwing to say the idea of full employment is nonsense. In the
same way you have to have empty homes to make the housing market work, you
need a stock of unemployed people to make the labour market work.'
Pursuing his thesis, Mr Melville-Ross said his wish to see the education
system further 'privatised' was not a rightwing stance.
'I think it is wrong for someone in my financial position to have my
children's university education subsidised by people far less able to afford
it than me. If that view is rightwing then I'm a Dutchman.'
Mr Melville-Ross stressed that he has never been 'a raving Conservative or
socialist or whatever', but he has long experience of nudging ministerial
elbows.
Cuddling up to a particular administration, he stressed, can have its
drawbacks, so contacts will be made across the political spectrum. If a
Labour government is elected, he will start on good terms with several of
its senior figures.
Mr Melville-Ross acknowledged unflattering comparisons with the
Confederation of British Industry - the employers' body with which he
intends to forge closer links - but denied that the IoD is less in touch
with business or less influential with government. He added: 'We should not,
in any case, view each other in a competitive way. If it is possible to
develop similar positions on key policy areas, then that will be a very
powerful combination.'
The IoD, he emphasised, is not about to embark on a root-and-branch overhaul
of policy, although he has given himself and his colleagues three months to
review it. Then, he said, the organisation will have to present its views in
'a more coherent way'.
He hinted that he might want a more streamlined policy-making process and,
without uttering any threats, said he intends to run a 'very crisp'
organisation.
Mr Melville-Ross accepts that he comes to the job at a time when the
reputation of the business community has taken some tough knocks. He largely
rejects the image of directors as 'grasping and overpaid', although he has
no time for rewarding failure.
'I have no problems at all with giving very high rewards for success that
helps create wealth and which, in turn, sustains businesses and jobs,' he
said. 'But we have to find ways of avoiding situations where someone who has
manifestly failed walks away with half a million pounds. It has to be wrong
and it has to be stopped.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Kinnock will urge participation in Maastricht social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will come under increased pressure to participate in the social
chapter of the Maastricht treaty from Mr Neil Kinnock, whose appointment as
a British member of the European Commission was confirmed yesterday.
The former Labour leader angered Tory MPs by immediately making known his
intention to seek to overturn the opt-out secured by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, from the regulations that can be imposed on employers from
Brussels.
Mr Kinnock's appointment to the Pounds 103,000-a-year post was welcomed by
Mr Tony Blair, the new leader of the Labour party.
Mr Blair said: 'He will be a great asset both to Britain and Europe and I
wish him every success.'
Mr Kinnock explained why he would back the demands that Britain should keep
in line with the other member states of the European Union by accepting the
social chapter. He said: 'It is a modest way of defining basic standards for
workforces.'
He emphasised that there were several countries and many employers in Europe
who took strong exception to the possibility that, while free from the
obligation to comply with the social chapter, Britain would become a place
for 'social dumping'.
Mr Kinnock said: 'My general disposition is to seek to ensure that none of
the employers in the EU are disadvantaged in their relationships one with
the other.'
Sir Leon Brittan, the former Conservative cabinet minister, will continue as
Britain's senior representative at the European Commission.
The government is expected to exert strong pressure in Brussels to ensure
that Mr Kinnock's role in the commission covers overseas development - a
policy area in which he has always been closely interested.
Mr Kinnock's wife, Glenys, became one of the Welsh Labour members of the
European parliament in June.
Mr Kinnock's departure from Westminster will necessitate a by-election in
his Islwyn constituency, a Welsh Labour stronghold, which he has represented
since 1983. He had a majority of 24,728 at the last election. Before that he
represented the former Bedwellty constituency from 1970.
Mr Kinnock led the Labour party for nine years, resigning in 1992 after the
party's second general-election defeat under his leadership.

The announcement came amid growing doubts in the gas industry that the
government is still committed to the plan it announced last December to
phase in domestic competition, beginning in 1996.
The inquiry, which will start immediately after parliament returns from its
summer recess, will examine 'the timing and the manner of opening up the
domestic gas market to competition'.
It will also look at the possible impact of competition on gas prices for
various types of consumer. Safety, security of supply and standards of
service will also be examined.
Ofgas, the industry's regulator, said it did not expect the parliamentary
inquiry to affect its effort to develop detailed plans to open up the
residential market to competition.
The Gas Consumers Council welcomed the announcement. Mr Ian Powe, the
council's director, said it should make the present consultation process
between the government, the regulator and industry more open.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Gummer issues Pounds 2m writ for BT rent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday issued a writ against
British Telecommunications claiming more than Pounds 2.2m in rent and
interest.
Mr Gummer alleges that since Christmas day, BT has failed to pay Pounds 2.1m
of rent for the 15 floors of the Euston Tower, in north-west London, that it
leases from the department through an underlease.
Mr Gummer also claims that BT, through two other underleases, owes another
Pounds 123,000 for 50 parking spaces and rooms it rents in the tower's
basement.
The writ comes as BT, which has one of the largest corporate property
portfolios in the UK, presses on with plans to cut its holdings from 75m sq
ft to 15m sq ft by 2010.
In particular BT is looking at properties where leases are ending,
properties with long leases, where there is a notice to break a lease, and
where there is a sub-leased property.
A BT spokesman said he knew of 'no connection between the writ and our
property disposals'.
He added that the writ had not yet been served on the company.
The Euston Tower is owned by British Land.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Lottery consortium names the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's first multi-million-pound National Lottery draw will take place
live on BBC television on November 19, less than six months after the
Camelot consortium was chosen as the preferred operator.
The announcement of the launch date came yesterday as Camelot was formally
awarded its licence by Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National
Lottery and the lottery operator unveiled its logo - a smiling hand with
crossed fingers.
The logo, created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Design and chosen from more than 100
designs, was claimed to represent everything from fun, friendliness and
approachability to hope, anticipation and honesty.
Anyone who has chosen the numbers in any order could win Pounds 2m although
the odds are almost 14m-1 against. Although the size of the prizes will
normally be influenced by the number of Pounds 1 lottery tickets sold in any
week it is likely there will be a minimum jackpot of Pounds 2m for the first
draw.
The licence, which will run until the end of September 2001, closely follows
the draft licence published last year except that the commitments made by
Camelot when it applied for the licence have been incorporated. These range
from the percentage of ticket sales that will go in prizes to the
percentages of revenues that will go to five good causes: the arts,
charities, a millennium fund, national heritage and sport.
The percentage of prize money before deduction of 12 per cent lottery duty
ranges from a low of 47.2 per cent of ticket sales in the 1995 financial
year ending March 31 to a high of 50.65 per cent the following year.
At ticket sales of between Pounds 750m to Pounds 1.5bn a year the percentage
going to good causes will range from 21.66 per cent to 26.8 per cent.
If the lottery has revenues of more than Pounds 3.5bn a year - which is
thought to be possible - the good causes will get between 31.35 per cent and
34.005 per cent.
Companies in the Camelot consortium are: Cadbury Schweppes, the food and
drinks group; security printer De La Rue; computer company ICL; Racal
Electronics; and GTech, the US company which claims to be the world's
biggest lottery operator. It said yesterday the project was on track for the
launch. Manufacture of the computer terminals has begun and more than 8,000
of the 10,000 retail outlets needed for the launch have signed up.

FT  30 JUL 94 / P&amp;O threat over animal welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O, one of the largest cross-Channel ferry companies, yesterday threatened
to stop transporting vehicles carrying animals for slaughter unless European
farm ministers agreed on improved standards.
The company set next October as the deadline for an 'imminent prospect' of
European Union legislation to deal with the mounting controversy over
conditions for live export.
Lord Sterling, P&amp;O chairman, said last night that the company had acted
after reviewing legislation on animal transport standards. This had shown
that there was 'no way' these could be enforced.
P&amp;O's decision follows an increasingly vociferous campaign by animal-rights
groups against the conditions in which sheep and cattle are transported to
continental slaughterhouses. Animals often travel for several days in packed
lorries without food or water. Last month, Mr Alan Clark, the former trade
minister and campaigner against animal cruelty, joined other activists in
calling for a boycott of cross-Channel ferry companies which transported
animals for slaughter.
Lord Sterling said that his decision to put pressure on government was not
out of concern for the damage that a boycott might do to his company. 'It's
deeper than that,' he said. 'There are certain subjects that go beyond
commercial considerations.'
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, said the government was
determined to make progress on the issue without causing unfair disadvantage
to British farmers. But 'those urging precipitate action would do nothing to
protect travelling animals in the long term, and would impose an immediate
damaging effect on a trade already going through a difficult period'.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Video project chief loses post in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications has broken up the division which helped to
develop and promote video-on-demand, leaving its director Mr Steve Maine
without a formal post.
Mr Maine, who has been at BT for 20 years, ran the Visual and Broadcast
Services division from 1991.
The division was responsible for such activities as video conferencing,
satellite-data broadcasting and the provision of communication networks for
broadcasters.
The development of video-on-demand, which also included a wide range of home
services using the telephone network, was potentially the division's biggest
project.
Technical trials of video-on-demand, sending VHS-quality pictures down
telephone lines at the same time as the line is being used for conversation,
are nearing completion.
Marketing trials involving between 2,000 and 2,500 homes are scheduled to
start later this year or early next year.
If BT decides to go ahead with what it calls inter-active multimedia
services the investment would probably amount to several billion pounds.
Sophisticated computer databases would have to be installed at telephone
exchanges.
Earlier this year Mr Maine told delegates at a Financial Times conference:
'If you are in the home-entertainment business, think beyond the existing
boundaries of your industry - talk to us at BT.'
The video-on-demand project has now gone to ICE - the BT division
responsible for information, communication and entertainment. Mr Rupert
Gavin, a marketing director from retail group Dixons, has been brought in to
run the division. The appointment reflects the strategy of Mr Michael
Hepher, BT's group managing director, to make the organisation more
marketing-led.
Mr Maine is said to be carrying out 'a special project' and an announcement
about his new job in BT is expected 'in due course'. Mr Maine, who is on
holiday, was unavailable for comment.
BT satellite services will become part of the international communications
division. Video conferencing will go to business communications. BT
emphasised that the restructuring did not mean any lessening of its
commitment to interactive multimedia.

Three businessmen jailed for fraud after the longest criminal trial in
English legal history failed yesterday in appeals against their convictions.
The Court of Appeal rejected argument that the 253-day Brittania Park trial
was so long and complex that the jury must have been unable to concentrate
sufficiently to reach a safe and satisfactory verdict.
Mr Peter Kellard, Mr Edward Dwyer and Mr John Wright, former chairman of the
Derbyshire theme park, were convicted in 1992 of offences including
fraudulent trading.

Lord Archer refused to make any comment on the handling by Mr Michael

<TEXT>
The receiver to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, said
yesterday that the price offered by the sole prospective bidder for the
company as a going concern was significantly below Pounds 5m, and
substantially less than the business's break-up value, Chris Tighe writes.
The comments from joint receiver Mr Ed James of Price Waterhouse underlined
how poor the prospects now are of saving north-east England's last
shipbuilder. Mr James said this week's bid from Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie was less than half the Pounds 10m figure discussed earlier this
year. Swans' break-up value is understood to be about Pounds 7.5m.
CMN insisted its offer, including Pounds 5m relating to a tax loss deal, was
worth Pounds 11m. It wants to negotiate not with Price Waterhouse but with
Lloyds Bank, Swans' principal creditor.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Embassy terrorism threat highlighted last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A security report identifying London's 'Embassy Row'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which includes the Israeli embassy - as a prime potential target for a
car-bomb attack was given to the royal household and to the Metropolitan
Police at the end of last year.
The 100-page risk analysis, which detailed the resurgent threat of
fundamentalist groups opposed to peace moves in the Middle East, was
prepared by one of Britain's leading anti-terrorist experts. It was
commissioned by officials working for the royal family as part of a security
review of Kensington Palace, which is near the Israeli embassy.
The report's author, Major John Wyatt, was a serving officer in Northern
Ireland. His private company, Search Training International, has advised
businesses on protection against terrorism and on security for the Crown
Jewels.
The report describes the embassy area as a 'credible attack scenario' for a
'vehicle bomb' because terrorist organisations would gain maximum
international publicity from a successful operation.
Maj Wyatt said this week that he had been concerned before Tuesday's bomb at
the Israeli embassy about security being relaxed. However he added that in
his view 'no degree of risk analysis' could have prevented the attack from
taking place.
He said: 'The problem faced by the security forces is striking a balance
between maintaining an effective level of security and not unduly disrupting
life in London.'
Nevertheless, news of the report's existence will be an embarrassment to
security officials, who have already been criticised by the Israeli
government for ignoring requests for additional security after the July 18
bomb attack on the central Jewish community building in Buenos Aires which
killed at least 96 people.
Scotland Yard would not comment on the report but a police official
expressed surprise that a risk analysis for Kensington Palace on such a
sensitive subject should have been commissioned from a private consultancy
and not from the police or the intelligence agencies.
The report does not specifically refer to the Israeli embassy. However it
identifies the growing threat of terrorism by Iran and by fundamentalist
groups, such as Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah and Hamas, the Islamic
resistance movement based in Damascus, opposed to the Middle East peace
moves.
According to the analysis, the terrorist threat had shifted from the US to
Europe after bomb attack on New York's World Trade Centre. Whereas the US
was 'too alien' to fundamentalists for such an attack to succeed again,
Europe had become better known to extremist groups as an area where the
'juxtaposition of races and creeds' was sufficient to 'hide the
perpetrators'.
Predictions of an upsurge in fundamentalist terrorism do not appear to have
been shared by MI5 and MI6, the intelligence agencies. Both appear to have
focused their attention on the threat posed by the IRA.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Rise in expenditure approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a 3.8 per cent increase in public
expenditure ceilings for the 1995-96 fiscal year, the first rise for three
years.
The initial plan for 1995-96, published earlier this year, proposed a cut in
the ceilings. However, the revised plan represents an increase of 4.8 per
cent over the initial plan.
General operating expenditures - the core budget, excluding debt service
costs and grants to local government - are to total Y42,820bn (Pounds
284bn). Special factors, such as costs related to next year's upper house
elections and the national census, will account for much of the increase.
But the new coalition government of Social Democrat, Liberal Democrat and
centrist Sakigake parties agreed to allow investment-related spending to
rise by 5 per cent to stimulate the fragile economy. Current spending is to
be cut by up to 10 per cent.
The principal feature of the budget allocations is a new Y300bn special
investment fund to allow the government to target priority areas such as
farming assistance and telecom systems. The tightest financial squeeze will
be at the defence agency. Defence spending requests are to be held to an
increase of just 0.9 per cent, the smallest rise since ceilings were imposed
in 1961.
Other figures yesterday showed the government deficit in 1993-94 was
Y566.3bn, the second consecutive annual deficit. The figure is expected to
increase sharply this year as substantial income tax cuts take effect,

FT  30 JUL 94 / Vietnam wakes up with a thirst: Brewers are competing
fiercely in a new market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At street-side bars throughout Vietnam, a battle is under way for the
loyalty of beer drinkers. For the first time in many years, the country is
experiencing a fully fledged marketing battle.
For many people there is still no choice. In many towns and cities, a small
local factory produces draught beer which it sells in barrels straight to
the bars. Increasingly, though, new canned and bottled beers are also on
sale in bars and shops and the manufacturers are spending heavily to promote
their products.
One recent arrival which has grabbed its corner of the market is Tiger beer
from Singapore. It has been marketed as the drink of the newly rich. 'I
think if you are a businessman in Vietnam today, you will drink Tiger Beer,'
says a young Vietnamese executive. 'That's the reason why the Vietnam
Brewery which makes Tiger beer has been so successful.'
Tiger caused a stir when its advertisements featuring a blonde woman first
appeared. When the local authorities issued new rules banning the use of
foreigners in advertising, it was rumoured to be a response to the Tiger
adverts.
The beer is now brewed in the southern commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City,
by a joint venture between the Dutch brewer Heineken, Singapore-based Fraser
and Neave and a local partner. It was the first such venture to produce an
imported beer locally and has captured a large share of the business market.
However, it is expensive and at a dollar a bottle, most local people still
cannot afford to buy it. Cheaper, and more popular among ordinary people, is
Saigon beer, brewed by the Saigon Brewery.
Saigon Brewery, like many of its local competitors, is in the middle of a
big expansion programme. At the moment the average consumption of beer is
less than four litres a year. Across the world the average is nearly four
times that and in other South-East Asian countries such as the Philippines
it is much higher.
Local and foreign manufacturers believe this market still has a long way to
grow. The limit now is the capacity of breweries. At the moment, the
national capacity is less than 300m litres a year. But everyone seems to be
expanding. When current growth targets are fulfilled, towards the end of
this decade, total output will be about 500m litres a year. Industry bosses
say that still will not be enough to satisfy this thirsty market.
Another brewery that is expanding is Halida in Hanoi, which produces its own
brand and has a joint venture agreement to make the Danish beer, Carlsberg.
The brewery is in the middle of a development which will see capacity
increase from 25m litres this year to more than 100m by the end of the
decade.
The company that now makes Halida is one of the big success stories of
Vietnam's transition to a market economy. For many years, the company
produced fish paste for export to eastern Europe. But with the collapse of
the communist bloc, that market dried up and general manager Nguyen Thi Anh
Nhan started looking for a new outlet.
Abandoning fish paste, she managed to borrow Dollars 3m to set up a simple
beer production line. That was in 1990. Now, the company is in the midst of
a massive expansion project.
Mrs Nhan says the outlook for the market is rosy: 'It's now summer and if
you go to a bar after about two o'clock in the afternoon, they stop serving
because they have run out of beer.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Japanese take a hesitant look at Aids: Drug users and
prostitutes are honoured conference guests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's bureaucrats are being reduced to blue-suited bemusement at the
arrival of one of the strangest and most feared processions of visitors from
abroad since General MacArthur's occupying troops hit town 49 years ago.
There will be 3,870 of them at latest count, with the US supplying the
largest contingent. Known prostitutes will be waved through by immigration
staff at Tokyo's Narita airport in the coming week, while intravenous drug
users are assured they have nothing to fear from the normally scrupulous
Narita customs as long as they bring in their prescribed methadone rather
than heroin, its street equivalent.
Narita personnel are among those who have been given special training in an
attempt to ensure they do not offend these honoured guests, whose visit
forms part of Japan's effort to secure a role in world affairs more
commensurate with its economic stature. The country is hosting the annual
international conference on Aids, which starts in Yokohama next weekend.
The bulk of those arriving from abroad for the event will be men in white
coats. But the conference, held last year in Berlin, has become an often
rowdy meeting ground for the scientists seeking a cure, a vaccine or
palliative treatments for the disease, companies hoping to profit from any
such developments, and campaigning organisations representing those who have
been exposed to the HIV virus.
Activists may, as has become almost traditional, again zap the stand at the
conference centre run by Wellcome of the UK, maker of the AZT treatment for
which clinical trials continue to report patchy and sometimes detrimental
results.
But the campaigners will be present in smaller numbers this year. Some
13,000 participants of all persuasions gathered in Berlin, the large
majority of whom came from outside Germany. This time the 4,729 Japanese
delegates will predominate, according to figures released by the organising
committee yesterday.
In 10 years, it is the first time the conference will have been held in
Asia, where after a late start the proliferation of HIV among largely urban
populations threatens to cast a shadow over economic growth. 'Now the Aids
epidemic is truly rampant in Asia, it is meaningful to hold the meeting
here,' Dr Takashi Kitamura, programme committee chair, said yesterday.
Up to 1m in India's great cities are estimated already to be infected, and
the more developed economies represented by the six-nation Association of
South-East Asian Nations (Asean) agreed last month they should seek to
'prevent the disease from spreading across our workforce'.
The US, Japan and Australia are to help fund an Aids programme for Asean.
However, fewer than a tenth of the delegates to the Yokohama conference,
which aims to focus attention on the problem facing the region, will be
drawn from the Asia-Pacific outside Japan.
For most, the main impediment is a Y80,000 (Pounds 527) registration fee and
the Y25,000 a night cost of a hotel room near the conference centre. Some
1,500 would-be delegates applied for subsidies, but conference organisers
could not say yesterday how many had been granted.
The Japanese government has committed Y150m over three years to the total
costs of staging the conference, less than the amount required to fund each
of these applicants for a one-day stay, airfare not included.
Nonetheless, health ministry officials are wearing the red ribbon of Aids
awareness on their navy lapels and have been educating everyone from their
airport colleagues to those who make the beds in the Dollars 250 Yokohama
hotels that HIV cannot be caught merely by handling a passport or a vanity
towel.
Along the way they are passing on the message, still only half believed,
that Japan itself is by no means immune to the real risks.
The health ministry said this week that 3,839 residents of the country had
tested HIV positive, excluding those who had contracted the virus through
blood transfusions in the first half of the 1980s.
The majority of those newly diagnosed were Japanese nationals who were
apparently exposed through heterosexual intercourse.
In hosting the 10th annual conference on Aids, Japan has accrued better
credentials than the US, where the assembly has not been held since its
earliest years because of restrictive immigration policies.
Medical researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers arriving next week may
be thankful that they are less likely than in the past to be accosted by
those either decrying their treatments or demanding them for free. But if
the event passes without undue incident, the Japanese bureaucrats will be
the local heroes of the piece.
For a small outlay on the part of their government they will have raised
awareness of the real risks while dispelling many of the anxieties
surrounding social contact with people with Aids - about 90 Yokohama high
school volunteers will tend those in the 'care lounge'.
And the conference may even bring broader trade benefits to foreign
companies. The health ministry said US activists could import 3,700 condoms
to distribute in Yokohama. Japan has until now prohibited condom imports by
deeming them a medical product - one of its remaining non-tariff barriers to
trade.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Japan's jobless rate nears all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of the weakness of the Japanese economy emerged yesterday
with figures showing an increase in unemployment and a sharp fall in the
inflation rate.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose by 0.1 of a percentage point to 2.9
per cent in June, according to the government's Management and Co-ordination
Agency. The jobless figure has been rising steadily since the recession
began three years ago, and now stands just below its all-time high of 3.1
per cent recorded in May 1987.
Separate figures released by the labour ministry revealed that the job
offers-to-applicants ratio declined further last month to 0.63 per cent, the
lowest level in more than seven years. The number of job offers fell in the
year to June by 6.5 per cent while the number of applicants rose by 13.8 per
cent. Employment fell sharply in all the main sectors of the economy, led by
the wholesale, retail, and restaurant sector, with a drop of 170,000 workers
from a year ago.
Though most Japanese companies have maintained their commitment to lifetime
employment, and have avoided compulsory redundancies, they have cut
recruitment and encouraged earlier retirement.
Mr Manso Hamamoto, the labour minister, said the figures showed the labour
market was 'in a continuously precarious situation'.
Most analysts agreed. Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Barings in
Tokyo, said: 'Despite the reticence of companies to lay off en masse, the
unemployment rate is likely to rise above 3 per cent in the next few
months.'
The inflation figures showed that consumer prices in Tokyo, the bellwether
for the rest of the nation, fell in July by 0.3 per cent from a year ago,
the first year-on-year drop since 1987.
A sharp decline in fresh food prices was the principal cause of the fall,
according to government officials. Poor weather last summer led to a sharp
rise in prices a year ago, magnifying the year-on-year decline this month.
But the core inflation rate, excluding food prices, also fell sharply to 0.6
per cent, the lowest level since September 1988.
There was better news with the publication of figures showing an increase in
housing starts and a rise in consumer confidence. The construction ministry
reported that housing starts were up by 10.6 per cent on a year ago to
147,909 homes, and the Economic Planning Agency reported that its consumer
sentiment index rose 7.8 per cent in the three months to the end of June.
The index measures expectations in five categories: employment, income
growth, prices, livelihood and durable goods purchases.
But even here the good news was tempered by the fact that it was consumers'
expectations of lower prices that contributed most to the increase in
confidence.
Economists were agreed that, overall, the figures were consistent with very
sluggish growth this year. Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura
Research Institute, said: 'Falling inflation and rising joblessness suggest
that capacity continues to outstrip demand, pointing to a continuing weak
performance by the Japanese economy for the foreseeable future.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / China gives hope of Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China said yesterday that it expected to begin 'the final stage' of its
negotiations to re-join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the
end of next month, when it plans to file improved offers on market access
for products and services.
Speaking at the end of two days of talks with Gatt members in Geneva, Mr
Long Yongtu, Beijing's chief negotiator, said his government was ready to
negotiate on the offers in September and would work constructively for an
agreement on accession.
The sense that the eight-year-old talks with Beijing were approaching a
decisive phase was reinforced by the closing statement by Mr Pierre-Louis
Girard, the Swiss economics ministry official who chaired this week's
working party. He said the working party had before it for the first time
'major parameters' which could serve as the basis for negotiating a draft
protocol for China's Gatt accession. He hoped to call the next meeting in
late September or early October.
Mr Girard indicated that prospects at that meeting were likely to depend on
progress made in the meantime in bilateral discussions between individual
Gatt members and Beijing.
However, he emphasised that though some progress had been made towards
convergence on the issues raised by China's accession, there were still many
points of difference.
Though China has previously said it wants to be a founder member of the
World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the Gatt early next year, Mr Long
failed to reiterate that ambition in his statements this week.
One western diplomat who participated in the meeting suggested China had
begun to realise that WTO membership - which would mean subscribing to the
provisions of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement - required far more
complex negotiations than simply re-joining the Gatt.
Though Beijing has said it is ready to accept all the obligations of WTO
membership, it presented this week's meeting with a 10-point list of
'non-negotiable' demands.
Earlier this month, officials in Beijing accused the US of blocking China's
application and threatened to call off the negotiations if Washington does
not drop its insistence that it joined as a developed country.
Observers are unsure whether China's public posture is part of a deliberate
strategy, or whether - as some western diplomats in Beijing believe - it
reflects political problems rooted in deep divisions in its bureaucracy.
Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy, has emerged as
a leading 'Gatt-sceptic' and is said to be insisting that negotiators yield
little on China's demand to join as a developing country.
His stand may be connected with political manoeuvring in the Chinese
leadership. He is under pressure from conservatives unhappy about his
liberalising policies, and without his support compromise on sensitive Gatt
issues will be difficult.
'The Chinese can't seem to get their act together,' said a western diplomat
in Beijing. 'It is going to take very hard negotiations, and they are not
used to hard multilateral negotiations.'

FT  30 JUL 94 / Chilean growth seen as rising to more than 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chile's main business federation has revised upwards its estimate of
economic growth in 1994 to between 4 and 4.5 per cent. At the start of the
year many business leaders were forecasting growth in the range of 2 per
cent to 3.5 per cent after the economy had cooled rapidly in the second half
of 1993.
'The difficulties that we foresaw at the beginning of the year are
dispersing and it is becoming increasingly clear that the economy will grow
by roughly 4-4.5 per cent,' said Mr Jose Antonio Guzman, president of the
CPC. 'I am more optimistic than I was in January,' he said.
Mr Guzman attributed the improved prospects to the higher prices being
fetched by Chile's principal exports - copper, cellulose and fish meal  -
which were depressed for most of last year.
Exports in the first half of 1994 rose by 9.3 per cent over the same period
last year to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.4bn), with non-traditional exports up
18 per cent. Imports rose by only 5.3 per cent, although those of capital
goods increased by 16 per cent, encouraging hopes of future productivity
gains.
Mr Guzman's statements follow the release of several other encouraging
economic indicators, most recently a sharp rise in the monthly economic
activity index for May, bringing the growth rate over the first five months
of 1994 to 3.8 per cent. May's rise in the index of 6.8 per cent was the
highest since last June.
The strong export performance, which has produced a balance of trade surplus
of Dollars 237m for the first six months (in spite of a deficit in June) has
prompted the central bank to revise its trade estimates for the second time
this year. The bank now expects a trade deficit of only Dollars 150m-Dollars
200m, compared with the near Dollars 1bn deficit predicted at the start of
the year.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Serbs may face stiffer air power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tighter economic sanctions and tougher use of Nato air power against the
Serbs will top the agenda at today's meeting in Geneva of the five nations
which are trying to impose a Bosnian settlement.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said he and his counterparts
from the UK, France, Germany and Russia would consider stricter enforcement
of the exclusion zones designed to protect the Bosnian Moslems. 'That will
require perhaps a further use of Nato air power,' he said.
Shoring up the existing sanctions and exclusion zones would be a milder
course of action than one demanded by many US politicians: lifting the arms
embargo against Bosnia's Moslem-led government. But the US administration
appears to have soft-pedalled on this idea, for the sake of preserving unity
in the five-nation contact group.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said Britain remained opposed to
lifting the arms embargo, although it would not stand in the way if
international support for such a move built up.
Russia is thought likely to acquiesce in some form of pressure on the Serbs,
as long as the raising of the arms embargo - which would be anathema in
Moscow - is kept off the agenda.
The peace plan's virtual rejection by the Serbs has caused anger in western
capitals and embarrassment in Russia, a traditional Serb ally. Senior
Russian officials have unsuccessfully tried this week to persuade the
Bosnian Serbs to come up with a more reasonable negotiating position.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said yesterday his government felt
it had been deceived by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We've done all we can for the
Serbs,' he said.

FT  30 JUL 94 / US growth 3.7% in 2nd quarter: GDP now 10 per cent higher
than at the trough of recession
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent between April and
June, partly because companies built up inventories faster than in previous
quarters, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
Bonds and shares rose sharply on Wall Street - the Dow Jones industrial
average jumping 33.67 to 3,764.5 - as traders interpreted the rise in
inventories as a sign that growth would slow in the second half, reducing
the need for further interest rates rises. Consumer spending grew at an
annual rate of 1.2 per cent, a third the pace in previous quarters.
Many economists, however, played down the significance of higher inventories
and predicted a rebound in consumer spending later this year.
The second quarter gain in output was the 13th consecutive quarter of
economic growth following a mild recession in 1990-91. GDP is now nearly 10
per cent higher in real terms than at the trough of the recession.
Data revisions showed growth at annualised rates of 6.3 per cent and 3.3 per
cent in the fourth and first quarters respectively, against previous
estimates of 7.0 per cent and 3.4 per cent.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York brokerage,
predicted growth in excess of 3 per cent at an annual rate in the second
half, reflecting a rebound in consumer spending and in exports, and a
further rise in inventories. The Federal Reserve was likely to raise rates
by another percentage point to about 5.25 per cent by the end of the year,
he said.
Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, said the figures were
consistent with her projections of a 3 per cent rise in both growth and
inflation this year.
The gain in inventories was mostly a voluntary adjustment by companies to
faster growth.
Inflation was under control, she said. The 'fixed price' GDP deflator - a
broad gauge of inflation - rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the
second quarter, down from 3.1 per cent in the first three months.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Heroism and wickedness in Warsaw: Stalin's troops looked on
with folded arms as 20,000 Poles fought to the death - Walesa has invited
Russian and German leaders to commemorate the anniversary of the tragic
Warsaw uprising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few episodes of the second world war revealed so clearly the depths of human
wickedness and the heights of personal and collective heroism as the Warsaw
rising, whose 50th anniversary will be commemorated this weekend in the
Polish capital.
The rising, 63 days of increasingly desperate street fighting between
150,000 ill-armed volunteers of the Polish Home Army (the AK or Armia
Krajowa) and a pitiless Nazi annihilation force, took place while Stalin,
whose soldiers were encamped just across the River Vistula, looked on with
folded arms, and the western allies were preoccupied with the battle for
France.
'The decision to launch the rising represents for the Poles the most tragic
mistake in their recent history,' wrote historian Norman Davies, author of
God's Playground, the most authoritative contemporary history of Poland. Its
failure scarred a generation of Poles and set the scene for 45 years of
east-west mistrust and the cold war.
Given this background, the decision of Polish President Lech Walesa to
invite the presidents of re-united Germany and post-communist Russia, as
well as representatives of the war-time allied powers, to this weekend's
ceremonies has been controversial. Intended as a gesture of forgiveness for
crimes which Poles will never permit to be forgotten, the Russo-German
presence has been fiercely criticised by Mr Walesa's domestic political
opponents and nationalist critics.
Mr Roman Herzog, the recently elected German president, accepted under the
unfortunate misapprehension that the object of commemoration was an earlier
slaughter of the innocents, the desperate Warsaw Ghetto uprising of April
1943 when the last remnants of the Jewish ghetto fought a doomed battle to
prevent their transport to the death camps, while Russian President Boris
Yeltsin passed the invitation on to lesser officials. Prime minister John
Major is representing Britain but US President Bill Clinton, who toured
central Europe before the Naples summit, is sending Vice President Al Gore.
The international line-up may be lighter and more controversial than hoped.
But nothing can take away from the significance of the event being
commemorated.
Five decades ago Soviet forces under General Rokossowski had advanced to the
suburbs of Warsaw. German troops under General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski
were evacuating stores and preparing to vacate the city. In his makeshift
underground headquarters General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, commander of the
Polish Home Army and the chief delegate from the Polish government in exile
in London were debating how and when to strike what they hoped would be a
decisive blow for liberation.
On the evening of July 29, Moscow Radio broadcast to Warsaw that 'the hour
of action has arrived.' This apparent invitation to take up arms against the
retreating Nazi's was accompanied by the first sighting of Soviet T-34 tanks
in Praga, a suburb just across the river Vistula from the historic town
centre.
The rising began at five o'clock on the afternoon of August 1 and ended two
months later with the surrender of the last pockets of Polish resistance. It
was followed by the forced evacuation of the surviving population and the
systematic destruction of 85 per cent of the city on Hitler's express
orders.
The outcome of the unequal battle was never in doubt after the hoped for
Soviet intervention failed to materialise and the first four days of
fighting failed to secure the airport, the railway station or the bridges
over the Vistula. Hitler, shocked and angered by the failed bomb plot
against him a few days earlier, ordered his commanders back to the city to
suppress the rising ruthlessly.
Fighting street to street, and cellar to cellar even continued in the sewers
which formed the main lines of communication for the beleaguered AK while
German ground troops backed by heavy artillery, dive bombers and tanks
remorsely tightened the net. To this day the track of a German 'goliath'
mini-tank lies embedded in the rebuilt walls of St John's cathedral in the
heart of the old city where mass will be said on Sunday in memory of those,
soldiers and civilians, who took part.
The last hope flickered and died on September 18 when a daylight air-drop of
food and arms by allied bombers left 90 per cent of the aid in German hands.
The bombers were forced to fly to the limits of their range from bases in
Italy because Stalin refused to allow them to use airfields in
Soviet-occupied territory.
It was a telling omen of things to come, which the allies turned a
half-blind eye to, preoccupied as they were with breaking out from the
Normandy beachheads and unwilling to 'antagonise Uncle Joe', the man whose
Red Army had torn the guts out of Hitlers armies in the east,
But the Poles had embarked upon the rising harbouring no illusions. Their
aim was to liberate the Polish capital from the Nazis and 'to mobilise the
entire population spiritually for the struggle against Russia.'
For the Poles already knew what being 'liberated' by Soviet forces meant.
Five years earlier, in September 1939, Poland had been violated by Hitler
and Stalin together under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.
Poles, and the large pre-war Jewish population in particular, suffered
terribly under Nazi rule. But for non-Jews, political and physical
repression by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, in the Soviet-occupied
east of Poland was in many ways worse than that imposed by the Gestapo.
To the Nazis the Poles were simply Untermenschen whose ideas and culture
were of no interest. For Stalin's commissars, by contrast, Poland's
nationalist traditions and 'bourgeois' culture were a threat to be
eliminated. Hence the cold-blooded murder of thousands of captured Polish
officers in Katyn forest, near Smolensk. Hence the mass arrest of Polish
intellectuals, priests and teachers and their execution or deportation to
Siberia.
The AK's decision to fight for a 'Polish solution' to Poland's future was
'taken for the most honourable motives by men who had fought selflessly for
their country's independence against all comers,' writes Professor Davies.
But 'the idea that Warsaw could have been held by the AK in the name of the
government in exile without a subsequent showdown with the Soviets was
belied by all previous experience,' he adds.
So it proved. But the tradition of stubborn resistance to foreign occupation
embodied by Warsaw's defenders lived on to re-emerge a generation later in
the anti-Soviet Solidarity movement. The defeat of 50 years ago turned into
the victory of 1989 when Poland became the first of Moscow's satellite
states to throw off the Soviet shackles. In so doing Poles started the
process which liberated not only central Europe but permitted the
re-unification of Germany and the re-emergence of a Russia shorn of its
Soviet imperial arrogance. That is the final testament to an immense
sacrifice.

Almost half the controversial subsidised loan provided by the UK government
for the Malaysian Pergau Dam project has been repaid early. Tenaga Nasional,
the Malaysian electricity authority, yesterday repaid Pounds 140m of the
Pounds 305m loan around 10 years ahead of schedule. As a result the UK
government will recoup Pounds 9.3m of the Pounds 255.3m cash costs of
subsidising the loan. This represents savings for the government of the
'margin' it pays to the commercial banks which administer the loan,
according to officials. However, Tenaga is continuing to enjoy the full
benefit of the UK government subsidy. The UK government has been criticised
by MPs for giving too much of its aid budget to the Pergau project and for
using the promise of aid to win a substantial defence contract.

The tortuous search for a Dutch government coalition entered a new phase
yesterday when Mr Wim Kok, finance minister in the outgoing government, said
he would try to form a three-party government of his own Labour party, the
right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66. The negotiations, which will
begin next week, represent the second attempt to put together a coalition of
the three parties since the Christian Democrats suffered an historic defeat
in the May general election. The first attempt was scuppered by
disagreements over social welfare spending. But the differences between
Labour and the Liberals in particular have narrowed after Mr Kok unveiled a
proposed government programme on Monday stressing cuts in social spending
and promising to boost jobs. All four main parties responded positively to
Mr Kok's proposals, but he decided to exclude the Christian Democrats from
the negotiations because they opposed maintaining levels of social benefits.

General Francisco Veguillas, who as director-general of defence policy
played a key role in the modernisation of Spain's armed forces, was killed
yesterday, together with his driver, when a car bomb exploded alongside his
car. The blast, in central Madrid, also killed a bystander and severely
wounded at least eight others. The attack, which bore the hallmark of ETA,
the Basque separatist organisation, came in the midst of a controversial
initiative by the new interior and justice minister Mr Juan Alberto Belloch
to allow partial freedom to an initial 30 out of more than 500 jailed ETA
members serving long sentences. Gen Veguillas, 69, replaced Admiral Fausto
Escrigas, who was also killed by ETA, as director general of defence policy,
in 1985. Yesterday's attack brought the number of ETA victims this year to
nine, five of them military officers.

Ukraine's parliament voted yesterday to freeze the privatisation of state
enterprises for six weeks. Deputies voted 180-62 for a resolution that said
the system of privatisation was flawed and had to be stopped until the
assembly decided which types of property are not to be transferred to
private ownership. It ordered the government to draw up a list of
enterprises in transport, energy and communication which should not be
privatised 'because of their national significance' and submit the list for
parliament's approval in September. The resolution also ordered a review of
the mechanism by which foreign investors participate in privatisation.
Deputies were keen to prevent enterprises avoiding the competitive process
and buying out their leases from the state for a low price. Reformers,
including Mr Volodymyr Kuznetsov, head of President Kuchma's economic
service, were opposed to the resolution, and said the process of
privatisation could not be stopped.

The Russian government yesterday issued a veiled call for the people of
Chechnya - a Russian republic in the North Caucasus - to rise against their
president, General Dzhokar Dudayev. It accused him of the murder of hundreds
of opponents and of destabilising the whole of the North Caucasus. The
statement comes after a week of rising tension between Moscow and the
republican government and after hostages seized by Chechen terrorists were
freed with the loss of 10 lives. The statement also warns of Russian
intervention 'if violence is used against Russian citizens'. It says
Chechnya has become the base for organised criminal groups. Opposition
forces in the republic, with clear Russian backing, have also in the past
week called for an uprising against the Dudayev regime.

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday hit back at allegations that up to 8 per
cent of EU funds was going astray each year amid growing fraud in the Union
budget. Responding to a highly critical report by Britain's House of Lords,
the Commission said the fraud battle should mainly be fought by member
states as they were directly responsible for spending three-quarters of the
budget.
The Lords report said that while it was impossible to estimate the scale of
fraud within the EU it was at least Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn a year, equivalent
to 7-8 per cent of the EU budget. The Commission said it had proof that
fraud accounted for 1 per cent of the EU budget. 'Nobody knows how much the
fraud is. If it's at that level it shows total dereliction of duty by member
states,' said a Commission spokesman. Brussels yesterday set out a scheme
under which people who inform on EU fraud could get up to Ecu10,000 (Pounds
7,886) for tip-offs. About Ecu200,000 would be earmarked annually for the
scheme.

Britain sees a German seat on the UN Security Council as both desirable and
likely, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said yesterday. It was
the second time in a week that Mr Hurd has voiced his approval for a more
active German role on the world stage. Asked on BBC radio whether Britain
would back a proposal to give Germany a permanent Security Council seat, he
replied: 'Yes, indeed we would.' He added that the UK viewed German
admission as a probable outcome of forthcoming debates on the UN's future
structure.
UK officials said London continued to link German and Japanese admission to
the Council with a broader reform of the institution, in which Latin
America, Africa and Asia might also demand seats. Mr Hurd told the German
magazine Der Spiegel, in an interview published this week, that Britain
welcomed the prospect of a more decisive role for Germany in international
affairs. He said it was 'childish twaddle' to imagine that Britain might be
jealous of President Bill Clinton's enthusiasm for ties with Germany.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Clinton faces a fierce attack over Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Republicans in the US Senate yesterday launched a series of savage attacks
on President Bill Clinton, his administration and even Mr Robert Fiske, the
Whitewater special counsel, for failing to come clean on the affair.
Senator Al D'Amato of New York charged the White House had 'concealed,
disguised and distorted the truth, all in the service of politics and the
president's self-preservation.' He also accused Mr Roger Altman, deputy
treasury secretary, of deliberately misleading Congress last February in
testimony about his contacts with White House officials over criminal
investigations into Madison Guaranty, the failed Arkansas savings and loan
company at the heart of Whitewater. The affair stems from the first family's
land and financial dealings in their home state in the 1970s and 1980s.
The hearings of the Senate banking committee contrasted sharply with those
earlier in the week by its House counterpart, where Congressman Henry
Gonzalez, the Democratic chairman, controlled both statements and questions
tightly.
Technically on the agenda yesterday was testimony by police and medical
officials on the circumstances of the suicide last summer of Mr Vincent
Foster, then deputy White House legal counsel. But each member of the
committee was permitted a lengthy opening statement before any witnesses
were summoned.
Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, citing old professional contacts
between the special counsel and Mr Clinton's legal representatives, accused
Mr Fiske of 'hiding information that would be embarrassing to the Clintons.'
In an interim report, Mr Fiske, a Republican, exonerated administration
officials of any criminal wrongdoing in the Madison affair and found that
the death of Mr Foster was a clear case of suicide.
This conclusion was endorsed yesterday by Mr Larry Monroe, an FBI special
agent, who testified that forensic and other evidence offered 'irrefutable
proof' that he had taken his own life and that his depression could not be
ascribed to concerns about Whitewater.
But Senator D'Amato hinted at further dark conspiracies when it was
announced that a park service policeman due to testify yesterday was 'out of
town.' He did not appear contrite when advised that the policeman would
appear on Monday.

The reputation of one of the oldest and most illustrious US civil rights
organisations was further damaged yesterday by details of an out-of-court
settlement of sexual harassment charges brought against its director.
According to reports in both the New York Times and the Baltimore Sun, the
Rev Benjamin Chavis last year committed the National Association for the
Advancement of Coloured People to pay up to Dollars 332,400 in damages
without informing the NAACP's board and its legal counsel.
The plaintiff, Ms Mary Stansel, who briefly worked for the organisation last
year, is now additionally suing Mr Chavis and the NAACP for breach of part
of the out-of-court settlement under which she would be found a job
elsewhere paying at least Dollars 80,000 a year.
Several NAACP board members were quoted as saying that they knew nothing of
the settlement and subsequent suit and that nothing was communicated about
either at the organisation's annual convention in Chicago earlier this
month.
Lawyers for Mr Chavis said he denied the sexual harassment charges and he
had reached the settlement under duress and in order to preserve his
reputation. Good faith attempts were made to find Ms Stansel another job,
but she either failed to turn up for interviews or overstated her
qualifications, one said.
Mr Chavis was elected executive director of the 85-year-old NAACP in April
last year. He took over an organisation with a membership of only about
500,000, less than half that of 30 years earlier, and with current debts
estimated at about Dollars 3m.
It was also deeply split between traditional moderate integrationists and
outspoken black nationalists. This came to a head early in June when Mr
Chavis invited Rev Louis Farrakhan, militant head of the Nation of Islam, to
participate in a 'black summit'.

The United Nations' top aid official said yesterday Rwanda could see yet
another 'world record' refugee exodus when French troops pull out of their
south-western security zone next month. Mr Peter Hansen,
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, issued the warning on his
return from the region, where the UN is already struggling to look after
more than 2m refugees. About 1.6m Rwandan Hutus have taken refuge in the
safe area set up by France, which says it will withdraw its 2,500 troops by
the time its UN mandate expires on August 22. The first French troops left
yesterday. 'If we have a vacuum and that vacuum would lead to instability,
we could see an exodus from that zone into Zaire, where there are already
500,000 to 600,000 refugees in Bukavu and Uvira,' Mr Hansen said. In
Washington, President Clinton asked Congress to approve Dollars 320m of
extra aid. He said the US was 'urgently reviewing' whether to open a new
airfield in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, to speed aid deliveries.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Russia's teetering MMM slashes fund price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's MMM share fund teetered on the edge of oblivion yesterday as it
slashed the redemption price of its shares from the last quote of Rbs115,000
(Pounds 37) to Rbs1,000, sending investors streaming into Moscow's
commodities exchange in desperate attempts to sell their paper.
In the early evening an estimated 25,000 angry shareholders gathered round
MMM's headquarters in a dowdy Moscow suburb. They blocked off the multi-lane
Varshavskoye Chaussee and attacked the policemen guarding the building. Riot
police were in reserve, in and around the building, but were not deployed.
Mr Sergei Mavrodi, MMM's elusive head, issued a written statement in the
early afternoon saying the price cut was temporary and that 'in two or three
months the price will return to Rbs100,000 or more. We are simply taking
economic measures to force shareholders to wait and hold on to the shares
for two or three months'.
Mr Mavrodi, in the anti-authoritarian style he has adopted in recent days,
blamed the government for the plight of the fund and the 10m citizens he
claims as shareholders (other estimates put the number at 2m-5m).
The Russian government has recently questioned MMM's solvency. Mr Mavrodi
said: 'We've been stopped on the eve of a super breakthrough, after which
Russia could have become the richest country in the world and Russians - MMM
shareholders - wealthy people.'
He said that allegations made by the finance ministry and tax inspectorate
that MMM was a classic 'pyramid scheme', in which the purchases of new
shareholders fund the profits of the old until expansion stops, were
'absolutely false'.
The crowds around the MMM headquarters were generally phlegmatic before the
evening outburst. Most of their anger appeared to be directed more at the
government than at MMM, which they were reluctant to blame. Mr Mavrodi's
statement referred to the 'panic' created by the government a week ago, when
it first issued warnings about the scheme. In the conditions created by the
statements, 'it is useless to continue buying shares back from the
shareholders . . . it can only lead to the bankruptcy of the company,' the
statement said.
However, the company's press office said that 32 of its sales points in
Moscow were working yesterday, buying shares at Rbs950 and selling at
Rbs1,000. On the street, the buying price stood at around Rbs6,000 and
selling price at around Rbs10,000.
The company's apparent collapse, after months of Russia's biggest television
advertising campaign, has revealed huge gaps in securities and investor
protection law. But the authorities were also unwilling or unable to use
what law exists, or to issue warnings until the fund had millions of
shareholders.
Many of these say they have invested much of their savings in what has
turned out to be Russia's latest false dream.
The affair has not yet affected the currency market, where the rouble has
remained stable against the dollar for some days.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets braced for rate rise: Bank of England's dealings
lead traders to expect half-point increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets yesterday signalled their expectation of an imminent rise
in UK interest rates. This was based on Bank of England dealings in the
money markets which persuaded many traders that a half percentage point
increase was likely.
Although the markets found the Bank's dealings confusing, anxiety about a
rise in rates prompted selling in the futures market. By the close last
night, short sterling, the futures market's medium for speculating on
interest rate changes, pointed to short-term rates of over 6 per cent by
September compared with base rates currently at 5.25 per cent.
The prospect of higher rates bolstered the pound which finished in London at
DM2.4413, more than 2 pfennigs up on Thursday's close of DM2.4195.
The Bank yesterday accepted bids for Treasury bills - short-term debt issued
by the government - at rates of up to 5.75 per cent, half a point above
current base rates. That was interpreted by some traders as a sign that base
rates would rise shortly, either on Monday morning or on Tuesday when the
Bank publishes its quarterly inflation report.
In its daily operations, however, the Bank dealt at unchanged rates, before
and after the Treasury bill auction. These activities are the Bank's
traditional method of signalling its desired level of base rates.
While some economists now expect base rates to rise by half a point next
week, others thought the Bank did not intend to increase rates and had
merely miscalculated the market's reaction to the Treasury bill
announcement. In the confusion, many talked of 'mismanagement' by the Bank.
The result of yesterday's auction is that the Bank is paying more to borrow
money than it is receiving for lending it, a position which cannot last for
an extended period.
Markets were already jittery about a possible base rate rise, with evidence
of inflationary pressure in the Confederation of British Industry's
quarterly survey, released on Tuesday, and in the purchasing managers'
index, announced yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor,
held their monthly monetary meeting on Thursday. Interest rate decisions are
taken at the monthly meetings although the timing of the change is left to
the Bank. Speculation about rate changes is accordingly at its peak in the
days following the meeting.
Trade in short sterling reached more than 210,000 contracts, the highest
volume this year. The September contract lost 33 basis points to close at
93.95.
The FT-SE 100 index fell by 26.2 points at one stage before closing 13.3
points down on the day at 3,082.6.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Lloyds up 21% at half-year but rivalry fears hit shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lloyds Bank fell sharply yesterday despite a 21 per cent rise in
half-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 605m. The marking down of the stock
reflects concern among investors that clearing banks are starting to compete
for business by cutting loan margins and charges.
Lloyds' results reinforced fears that banks are building up more capital
than is needed to meet slack demand for loans. Analysts said banks were
likely to start reducing charges to attract business in an overcrowded
market.
Lloyds' shares fell by 18p to 544p. Other bank shares declined. Lloyds
raised its interim dividend by 14 per cent to 7.5p, but the increase was not
as great as some analysts had predicted, given the bank's generation of
capital.
Sir Robin Ibbs, Lloyds' chairman, said the bank was confident it would
succeed with its Pounds 1.8bn agreed bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society. C&amp;G is expected to announce revised terms in mid-August
for sharing the cash among its members.
Sir Robin emphasised that the C&amp;G purchase would not be the last acquisition
considered by Lloyds. 'Just because we are moving towards a satisfactory
conclusion with C&amp;G does not mean we are pulling down the shutters,' he
said.
He said Lloyds would not impose charges on current accounts in credit,
although the decision was not a consequence of the capital build-up. 'If one
is virtuous to begin with, one does not need even more temptation to be
virtuous,' he said.
Weak loan demand and flat income from charges meant revenue grew only 5 per
cent to Pounds 1.92bn, against Pounds 1.83bn in the first half of 1993.
But the bank's trading surplus rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 713m, against
Pounds 632m, because costs were held down.
Lloyds gained from the improvement in credit quality among UK companies in
the first half of the year as the effects of the economic recovery were
felt. Its provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to Pounds 102m,
compared with Pounds 138m.
The bank continued to gain from its decision in the 1980s to retain
non-performing debt to less developed countries.
Its debt portfolio earned it Pounds 148m, including a release of Pounds 105m
provisions due to Brazilian debt rescheduling in April.
Two problems were caused by financial market turmoil in the first half. It
lost Pounds 5m in securities trading, and sustained a Pounds 25m loss from
Banco Multiplic, a bank dealing in Brazilian government securities in which
it has a 50 per cent stake.
Sir Brian Pitman, the bank's chief executive, said it was holding on to
about 80 empty branches in the hope of getting better prices when the
property market picked up.
Sir Brian suggested that they would make good restaurants.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Tribunal attacks big pay-outs for ex-servicewomen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of large pay-outs to former servicewomen who were sacked after they
became pregnant were 'manifestly excessive' the Employment Appeals Tribunal
ruled yesterday.
However, the appeals tribunal said most of the seven ex-servicewomen whose
cases were taken to appeal by the Ministry of Defence could keep the bulk of
their compensation because of the way the Ministry of Defence presented its
case. Two women will have to return to industrial tribunals for
reassessments.
Mr Justice Morison, tribunal chairman, said: 'The large awards, running into
many tens of thousands of pounds, seem quite out of proportion to the wrong
done.'
The MoD, which welcomed yesterday's decision, has already paid out Pounds
16m in settlements since 1990 when the European Court of Justice ruled that
the armed forces were not exempt from EC legislation making it illegal to
dismiss a woman because she was pregnant.
The ministry said at the time that pregnant women dismissed since 1978, when
the UK government was obliged to have implemented an EC equal treatment
directive, were entitled to compensation. Until today's ruling it had
claimed it faced bills of up to Pounds 100m if the principle of large awards
had been upheld.
The level of future awards to ex-servicewomen dismissed because of pregnancy
is now likely to be much lower for the 1,700 outstanding claims.
The seven test cases involved women who lost their jobs between 1978 and
1990 and who received awards of up to Pounds 173,000. The awards were made
after the government's abolition last November of an Pounds 11,000
compensation limit in industrial tribunals for sex discrimination.
About 70 cases involving pregnant women dismissed in past years from the
armed forces have been heard at industrial tribunals, with a record Pounds
299,000 recently awarded.
The appeals tribunal, which criticised the way the original industrial
tribunals had calculated the awards, ruled that in future cases 'industrial
tribunals need to keep a due sense of proportion when assessing
compensation'.
The tribunal also called for greater consistency in future in the awards
granted to ex-servicewomen.
The tribunal commented that the women had only been entitled to compensation
because of judgments by the European courts after they had been dismissed
from the services.

<TEXT>
UCB, the Belgian chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, boosted pre-tax
profits 21 per cent to BFr1.28bn (Dollars 39m) in the first six months of
the year, aided by improved economic conditions in Europe, writes Emma
Tucker in Brussels.
Post-tax profits of BFr1.23bn were lower than in the first half of 1993 when
they were BFr1.74bn. The group's sales rose to BFr25.2bn from BFr23.43bn in
the same period a year earlier.
Exceptional profits were below those of the previous year, which had been
boosted by the sale of Vel, the group's Belgian chemicals subsidiary
UCB said its pharmaceuticals sales had benefited from buoyant demand for
Zyrtec, the company's successful anti-allergy drug, which normally sells
well during the spring.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said it expects to return to growth in the second half
of the year after reporting a net loss for the second quarter, Reuter
reports.
'Sales and earnings were below expectations, particularly in the US,' the
company said. 'However, we anticipate returning to growth in the second half
of the year.'
RPR is maintaining tight control of operating expenses, while continuing to
invest in new products and technologies that will drive its future growth.
The company said it will start to see the beneficial results of its
restructuring plan by the end of this year.
The company said second-quarter sales dipped 3.5 per cent to Dollars 973m
compared with the year-ago quarter, but were about equal after the negative
effects of currency fluctuations and product divestitures are excluded.
Sales in the US prescription business declined because ex-factory sales,
particularly of key respiratory products, are not yet matching the audited
prescription growth.
Sales in the North American over-the-counter business were below last year.
Sales in Europe, excluding currency fluctuations and divestitures, were
level with the previous year.

FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: BPA shareholders fight bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading shareholders in Banco Portugues do Atlantico are preparing to defend
Portugal's largest commercial bank against a hostile takeover bid by Banco
Comercial Portugues, a smaller rival.
A group of Portuguese businessmen who control 27 per cent of BPA said they
would seek to expand the core shareholding to 40 per cent. Earlier this
week, BCP made a public offer of Es132bn (Dollars 819m) for 40 per cent of
BPA.
An official of Sonae, Portugal's largest private conglomerate and leader of
BPA's core shareholders, said the group would not make a counter-bid but
hoped to increase its own holdings and persuade other shareholders to join
the group.
BPA's core shareholders are bound by an agreement not to sell outside the
group. The Sonae official said that if the core were extended to 40 per
cent, BCP's bid would fail because the state owned 25 per cent of BPA and
would remain neutral in the bid battle.
But Lisbon analysts said BCP's offer would be a severe test of the cohesion
of BPA's core shareholders. 'When the crunch comes and the money's on the
table, the group may not hold together,' said a Lisbon dealer.
BCP's bid of Es3,000 a share values BPA at Es330bn. BPA shares reached a
high of Es2,800 yesterday before closing at Es2,615. They had been suspended
since Tuesday, when they closed at Es2,010. More than 185,000 shares were
traded yesterday.
BCP's offer has to be approved by the government, central bank and stock
exchange commission. BCP control of BPA would create Portugal's largest
private-sector banking group, with combined assets of about Es5,360bn.
The new group would be close in size to state-owned Caixa Geral de
Depositos, the country's largest bank, which focuses on mortgage lending and
savings deposits.

Vard, the Norwegian shipping group, returned to the black in the first half

The group's pre-tax result swung to a NKr519.4m (Dollars 73m) profit from a
NKr212.2m loss in the same 1993 period.
The main impact was a NKr549.2m extraordinary gain on the sale of the

The Cyprus Development Bank is setting up an investment bank in the
Krasnodar region of Russia, with backing from Greek and Russian banks and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, writes Kerin Hope in
Athens.
The new bank, to be called Investment Bank of Kuban, is due to start
operating in Krasnodar early next year. It aims at channelling funds from
private investors and international agencies into tourism and industry under
a plan launched last year by the Cyprus and Russian governments to develop
the region.
The state-controlled CDB, together with Commercial Bank of Greece, will
control and manage the new bank, which will have a capital base of Dollars
7m. In addition to the EBRD, two local banks, Kubinbank and Bank of Kuban,
will also take equity stakes in the bank. A CDB official said the bank
planned to participate in joint ventures in food-processing, timber and
cement production, and tourism, identified in a recent UN-backed study of
the region as promising sectors for investment.

Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics
group, will establish a marketing subsidiary in India by the end of this
year, following approval from the New Delhi government.
Japanese consumer electronics makers have been showing increasing interest
in the Indian market due to its size and growth potential. Sony, another
leading electronics maker, recently applied for government approval to
launch its first television production plant there.
Matsushita said it would start producing this autumn 150,000 colour
television sets and 350,000 audio visual products a year through Salora
International, a consumer electronics maker based in New Delhi with which
the Japanese company has a technical co-operation agreement. The new Indian
subsidiary will provide after-sales services and handle publicity.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Germans fear weak dollar will hit recovery: Industry looks
to Bundesbank forcut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's industrial leadership has been showing signs this week of
increasing restiveness about the strength of the economic recovery and the
effects of exchange rate distortions on business prospects.
Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman of the Allianz insurance group, warned
in Munich that continuing dollar weakness could 'draw a line through our
calculations' for 1994.
Every one pfennig drop in the value of the US currency below the official
fixing of DM1.7263 on December 31 last year implied a drop in the company's
sales of DM100m (Dollars 63.6m), he claimed.
An interim profits report from BMW, the quality carmaker, also warned of
'considerable risks' for economic developments in the renewed strength of
the German currency.
'A continued rise in the external value of the D-Mark could bring the
expected economic recovery back into question,' it said.
Meanwhile, Gesamtmetall, the engineering industry employers' association,
warned there would be no 'sweeping improvement' in the sector's earnings
this year after aggregate losses of DM7bn in 1993.
Even though new data has shown orders for machinery and plant continuing to
rise - they were up a real 10 per cent in the first half of the year -
Gesamtmetall said the need for rationalisation was still as strong as last
year.
The association's gloom stemmed from a survey in May by the respected Ifo
economics institute of more than 1,000 engineering and electrical companies,
in which only 38 per cent said they expected better results this year.
Since two-thirds of these more optimistic forecasts came from companies
which made losses in 1993, the association suggested that most of them
expected no more than reduced deficits this year.
Although the association's warning that 'a lot remains to be done, above all
on the wages front' smacked of politicking in advance of the 1995 wages
round, due to start in the autumn, it echoed worries voiced by individual
companies.
According to Siemens, Germany's biggest electrical engineering group, price
competition and currency factors had depressed prices of some products by up
to 10 per cent.
Simultaneous warnings from two of Germany's leading companies also suggested
real concern that the Bundesbank's tight hold on interest rates - one reason
for the D-Mark's strength - could damage prospects for many industrial
sectors.
Although most economists expect at least one more cut in the
internationally-sensitive 4.5 per cent discount rate before the end of the
year, this week's statements suggest pressure is mounting for a move as soon
after the summer break as possible.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Too much water and wine don't mix: Thunderstorms have
wrecked some of the best French vineyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For some French wine producers it never rains, but it pours. The violent
thunder and hailstorms that have rolled across France over the past few
weeks have struck at random, causing serious damage to some vineyards, while
leaving others untouched.
Take the case of the Puligny-Montrachet vineyards in the Burgundy region of
eastern France. Heavy hail on the night of July 17 could reduce this year's
production by up to 20 per cent.
Some vineyards are particularly affected. Chartron and Trebuchet, a company
which owns and manages vineyards on the region's Montrachet hill, says that
its grands crus and premiers crus have suffered severely.
'As far as the Domaine Jean Chartron is concerned, the parcels Clos des
Chevaliers, Clos du Cailleret, Clos de la Pucelle and Les Folatieres have
unfortunately been devastated by more than 50 per cent,' says Mr Louis
Trebuchet.
A colleague points out the element of chance involved. 'In Burgundy we have
to live with hail. But it is very pinpoint. A few hundred metres away there
will be no damage,' she says.
There may be a silver lining to the hailstorm clouds. The scarcity of this
year's vintage could raise prices of the Domaine Jean Chartron wines, for
which the grands crus already cost more than FFr300 (Pounds 36) a bottle.
But wine experts say that any increase in prices will be determined by the
quality of this year's wine and the production in rival high-quality
vineyards.
Other regions have also been affected by the recent storms. 'Last weekend
there was some damage,' says a spokesman for the association of Bordeaux
wine producers. 'But it appears very isolated and I don't think there will
be a widespread affect on production. For those which have been affected,
however, the effects can be very damaging.'
Until the harvests are gathered over the next few months, it is unclear
whether 1994 will mark another year of declining production. Total
production fell in 1993 by 19 per cent, to 53m hectolitres, according to
Insee, the national statistics office.
Last year, too, the weather was to blame. 'The harvest was greatly affected
by rain,' says Insee, citing Aquitaine in southwestern France as one of the
worst-hit regions.
In general, however, the report concludes that the quality of the harvest
was not greatly affected and '1993 should count among the good years'. There
were other encouraging signs. Consumption rose by 7 per cent in volume
terms, after several years of decline, although prices continued their
downward trend.
The sole exception, according to Insee, has been for Burgundy wines, where
the average price rose by 6 per cent last year. As they survey their ravaged
vineyards, however, that may prove little consolation for the producers of
Puligny-Montrachet.

FT  29 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whispers were reaching the market that Granada Group, the television and
catering concern fresh from its successful takeover of LWT, might be
considering hitting the acquisition trail again. Gardner Merchant, the
catering group sold by Forte last year to management and set to come to the
market later this year, was being mooted as the most likely candidate, with
a price tag of around Pounds 600m being attached.
Leisure analysts, while agreeing that the move would make strategic sense to
Granada, said that it was unlikely given both its recent foray and Gardner
Merchant's imminent flotation. 'Granada would have to pay a lot to stop that
happening,' was the view of one seasoned professional. Forte, which will
reap 25 per cent from any float, crept a half-penny forward to 232p, while
Granada managed a penny gain to 533 1/2 p.
ICI put on 4 at 837p after the UK's leading chemicals company released
second-quarter figures above the range of analysts' forecasts and
accompanied them with a strong statement.
The profits of Pounds 141m translated to a first-half gain of Pounds 234m,
against forecasts of Pounds 205m to Pounds 225m. Sir Denys Henderson, the
chairman, said: 'This is the most tangible evidence yet that our customers
are emerging from recession.'
Forecasts for the full year shifted from a range of Pounds 400m to Pounds
450m to between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m, but many analysts remained just
holders of the stock, arguing that it was already expensive.
SmithKline Beecham fell as initial reports suggested that the US Food and
Drug Administration's advisory committee had decided not to approve the
company's best selling drug Tagamet as an over-the-counter treatment for
heartburn.
The shares dropped 11 1/2 to 408p but, after the market closed, SmithKline
announced that recommendation had been given subject to one or two small
points. It said that if those points were cleared up, the drug would not
have to be referred back to the advisory committee.
News that Medeva, the pharmaceuticals company, had lost a significant
European appeal case came too late to affect the shares, which ended steady
at 134p. But one analyst said the decision to uphold the patent on a
hepatitis B drug held by Biogen, of the US, could prompt a significant fall
in the Medeva share price when the market opens today.
The hepatitis B vaccine is seen as one of the prime sources of Medeva's
earnings growth in the next five years. Analysts had been looking for sales
of around Pounds 30m next year.
News that conglomerate Hanson had made a Pounds 96.1m recommended offer for
Scholes, manufacturer of electrical products, at 250p a share was not the
blockbuster bid that many had expected. Analysts are looking for further
acquisitions but some said that much depended on the strength of the dollar
and its impact on the group's high level of dollar denominated debt. Scholes
rose 57 to 250p while Hanson improved 3 to 258p, the shares receiving
further support from a recommendation by Nomura which urged investors to
switch their holdings from industrial conglomerate BTR, which eased 2 to
370p.
Office equipment group Danka Business hardened 3 to 333p after reporting
bumper first-quarter profits
Rolls-Royce advanced 7 1/2 to 188 1/2 p, with investment bank Lehman
Brothers reported to have been an aggressive bidder for stock in the second
half of the session, to cover a position on a warrant issue.
Food processing equipment manufacturer APV firmed 2 to 114p after NatWest
Securities upgraded profits expectations for the current year by Pounds 1.8m
to Pounds 26.8m.
Motor dealer Lex Service, which reported disappointing figures on Tuesday,
relinquished a further 10 at 437p.

FT  29 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters up strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofwat, the water regulator, delivered the review many in the market were
hoping for and sent water shares spurting forward as utility specialists
upgraded profits and dividend forecasts.
Ofwat's recommendation on the 'K' factor - the amount the water companies
will be able to raise their prices above the rate of inflation - came in
more or less in line with market expectations, with a lower than expected
figure for capital expenditure over the next 10 years. Other issues, such as
rates of return and dividend growth, were also considered to be leniently
treated in the report.
Traders said there were hefty gains from the outset, with good buying
support being maintained throughout the session. Among the perceived key
beneficiaries of the report, Northumbrian jumped 30 to 527p, Southern 33 to
588p, Anglian 24 to 549p, North West 28 to 553p, Welsh 30 to 638p and Severn
Trent 33 to 572p, with turnover there hitting 7.4m, the second highest
recorded. It was a similar story at Thames, where volume reached 10m as the
shares raced forward 24 1/2 to 515 1/2 p. South West, the only company to
appeal against Ofwat's findings, was also the only weak spot in the sector,
losing 12 at 517p on busy volume of 3.4m.
Analysts upgraded forecasts for real dividend growth in the sector from
around 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent per annum, with talk of the more bullish
houses moving to 5 per cent. Hoare Govett predicted a further 10 per cent
upside for shares, with strong recommendations on Welsh, Thames and Severn
Trent. But NatWest Securities sounded a slight note of caution. Mr Andrew
Wheeler at the securities house said: 'Some companies might struggle to
maintain aggressive dividend growth above the market rate.'

FT  29 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco riposte predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bid battle in the food retail sector is expected to take a further
twist, perhaps today, with Tesco widely predicted to counter yesterday's
Pounds 210m bid from J. Sainsbury for William Low, the Scottish retailer.
Analysts were united in the belief that Tesco would return to the fray three
weeks after making an agreed Pounds 154m offer for Low. A fresh bid of 350p
a share was being mooted in the market, a move which would severely test
Sainsbury's staying power in the battle for the Dundee-based grocer.
However, others suggestions were of a more cautious 325p a share response.
Sainsbury's cash bid is worth 305p a share.
Low shares surged forward on the early morning Sainsbury announcement,
reflecting the market's instant assumption that Tesco would respond. They
closed 44 ahead at 324p with turnover a record 11m. Trading in Tesco was
also heavy. The shares retreated 7 to 233p on turnover of 15m, while
Sainsbury added a penny at 411p on volume of 4.3m.

FT  29 JUL 94 / Market Report London Stock Exchange: Treasury report helps
calm interest rate nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The favourable tone of the UK Treasury's monthly report calmed worries on
interest rate prospects in the London stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE
100-share Index recovered more than 13 points in a determined attempt to
regain the 3,100 level. The market was given a lead by strong gains in water
industry stocks following an unexpectedly favourable pricing review from
Ofwat, the industry regulator.
A new bid from J. Sainsbury for William Low saw shares in the Scottish
supermarket group immediately outstrip the terms as speculators anticipated
an aggressive response offer from Tesco, the original bidder.
At the day's best the FT-SE 100 was above 3,097, before closing at 3,095.9
for a gain on the session of 13.6. The September Footsie futures contract
returned to a good premium, trading comfortably above 3,100 as the markets
closed.
Equities moved uncertainly in the early part of the session, easing at first
with other European markets and then losing most of an 11.8 gain on the
Footsie. But a steadier trend in the pound and sterling futures had already
calmed nerves to some extent when the UK Treasury commented that all the
latest data indicated steady economic growth, with no sign of input pricing
pressures.
Securities markets responded cautiously at first but gathered confidence in
the second half of the session, helped by a brief upturn in British
government bond prices.
A firm start on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 12
points ahead in UK hours, reinforced analysts' perceptions that global
equities still have further to run before interest rate pressures become
negative.
The strength of the water sector overflowed into the electricity stocks,
which hoped for a similarly favourable regulatory climate to prevail in the
power industry. The market had no immediate guide as to the implications of
the rejection of Ofwat's ruling by South West Water.
Heavy turnover in William Low shares as they topped the Sainsbury offer
reflected the market view that Low's pivotal position in Scottish markets
will not be taken over without a battle between the two monarchs of the
industry.
The final picture across the Footsie range was more mixed than the gain in
the Footsie index suggested. Dollar stocks, including Glaxo, BAT Industries,
RTZ and Reuters Holdings, were strong, and ICI moved forward after
disclosing satisfactory first-half results, although with no change in the
dividend payment. Oil shares were firmer in response to the dollar and the
continued strength of crude oil prices.
There was no great response from retail and consumer stocks to the easing of
interest rate concerns. Banking shares continued to move confidently towards
the profits reporting season, to be opened this morning by Lloyds Bank, and
brushed off weakness in bank stocks in Germany in the wake of interim
figures from Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank.
In general, however, strategists were wary of expressing over-optimism ahead
of the report today of the US second-quarter gross domestic product
statistics. Market forecasts for GDP growth have been moving higher all
week, and analysts now warn that growth above 4 per cent would revive all
the old fears of action by the US Federal Reserve.
Seaq volume increased to 657m shares, from 599.1m in the previous session;
on Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.05bn, indicating that the
interest rate worries dominating that session had inspired some selling
pressure.
But non-Footsie stocks were more active yesterday, making up nearly 58 per
cent of the day's business. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 9.9 at 3,642.8 as
investors continued to search out growth stocks.

FT  29 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squeeze in stock index futures helped to reverse an initial decline as
turnover in the derivatives returned to meagre levels, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,084 was
below expectations and appeared to indicate that a dull session lay ahead.
Within the first hour of trading the contract had fallen to a low of 3,074.
However, an aggressive buyer appeared at mid-morning, taking the market by
surprise. September saw the earlier decline reversed and a gentle squeeze
was seen as dealers attempted to fill the order. A more favourable outlook
on inflation helped to maintain the momentum.
A firm opening on Wall Street, the strength of sterling and another bout of
hectic buying by the morning's big trader brought a squeeze to the contract
in the last hour which saw it climb to a day's high of 3,119.
Following a bout of profit-taking it closed at 3,103, a point ahead of its
fair value premium to cash of about 7 points. Volume was 11,468 contracts.
Dealers reported a dull session in traded options, where a total of 24,372
lots had been dealt by the close. The FT-SE 100 option encountered business
of 8,261 contracts, and among stock options HSBC closed well ahead with
3,814 lots traded.

Wall Street
US stocks posted modest gains yesterday as the bond market rebounded and
this week's flood of corporate results slowed to a trickle, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 10.36 firmer at 3,730.83, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.67 ahead at 454.24.
Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 246m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite closed a slight 0.14
softer at 433.88, but the Nasdaq composite edged ahead 0.30 to 712.43.
After a weak opening, equities made a decisive push into positive territory,
in spite of the approach of a potential stumbling block this morning, when
the government will release its preliminary estimate of second-quarter
economic growth. The market was particularly vulnerable to a strong reading
because of the threat of an imminent increase in short-term interest rates
by the Federal Reserve.
Investors received a further suggestion of economic strength yesterday when
the Labor Department reported a sharper than expected decline in claims for
unemployment benefit last week, but jitters triggered by the report were
shortlived.
The employment news, which came on the heels of a sharp rise in durable
goods orders the previous session, depressed bond prices. However,
economists later dismissed the significance of the reading as a technical
aberration, allowing Treasuries to recover. The activity was closely
mirrored by the stock market until the final hours of trading, when prices
sagged a bit.
With the quarterly reporting season drawing to a close, there were a few
latecomers to pepper the morning with their results. General Motors, last of
the Big Three car makers to report, seemed to benefit from its tardiness.
GM's share price gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 50 1/4 after it revealed
record second-quarter earnings, in contrast with Ford and Chrysler, whose
strong performances had gone unrewarded. Yesterday, however, Ford
appreciated Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 and Chrysler put on Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 47 5/8 .
3M advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 in a delayed reaction to its
results, posted a day earlier. But Alcoa retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 76
7/8 and United Technologies shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/8 .
On the negative side, shares in Wellpoint Health Networks lost 18 per cent
of their value after the company posted earnings of 50 cents a share,
against expectations of 54 cents. The stock was down Dollars 5 3/4 to
Dollars 25 in heavy volume.
In an ironic twist, Wellpoint's disappointing performance fuelled
speculation that it would launch a bid for Intergroup Healthcare, which rose
25 per cent, or Dollars 9 1/2 , to Dollars 47 1/2 .
Acquisition news also buffeted the share price of Williams. The stock
climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 on a report that it was close to
accepting a sweetened Dollars 2.5bn offer from LDDS Communications for its
long-distance telephone operation.
On the Nasdaq, LDDS moved up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 19. IDB Communications,
a second LDDS takeover target, slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 on reports
that the completion of a deal was contingent on an audit of IDB finances.
Canada
Toronto ended mixed after a sluggish session, with more of the same expected
today ahead of Canada's August Civic Holiday long weekend.
Gains in conglomerates, real estate and financial services outpaced losses
in gold shares, forestry and merchandising, but overall falls outscored
rises by 373 to 343. The TSE 300 composite index gained 15.8 at 4,149.8 in
turnover of 59.7m shares valued at CDollars 626.5m.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo rose as a new electoral poll showed market favourite
Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso leading his leftist rival for the October
3 presidential election. The Bovespa index closed 1,053, or 2.5 per cent,
higher at 42,553.
The Datafolha poll, published yesterday, showed 47 per cent support for Mr
Cardoso, a moderate, against 40 per cent for Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of
the Workers Party, who had been the front-runner for months.
Mr Cardoso, who as finance minister assembled the government's economic
plan, is gaining support due to lowered inflation. Since Brazil's new
currency, the real, was introduced on July 1, inflation has dropped to 6 per
cent this month from 50 per cent in June.
