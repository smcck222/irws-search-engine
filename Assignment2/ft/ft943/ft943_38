FT  20 JUL 94 / Code on property leases proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has decided not to legislate against commercial-leasing
practices after a one-year consultation that followed widespread criticism
by tenants, Simon Davies writes.
However it is urging the property industry to set up its own code of
practice covering the controversial areas of upward-only rent reviews,
confidentiality clauses and dispute resolution procedures.
Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, said: 'It is evident that the market
is now providing a greater variety of lease terms'. The proposed code would
encourage greater flexibility. He was replying to a written question from
Mrs Angela Browning, Tory MP for Tiverton, on the conclusions of the
consultation paper.
Concerns had been expressed in parliament that the practice of upward-only
rent reviews was a significant contributor to inflation. Mr Baldry said:
'Whilst the relative bargaining strengths of the parties will depend on the
state of the market, it is not clear that occupiers fully appreciate the
strength of their own bargaining positions.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Ashdown reshuffle creates 'leadership team'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday reshuffled his
Westminster team in a bid to raise the party's morale after its poor
performance in the European elections, James Blitz writes.
In a reshuffle that was marred by moments of confusion, Mr Malcolm Bruce,
the MP for the Scottish constituency of Gordon, took the key job of economic
spokesman from Mr Alan Beith. Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's defence
spokesman, is to combine his present role with the brief on foreign affairs
that was held by Sir David Steel.
The creation of the new line-up, which should be unaltered up to the next
election, was accompanied by a new leadership team, the 'leader's
committee,' which will contain the party's main spokesmen. This body will
try to meet Mr Ashdown's concern that his party is sometimes seen as a
'one-man band'.
However there were signs yesterday that the re-organisation of the party
leadership had not gone as smoothly as could have been hoped.
Party workers were unsure whether any member of the leader's committee would
have responsibility for education policy. One senior party figure was
uncertain whether he was in the leadership team or not. There was immediate
criticism, too, that Mr Ashdown had failed to include any of the party's
three women MPs in the top leadership team.
Mr Bruce, a member of the Commons trade and industry committee, was
described by Liberal Democrat workers last night as having a similar
ideological outlook to Mr Ashdown.
The MP, who has set up his own industry think-tank in the city, believes in
a deregulated labour market and is opposed to the statutory minimum wage.
Mr Campbell, a QC and former Olympic runner, is regarded as one of the
party's strongest Commons performers. But Mr Charles Kennedy, the party's
departing president, will take sole charge of European affairs. He is widely
seen as a future Liberal Democrat leader and his retention in the post
underlines Mr Ashdown's belief that the debate on Britain's role in the EU
will dominate the next election.
Mr Beith, who has been the party's Treasury spokesman for seven years, was
thought to be disappointed to be moving from the post. He will now take over
the home affairs brief and remain deputy leader of the party.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Rules on child seatbelts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday unveiled plans to make seatbelts compulsory in all
minibuses and coaches carrying children and young people but was criticised
by the coach industry for failing to go far enough.
The Department of Transport said its proposals met the industry's demands
for a clear set of rules, but the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK
said: 'This doesn't give us the clear guidelines we need.'
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the government wanted early
action on child seatbelts while pressing the European Commission for
legislation requiring seatbelts in all new minibuses and coaches.
In the longer term the government may set tougher requirements on the
competence and health of minibus drivers and may require volunteer drivers
to pass a special test.
A series of fatal crashes has put pressure on the government to tighten up
the law covering seatbelts in minibuses and coaches.
Unilateral action by the UK to require minibuses to have seatbelts fitted to
all their seats could be regarded as inhibiting free trade in the single
European market.
By restricting the tougher regulations to minibuses used by children, the
department of transport hopes to win EU approval for new rules in 1995, and
hopes that the EU will be able to bring in a directive in 1996.
Existing EU legislation on seatbelts merely requires that they be fitted to
the front seats and other exposed seats in a coach or minibus.
This means other European manufacturers could still supply minibuses without
seatbelts.
Mr MacGregor said most new vehicles manufactured in the UK were already
provided with seatbelts, and minibus operators would be encouraged to fit
them to their existing fleets where practicable.
The confederation said it was dissatisfied with the proposed legislation
which merely extended the rules on front-seat belts to all other seats in
coaches and minibuses. It had been seeking different rules covering the
other seats in vehicles.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Departure delays at airports cut sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Departure delays at airports fell sharply last year for the second year
running, in spite of a 3 per cent increase in air traffic movements, the
Civil Aviation Authority reported yesterday.
Over three years, average departure delays at the London airports have been
reduced from 28 minutes to eight minutes, the authority said in its annual
report for the year to the end of March.
The percentage of flights that left more than 30 minutes late from six
leading airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Stansted and
Luton - dropped from 19 per cent in 1990-91 to 10 per cent in 1993-94.
The improved performance was attributed to the authority's investment in its
National Air Traffic Services (Nats) arm, and in particular the introduction
of the first stages of the Central Control Function at West Drayton,
Nottinghamshire.
The authority also said there had been 'lots of fine tuning' of systems,
especially on routes to Europe.
Mr Christopher Chataway, the authority's chairman, also announced that, for
the first time, the authority had lowered its charges 'across a broad front'
as a result of tight budgetary control and greater operational efficiency.
In December National Air Traffic Services announced average reductions of
between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in charges to airlines. The authority's
Safety Regulation Group returned about Pounds 4m to its customers -
equivalent to 8 per cent of its revenues - and announced a further small cut
in its average tariff. The economic regulation group cut charges for airline
operating licences by 15 per cent.
Mr Chataway said the authority's board had given unanimous support to recent
government proposals for privatising air traffic services as a contractor to
the authority.
He added: 'It is vital that Nats should be enabled to carry through its
investment programme and this will clearly be very difficult so long as it
remains in the public sector.'
The authority's turnover for the year rose 3 per cent to Pounds 586.1m, but
operating profit fell 7.9 per cent to Pounds 56.2m. Capital spending rose
from Pounds 127.1m to a record Pounds 151.9m. Even so this was below budget,
because projects were brought in at better-than-expected prices.
The report reveals that Heathrow's all-time daily aircraft movement record
was broken when air traffic controllers handled 1,239 arrivals and
departures, nine more than the previous best.
For the fourth year running, there were no fatal accidents involving
UK-registered public transport aircraft with more than 40 seats. But there
were two deaths in smaller public transport aircraft and 17 in general
aviation.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Manchester Airport claims lead over Gatwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester Airport yesterday claimed it has established a clear lead over
London's Gatwick Airport in the holiday flight market, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
Figures produced by Stats MR, an independent company, gave Manchester 29.4
per cent of the market in June, compared with Gatwick's 25 per cent.
In June passenger traffic was up 14.6 per cent on the same month last year,
at 1.57m. The total for the second quarter was 3.92m, 13 per cent up on the
same period in 1993.
June's charter traffic - nearly all holidays - was 1.03m passengers, a rise
of 15.4 per cent on the same month last year.
The airport said it had established a faster trend of growth than Gatwick.
Share of the holiday market in June last year was 28.4 per cent for
Manchester and 27.7 per cent for Gatwick.
'The holiday market has been expanding more quickly in the regions than in
London,' the airport said.
'The operators like it because most bookings in the north are made well in
advance and remain firm. London has comparatively more last-minute bookings,
so the average yield per flight tends to be lower.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Howard may still be on probation over law and order: How the
Lords have given the home secretary a rough ride over his criminal justice
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lords gave a third reading last night to the criminal justice bill, the
troubled centrepiece of Mr Michael Howard's campaign against crime. But it
is not clear whether the home secretary is finally free of their lordships,
or merely on probation.
Mr Howard had no such doubts in October when he won a standing ovation at
the Conservative party conference for a rousing speech promising to 'take
the handcuffs off the police and put them back on the criminals where they
belong'.
To roars of approval from the party faithful he unveiled 27 law-and-order
initiatives, including new prisons, tougher anti-terrorist powers, action
against 'jury-nobbling', and an end to repeat cautioning of offenders by the
police.
Separately Mr Howard proposed a thorough shake-up of the criminal-justice
system involving a big increase in the home secretary's influence over
police authorities and the introduction of contracts for justices' clerks,
who advise magistrates.
The trouble began with the police and magistrates' courts bill, which
embodied the changes to police authorities and justices' clerks.
Harried by a bevy of former Conservative ministers, including Lord Whitelaw,
Mr Howard was forced to back down on both issues.
There was even more trouble when debate began on the criminal justice bill.
In the Commons Mr Howard was forced to promise action against violent videos
to head off a widely supported amendment by Mr David Alton, the Liberal
Democrat MP.
In the Lords there have been five main changes at the hands of Conservative
peers:
Plans to weaken the so-called right to silence by allowing judges to call
defendants to the witness box were watered down after criticism from Lord
Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice.
Lord Ackner, a former law lord, pushed through an amendment blocking plans
to reform the compensation system for criminal injuries.
Lord Stanley of Alderley, a Conservative backbencher, led a cross-party
coalition which forced a five-year delay in government plans to abolish
local authorities' duties to provide campsites for gypsies.
Lord Carr, a former Conservative home secretary, persuaded peers to water
down plans for secure centres for offenders aged between 12 and 14.
Lord Brightman, a former law lord, successfully urged the Lords to defy the
government and create an offence of selling or offering to sell information
about personal financial affairs.
There have been other unwanted amendments too. For example last week Earl
Ferrers, a home office minister, had to accept a Labour amendment creating a
new offence of male rape with a maximum life sentence.
Friends of Mr Howard point out that most of his 27-point law-and-order plan
has emerged from the legislative process unscathed. They also say that Mr
Howard will seek to reverse some of the changes when the bill returns to the
Commons. But the bill must then return to the Lords, where peers may insist
on reinserting the changes.
In any event, the bill's rough passage through the Lords has wrecked Mr
Howard's timetable for implementation. The bill should have been on the
statute book by next month but will not now complete its Commons stages
until MPs return from their summer break in October.
Mr Howard's apologists argue that other bills have suffered at their
lordships' hands in this session - notably the education bill, which was
savaged by peers on all sides of the house.
Nevertheless, Mr Howard's difficulty in winning approval for his
much-trumpeted law-and-order programme has removed much of the gloss from
his parliamentary reputation and stoked speculation that he may be moved or
even dropped from the cabinet in Mr John Major's impending reshuffle.
Mr Howard promised his party conference audience that his 27-point plan was
'just a first instalment' in a sustained campaign on law and order. His
thinking then was that a second criminal justice bill would be introduced
next year. Not surprisingly officials say this now looks unlikely.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Major underlines food VAT denial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday appeared to rule out an extention of valued
added tax to food.
For the first time Mr John Major used the word 'ever' to underline his
denial that he could see no circumstances in which VAT would be extended to
food.
Mr Major's reply came under persistent questioning from Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the acting Labour leader, who accused the Tories of having a 'fatal
attraction' to extending the tax to other goods and services.
She pressed Mr Major to say if he agreed with the view of Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, that 'far too many goods and services' are exempt from VAT.
Mr Clarke's views on VAT were contained in a letter to one of his
constituents which was leaked by Labour.
Mr Major urged Mrs Beckett to examine Mr Clarke's comments in full instead
of 'selectively misquoting what he said'.
Pressed to name one thing on which he would never put VAT, Mr Major said he
could 'conceive no circumstances ever when food would be subject to VAT'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, yesterday wrote to the prime minister
asking him to 'clear up the conflicting statements' over VAT.
He said: 'The chancellor said no sensible minister would give categorical
assurances over extentions to VAT.
'The prime minister contradicted the chancellor when he attempted to rule
out circumstances in which he would impose VAT on food - but not on
newspapers, children's clothes, or bus and train fares.'
Labour now plans to press Mr Major to rule out further extentions of VAT to
children's clothes, newspapers, books, and rail and bus fares.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Labour to stress 'green' economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday pledged to put greater emphasis on the environment in
government, particularly where it can create new jobs and produce a more
sustainable economy.
The party sets out an approach to environmental issues in a new policy
document which relies heavily on government action, particularly in
transport and energy.
Mr Chris Smith, environment spokesman, said: 'We have tried to integrate the
environment into a whole range of policy areas. We view the environment not
just as a challenge, but also an opportunity.'
In a policy paper, In Trust for Tomorrow, Labour proposes to create jobs by
encouraging energy efficiency conversions in homes; training young people to
help clean up the environment; and promoting environmental industries which
supply clean technologies and 'green' products. It would also offer
protection to 'whistle-blowers' who reveal breaches of environmental law by
their employers.
The party acknowledges for the first time that increased protection for the
environment could lead to a lower rate of growth in gross domestic product.
The document says: 'A sustainable economic policy will aim to optimise
environmentally beneficial activity, recognising that there are limits to
the pollution that can be safely emitted, and that the consumption of
non-renewable resources needs to be matched by the development of renewable
technologies.'
Labour would aim to change the national accounting system by 2000. A
reformed measure of national income would initially be published alongside
GDP figures.
Transport policy would be reversed, with a shift of investment from road
building to public transport. A moratorium on new road schemes would be
declared pending a review, and it would aim to double the amount of
long-haul freight carried by rail.
The party would stress improving the energy efficiency of homes with
incentives which could create up to 50,000 jobs in the building sector.
Labour would also support the coal industry by promoting clean-coal
technology and halting nuclear-power construction, and set a target of 10
per cent electricity generation from renewable sources by 2010.
For the private individual, a Labour government would establish a set of
environmental rights, such as clean air and drinking water, and access to
open land. People would also have the right to compensation for
environmental damage.
The document received a broad welcome from the environmental lobby. The
Council for the Protection of Rural England said Labour had 'woken up to the
importance of having an effective environment policy'. Friends of the Earth
welcomed Labour's recognition that the environment could create jobs.
However, the Road Haulage Association attacked the document, saying it
played down the environmental improvements made in transport and exaggerated
the problems.
Berrymans, a firm of solicitors specialising in pollution cases, said the
policy had failed to deal adequately with environmental liability.

FT  20 JUL 94 / London service sector sees jobs fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlook for employment in London's service sector has grown gloomier in
the last three months, according to a survey by the London Chamber of
Commerce.
The proportion of service-sector businesses that say employment has risen,
compared to those who say it has fallen, has dropped to a negative balance
of 13. In the last quarterly survey in March there was a positive balance of
28 in the proportion of companies reporting a pick-up in employment.
Meanwhile, the proportion of service-sector businesses expecting employment
to pick up in the next three months has also dropped significantly, to a
negative balance of three.
This decline took place even though export optimism in the sector rose
sharply in the last three months. Overall business confidence is now at its
highest level for five years in the sector.
The report, which surveyed 344 business employing about 330,000 people in
greater London, notes that export confidence in manufacturing also rose.
However domestic deliveries fell and overall business confidence dipped
slightly, although the balances in both sectors remained positive.
The balance of manufacturing companies reporting increased employment has
now risen to zero, up from a negative balance of minus five in the last
quarter.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Roads agency to shed 500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Highways Agency, the organisation set up just three months ago to manage
England's motorways and trunk roads, yesterday announced plans to cut both
its staff numbers and budget by more than a fifth.
The agency, which is responsible for the implementation of the Pounds 2bn
annual road-building and maintenance programme, is to shed 500 jobs as part
of a cost-cutting programme aimed at saving Pounds 20m a year. It will close
13 of its 21 regional offices. Managers will be hardest hit with 30 per cent
of senior posts abolished. Less than 20 per cent of junior staff jobs will
go.
Most of the reductions in the workforce of 2,400 should be achieved by
voluntary redundancy.
The result of these moves will be to reduce the agency's annual budget of
Pounds 83m by Pounds 20m in 1996-97. The restructuring will be completed in
the first half of next year.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the re-organisation was the
final stage of a programme aimed at speeding up the planning and
construction of roads.
The agency suffers from high overheads because of the complexity of its
regional structure. Communications between departments are slow and it is
inflexible in responding to the peaks and troughs of highway works. A single
office to oversee the road-building programme will be set up in the west
Midlands, replacing the 10 offices used at present.
Four regional offices to manage and maintain the road network will be
established. These will be in Leeds for northern England; in Bedford for
central England; Dorking in Surrey for southern England, with a branch
office in Exeter, Devon; and in London. Offices which will close include
Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, Bristol, Nottingham and Coventry.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Prison-building programme 'hit by delays'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extensive prison-building and modernisation programme in England and
Wales has been dogged by cost overruns and delays, the National Audit Office
says in a report published today.
The public expenditure watchdog found that costs exceeded estimates in every
one of the seven new prison projects - all completed since 1991 - examined
for the report. There were also overruns on 15 refurbishment programmes.
Total construction costs for the seven prisons were Pounds 475m - Pounds
78.9m more than the estimated costs. With Woodhill, near Milton Keynes, the
cost of Pounds 102.3m was 31 per cent over the tender price.
The time taken to build the seven prisons varied between three years and
eight-and-a-half years, the report says.
On all 15 of the refurbishment projects, the final cost exceeded the
contract price by 10 per cent or more. Seven of the 15 were completed in
time, with significant delays on some of the rest.
The watchdog says however that the building and modernisation programme is
the greatest effort to improve conditions and provide accommodation since
the 19th century.
It also commends the Prison Service for reducing the average time to build a
prison from seven years to four years.
Delays and extra costs were incurred because of changes in design - often
the fault of contractors - and improvements required by the service, some of
them prompted by incidents at other prisons.
The report puts the blame for many of the problems on the service for
overloading project managers. The service gives managers a workload that
leaves them little time for adequate financial and managerial control.
It also says that Treasury rules limiting the scope for carrying forward
unspent money constrain effective management of prison building works.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Merseyside body lifts performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The controversial Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday told MPs it
had met or exceeded all government targets set for it in the year ended
March 31. The targets are the main means of measuring performance among the
10 development corporations.
The Liverpool-based corporation, which was set up in 1981 to regenerate
Mersey docklands, has been under fire from the Commons public accounts
committee over losses of nearly Pounds 700,000 on an opera concert staged to
celebrate a tall ships regatta in 1992. The committee will report in the
autumn.
The corporation's annual report says it has reclaimed 47 acres of land in
the last year, built nearly five miles of new roads and 402 houses,
developed more than 750,000 sq ft of commercial floor space, secured 2,753
jobs and attracted Pounds 37m of private-sector investment.
In addition it has also attracted 112 new companies into its mainly
waterfront areas and has let more than 720,000 sq ft of space - 9 per cent
up on 1992-93. Indirect investment in plant and equipment by private-sector
companies rose 24 per cent to Pounds 43.2m.
The opera concert was contracted to an independent company formed by the
corporation's local public-relations consultant. No other tenders were asked
for. When ticket sales failed to materialise, the corporation had to inject
about Pounds 400,000 to save the concert. The company later collapsed,
leaving creditors bearing most of the losses.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Nuclear privatisation call renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned utility, has revived its plea to be
privatised.
In a submission to the government's nuclear review yesterday the company
said its long-term future could only be secured if it was put on the same
commercial footing as other electricity generators.
Mr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive, said the government would not provide
money to build further nuclear power stations - funds would have to come
from the private sector.
Although Scottish Nuclear came out in favour of privatisation before its
English counterpart, Nuclear Electric, it had appeared to back off because
of the practical problems of adapting nuclear power for the private sector.
But Mr Jeffrey said yesterday that he felt these problems had now been
clearly identified - and could be resolved. His company hoped to be
privatised by the end of 1996.
Scottish Nuclear is proposing that it be split into two parts. One would
contain its closed Hunterston A Magnox station and the associated
liabilities, as well as past liabilities for reprocessing fuel from its two
active advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs).
The financial provisions already made for decommissioning Hunterston A would
be put into a segregated fund, which would take over full responsibility for
the station.
The other part - which would become the company to be privatised - would
consist of the two AGR stations and the provisions made for their
decommissioning costs. Mr Jeffrey said this company would be able to operate
commercially, particularly if the government approved its plan to put spent
fuel into a dry store instead of sending it for expensive reprocessing.
Mr Jeffrey said he believed the wholesale price of electricity would rise
from 2.5p to 3p per unit by the end of the decade as supplies of fossil
fuels became tighter.
The environmental costs of fossil fuels would also add between 0.4p and 0.8p
to each unit. Against this, Scottish Nuclear estimated that it would be able
to get its existing costs down to 2.5p a unit this year, with any newly
built plant producing at 2.9p.
Unlike Nuclear Electric, which wants to build a new nuclear station at
Sizewell as soon as possible, Scottish Nuclear has no need for extra
capacity until 2011. But Mr Jeffrey suggested that a privatised company
might not build a nuclear station: it could build whatever was appropriate.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Grassroots role was decisive: A look at the battles behind
yesterday's announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the government set out to privatise the nation's forests, the group of
civil servants set up to review the Forestry Commission's role received
thousands of letters from the public, most of them opposed to a sell-off.
It is this overwhelming public opposition which appears to have been the
main factor that persuaded the government to abandon the idea, at least for
the time being.
Environmental organisations, walkers' groups and private-sector timber
growers all weighed in with protests. Among the few advocates were the
forestry management groups that stood to gain from a wholesale shift of
woodlands into private hands.
'The level of opposition right across the spectrum was more than they
expected,' said one industry observer.
With a raft of other thorny measures under way, such as the introduction of
value added tax on fuel and the reorganisation of local government,
ministers felt a highly unpopular measure involving the 1.1m hectares of
public forests would be ill-timed, especially if it affected traditional
Tory voters in the countryside.
Privatisation would also have required legislation, creating the potential
for a messy parliamentary process.
Chief among the concerns expressed by the public was that access to woodland
would be impeded - or blocked altogether - if private landowners took over.
Three former senior commission executives said a forced sale might raise
only Pounds 500m while additional costs to the Treasury in lost timber sales
and grants for planting could rise to Pounds 83m a year by 2010.
The commission's lack of financial transparency - one of the government's
reasons for seeking radical change - also proved in the end to be a reason
for postponing privatisation. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary and an
ardent free marketeer, is understood to have argued against the Treasury's
push for a sell-off on the grounds that the commission's management and
accounting practices first had to be modernised.
The internal government debate on privatisation was complicated by
disagreements between ministers. Responsibility for the nation's forests is
divided between the Scottish Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food in London, and the Welsh Office.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
agriculture minister, are believed to have opposed privatisation, arguing
that it would be unpopular. They also felt the commission, reorganised into
separate commercial and regulatory arms as recently as 1992, was beginning
to prove itself in better shape, with the prospect of break-even this year
or next.
It is thought those in favour of a sell-off were the Treasury, anxious to
hold down public spending; Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who
wanted the commission to be made more efficient; and, until recently, Mr
Redwood.
Tensions between cabinet colleagues were exacerbated by a long-standing
distrust of the Forestry Commission by ministers and Whitehall officials.
Although the commission is the government's forestry department, it is run
by a government-appointed board of commissioners which has contributed to
diluting ministerial control.
Mr Redwood, for one, is understood to have wanted three separate 'next
steps' agencies for England, Wales and Scotland to be created out of Forest
Enterprise, the commission's commercial arm, in order to improve the
commercial output of the forests under his control.
The question of eventual privatisation remains un-resolved. Most of the
forests were planted after the 1930s and many are only now reaching
maturity. It is thought some ministers believe privatisation would be more
successful once those forests are fully productive.
'It's an open question as to whether they're being fattened up for
privatisation,' said an industry observer. 'Quite a lot of these executive
agencies are. Is this one? It's clearly not happening at this stage,
however.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Cost targets planned to curb NHS bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to launch a fresh initiative to counter growing
bureaucracy in the National Health Service by setting out broad targets for
management spending by trust hospitals and community health groups.
Amid growing concern about the increase in the number of NHS managers,
ministers will reveal that the average administrative costs incurred by NHS
trusts over the past year are between 3.5 per cent and 6 per cent of their
total budgets.
The Department of Health intends to use this figure as a guide to how much
each trust chief executive should spend on management. Earlier this year Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, admitted that some trusts spent as
much as 8.6 per cent of their total pay bill on administration, and said it
needed to be reduced.
The recommendations will come in a hitherto confidential report produced by
the Department of Health, the Audit Commission and the Trust Federation,
which should be published later this year.
But it is unlikely to satisfy critics in the Labour party and health unions
who argue that the purchaser/provider reforms in the NHS have led to more an
bureaucrats.
Concern over the increase in bureaucracy followed the publication of figures
last year showing that the number of NHS managers rose by nearly 25 per cent
in 1992.
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, recently embarrassed the government by
referring to the 'restlessness among medical staff about the number of men
in grey suits'.
The government does not intend to enforce strict guidelines for spending on
management. It believes that publication of figures on the average
administrative expenditure by trusts will exert strong public pressure on
those which exceed the figure.
It will be a criminal offence for a drug company to offer expensive gifts
and for doctors to accept them under regulations presented to parliament
yesterday.
The regulations implement the European directive on the advertising of
medicines. Inexpensive items relevant to the practice of medicine or
pharmacy remain allowed.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Row over cash for questions probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row broke out at Westminster yesterday after four MPs with extensive
outside interests were proposed to sit on the committee charged with
investigating the so-called 'cash for questions' affair.
The 17 MPs selected to serve on the Committee of Privileges had between them
18 paid directorships, eight consultancies and six sponsorship arrangements
with trade unions or other bodies.
Just two of the proposed committee members, both Conservatives, had nothing
to declare in the most recent register of members' interests.
One Labour MP - Mr Dale Campbell-Savours - immediately claimed that the
public would not have 'very much confidence' in a probe conducted by such a
committee.
But this view was rebutted by Sir James Spicer, who was among the nine
Tories nominated. 'Do you want people on a committee like this to be
virtually eunuchs who do nothing at all except haunt the House of Commons?'
he asked.
The inquiry will focus on the case of two Conservative MPs who were
suspended from their posts as junior ministerial aides after reports that
they were prepared to accept Pounds 1,000 for tabling parliamentary
questions. But some Tories are worried the probe could lead to a fundamental
reassessment of MPs' outside interests.
Labour MPs last night blocked attempts to nod through the appointment of
those named, forcing a debate on the subject today and making it less likely
the committee will be able to meet for the first time before the recess.
The bulk of the directorships and consultancies held by those proposed for
the committee were shared between four senior Tory MPs: Sir Marcus Fox,
chairman of the backbench 1922 committee; Sir Peter Hordern, Sir Cranley
Onslow, a past 1922 committee chairman; and Sir Giles Shaw.
Six of the seven Labour MPs are sponsored by trade unions or other bodies,
the exception being Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield. The two proposed
members who had nothing to declare in the most recent register were Mr Tony
Newton, leader of the Commons, and Mr John Ward.
The full list of those proposed was as follows: Sir Nicholas Lyell
(attorney-general); Mr David Alton (Lib Dem Liverpool Mossley Hill); Mr Tony
Benn (Lab Chesterfield); Sir Marcus Fox (C Shipley); Sir Peter Hordern (C
Horsham); Mr Doug Hoyle (Lab Warrington North); Mr Bill Michie (Lab
Sheffield Heeley); Sir David Mitchell (C Hampshire North West); Mr Alf
Morris (Lab Manchester Wythenshawe); Mr John Morris (shadow
attorney-general); Mr Tony Newton (Leader of the Commons); Sir Cranley
Onslow (C Woking); Sir Giles Shaw (C Pudsey); Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal
Green and Stepney); Sir James Spicer (C Dorset West); Mr John Ward (C
Poole), and Mr Alan Williams (Lab Swansea West).

FT  20 JUL 94 / ITV claims advance over Sky channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV yesterday claimed it was winning the battle for viewers against Sky
Television as it unveiled its Pounds 176m autumn schedule of programmes.
Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV's network director responsible for commissioning and
scheduling, said sales of satellite dishes were down and there had also been
a drop in viewing of Sky Television.
'Sky has been losing to minority satellite channels,' said Mr Plantin.
These 'minority' channels - which appear to eating into the share of viewing
taken by the six Sky channels in cable and satellite-equipped homes -
include UK Gold, the library channel; Eurosport, the pan-European sports
channel; and the TNT/Cartoon Channel.
ITV figures, based on research by the Broadcasting Audience Research Board,
show that the audience share of the six Sky channels in cable and satellite
homes declined from 59 per cent in January to 51 per cent in June. In the
first six months of last year, before the launch of a range of new satellite
channels in September, the Sky channels' share ranged between 68 per cent
and 70 per cent.
Sky Television is owned by British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.
Sky One, the most popular satellite channel, was watched for an average of
1.5 hours a week this January, but that figure fell to an average of only
1.2 hours in June, while viewing of Sky movies also declined.
Mr David Elstein, director of programmes at Sky, said yesterday that some
decline in the Sky channels' share of viewing was inevitable with the
arrival of six new satellite channels. The summer drop had been caused by
high-profile sports events, such as the World Cup, for which Sky could not
bid.
ITV said yesterday it had also increased its lead over its nearest rival,
BBC 1, by more than 50 per cent during the past few months.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Most charities to benefit from eased accounts rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most charities will face lighter accounting requirements under proposals of
a voluntary sector deregulation taskforce which were accepted by the
government yesterday.
Charities with an annual income of less than Pounds 10,000 will in future
satisfy their legal obligations by producing simplified trustees' annual
reports and accounts in line with Charity Commission guidance.
More than 90 per cent of charity income goes to the biggest 10 per cent of
charities, and some two-thirds of the sector will benefit from being able to
produce simpler reports and accounts. Ministers have also agreed in
principle that the income threshold at which bigger charities' accounts must
be audited rather than independently examined should rise from Pounds
100,000 to Pounds 250,000.
The government has fully or partially accepted 72 of 189 recommendations in
the taskforce's report. A further 60 are under review. Recommendations
accepted cover a wide range of issues, from easing restrictions on obtaining
permits for charitable collections to agreeing to clarify the application of
health and safety legislation to village halls and community centres.
Ministers intend to extend the small-business litmus test - under which the
likely impact on small businesses is taken into account before new
regulations are framed - to include the effect on charities.
Britain's voluntary sector has a turnover of about Pounds 16bn a year and
faces many of the same regulation issues as business.
The government wants charities to play a growing role in delivering services
under contract to public authorities, and hopes that the changes accepted
yesterday will lead to increased efficiency.
There will however be disappointment in the sector about recommendations the
government has rejected. A call to lessen the restrictions on trustees'
scope to invest funds has been turned down, although the Treasury said it is
'considering the case for reform'. Charities made little progress in their
efforts to to raise the problems faced from a Pounds 335m annual bill for
irrecoverable value added tax.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Woodlands avoid sell-off: Government plans executive agency
status for Forest Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday formally ruled out privatisation of Britain's
public forests but announced new incentives for tree-planting for timber and
a more 'businesslike' structure for the commercial arm of the Forestry
Commission.
Announcing the results of an Pounds 833,000 review of the forestry sector
initiated by the government in March last year, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, left open the possibility of a change of heart on privatisation
at some future date.
'Our conclusion is that, at this stage of their development, the Forestry
Commission woodlands should remain in the public sector,' he told the
Commons.
He said environmental, recreational and public-access needs had been taken
into account in the decision against a sell-off, as had the fact that the
forests were mostly not fully mature and would raise only about Pounds 750m,
compared with a book value of Pounds 1.7bn.
Mr Lang said that Forest Enterprise, which manages the commission's 1.1m
hectares, would become an executive agency under the government's 'next
steps' programme aimed at increasing efficiency and providing better value
for taxpayers' money.
'There will be improved accounting and costing arrangements, helping to
ensure that the costs and benefits of commission programmes are better
measured.'
Some 180,000 hectares of commission land have been sold off since the start
of the 1980s, and these sales will continue. But the government plans to
strengthen protection for continued public access to woodlands that move
into private hands.
Incentives to encourage the private sector to plant new commercial forests
are to be increased by 10 per cent, with Pounds 3m in new money and an
additional Pounds 1m reallocated from reduced grants for re-planting.
The changes were broadly welcomed by the forestry industry. Mr Peter Wilson,
chief executive of the Timber Growers Association, said planting of conifers
for timber had fallen dramatically since controversial tax incentives were
dropped in 1988.
'Prior to 1988 the pendulum was stuck on the commercial side. Then it swung
completely towards the environment. This is a swing back to a more sensible
balance,' he said.
However, other forestry and landowner organisations were not convinced the
increases in grants were sufficient to attract new investment.
Conservation groups welcomed the abandonment of privatisation, but expressed
concern that commercial objectives could override environmental ones in the
new Forest Enterprise agency.
'We're not persuaded that we're not going to see more commercial plantations
in the wrong places, which aren't driven by environmental criteria,' said Ms
Fiona Reynolds, director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Britons still walk a mile for a pint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's dream of a return to a Britain of warm beer and cricket on
the village green was given a boost yesterday by news that the traditional
pint of milk on the doorstep and pint of beer in a pub will live on.
From October 1 next year the UK will move into line with the rest of the
European Union by adopting metric measures for most purposes. But beer and
cider will still be sold in pint rather than half-litre measures - provided
these are in returnable containers - while road signs will stay in miles
rather than kilometres.
Lord Strathclyde, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday he had laid
before parliament statutory instruments to implement the European Units of
Measurement directive. But the legislation provided for a handful of the
most popular imperial measures - some first standardised just after the
signing of the Magna Carta - to continue to be used.
Past reluctance from the public and from traders to adopt metric measures
led to the UK being granted a special exemption from the weights and
measures directive.
However most goods that are not already sold in metric measures will have to
conform from next year.
The main exceptions will be foods such as meat, poultry, fish and cheese,
which are sold loose by the pound and ounce. These will not have to switch
to metric until 2000.
The imperial measures that will continue beyond that are the mile, yard,
foot and inch for road-traffic signs and distance and speed measurement; the
pint for milk, draught beer and cider sold in returnable containers; the
troy ounce for precious metals; and the acre for land registration.
Consumers fearing confusion should take heart. Retailers will display price
conversion charts for goods sold in metric quantities.

FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Scepticism on jobs role of small
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Job turnover in the OECD countries is higher than expected, with an average
of one in five jobs being newly created or destroyed each year, according to
a special chapter in the OECD employment outlook on job gains and job
losses.
The study finds little variation across countries and no correlation between
job turnover levels and degree of labour market regulation.
Indeed, the figures suggest that the highly regulated Nordic countries have
some of the highest job turnover levels and the deregulated UK and US some
of the lowest.
The study suggests high job turnover cuts employer-employee commitment and
skill training. It also expresses scepticism about the assumption that small
enterprises will be the motor of job creation, pointing out that, in the
late-1980s, employment growth was mainly due to expansion of existing
enterprises.
Across the OECD, job gains from new starts and the expansion of existing
enterprises now average 10 per cent of total employment each year, while job
losses from closures and contractions also average about 10 per cent.
The UK and Germany, despite wide differences in the degree of labour market
and business regulation, show similarly low job turnover between the
mid-1980s and early-1990s.
The spectrum on job gains ranged from 9 per cent of total employment in the
UK and Germany to 16 per cent in Denmark, while the rate of job losses
ranged from 7 per cent in the UK and Germany to 15 per cent in Sweden.
Combining the percentage of jobs created and those destroyed yearly, the US
turnover rate is 23.4 per cent, Canada 26.3 and the UK 15.3. The highest
figure is New Zealand (35.5 per cent) followed by Denmark (29.8), Sweden
(29.1) and France (27.1). In most countries about 80 per cent of job
turnover is not related to the economic cycle, and most turnover is due to
labour displacement within industries rather than across industries.
There is quite a large variation within Europe in the extent to which job
gains come from new enterprises or expanding existing ones.
There is, however, relatively little difference between patterns of turnover
in North America and Europe, particularly in manufacturing. The report says
'the manufacturing sector in North America is no more dynamic in terms of
openings and closures of establishments than a sample of Nordic countries.'
Looking at the overall birth and death rate of enterprises, the UK has the
lowest 'birth rate' of the countries studied despite the increase in small
companies and self-employment associated with the 'enterprise culture' of
the Thatcher years.
New enterprise creation as a proportion of all enterprises - between the
mid-1980s and early 1990s - was highest in Canada (19.1 per cent), Sweden
(16.8) and France (14.3).
Of the nine countries studied the UK was last (9.2 per cent). But the UK
also has the lowest rate of establishment closure at 8.5 per cent. The US is
also at the bottom end for both openings (13.6 per cent) and closures (9.2
per cent).
Only 10 per cent of those companies surviving at least six years created
jobs in the first two years and only 11 per cent created jobs during the
first four years. However, after six years, 34 per cent of the survivors had
created jobs.
On the reasons for enterprise survival, the report quotes a study which
stresses the availability of advice from private or public experts and
having partners such as an important and regular customer, supplier or
banker.
'Other processes related to unemployment, personal wealth, a liberal
political climate, or local spending or programmes of assistance had weak or
mixed effects,' says the report. Large claims made for the job creation
ability of small enterprises are often based on faulty statistics.
'A more correct statement is that small establishments are
disproportionately responsible for both gross job gains and losses. The
latter is partly due to the relatively high mortality rate of new, small
establishments,' the report states.
It also points out that it is not surprising that small enterprises
(employing up to 100 people) should play an important role in job creation
as they account for between 40 and 70 per cent of all jobs.
Even so, the share of employment in small enterprises did rise in several
OECD countries from the early-1970s.
The employment share of small enterprises varies widely from a high of 71
per cent in Italy to a low of 43 per cent in the US. Britain is at the lower
end with 49.1 per cent.

FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Effect of labour standards may be
small
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In one of its most politically controversial passages, the employment
outlook hints that the attempt to harmonise labour regulation through the
social dimension of the European Union is superfluous.
'It may be argued that labour standards do not have much influence on
external competitiveness and trade performance, and thus harmonisation of
labour standards is not necessary,' says the report. But it adds: 'However,
it is too early to reach this conclusion: considerably more empirical work
is called for.'
Overall the special chapter on 'social dumping' - the downward pressure on
employment conditions to improve competitiveness - finds there is little
evidence for its existence in association with more open world trade.
It does, however, warn that it could become an issue, especially in trading
blocs such as the European Union, which intend to merge their currencies.
'If exchange rates are unified there is a risk that countries may resort to
'social devaluations' to improve competitiveness, to the detriment of other
member countries,' says the report.
The chapter also finds:
There has been a general convergence towards lighter labour market
regulation (with the exception of some southern European economies)
throughout the OECD area;
The degree of government intervention in the determination of labour
standards appears to have little effect on either wage rates or trade
performance;
There is, however, some evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment
have been larger in countries where labour costs are lower and government
regulations less stringent.
On the liberalisation trend of the 1980s the report says that enterprises
enjoy increased freedom on working time, on flexible employment contracts
and on minimum wages but it is unclear whether this trend is the result of
economic integration, or whether other factors such as technological change
or unemployment are just as important.
The report states that real earnings actually grew faster in countries where
regulations were weakened in the recent past, and finds no evidence of a
correlation between levels of regulation and per capita GDP and wages.
On the other hand there is little evidence to show that countries with less
stringent regulations have performed better in terms of trade.
The chapter includes an OECD index which attempts to measure the stringency
of labour standards, with low marks for low regulation and vice versa. The
US and UK both score zero, with Greece the most regulated with 8 points
followed by Italy, Spain and Sweden all on 7.
The chapter concludes: 'There is no compelling evidence that working
conditions have worsened in OECD countries as a result of greater trade
openness.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Unemployment set to reach 35m this
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in the 25 countries of the Organisation of Economic Development
and Co-operation will reach a record 35m this year, up 10m since 1990, but
will fall from 8.5 per cent of the working population in 1994 to 8.3 per
cent in 1995, according to the OECD annual Employment Outlook released
yesterday.
In Europe, however, the jobless figure will rise from 11.7 per cent this
year to 11.8 per cent next.
The report says employment growth in the current recovery has been
concentrated in part-time jobs and has been weaker than in past recoveries,
a result of slower growth in service sector employment. But the OECD says
that fears of 'jobless recovery' have been exaggerated and predicts that as
growth picks up employment will follow.
Wage rises remained moderate in 1993, falling to 3.4 per cent from 5.2 per
cent in 1992. A peak was reached in public spending on labour market
measures in 1992 and 1993 at an average 1.7 per cent of GDP.
The report strikes a rather less free-market tone than parts of last month's
OECD Jobs Study.
'High labour turnover can deter both businesses and workers from investing
optimally in skill training. This can result in even more labour turnover as
workers look for better job opportunities in other firms', says the
commentary. Countries should facilitate long-term commitments between
employees and employers and says 'institution building, involving
governments and the social partners, is an essential component of a strategy
to foster a high productivity growth path.'
This emphasis reflects the influence of Mr Robert Reich, the US labour
secretary, and will be less to the liking of the UK government. Similarly,
strongly deregulatory governments will have reservations about the praise
for collective bargaining and consultation with workers over plant closures.
However, the UK government will be pleased that on labour standards the
report hints that harmonisation of labour regulation of the European Union
is superfluous, although it adds that further research will be needed to
substantiate this.
The UK will also be pleased that the OECD predicts it will have one of the
highest levels of employment growth this year and next, at 1.2 per cent in
1994 and 1.4 per cent in 1995. And in an analysis of average earnings after
tax, adjusted for purchasing power parities, the UK comes fourth out of 18
OECD countries behind Switzerland, the US, and Canada, and just ahead of
Germany.
Compared with the 1980s it says labour force growth in Europe will slacken
but the opposite is predicted for North America and Oceania.
The number of young people in the labour force is set to fall in Europe and
grow in North America. Women and older workers will see their share of the
labour force grow.
Occupational growth will be strongest for professional, technical and
managerial workers.

FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Collective bargaining remains
prevalent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Collective bargaining is not evolving along the lines of one single model,
but, with some exceptions, the number of workers covered by collective
agreements has remained consistently high over the past decade, according to
a special chapter of the OECD outlook, writes David Goodhart.
In 12 out of 17 countries for which data are available at least two-thirds
of employees are covered by collective agreements. But the chapter also
examines the wide disparity between the number of workers in unions and the
much higher number who are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
The OECD says that the most extreme disparity can be found in France and
Spain where, respectively, 10 and 11 per cent of the workforce are in
unions, but 92 per cent and 68 per cent are covered by collective
bargaining.
In Austria 98 per cent are covered by collective bargaining with 46 per cent
in unions. Some 32 per cent are unionised in Germany but 90 per cent are
covered by collective bargaining. In the US 18 per cent are covered by
collective bargaining and 16 per cent are in unions. The unionisation rate
in the UK is 39 per cent, with collective bargaining coverage of 47 per
cent.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan calls for silicon wafers consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) has called for a
global research consortium to bring together leading manufacturers of
silicon wafers to develop advanced materials for use in the production of
semiconductor chips.
Nine Japanese silicon wafer makers plus Wacker Chemitronics, part of
Germany's Hoechst group, and MEMC Electronic Materials, a US subsidiary of
Huls of Germany, are involved in discussions about forming the consortium.
The companies together have a 90 per cent share of the world market for
silicon wafers - thin mirror-like platters of finely-tooled silicon on to
which miniature electronic circuits are etched and then diced into
semiconductor chips.
Japanese makers together have about 70 per cent of the silicon wafer market,
with Shinetsu Semiconductor alone holding a 28 per cent market share.
Several companies have dropped out of wafer manufacturing over the past few
years in the face of high research and capital costs and fierce competition
on prices.
Miti is considering putting up 70 per cent of the estimated Y18bn (Pounds
117m) in research and development costs for the consortium, with the balance
to be paid by the participating companies.
The plan has yet to receive final approval. 'It is one of several research
projects that Miti is considering,' said Roger McDaniel, chief executive of
MEMC.
'The proposal is in the preliminary stages,' he added, 'but if it goes ahead
and the conditions are acceptable, then we would be interested in
participating.'
Companies joining the proposed consortium are expected to provide personnel,
technology and some of the funds for the joint effort.
The wafer research project would be the first of its kind in which the
Japanese ministry has provided funding to an international group of
companies in the semiconductor industry.
The proposal is to develop, over a period of about seven years, wafers that
are twice the size of those in use in the semiconductor industry today. At
present, the largest wafers in use are 200mm in diameter and the industry is
in the midst of debating what size the next generation of wafers should be.
The Miti project is aimed at the next-but-one generation of wafer
technology. The size of wafers keeps increasing as the semiconductor
industry develops more sophisticated and larger chips.
However, increasing the size of silicon wafers is an expensive proposition
involving considerable investment in tooling, and technology development.
'There is a limit to what the companies can achieve with their own R&amp;D
funds,' a Miti official said.
The wafer market, at about Y400bn worldwide, is much smaller than the
semiconductor market, which is approaching Dollars 100bn, but Miti expects
it to expand to as much as Y1,000bn by 2010.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Geneva has won the contest with Bonn to host the World Trade Organisation,
which takes over from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year,
writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
Mr Andras Szepesi of Hungary, who has been conducting the consultations with
Gatt's 123 members, said yesterday that with over 90 per cent of opinions
in, there was a 'rather strong majority' in Geneva's favour. He told trade
diplomats that the basis was there for a consensus decision when the WTO
preparatory committee meets on Friday.
The German government is desperate to seek substitutes for the thousands of
civil servants and diplomats who will move from Bonn when the German capital
shifts to Berlin later this decade. Both Bonn and Geneva put up seductive
cases for housing the future WTO - due to come into being in January 1995 -
with offers of office accommodation, conference facilities and diplomatic
perks worth millions of dollars.
Mr Szepesi said that in terms of value and costs there was little to choose
between them. However, two factors weighed heavily in the choice of Geneva:
continuity with the present Gatt which has its headquarters in Geneva; and
the proximity of key international organisations the WTO will have to work
with.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Siemens-led group clinches Kazakh power
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Turkish-German consortium led by KWU, Siemens' power-generating equipment
business, has won a breakthrough turnkey contract to build a gas-fired power
station in the Aktyubinsk region of Kazakhstan. The order is worth nearly
DM1bn (Pounds 400m).
The 954MW station will be Kazakhstan's first combined-cycle power plant,
which uses the waste heat from gas turbines to power additional steam
turbines. In line with a decree passed in December, the plant will be
financed through revenue from three oilfields in the region.
The contract was awarded by Kazakhstanenergo, the state-owned utility. Due
to go on line in stages by 1998 and fired with Kazakh natural gas, the plant
is expected to make a big contribution to the independence of the country's
power supply.
Kazakhstan is a big exporter of primary energy sources, notably coal and
crude oil, but has to import about 20 per cent of its electricity.
Siemens' German consortium partners are Babcock Lentjes Kraftwerkstechnik
and Balcke-Durr, both parts of Deutsche Babcock.
Siemens will supply four gas turbines, two steam turbines, six generators,
the instrumentation and control equipment and the switchgear. The Babcock
companies will provide the heat recovery steam generators and mechanical
systems. Other components will be sourced from eastern Germany.
The Turkish consortium member is the Turkish-US company United BMB Group,
based in Ankara and New Jersey, which will handle construction and civil
works.
Siemens has been active in Russia through Interturbo, its St
Petersburg-based venture with turbine manufacturer LMZ.
Interturbo will manufacture four units for the Aktyubinsk IPP combined-cycle
plant in Kazakhstan.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: WTO chief contender with trade in his
veins - Guy de Jonquieres interviews South Korean Kim Chul-su who is seeking
to head the new world body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister, is not a natural
attention-seeker. Soft-spoken, courteous and discreetly attired, he looks
every inch the product of his 20-year career as an influential government
technocrat.
But in the next few weeks, the 53-year-old Mr Kim will be pounding the
campaign trail, canvassing support in ministries around the globe for his
bid to become head of the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year.
Australia, eager to emphasise its Asian links, has already come out in his
favour, and he is optimistic about winning backing in the rest of the
region. He is more guarded about the attitudes of the US and the EU, whose
support, he acknowledges, will be crucial.
He bases his claim to the WTO job, first, on Korea's spectacular economic
development, which is emblematic of Asia's rapidly growing importance in the
global economy and international trade.
He relates with pride how, in three decades, his country has risen from
poverty to the stage where it is ready to join the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based 'rich man's club'.
His second claim is his long specialisation in international trade affairs.
He participated in the Uruguay Round and has represented Korea in many
bilateral trade negotiations with the US, the European Union and Japan.
'I have the feel of the trade policies of industrialised and developing
countries,' he says, adding that Korea's trade is equally divided between
them. 'I think I can deal with trade and investment issues in an impartial
way.'
The US-educated Mr Kim, who speaks fluent English, is respected as an astute
negotiator in support of his government's interests. 'He is a tough cookie
who is always on top of his brief,' says a senior European official.
Other observers, however, were less impressed by his chairmanship of a key
Uruguay Round committee. 'Much of the nitty-gritty work was done by others,'
says an official in Geneva. 'You couldn't say he made the difference between
success and failure.'
Mr Kim believes his penchant for technical detail would be valuable in
getting the WTO running smoothly. 'The leader should be ready to act as
conciliator and mediator. In that capacity, he has to know the details of
trade problems. Willingness to work with details is very important to the
job,' he says.
His skills at settling international disputes were severely tested in the
late 1980s, when US threats of trade sanctions against Seoul inflamed
relations with Washington and outraged Korean public opinion. 'But in the
end, we were able to solve the problem in a relatively calm way,' he says.
That experience left him with a deep aversion to bilateral trade offensives.
'There is always political resistance when a big country tries to pressure
people in a smaller country to accepting its own standards and preferences,'
he says.
Mr Kim is reluctant to enunciate any sweeping vision for the future of the
WTO, saying it will have plenty to do implementing the Uruguay Round and
negotiating the entry of about 20 new members.
He is equally reticent about how he would handle politically contentious
questions, such as the links between trade, the environment and workers'
rights, arguing that more research is needed to define an 'intellectual
basis' for policy-making.
He stands 'somewhere in the middle' of the debate on workers' rights and
trade, which has put the US and many developing countries at bitter odds.
However, he would like the WTO to study how to help the very poorest
countries benefit more from international trade.
Though such cautious attitudes may not impress those who believe the WTO
needs charismatic, high-profile leadership, they are unlikely to arouse
hostility, either.
More controversial may be Korea's reputation for being slow to remove trade
barriers. In a recent survey of international companies, it emerged as the
most protectionist country in the Asia-Pacific region and the most hostile
towards inward investment.
Mr Kim concedes Korea may have 'a negative image', but considers it unfair.
'One would be hard-pressed to name a country which has moved so fast to
liberalise in the past 15 years,' he says, adding that the process has
recently accelerated.
He also insists that critics - particularly in Europe - are partly to blame
for ignoring opportunities in Asia. 'European governments and businessmen
need to be more aggressive,' he says.

FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Canada and US seek to avert wheat sales
clash

The US trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, and his Canadian counterpart,
Mr Roy MacLaren, will hold last-ditch talks next week in an attempt to
resolve the trade dispute over imports of Canadian wheat, Reuter reports
from Washington.
White House officials and congressmen and senators from wheat-growing states
met yesterday to discuss options. The wheat states' representatives said
later that the US was poised to act if the talks in Washington on July 27
failed. 'The US is prepared to pull the trigger,' Kansas congressman Mr Pat
Roberts said.
The International Trade Commission recommendations call for import quotas of
500,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes. During the meeting, these recommendations
were discussed and trigger levels of 500,000 tonnes, with 150,000 tonnes for
durum imports, emerged as a likely level, although senators noted that no
decision has been finalised.
The US-Canada wheat trade dispute has spiralled from a minor problem - over
the surge in imports of Canadian durum wheat - into what threatens to be the
beginning of a trade war between the world's two largest trading partners.
Imports of Canadian wheat have surged to record levels, angering US farmers
who fear the loss of domestic markets to imports of cheaper Canadian wheat.
Agriculture department figures show the US imported 4.766m tonnes of wheat
from Canada between October 1993 and April 1994. This is more than double
the 2.173m tonnes imported in the same period a year earlier.
The complaint against Canada was bought under Section 22 of US agricultural
law which expires in January 1995, or as soon as the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade is implemented.

International aid donors have pledged Dollars 820m to help support economic
reforms in Uganda during 1994/1995, the World Bank said, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The aid, in the form of grants and highly concessionary loans, was far
higher than the minimum Dollars 515m estimated as needed, and reflected
donors' appreciation of Uganda's economic reforms, a Bank official said.
Uganda, suffering from a heavy debt burden and lower prices for its main
export, coffee, has been moving towards a more market based economy.
The pledges include Dollars 470m in project aid, Dollars 297m in import
support and Dollars 53m to help multilateral debt servicing, civil service
reform and further army demobilisation. More than half the funds will come
from multilateral institutions. Last year international aid donors pledged
Dollars 815m in aid to Uganda.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Jordan eager for quick fix with Israel: A desire for joint
business projects ahead of the signing of a formal treaty will cause deep
concern in Damascus and Beirut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jordan yesterday sent strong signals to Syria and Lebanon that it was
prepared to carry out joint projects with Israel ahead of signing a formal
peace treaty.
This will ignite further concern in Damascus and Beirut that Jordan has
abandoned any pretence at Arab co-operation in peace talks with Israel and
intends to press ahead with its own political, regional and economic
interests.
At the close of two days of Israeli-Jordanian talks, Mr Fayez al-Tarawneh,
head of the Jordanian delegation, said Jordan was willing to implement joint
projects with Israel, like tourism or environmental protection before a
peace treaty. Mr Tarawneh said Jordan and Israel felt if 'there are certain
things which are beneficial to both sides' they they could be implemented.
The Jordanian statement also revealed Amman's strategy of moving swiftly
towards normalisation of relations with Israel by taking joint measures like
opening borders to tourists before and outside of a formal treaty.
Both sides said they had made solid progress on the three key issues which
will make up the peace treaty - water, border demarcation and security.
However, Israel refused a Jordanian demand it immediately recognise
Jordanian rights to water from the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers which Amman
claims Israel has diverted since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Mr Gideon Zur, chairman of the working group on water, said Jordan has asked
for Israel to recognise their rightful allocation of water before the two
sides negotiated actual quantities, but Israel refused.
Both sides agreed to continue bilateral negotiations next month meeting
alternately on the Israeli and Jordanian sides of the Dead Sea.
Israel, Jordan and the US are due to meet today at a resort hotel on the
Jordanian side of the Dead Sea to discuss economic projects to cement
Arab-Israeli peace. On the agenda are projects ranging from the visionary
and idealistic - like the creation of a common market or a Cairo-to-Istanbul
railway - to the more simple and practical like the integration of
electricity grids.
Both countries know their economies will benefit considerably from
co-operation and that fact is increasingly driving the broader peace
process.
Joint development of tourism is widely seen as the starting point. It is
difficult for tourists visiting Israel to cross into Jordan. Opening the
border would increase tourism through the development of multi-destination
packages and joint international promotion.
It could offer a visitor, for example, seven nights in the Holy Land
combined with five nights in Jordan, visiting ancient Petra, the Roman ruins
at Jerash, the Dead Sea and the Red Sea resort of Aqaba. Another possibility
is developing Aqaba, Eilat and theEgyptian resort of Taba as a tourism
triangle sharing airports.
Opening the borders would also boost trade between Jordan and Israel and
between Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas. Businessmen would be
able to drive from Tel Aviv to Amman in three hours.
Joint projects in water are also under consideration, including a possible
joint desalination plant in the Gulf of Aqaba. According to Israeli
officials, such a project could supply Israel, Jordan and Palestinians with
800m cubic metres of drinking water over the next 30 years.
In energy, Mr Moshe Shahal, Israeli energy minister, said Israel had
presented the Jordanians 10 projects, including shale oil technology
transfer and linking national electricity grids to allow the two countries
to share energy at peak hours. Israel is already preparing detailed plans to
link its grid with Egypt's and Jordan could be included in a three nation
link-up.
Another project under consideration is a canal between the Dead, Red and
Mediterranean Seas which would produce hydro-electric power. The two sides
will also discuss oil and gas pipelines and the Jordanian use of Israeli
ports as an exit to the Mediterranean.
The role of the US in financing some of these projects is critical and Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, will attend today's talks. The US
army corps of engineers, for example, is considering paving a road between
Israel and Jordan.
The US is also encouraging private sector investment. Israel recently
announced that a Middle East economic conference would take place in October
in Morocco under President Bill Clinton. Israel expects more than 2,000
international companies to attend.

North Korea claimed 2m people, almost a tenth of the country's population,
attended funeral services yesterday in Pyongyang for President Kim Il-sung.
The ceremony reflected the huge cult of personality Mr Kim created during
his 46 years of autocratic rule as Great Leader.
A hearse carrying his black coffin, partially covered by the red flag of the
ruling Korean Workers' party, paraded through the normally empty boulevards
of the capital during a 40km, five-hour journey as mourners paid their last
respects.
A funeral rite was held in front of the palace, attended by a sombre Mr Kim
Jong-il, the eldest son and designated successor of the president, and other
members of the political elite.
Mr Kim junior may officially succeed his father during another memorial
ceremony scheduled for today. But it is unclear whether he will assume both
positions of party general secretary and president left vacant by his
father's death, in addition to head of the armed forces.

North Korea claimed that 2m people, almost a tenth of the country's
population, attended funeral services yesterday in Pyongyang for President
Kim Il-sung.
The ceremony reflected the huge cult of personality that Mr Kim had created
during his 46 years of autocratic rule as Great Leader.
A hearse carrying Mr Kim's black coffin, partially covered by the red flag
of the ruling Korean Workers' party, paraded through the normally empty
boulevards of the capital during a 40km, five-hour journey in the afternoon
as mourners paid their last respects.
The hearse was preceded by a phalanx of motorcycle policemen and a huge
portrait of a broadly smiling Mr Kim and followed by a long double row of
black limousines carrying senior officials.
The body of the president was removed in the morning from the Kumsusan
presidential palace, where he had been lying in state in a glass coffin
since last Monday.
A funeral rite was held in front of the palace, attended by a sombre Mr Kim
Jong-il, the eldest son and designated successor of the president, and other
members of the political elite.
Another service was then conducted in Kim Il-sung Square in central
Pyongyang, but the junior Mr Kim did not appear at this ceremony and other
senior party officials present did not make speeches. Mr Kim junior may
officially succeed his father during another memorial ceremony scheduled for
today.
But it is unclear whether Mr Kim will assume both positions of party general
secretary and president left vacant by his father's death, in addition to
his role as head of the armed forces.
The state-controlled Radio Pyongyang yesterday referred to the junior Mr Kim
as: 'The great leader of our party and our people who is national defence
committee chairman and concurrently the supreme commander of the armed
forces.'
Although the statement suggests that Mr Kim will become head of the party,
it left doubts whether he will acquire the nominal post of president as
well.
The appointment of another official as president could indicate that Mr Kim
still faces opposition among conservative leaders to his rule.

subcontinent last month.
Relief operations in most states have been hampered by continuing rainfall.
In Bombay, India's commercial capital, at least 100 people have been killed
and more than 80,000 have lost their homes. Several old buildings have
collapsed.
Railway services were disrupted for the eighth consecutive day yesterday.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Asean puts out welcome mat for Burmese junta: Human rights
brushed aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even for governments that profess to despise 'western' ideas about human
rights, the timing is a little embarrassing. Today Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
Burmese pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace prize winner, marks the
beginning of her sixth year under house arrest in Rangoon. Burma's military
junta is being condemned throughout the world for continuing to detain her
without trial.
Yet this week representatives of this same military junta will be welcomed
by south-east Asian foreign ministers to the opening of their annual meeting
in Bangkok.
The six members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) -
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - are
prepared to endure criticism from the west, from Burmese democrats and from
their own human rights activists about their links to the junta partly
because they have a stake in the Burmese economy.
Led by Singapore, which sells weapons to the Burmese army, a growing number
of Asian companies are investing and trading in Burma as the generals in
charge slowly liberalise the economy; tourist hotels and logging are two of
the most popular sectors.
Asian governments are also declaring with increasing confidence that
'western' concepts of individual human rights are inappropriate for Asia,
where individuals are supposedly ready to sacrifice their personal desires
for economic development and the good of society as a whole.
The governments of Thailand and the Philippines - hitherto the two most
democratic and liberal members of Asean - are the latest adherents to this
Asian world view.
In an attempt to stop a human rights conference arranged by Thai
non-governmental organisations to coincide with the Asean meeting, the Thai
authorities last week ordered Chulalongkorn University not to host the
conference and banned foreign delegates from attending.
The motive was to save the Indonesian government from embarrassment. East
Timor, invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed after thousands of people
had been killed is one of the topics on the agenda.
In May, the Philippine government announced restrictions on an East Timor
conference after Indonesia threatened to suspend talks on promoting regional
trade and investment that would have helped the southern Philippines.
Foreigners - including Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president
 -were forbidden to attend.
But Asean's efforts to stifle public debate on human rights abuses in the
region appear to have backfired. In Manila and Bangkok, the clumsy attempts
to prevent discussion led to fierce criticism of the authorities and much
more extensive media coverage of the issues than would otherwise have been
the case. The Manila conference was held anyway and Thai human rights groups
vow to go ahead with theirs.
The human rights debate is particularly awkward for the Thai government of
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, because he and his Democrat party were
voted into office in 1992 with the support of pro-democracy demonstrators
who had toppled a military government earlier in the year  - about 50 people
were shot dead by troops in Bangkok.
Thailand has justified its decision to invite Burma to this week's Asean
meeting by pointing to Asean's policy of 'constructive engagement' with
Rangoon. Mr Prasong Soonsiri, Thai foreign minister, said Asean wanted to
integrate Burma into the world community 'so it takes measures to improve
its political, economic and social situation, which will be beneficial to
the Burmese under a democratic system.'
Mr Prasong's support for democracy in Burma broke new ground and suggests
the purported ideological rift between east and west on human rights is not
as clear cut as some Asian leaders claim.
'Constructive engagement' was a phrase used in the past by the conservative
governments of the US and UK to describe their relationship with the
apartheid regime in South Africa. Just as many opponents of apartheid in the
west and in Asia criticised the policy then, so many opponents of the
Burmese junta in Asia and the west criticise it today.

FT  20 JUL 94 / US envoy urges UN force to end Rwanda tragedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A special US envoy to Rwanda said yesterday he would urge the dispatch of a
large United Nations peacekeeping force to convince millions of Hutus who
have fled the country that it would be safe to return under Rwanda's new
Tutsi-dominated government.
Mr Brian Atwood, who will brief President Bill Clinton tomorrow on the
humanitarian catastrophe caused by the flight of over 1m Hutus into Zaire,
expressed confidence in Rwanda's new leaders, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic
Front, which declared victory this week after a four-year guerrilla war
against a Hutu government and army.
'We have been working hard behind the scenes to encourage the formation of a
moderate, mixed Hutu-Tutsi government,' Mr Atwood said in Nairobi. 'We are
prepared to work with them to consolidate peace and begin the reconstruction
of the country.'
The Tutsi-led RPF yesterday installed a new government in the capital Kigali
which includes a Hutu president, Mr Pasteur Bizimungu, and a Hutu prime
minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu. Its immediate problem is how to win
legitimacy in the eyes of Rwanda's Hutu majority, many members of whom
participated in the slaughter of the Tutsi population following the death of
President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash in April.
Several western governments, including Belgium and the US, have now pledged
to work with Rwanda's new government.
France, which sent an intervention force to Rwanda earlier this month
yesterday acknowledged Rwandan rebels had effectively won the war. Mr Alain
Juppe, foreign minister, said Paris would negotiate with the victors on an
end to its intervention.
Even if the UN troops are deployed rapidly, Mr Atwood believes it will take
several months before the right psychological environment can be created to
persuade the Hutu population to return.
In RPF-controlled areas, for example, Mr Atwood said rebels were holding
Hutus in encampments against their will.
But Mr Atwood's immediate concern, like that of all international relief
agencies, is how to deal with a refugee crisis of unprecedented proportions
on Rwanda's western border with Zaire. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees
says there are 1m refugees in the Zairean border town of Goma, and about
100,000 more in Bukavu to the south. Yesterday there were reports that
400,000 Rwandans had flooded into another Zairean town, Uvira.
'It's really an exodus of a nation. The whole country is coming out of its
borders. We can't cope,' Mr Panos Moumtzis, an UNHCR spokesman, said.
Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical charity, warned that thousands of
people faced almost certain death due to the logistical impossibilities of
meeting the needs of the biggest flow of refugees in contemporary history.
Mr Atwood also fears Rwanda's defeated Hutu troops, who have also fled into
Zaire, might attempt to regroup and invade Rwanda, or wage a war of
attrition against the new Tutsi-led regime.

FT  20 JUL 94 / A changing Taiwan wants welfare without the tears:
Traditional care systems need replacing but policymakers want to avoid the
west's mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like its east Asian neighbours, Taiwan is grappling with how to balance the
growing need for social services such as healthcare and old-age support
against fears of turning its vibrant economy into a hypertaxed welfare
state.
Taiwan's parliament yesterday approved a universal health insurance scheme
which is due to come into effect from January. And the establishment of a
national pension scheme is to top the legislative agenda during the autumn
session.
The health scheme will be state-run and will be 90 per cent financed by
employer and employee contributions, with the state picking up the rest.
Total healthcare expenditure is projected to be NTDollars 270bn (Pounds
6.5bn) in the first year.
Taiwan is going the way of most industrialised countries. Rising incomes,
shifting demographics and changing social structures are straining the
capacity of traditional family-based care. And with per capita gross
national product having risen from Dollars 145 in 1951 to more than Dollars
11,000 this year, there is more money around to pay for good care than there
are opportunities to get it.
In 1993 existing government-run health, labour and retirement insurance
schemes covered just more than half Taiwan's population of nearly 21m.
In recent months, Taiwan's medical establishment has been rocked by a spate
of scandals revealing the widespread practice among doctors, whose salaries
are low by most comparable countries' standards, of accepting bribes for
services.
Entrepreneurial solutions have emerged to fill the void left by a government
struggling to keep up with the welfare demands of an industrialised society.
But Taiwan, which prides itself on having probably the most equitable
distribution of wealth among Asian countries, is anxious not to allow
quality health services to become the preserve of the rich.
Under the state-run health insurance scheme, employers will pay 60 per cent
of their employees' premiums and the employees 30 per cent. The state will
pick up the remaining 10 per cent as well as the administrative costs.
But the government's burden will be significantly higher because it must
subsidise a large part of the premiums, including those for government
employees, veterans, the self-employed and low-income groups.
Mr Chan Huo-sheng of National Taiwan University's graduate institute of
sociology is pessimistic about the health plan, which he describes as a
hybrid version of the US, Canadian and British systems.
'Based on my experience in Britain, I am very much in favour of universal
health insurance. The difference is in Britain, general practitioners are
government employees. But here doctors are privately employed and the
hospitals are privately run.
'So doctors, who are a powerful pressure group, will be bargaining with the
government over fees and services,' Mr Chan argues. 'And here we don't have
a strong sense of ethics in the medical profession. There are problems with
wastage of resources, problems with hong bao' - red envelopes - a reference
to the institutionalised bribery of doctors for preferential services.
In the absence of a mechanism to keep a lid on the costs of providing
healthcare, expenditures will escalate endlessly, the government will be
forced to shoulder a heavier burden and taxpayers will have to pay more to
keep the system afloat in what will became a vicious circle, he predicts.
The ruling Nationalist party wanted to push the programme through quickly
for political reasons without subjecting it to sufficient debate and study,
says legislator Parris Chang of the leading opposition party, the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
Demographic forces are also driving the need for a modern national old-age
pension scheme. The country's population growth rate fell below 1 per cent
in 1993 for the first time and is projected to reach zero in 2035.
At the same time the population is greying rapidly. The median age is
forecast to rise to 42.6 in 2036 from 28.6 in 1993, and the percentage of
the population aged 65 and over to 21.57 from 6.93.
The tradition of extended multi-generational families living under one roof
is fast giving way to the nuclear family, leaving greater numbers of the
elderly to fend for themselves on a day-to-day basis. Mr Chen Chao-nan, a
researcher at the Academia Sinica, a government think-tank, estimates that
one-third of Taiwanese 65 and older now live alone, twice as many as in the
mid-1970s.
In addition, women - historically the primary carers - have entered the
labour force in unprecedented numbers. In 1992 women made up 37.7 per cent
of the workforce, compared with 27 per cent in 1965.
'Basically we're seeing a sharp reduction in informal social support
systems,' said Mr Chen. 'In addition to national health insurance, we need
home care systems and nursing homes for those elderly whose family are no
longer able to physically care for them.'
The DPP has proposed a pension scheme loosely modelled on the American
social security system, under which workers would pay into the scheme and
begin collecting once they reached 65. Under existing comprehensive schemes,
covered workers receive a lump sum payout upon retirement.
The ruling party has yet to produce its own pension plan proposal, but it is
likely to be similar to the DPP's.
'Both parties favour self-financing systems, as they fear too much
government intervention will lead to waste and inefficiency,' says Mr Ho
Dwanfan, director of the DPP's social issues department. 'The widely held
view is that welfare will make people lazy. Everyone is very much afraid of
becoming like Britain - the economy goes downhill and everybody blames the
welfare system.'
Articles on the welfare impact of a greying society in Hong Kong and
Singapore appeared in the Financial Times last Thursday and Friday

Argentina plans to cut civil service costs by 10 per cent, and introduce
tighter tax controls and a range of export incentives, according to an
outline of the 1995 budget bill, released yesterday by the economy ministry.
However, based on average consumer and wholesale price inflation of 3.5 per
cent and GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in 1995, the budget promises to step up
spending on state-funded health and education.
The budget statement did not estimate the effect of these measures on total
public spending. However, in earlier estimates, the government had forecast
1995 total public sector spending at 81.9bn pesos (Pounds 52.5bn) - roughly
26.3 per cent of GDP - compared with 78.8bn pesos budgeted for this year, or
26.5 per cent of GDP.
The peso is at par with the US dollar.
Previous official figures have projected a federal revenue surplus of 4.5bn
pesos for the current year, and of 3.18bn-3.23bn pesos for 1995.
The government is under pressure to rein in public spending if it wishes to
maintain its economic reforms and sustain the dollar-peso parity established
in April 1991.
Mr Daniel Artana, chief economist at FIEL, an economic think-tank funded by
Argentina's leading companies, said the general feeling that the peso is
overvalued would be eased by the budget.
He also suggested that the tax revenue estimates were realistic. Tax
collection had increased by about 17 per cent in the first half of 1994,
compared with the equivalent period of 1993.
This rise took place despite cuts in payroll taxes, with most of it coming
from increased income tax collection and a crackdown on tax dodging. Tax
revenue has been forecast to rise to 30.8bn pesos next year, from an
estimated 26.5bn pesos in 1994.
The draft budget made no provisions for general pay rises, keeping salaries
tied to productivity levels in all departments. The cuts in civil service
costs are planned to fall largely on travel budgets and diplomatic postings.
The economy ministry estimated exports next year would rise by 13 per cent
to Dollars 17.4bn and put the trade deficit at Dollars 4.3bn. This year's
trade shortfall has been estimated to reach a new record of Dollars
4.5bn-Dollars 6bn, topping last year's Dollars 3.7bn deficit.
Reuter reports: Intelligence experts from Israel, Spain and other countries
arrived in Argentina yesterday to help hunt for the bombers of a Jewish
community centre in Buenos Aires. The blast, on Monday, killed 27 people.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Towards a leaner, greener bank: World Bank president plots
the future of the institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank will become leaner, more agile and more responsive to a
rapidly changing world, Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, pledged
yesterday.
He said he was attempting to streamline the organisation, reduce costs and
become more open and accountable. 'We still have a way to go - but the bank
is changing,' he said.
He said the nature of the bank's contribution to development was changing.
In its first half-century, now ending, the two arms of the bank - the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International
Development Association - had served principally as a supplier of
development capital for third world countries.
But, in view of the greatly increased availability of private investment
capital, it was now putting more emphasis now on its role as an adviser to
client governments. It would increasingly act as a catalyst and facilitator
of private sector investment in the third world and former communist
countries. Mr Preston was speaking at a Washington news conference to launch
a report - Learning from the Past, Embracing the Future* - which sets
long-term goals for the bank on the 50th anniversary of its creation at
Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.
He set out six principles which would guide the bank's future evolution. It
would try to be more selective in the tasks it undertook; to rely more on
partnership with other institutions; to be more responsive to clients'
needs; to put more emphasis on the results of projects; to save resources by
improving its cost-effectiveness; and strive to maintain its high standing
as a borrower on global capital markets.
These principles would guide the bank's response to five key development
challenges in coming decades. These would be the promotion of economic
reforms likely to help the poor; increased investment in people, especially
through education, healthcare and family planning; protection of the
environment; stimulation of private sector development; and public sector
reform to create an environment where private enterprise could flourish.
The report is a response to growing criticism that the bank is not adapting
rapidly enough to a changed global financial landscape.
In the past five years, flows of private capital to developing countries
have quadrupled to Dollars 120bn (Pounds 77bn), dwarfing the bank's own
total commitments of about Dollars 20bn.
Independent experts, including the Bretton Woods Commisssion, a group headed
by Mr Paul Volcker, a former US Federal Reserve chairman, have pressed for
significant staff cuts at the bank, on the grounds that larger private
capital flows to 'emerging markets' have rendered some of its former tasks
obsolete.
Left-of-centre pressure groups - including the '50 years is enough' campaign
 -have also taken aim at the bank, arguing that many of its projects have
harmed the environment while doing little to help the poorest groups in
developing countries.
Although the bank's total lending has fallen sharply in real terms during
recent years, it has continued to expand rapidly. It now has about 11,000
people on its payroll, up from 8,000 in 1989 and 7,000 in 1984. It has more
than 6,000 'higher-level' professional staff (including consultants), an
increase of a third in five years and of more than 50 per cent in a decade.
Its administrative budget (mostly staff costs) has increased by 44 per cent
to Dollars 1.4bn in the past three years.
In the institution's defence, Mr Preston says the demands on the bank have
increased enormously in recent years.
For example, it is playing a central role in helping to guide the transition
to capitalism in former communist countries. He has also needed to upgrade
the bank's skill-base in areas such as the environment, private sector
development and human resources.
Mr Preston said that the goal of a leaner bank 'means fewer people', but he
refused to say how many staff he expected to shed in coming years.
'Ultimately, it is the shareholders (member governments) who determine what
activities the bank engages in.'
He said the bank intended to charge fees for advisory services to client
governments, conceding that, if it offered services free of charge, it would
be providing unfair competition for private sector consultancy groups, which
are also seeking work as advisers to third world governments.
The bank is charging fees for advice in two countries at present, but the
costs of advisory services are normally absorbed in the interest charges on
associated loans. Mr Preston said that charging fees had not been feasible
until recently because the bank had no cost-accounting system and so had not
known what to charge.
Looking back, 'the mistake the bank has paid the highest price for was not
recognising the importance of the environment,' he said.
The bank had wrongly assumed that there was a confict between development
and the environment, but was now committed to the concept of 'sustainable
development' - meaning policies which promote economic growth and an
improved environment.
Mr Preston's 'vision statement' appears unlikely to quell criticism of the
bank.
Yesterday, Oxfam, the British-based charity, said it was a 'profoundly
disappointing document which avoides addressing the real challenges.' Oxfam
claimed that the bank's structural adjustment policies 'continue to impose
unacceptable and unnecessary social costs on the poor, especially women.'
This reflected 'the absence of effective public scrutiny of the bank's
operations,' it added.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Clinton hints at flexibility on healthcare bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday emphasised his flexibility over healthcare
legislation at a conference of state governors in an effort to keep the
reform on track.
Speaking in Boston, Massachusetts, Mr Clinton said he would accept any plan
that guaranteed 'universal coverage' for all US citizens. He seemed to
indicate still further flexibility when he later said he would not veto a
reform bill that 'moved toward universal coverage'.
'I have no pride of authorship and no pride of details, I just want to find
a solution that works,' Mr Clinton said in his speech.
However, in an earlier speech at the conference, Mr Robert Dole, the Senate
Republican leader and chief opponent of Mr Clinton's healthcare initiative,
accused the president of blocking a compromise. He said Mr Clinton was
'ratcheting up the rhetoric' and fomenting 'class warfare' with statements
about the increasing healthcare burden on the middle class that would ensue
if universal coverage was not achieved.
Both the president and Mr Dole urged one another to deflate the rhetoric
surrounding the healthcare reform debate which is beginning to draw to a
conclusion in Congress and said they were willing to compromise.
Mr Dole said: 'I think the seeds of a bipartisan bill still exist if the
administration is willing to come our way.'
Mr Dole promoted the insurance reform proposal he has floated as an
alternative to Mr Clinton's demand for an overhaul of the healthcare system
and coverage for every American. But Mr Clinton said he was highly sceptical
of the plan, which would allow workers to keep the same insurance policy
even if they switched jobs but would not mandate that employers pay for it.
Mr Clinton said there was evidence that insurance reform without universal
coverage was not a workable solution because it resulted in higher cost for
most workers.

FT  20 JUL 94 / US trade gap widens as imports grow
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit in goods and services widened sharply in May to Dollars
9.17bn (Pounds 5.88bn), from a revised Dollars 8.53bn in April, as import
growth continued to outstrip export performance, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The deficit was higher than market forecasts of a little more than Dollars
8bn. However, there was little reaction to the trade figures yesterday as US
markets waited for testimony due today from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, before the Senate banking committee.
The politically sensitive US trade deficit with Japan fell almost 20 per
cent in May to Dollars 4.39bn, on an unadjusted basis. Even so, the US
deficit with Japan for the first five months of this year reached almost
Dollars 25bn, up about 10 per cent on the deficit in the equivalent period
last year.
The merchandise trade deficit deteriorated to Dollars 14.1bn in May, the
highest figure in more than six years, against Dollars 13.3bn in April.
Exports of goods were little changed for the month, at Dollars 40.4bn, while
goods imports rose to Dollars 54.5bn from Dollars 53.7bn the month before.
Higher costs pushed up the US oil import bill by 9.2 per cent to an
unadjusted Dollars 4.03bn, while imports of clothing and telecommunications
equipment also rose strongly. The services surplus edged up in May to
Dollars 4.9bn.
The US trade surplus with Mexico soared to Dollars 353m in May, from only
Dollars 7m in April, as Mexico surpassed Japan for the month to be the
second-largest trade partner for the US after Canada.
The overall US trade deficit for the first five months of this year is
running at Dollars 41.96bn, against Dollars 25.84bn for the equivalent
period last year. About half the overall deterioration in the US trade
position this year has been with Europe, Merrill Lynch, the New York
securities house, pointed out yesterday. US exports to Europe should begin
to rise as European growth picks up.
In addition, US services exports for June should receive a fillip from
spending related to the World Cup football tournament, Merrill said. The
World Cup was held in the US from mid-June until last Sunday, and generated
much revenue through sales of foreign television rights and through tourism.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Brussels to probe pay-TV venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has ordered an investigation into a planned joint
venture by two German media groups and the state telephone monopoly. It is
suspicious that the concentration could create a dominant position in the
German market for pay-television services.
Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media group, Kirch, one of Germany's
biggest private television companies, and Deutsche Telekom notified Brussels
of their plans last month. They intend setting up a company to provide
infrastructure, marketing and booking services for commercial pay-TV,
including such services as video-on-demand, home banking and interactive
television. The company would be known as MSG Media Service.
The Commission is concerned that, with the introduction of digital
broadcasting in Germany over the next few years, the pay-TV market will
expand rapidly. This is particularly so in Germany where a large number of
households already receive cable or satellite television.
'The proposed concentration raises the question whether MSG could obtain, on
a permanent basis, a dominant position on the German market for technical
and administrative services for Pay-TV,' the Commission said yesterday.
Deutsche Telekom is the country's leading cable network operator. It also
recently acquired a substantial stake in the European satellite operator
Ses-Astra.
Bertelsmann and Kirch have a stake in Premiere, Germany's only pay-TV
channel, and Kirch is a dominant programme supplier to German television.
Media analysts value its library at more than Dollars 2bn.
'It is therefore particularly important to examine the effects which may
result from the combination of companies which probably would have a leading
position in pay-TV and cable networks in the future,' the Commission said.
Brussels is particularly uneasy that, by dominating the pay-TV
infrastructure at an early stage, the joint venture would control standards
for any newcomers. It fears MSG would be able to set the standards for
household decoders.
Mr John Scaife, a media financier at London-based Charon Capital, said: 'The
concern is that if the joint venture effectively controls the gateway to pay
television services, and people at home do not want to have to pay for more
than one decoder, then this group could be in a very dominant position.
Anyone coming in later, would have to use their standards.'
The Commission decided the need for investigation went beyond Germany's
borders arguing that the proposed concentration could affect the access of
pay-TV suppliers from other EU member states to the German market. It has
four months to decide on the merger.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Germany split over legacy of war resistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's politicians are engaged in a delicate but bitter struggle over the
right to claim the ideological legacy of a wartime plot 50 years ago to
assassinate Hitler.
Conservatives point to the aristocratic army officers who led the attempt,
half a century ago today, to blow up the Fuhrer in his headquarters.
Others say it is impossible to ignore the role played by socialists and
communists in the resistance to the Nazi regime.
Today Chancellor Helmut Kohl delivers a speech in Berlin to commemorate the
July 20 plot.
The ceremony will take place in the Bendler Block, the complex of buildings
where the conspiracy was born and where, nine years before, Hitler told
German generals of his plans to gain Lebensraum through conquests in eastern
Europe.
Mr Kohl has dissuaded President Roman Herzog from speaking at the ceremony,
organised by the federal government and the Berlin authorities, and has
shunned suggestions that Mr Rudolf Scharping, opposition Social Democrat
leader, be included.
His words may reveal the extent to which Germany's conservative camp wants
selectively to use history and memory in the federal election campaign this
year.
The controversy was initiated in the past two months by conservatives led by
Franz Ludwig von Stauffenberg, son of Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, one of
the main plotters in the July 20 assassination attempt.
The row centres on an exhibition dedicated to the families behind the July
20 plot, and shown in the Bendler Block. Franz Ludwig has insisted that this
should have nothing to do with a permanent exhibition, a floor above,
marking the resistance to Hitler which includes the role of communists,
socialists, trade unionists and the emigres.
What is more significant, Franz Ludwig, backed by members of Chancellor
Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union, its sister party,
wants communists excluded from the permanent exhibition on the grounds that
they installed a totalitarian regime in eastern Germany after the war.
The permanent exhibition was commissioned during the 1980s to documentthe
scope and complexity of the German resistance to help the Germans to come to
terms with the past.
This marked a change from the treatment of the issue in the immediate
post-war years. In the 1950s, and even in the 1960s, the July 20 plotters
were regarded in Germany as traitors, and no credit was given to the
communists, the emigres and the German prisoners of war in Soviet camps who
co-operated in the resistance.
'That attempt in the 1980s was a step towards establishing some elements of
a common historical memory shared by west and east Germans,' said Mr Jurgen
Kocka, professor of modern history at Berlin's Free University. 'But now the
situation has changed. Re-unification makes it possible to stress the
political and ideological divisions in the country. What is happening is
that the debate over July 20 is about the search for a national identity.
Above all, it is a fight over who should claim the traditions of July 20.'
In an open letter to the German press last week, about 50 people
representing a cross-section of the resistance, including Freya von Moltke,
the widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a July 20 conspirator, and Stefan Heym, the
east German writer and member of the resistance in exile, deplored attempts
to 'separate certain groups of the German resistance from the permanent
exhibition'.
Mr Manfred Messerschmidt, the military historian, argued in a weekly
magazine last week that the conservatives should 'not limit the resistance'
to the conservatives and army, even though that was their wish in order to
rally support against the left after the electoral success of the SPD and
the PDS, the successor to the former east German communists, in elections in
Saxony-Anhalt last month.
'The Chancellery has displayed a very close interest in the relationship
between politics and history, which I deplore because of the way it uses the
past,' said Professor Kocka.
'Everybody wants to claim July 20. If there is any good coming out of this
debate it is that everybody recognises finally that a resistance existed.
But it does not mean that all those in the resistance wanted the restoration
of democracy.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Berlusconi weakened by an own-goal: The Italian premier will
find it harder to control cabinet after the fiasco over the judiciary decree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The remarkable winning run of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, has come to an end.
Both his personal authority and his standing as a politician have been
seriously dented by his mishandling of the controversial decree to limit the
judiciary's power of arrest. The media magnate-turned-politician boxed
himself into a corner from which there was only one viable exit - a
humiliating compromise.
The precise form of that compromise was still being hammered out yesterday
between Mr Berlusconi and the two main partners of his Forza Italia party in
the coalition, the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance. But, in any event, the government must rework the legislation to
avoid the disastrous impression created by the original decree that Mr
Berlusconi and his colleagues were no longer interested in seeing corruption
investigated and punished.
If Mr Berlusconi had not chosen to back down in this way, his two-month-old
right-wing government would almost certainly have collapsed. For this
own-goal he only has himself and his political inexperience to blame.
The decree, which came into effect last Thursday, sought to prevent improper
use of arrest by magistrates. All too often during the anti-corruption
investigations of the past two and a half years, preventive detention has
been used not merely to stop people from fleeing the country or tampering
with evidence. It has been a means of psychological pressure to obtain
confessions, without which the corruption scandals would never have been
brought to light.
Mr Berlusconi's first miscalculation was to underestimate the reaction of
the magistrates. The Milan magistrates' anti-corruption team led by Mr
Antonio Di Pietro - who is so popular that Mr Berlusconi tried to persuade
him to join the cabinet - resigned in protest.
The magistrates claimed the new decree undermined their work and by the
weekend hundreds of those held in detention on corruption charges had been
allowed home on house arrest. These included Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the
former health minister, while the decree removed the threat of imprisonment
from Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader who has been ignoring an
arrest warrant from his seaside villa at Hammamet, Tunisia.
The premier's second error was to assume that his partners, having signed
the decree, would remain loyal. Aso soon as the League and the MSI saw the
hostile public reaction to the jails being emptied of the allegedly corrupt
they began to wash their hands. Mr Roberto Maroni, the League's astute
interior minister, immediately claimed he had been misled into signing the
decree and called for it to be changed. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader,
then weighed in. Aware that his party had drawn much of its original support
in the north precisely because of its anti-corruption stance, he threatened
to pull his party out of the government.
The third error was to rely too much on opinion polls. Mr Berlusconi's
privately commissioned polls told him the public was no longer so interested
in the corruption scandals. But it seems the questions did not include the
crucial one: would the public tolerate the exodus from jail of those caught
up in the corruption scandals? This aspect has particularly angered the
public.
Moreover the public, forever suspicious of something done in a hurry, smelt
a rat in the use of a decree rather than a law which must first pass through
parliament. A decree has immediate effect, subsequently approved by
parliament.
It seemed too much as if Mr Berlusconi was acting to protect his own
interests. The magistrates are investigating several different aspects of
operations within Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire that includes the
alleged payment of illicit transfer fees for footballers at AC Milan and
alleged corruption in the granting of television licences.
These errors have combined to weaken the substantial power within the
cabinet that Mr Berlusconi has accumulated since taking office in May. Mr
Berlusconi's trump card has been his acknowledged popularity. He has used
this to whip his dissident coalition members in the League into line. In so
many words he has frequently threatened: 'Obey me or I'll call early
elections.'
The threat held good because the League and the MSI knew they risked seeing
themselves being overwhelmed by Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia - perhaps
even to the point of no longer needing both as allies. But on this occasion
the threat has been without teeth.
For their part, Mr Bossi and Mr Maroni have found in the ill-conceived
decree an instrument with which to cut Mr Berlusconi down to size. Mr
Maroni's claim to have been misled into signing the decree is unconvincing.
But by opposing the decree, they have been seen as championing a much needed
revision of the text. In particular, corruption cases affecting the public
administration were considered in the decree as crimes insufficiently
serious to merit preventive detention. This will be changed.
The premier will no longer find it easy to run his cabinet in a presidential
style. More importantly, with his prestige damaged Mr Berlusconi will be
less sure of his public standing; and he will be thus less willing to wave
the threat of early elections.
Mr Berlusconi probably did himself further harm in the public eye by the way
he retreated over the weekend to his villa at Arcore outside Milan like a
wounded animal. From there on Monday he proceeded to call on Mr Emilio Fede,
his most faithful admirer and anchorman on his Fininvest's TG4 news.
Viewers were treated to a series of fawning questions which allowed Mr
Berlusconi to let go his anger on his allies. A total of 32 minutes were
calculated to have been given by Mr Berlusconi on Monday to his television
channels - none to the RAI, the state broadcasting corporation. Yesterday Mr
Fede again overdid himself in trying to portray his master as having saved
the day by being magnanimous enough to give ground when others refused to
compromise.
Mr Berlusconi has indeed saved the government from collapse. But in making
concessions he will find it harder to control an already disparate cabinet.
And if the rebels have found one cause they may well now look for another.
This could be Mr Berlusconi's conflict of interest with his media empire.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Italian recovery gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian economy has begun to move from a timid recovery to sustained
growth. Industrial production figures and the latest official survey of
industrialists' opinion shows the export-led recovery has begun to include a
modest element of renewed domestic demand. According to Istat, the state
statistics institute, industrial production in May was up 7.5 per cent on
the same period the previous year. During the first five months as a whole
industrial production was 2 per cent higher than in 1993. Production of
office equipment was up 14 per cent. Robert Graham, Rome.
In later editions of the FT yesterday, a graph on page 2 mistakenly referred
to Italian bond yields and not, as it should have done, to bond prices.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Santer pledges to run strong Commission: New Brussels chief
assures MEPs on single currency and social chapter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer last night defended his selection as the next president of
the European Commission and pledged to run a strong Brussels bureaucracy in
support of a single European currency and the social chapter.
In response to hostile questioning from newly elected members of the
European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Santer, prime minister of Luxembourg,
tried to dispel concerns about his emergence as compromise candidate to
succeed Mr Jacques Delors.
Mr Santer, who faces a vote of approval in the European Parliament tomorrow
, used his meeting with MEPs to distance himself from the UK government,
which last month blocked Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier whose
candidacy for president was backed by France and Germany. 'There is no
difference between me and Mr Dehaene,' he said in a remark that led to a
flurry later among Euro-sceptic MPs at Westminster.
During his appearance before the European People's Party and the Socialist
group, Mr Santer adopted a semi-apologetic tone about his selection and made
clear he had accepted the nomination only after appeals from Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany.
'I never sought this job. I have a perfectly good job in Luxembourg,' he
told Socialist MEPs, several of whom voiced outrage that Mr John Major, UK
prime minister, had torpedoed Mr Dehaene through the exercise of a lone veto
at the Corfu summit last month.
But Mr Santer expressed sentiments more in line with the UK Conservative
party by pointing to a gulf between the political class in Europe and people
in the street - a gap that was exposed in the debate over the Maastricht
treaty and that was opened last month in the Euro-parliamentary elections
from which nationalist splinter parties gained.
'I don't want to introduce a Napoleonic Europe or a centralised Europe,' he
said. 'I want a Europe where the regions have a role to play.' But he added
he would never have accepted the nomination if it meant being party to a
weakening of the European Commission. 'I am for a dynamic, efficient and
solid Commission,' he said.
MEPs, generally more federalist-leaning than their governments, drew up a
test of issues for Mr Santer. They grilled him on the desirability of the
single currency, Britain's opt-out of the social chapter in the Maastricht
treaty, and subsidiarity - the code-word for devolving decision-making to
the lowest appropriate level in the EU.
In response, Mr Santer said he knew of no genuine single market that existed
without a single currency. He voiced reservations about the UK not
participating in the social chapter, and he said there was no question of
using subsidiarity to roll back EU social and environmental laws.
German Socialist Klaus Haensch was elected president of the European
parliament yesterday.

Co-ordination between Nato and the Western European Union over how to
organise joint military task forces has failed to get off the ground, a
senior Nato officer disclosed yesterday. A new relationship between Nato and
the WEU was proclaimed after January's Nato summit, at which the US appeared
to give its blessing to the idea of western Europe taking more
responsibility for its own defence. But a speech yesterday by Air Vice
Marshal John Cheshire, until recently an assistant chief of staff at Nato's
military headquarters, indicated virtually no progress on linking the two
institutions had been made. He told the Royal United Services Institute the
WEU's permanent staff had declined to enter discussions about how to
organise task forces, on the grounds they had no mandate to do so from
member governments.

Germany is to experiment with performance-related pay and bonuses for civil
servants to make its bureaucracy more efficient. Bonn, which has often
complained that cumbersome bureaucracy hampers economic growth, approved a
small shake-up in the cash-strapped public sector, provided there is no
increase in overall costs. 'Existing pay structures in the public service
apparently do not always make it sufficiently clear that performance is the
key criterion for paying public service staff,' said an interior ministry
report approved by cabinet. 'For work which is considerably above average,
public servants could receive a performance bonus as a once-off payment or
for a limited period.' Meanwhile, Volkswagen, the German carmaker, said it
had agreed a pay deal giving workers a 1 per cent rise plus extra payments
totalling DM900 (Pounds 370).

The Polish government is to retain control of the country's pipeline and

announced yesterday. CPN, the state-owned service station operator, which
owns 3,300 outlets, will be split into three and passed over to refining
companies whose shares would then be offered to domestic and foreign
investors, the government said. The state would retain golden shares in the
companies with veto powers over the closure of refineries. The Poles will
also seek to delay the lifting of quotas on petroleum imports from the
European Union, promised for the spring of 1997. At present 20 per cent of
Poland's petrol is imported.

The Swedish government will have to intensify its savings drive if it is to
meet its debt stabilisation targets, Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, warned
yesterday. He said new measures would have to be outlined in next January's
budget if state debt as a proportion of gross national product was to be
stabilised by 1998. Although he was not specific, commentators say that up
to SKr30bn (Pounds 2.5bn) of extra budget-strengthening measures may be
needed to regain market confidence. The government has already promised
budget savings of SKr100bn over the next five years. The shaky state of
public finances has become the focus of heated political debate in the
run-up to September's general election. This follows the decision by
Skandia, the leading Swedish insurer, to boycott government bonds in protest
at Sweden's budget deficit and fast-rising debt.

Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday ended two days of heated debate, refusing to
reveal their decision on a 'last chance' international peace plan. But they
reportedly voted for conditional acceptance, an answer previously dismissed
as unacceptable by the plan's architects: the US, Russia, Germany, France
and Britain. The conditions are to be submitted to the western 'contact
group' in Geneva today, and are believed to include constitutional
guarantees allowing the self-proclaimed Serb state to join Serbia instead of
remaining in the planned Bosnian union with the Moslem-Croat federation.
They also sought revision of the 'take it or leave it' maps to include the
division of Sarajevo and access to the Adriatic sea. The contact group had
set a Tuesday deadline for the warring parties to give either a clear Yes or
No. Bosnia's Moslems have indicated they will accept the plan.

next two years. The debt represents credit lines provided by Turkey's Export
Import Bank to finance Russia's imports of Turkish goods and construction
services, on the back of a 1984 natural gas protocol, under which Turkey
takes delivery of Russian gas in exchange for supply of goods and services.
The agreement envisages Turkey will be repaid Dollars 90m in cash by the end
of September and a further Dollars 100m before the end of 1996. In addition,
it will take goods worth Dollars 100m in 1994, and the balance of goods over

FT  20 JUL 94 / German M3 growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in German money supply slowed further to an annualised rate of 11.3
per cent during June, after a rise of 13.4 per cent in May and 15.4 per cent
in April, according to provisional Bundesbank figures. The result was better
than expected, reviving expectations of more short-term interest rate cuts
this year. However, most economists think the key 4.5 per cent discount rate
is unlikely to be reduced before the central bank's four-week summer break,
which starts after tomorrow's council meeting. Attention at that meeting
will be on the traditional mid-year review of the performance of M3, the
bank's main indicator of potential inflation. Despite the welcome moderation
in M3, it is still growing far above this year's 4-6 per cent target range.
The Bundesbank added in a statement that lending to the private sector -
down in the previous two months - had fallen again. Investment in long-term
instruments outside the scope of M3 had also strengthened further during the
month. Monetary growth, however, had been 'strongly' influenced by the cash
management tactics of the public authorities during the month.

FT  20 JUL 94 / CIS balks at Russia's peacekeeping bill: Moscow appeals in
vain for men and money to bolster operations in hot-spots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An angry General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, yesterday
rebuked his counterparts from the other ex-Soviet republics for refusing to
contribute men and money to peace-keeping operations in the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
He also confirmed that Russia did not intend to honour the deadline of
August 31 for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia.
The clash over peacekeeping emerged at a meeting of defence ministers from
the CIS, which groups 12 former Soviet republics but not the Baltic states.
Russia unsuccessfully demanded help from its CIS partners, both military and
financial, for the peacekeeping operations it conducts in such hot-spots of
the former Soviet Union as Abkhazia and Tajikistan.
Gen Grachev, irritated by his partners' stance, shelved all further
discussion of co-operation over peacekeeping. He accused the CIS states of
looking after their own interests without taking into account the serious
economic situation in Russia.
However, the CIS defence ministers did approve a document which laid out a
new conception of collective security, in spite of reservations by
Azerbaijan and Belarus.
On the subject of Estonia, Gen Grachev, said the Russian garrison issue
would not be resolved unless the problems of the Russian minority were
resolved there. 'My stand on the issue has been, and will be, tough.'
Russian and Estonian negotiators are currently holding negotiations in
Helsinki, the Finnish capital, amid rising tension over minority rights and
border disputes.
Mr Mikhail Demurin, the deputy spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry,
yesterday described as 'counter-productive' the vote in the US Senate
earlier this month to stop aid to Russia if the troops are not pulled out
according to the agreed deadline.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, was quoted earlier this
week as saying he was 'confused, to say the least' by the US decision.
Estonia, even more than Latvia, with which Moscow has concluded a troop
withdrawal agreement, is clashing increasingly frequently with Russia - most
recently over a border disagreement.
Russia has strengthened the border guards and emplacements at the disputed
parts.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Berlusconi backs down over curbs on powers of arrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, suffered his first serious
reverse yesterday when he was forced to redraft controversial legislation
restricting the judiciary's powers of arrest.
The legislation, approved in cabinet last Thursday as a decree, split
Italy's rightwing coalition and threatened to bring down the two-month-old
government.
The decree will now be formally blocked in parliament and the government
will introduce new legislation in the form of a draft law. It will address
the most criticised aspects of the decree that provoked the resignations
last week of the Milan anti-corruption magistrates responsible for exposing
the corrupt practices of Italy's political and business elite.
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and one of the main
critics of the decree, said yesterday he had no wish to bring down the
government. However, he has taken advantage of Mr Berlusconi's difficulties
to undermine the prime minister's authority.
Yesterday Mr Bossi is reported to have blocked plans by Mr Berlusconi to
make a nationwide televised address on the issue. Mr Bossi, in Strasbourg
for the European parliament, co-ordinated his position with Mr Gianfranco
Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance.
These partners in the coalition, who have both campaigned hard against
corruption, became increasingly critical of the decree as the public outcry
grew.
The compromise was patched up after 24 hours of hectic and angry exchanges
between the coalition partners. The decree, which had immediate effect, will
be superseded by a draft bill whose text can be amended during its course
through parliament.
The draft will restore the discretionary powers of magistrates to use
preventive detention in cases of bribery, corruption and extortion that
involve the public administration. These cover many of the cases in the
anti-corruption drive of the past two and a half years that has changed the
political face of Italy.
It was the exclusion of these cases from preventive detention that caused
much of the public outcry and allowed nearly 1,800 people to be released
from jail. Of these, only 167 had been held on corruption charges. The
government did not clarify whether those just released would be obliged to
go back to jail. But the new law will not be passed by parliament, probably
until mid-August.
The new draft allows magistrates to retain the secrecy of their
investigations of persons suspected of belonging to the mafia to beyond
three months. The decree obliged magistrates to inform anyone immediately
they were the subject of investigations. Proposed restrictions on the press
have also been lifted.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Barclays Life rebuked over sales operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank's life insurance and pensions subsidiary has been publicly
censured by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog,
for shortcomings in the training and management of its 1,100 sales force.
The criticism was followed yesterday by the resignation of Mr Ken Bignall,
chairman of Barclays Life, from the board of the Personal Investment
Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, which began
operation this week.
Mr Bignall said the PIA, which Barclays Life yesterday applied to join,
needed 'to have the reputation of being administered by people who are
beyond reproach'.
Barclays Life is only the second organisation to receive such a rebuke from
the SIB, which does not have the power to impose fines on the 70-plus bodies
it regulates.
Yesterday's reprimand came a day after Nationwide Building Society announced
it was temporarily withdrawing its financial services sales force for
re-training, after a regulatory visit.
The SIB said Barclays Life's failures to comply with its requirements took
place from September 1991 - when it made an inspection visit - until June
1993, when a further routine visit occurred.
Since last summer, Barclays Life has been implementing measures intended to
do more than just remedy the supervisory and other defects the SIB
identified.
They include a move to give sales agents a basic salary as well as
commission and bonuses, instead of paying them on a commission-only basis.
The switch in remuneration is likely to take place by next year.
Barclays Life has already introduced additional training for its entire
sales force, it has extended the initial training programme for new sales
agents from three to eight weeks and it has expanded the central checking
unit from 31 to 100 staff. The company said the changes had cost several
millions of pounds.
Mr Bignall said, while there was no evidence that Barclays Life customers
had been disadvantaged, the company was reviewing a sample of past business
to reassure itself that this was the case. It has also set up a help-line
(0800 494949) for customers to contact if they are concerned. Mr Bignall's
resignation from the PIA may spark a renewed debate about the position of Mr
Joe Palmer, the former chief executive of Legal &amp; General, who is chairman
of the PIA.
Earlier this year, L&amp;G was fined a then-record amount of Pounds 180,000 by
Lautro, the life industry's current regulator, for a failure to meet
regulators' requirements over a period which included some of Mr Palmer's
time in charge.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Lara wins record-breaking Pounds 500,000 sponsorship deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management company, has
signed up West Indies cricketer Brian Lara, the world record-holding
batsman, in the largest ever individual cricket sponsorship deal valued at
Pounds 500,000.
Mr Lara was uncustomarily kitted out yesterday in pin-stripe suit and bowler
hat to open MAM's first innings in sports sponsorship, long an avenue of
corporate image-promotion for financial services companies.
MAM, which had done almost no advertising until two years ago, launched a
print campaign earlier this year, featuring dramatic sports imagery.
The company, which has grown to manage Pounds 60bn in assets, has recently
shifted its marketing efforts to its retail businesses including unit and
investment trusts tailored for wealthy private clients as well as personal
pensions business.
'The corporate theme is one of sporting excellence,' explained Mr Richard
Royds, managing director of Mercury Fund Managers. Although it was Mr Lara's
agent who made the initial approach to MAM, Mr Royds said his company's
market research suggested it would gain the greatest impact on its target
audience by sponsoring either cricket or rugby.
Sponsoring Mr Lara appealed to MAM, Mr Royds said, because 'he is the most
prolific run scorer in the world. We are the leading investment management
company in the UK. The tie-up is obvious'.
In April, Mr Lara broke the world record for the highest score in a Test
innings when he made 375 against England. Then, last month, he hit a world
record for a first-class innings, 501 for Warwickshire against Durham. He is
the first to hold both world records since Sir Donald Bradman, widely
regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, in the 1930s.
Mr Lara will invest his sign-on fee in Mercury's flagship unit trust, The
Mercury Portfolio. The contract with MAM will run until the end of 1996. A
performance-related element could raise the total above the basic Pounds
500,000.
In return for the sponsorship, Mr Lara will appear in MAM advertising and
appear at some MAM-sponsored charity events, while his cricket clothing will
carry some MAM advertising.
MAM, which is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, is hardly Mr Lara's sole
corporate sponsor. His others include a mobile telephone company based in
south-west England, Joe Bloggs clothing, and BWIA, the West Indies airline
which has given Mr Lara 375,000 free air miles.
In recent weeks, Mr Lara has been plagued by press reports of excessive
lateness for games and, in one well-publicised incident, for producing a
mobile telephone while fielding.
His contract contains a 'let-out' clause if he engages in certain specified
types of conduct. 'I'm not going to tell you what those are,' Mr Royds said.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Swan Hunter set to close as Rosyth gains Pounds 40m order:
Blow to north-east England after defence work goes to Scottish rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership for the past 14
months, looks certain to close after the Ministry of Defence yesterday
awarded a contract to refit the Sir Bedivere landing ship to a Scottish
rival, Rosyth Royal Dockyard.
Rosyth bid about Pounds 40m for the contract, Pounds 10m less than Swan
Hunter, which was fourth out of five bidders on price.
The closure of Swan Hunter would mean the end of shipbuilding in north-east
England, which once produced two of every five ships built in the world.
The loss of Swan Hunter, which combined craft skills with high technology,
would be a significant blow to employment and morale in an area already
suffering from Britain's highest regional unemployment rate.
French-based Soffia, owner of Cherbourg patrol boat builder Constructions
Mecaniques de Normandie, was the only prospective buyer to emerge from a
worldwide search by Swan Hunter's receiver Price Waterhouse. Soffia had
stressed it would acquire the Tyneside yard only if it had a two-year
workload, to sustain overheads while seeking more work.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said last night it seemed
nothing could prevent the closure. Soffia would reach a final conclusion
today, he said, but he was not optimistic.
With the outfitting of Swan Hunter's last vessel, the Type 23 frigate
Richmond due for completion in November, any price CMN could offer was
unlikely to be acceptable to the receiver, he said. 'There's just no market
for a dead shipyard.'
Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said unless CMN went ahead, Swan Hunter's sale
as a going concern was unlikely. 'There are no other prospective purchasers
waiting in the wings.'
About 100 redundancies, of the technical and design staff retained for Sir
Bedivere, seem imminent. The remaining 550 employees face redundancy after
Richmond is completed.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, also announced that
Swan Hunter had successfully tendered for the refit of the Royal Fleet
Auxiliary tanker Olwen, a three-month Pounds 6m contract.
The yard can take on this work only if it is no longer in receivership. The
contract will otherwise go to the second lowest bidder.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary and MP for South Shields, where
many Swan Hunter workers live, condemned this as a 'political fudge'. He
said: 'The government has thrown Tyneside a minnow when it knows it needs a
whale to survive.'
Swan Hunter tendered for Olwen to provide work for 238 laid-off employees,
hoping they would move on to Sir Bedivere.
By an added irony, CMN, which spent months negotiating with the MoD over its
acceptability as a UK defence contractor, heard yesterday it had received
clearance to take over the contract for the completion of Richmond at Swans.
Mr Aitken also announced that Devonport dockyard in Plymouth had won the
refit of HMS Birmingham.
Mr James insisted that Swan Hunter's Sir Bedivere bid was 'extremely
competitive' but had to reflect overhead costs.
The government's decision was condemned by union leaders as a missed
opportunity to support foreign ownership of Swans.

FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Composites rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Composite insurance stocks bounced sharply as some investors sought a
leveraged entrance to a rising market and traders marked some issues higher
in anticipation of continuing demand.
Royal Insurance, up 11 at 257p, experienced the sector's biggest percentage
gain as Credit Lyonnais Laing featured the stock as its principal buy in the
sector. Analyst Mr David Hudson said that with Pounds 7.2bn of assets in
equities and bonds and only Pounds 1.74bn invested by shareholders, the
group was the most highly geared to any market rises or falls. 'There is a
more confident tone to equities and bonds, and if they rise by 10 per cent
the value of shareholder funds rises by 30 per cent,' said Mr Hudson.
Commercial Union advanced 19 to 570p and General Accident rose 15 to 585p.
Second-quarter figures above analysts' forecasts sent SmithKline Beecham 'A'
up 8 to 402p. Hoare Govett pinpointed the 81 per cent growth of new products
in the second quarter compared to 61 per cent in the first. And Mr Paul
Krikler of Goldman Sachs said: 'This was a very good set of results.
Clearly, the decline of Tagamet (SmithKline's anti-ulcer treatment which
came off patent in the US in May) was much less than forecast.'
Shares in rival Glaxo took some heart from the figures, rising 14 1/2 to
582p. They were further boosted by a buy programme covering several leading
internationally traded stocks and carried out by a US brokerage. Merrill
Lynch was the house named and was also said to have been buying Hanson, up a
penny at 255 3/4 p, BP, 5 ahead at 407 1/2 p, and Cable and Wireless, 4 1/2
higher at 432p.
Legal &amp; General firmed 3 to 450p ahead of a statement after the market
closed which gave details of the new business figures for the first half of
the year. Analysts said that although the worldwide new business was down to
Pounds 146.3m from Pounds 156.1m, it was far higher than most had expected.
Shares in Barclays, the high street bank, slipped a penny to 554p after its
life and pensions arm was censured for shortcomings in the training of its
sales staff.
Airports operator BAA shed 2 to 952p in profit-taking that brought volume of
1.5m. However, the stock is favoured by Strauss Turnbull, which reiterated
its buy recommendation.
Mr Marshall Whiting at the broker said: 'We like the stock on fundamentals
and I think some outperformance is due.' He expects the company to report
first-quarter profits of Pounds 110m at the end of this month.
Chemicals group Courtaulds lost 2 at 509p following its annual meeting. The
shares shed some of the gain notched up as a result of an analysts' visit to
Courtaulds sites in Germany last week, but chemicals observers were quietly
encouraged by an agm statement, which is traditionally cautious.
Recent market arrival Inspec, the speciality chemicals group, was squeezed
16 higher to 222p ahead of its first set of public interim results on August
8.
Industrial conglomerate BTR gave up 6 1/2 to 370p in heavy trading of 8.6m
after UBS said it was cautious on the stock.
Engineering company BM Group firmed 1 1/2 to 35 1/2 p after announcing that
Credit Lyonnais Laing was to be its new broker in place of Kleinwort Benson.
Vickers moved ahead 6 to 182p after Henderson Crosthwaite recommended the
shares.
There was a two-way pull in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce which
brought turnover of 3.3m as the shares closed unchanged at 194p. A weighty
recommendation from investment bank Lehman Brothers is due to land on
investors' desks, while US rival United Technologies is expected to report
positive news on civil spares later today.
A sparkling debut from Yates Brothers Wine Lodges saw the shares come to the
market at 140p and close 25 ahead at 165p.
Granada shares were said to be upset by a director's stake sale and slid 9
to 530p. Mr Charles Allen sold 145,000 shares at 537p apiece, reducing his
holding in the company to 43,239 shares.
The perky retail sales report from the CBI helped several stores stocks.
Great Universal Stores added 11 at 591p and Marks and Spencer 7 at 435 1/2
p.
There were some good performances among the electricity utilities as the
sector responded to a variety of different pressures, including interest
rate optimism, regulatory issues and broker recommendations. Among the recs,
Southern climbed 21 to 614p, Yorkshire 26 to 596p, Norweb 24 to 658p and
East Midlands 17 to 604p.
Bumper profits from office equipment company Nobo Group saw the shares
appreciate 2 to 249p.

FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Legal and General's new business decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General, the investment management and financial services group, saw
the value of its worldwide new business fall from Pounds 156.1m to Pounds
146.3m in the first half of 1994.
The group, which calculates the figures by adding 10 per cent of single
premiums to annual premium income, said UK life and pensions premiums fell
from Pounds 102.3m to Pounds 122.7m in the first half.
Although UK annual premiums also fell, the downturn was offset by Pounds
74.7m (Pounds 54m) generated by its unit trust operations and Pounds 44m
(Pounds 33.4m) from overseas businesses.
Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said: 'The current UK market for
our products has proved difficult and this has been reflected in our new
business figures.'
The group's direct salesforce has been cut from 2,400 to 1,900 to improve
efficiency, but Mr Prosser warned that the operating environment was
unlikely to improve in the short term.

FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo gains 5% despite June
earnings warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PepsiCo, the US soft drink and fast food company that last month warned of
flat profits in its second quarter, yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in
net income for the period to Dollars 446.5m.
However, further indications of its difficulties came with the announcement
of another top management change.
Just one week after the departure of Mr Jeff Campbell, senior vice-president
for brand development, PepsiCo said Mr John Cranor, chief executive of its
KFC fast food business, had resigned.
Mr David Novak, a Pepsi-Cola North America executive, will become chief
executive of KFC-USA, and Mr Larry Zwain will remain chief executive of KFC
International. Both will report directly to Mr Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo
chairman and chief executive.
The shares were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 30 3/4 at midday. Last month,
PepsiCo said two main factors were behind its poor financial performance: a
downturn in profits from its fast food businesses, and discounting in its US
soft drink business caused by price competition.
Yesterday, PepsiCo confirmed 11 per cent growth in revenues from domestic
beverages had been partly offset by higher discounts to retailers, producing
a 5 per cent increase in operating profits to Dollars 270.9m.
Internationally, operating profits from beverages fell by 23 per cent to
Dollars 64.1m, mainly because last year's figure included a one-off Dollars
11.9m credit.
Snack food profits rose 15 per cent to Dollars 318.7m, but profits from all
the fast food businesses were down. Pizza Hut's fell by 10 per cent to
Dollars 59.7m, Taco Bell's declined by 5 per cent to Dollars 54.6m, and
KFC's fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 41.6m. Poor sales, lower prices and
higher costs were mostly to blame.
Overall, group sales rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 6.56bn and earnings per
share rose 4 per cent to 55 cents. Excluding the effect of accounting
changes, net income rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 729.3m in the half year.

Cincinnati Milacron, the US machine tool and plastics machinery producer,
lifted second-quarter earnings by nearly 30 per cent and announced its best
quarter for new orders.
Net profits were Dollars 7.9m, or 23 cents a share, compared with profits
before extraordinary items of Dollars 6.2m, or 19 cents, in 1993. Sales
advanced to Dollars 269.3m from Dollars 236.6m.
New orders totalled Dollars 302m, against Dollars 232m a year ago and
Dollars 267m in the first quarter of this year. Orders exceeded shipments
causing the backlog to grow to Dollars 299m, up more than Dollars 50m so far
this year.
Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman and chief executive, conceded that part of the
increase in new business came from the recently acquired Ferramatik, a
German producer of injection moulding machines.
Second-quarter machine tool sales fell year-on-year to Dollars 67m from
Dollars 78m, and the business had an operating loss of Dollars 900,000,
against operating profits of Dollars 1.6m a year ago.
However, Mr Meyer said the consolidation of the machine tool business would
not be completed until the fourth quarter, and with the higher order backlog
and improved efficiencies it would contribute positively to the bottom line
in the second half.
In contrast, second-quarter operating earnings in plastics machinery jumped
to Dollars 9.7m from Dollars 6.1m on record sales of Dollars 121m. In
industrial products, operating profits improved to Dollars 8.2m from Dollars
7.3m on stagnant sales of Dollars 81m.
Six-month profits were Dollars 12.9m or 37 cents, compared with Dollars 9.8m
or 32 cents. That was before extraordinary items which left Milacron with a
Dollars 46.8m net loss.

Gerresheimer Glas, the German glass maker, said it swung to an operating
profit of DM3m (Dollars 1.8m) in the first six months of the year to
November 30, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf.
Gerresheimer made a loss of DM47m during the same period last year. However,
the company said it made a net loss in the current half year of DM7m,
because of taxes on foreign units.
Group sales in the six months were up 12 per cent to DM772m, largely because
of the acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Kimble of the US.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Growth in German M3 slows to 11.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in German money supply slowed further to an annualised rate of 11.3
per cent during June, after growth of 13.4 per cent in May and 15.4 per cent
in April, according to provisional Bundesbank figures released yesterday.
Economists who had forecast 12 per cent expansion in the M3 measure after
13.4 per cent in May and 15.4 per cent in April, said the
better-than-expected result revived expectations of further short-term
interest rate cuts this year.
However, economists and money dealers were divided about whether the
Bundesbank would ease policy as early as tomorrow. A report in the
influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper quoted Bundesbank
sources as saying the chances of a rate cut tomorrow were very slight but
surprises could not be ruled out.
'Everyone's waiting to see what the Bundesbank will do, especially after
these M3 figures,' a Frankfurt trader said.
M3 comprises currency in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits for less
than four years and savings deposits at three months' notice.
Nevertheless, most analysts agreed the key 4.5 per cent discount rate was
unlikely to be reduced before the central bank's four-week summer break
which starts after tomorrow's council meeting.
Attention at that meeting is to be focused on the traditional mid-year
review of M3s performance. Despite the welcome moderation in the bank's main
indicator of potential inflation, M3 is still growing far above the 4-6 per
cent target range set by the bank for this year.
Although the Bundesbank said special factors distorting the figure still had
to be taken into account, it added in a statement that lending to the
private sector - down in the previous two months - had fallen again.
Investment in long-term instruments outside the scope of M3 had also
strengthened further during the month.
One important factor boosting its growth since the start of this year has
been the reluctance of investors to transfer money into longer-term paper,
such as bonds, which do not figure in M3.
The Bundesbank said, however, that monetary growth had been 'strongly'
influenced by the cash management tactics of the public authorities during
the month. According to an analysis by Dresdner Bank, these tendencies
signalled a return to normal borrowing and investment patterns, and raised
the possibility that M3 would not show any noticeable growth for the rest of
this year.
Dresdner's optimism followed statements on Monday from Mr Otmar Issing, a
central bank director, that while it would be difficult to reach the 4-6 per
cent target zone by the year's end, it was not impossible.

Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, said yesterday it had agreed a pay
deal with unions giving workers a 1 per cent pay rise plus additional
payments totalling DM900 (Dollars 372) per worker. The 102,000 workers at
VW's six plants in west Germany, who began working a four-day 28-hour week
to save jobs earlier this year, will receive an extra DM500 with their July
wages. They will receive a further DM400 next March, the company said. The
deal was reached after four rounds of talks with the IG Metall union, which
had originally sought a 3.2 per cent pay rise to match inflation.
Volkswagen, hit by a slump in demand because of the recession, has said its
four-day week will save DM2bn this year, or 20 per cent of its DM10bn wage
bill.

Turkey and Russia agreed terms yesterday to settle a Dollars 480m debt under
which Ankara will be repaid in cash and barter over the next two years. The
deal was signed in Ankara at the end of a two-day visit by Russia's first
deputy prime minister, Mr Oleg Soskovets. The debt represents credit lines
provided by Turkey's Export Import Bank to finance Russia's imports of
Turkish goods and construction services, on the back of a 1984 natural gas
protocol, under which Turkey takes delivery of Russian gas in exchange for
supply of goods and services.
The agreement envisages Turkey will be repaid Dollars 90m in cash by the end
of September and a further Dollars 100m before the end of 1996. In addition,
it will take goods worth Dollars 100m in 1994, and the balance of goods over
the next two years. Turkey is understood to be considering taking
Russian-made MI-24 Hind-D combat helicopters to bolster its war effort
against Kurdish rebels. Under the gas protocol, Turkey currently receives
6bn cubic metres of gas a year for household and industrial use. It has
agreed to take an additional 2.5bn cubic metres from 1997.

FT  20 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs keep peace verdict secret: Decision believed
to be a notional 'yes' with conditions attached
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serbs, in a deft move that will exasperate international peace
brokers, yesterday reached a verdict on a peace plan for the republic but
resolved to keep it secret.
The decision, contained in a sealed envelope which will be delivered to the
five-nation 'contact group' on Bosnia in Geneva, was believed to amount to a
notional 'yes' with up to six conditions attached.
The contact group - made up of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -
has told Bosnia's warring parties to expect an escalating series of punitive
measures unless they agree to a plan which splits the republic 51-49 between
the Moslems and Croats on one hand and Serbs on the other.
Mr Miroslav Toholj, the Bosnian Serb Information Minister, emerged from a
two-day debate in the Serb stronghold of Pale with the sealed message and
said: 'The Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday and today has adopted a
decision which is in this envelope and which will be submitted to the
contact group.'
Earlier Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, indicated that the
assembly was likely to endorse a conditional approval. 'We have reached no
decision but I hope we can accept it in some way.'
The conditions were believed to include:
guarantees that the Bosnian Serb state would have full independence from the
Moslem-Croat federation and would enjoy the right to join up with Serbia
proper;
access to the Adriatic for the Serb entity;
a new partition of Sarajevo.
During their emotional, closed-door debate, Serb deputies are reported to
have railed bitterly against a plan which they described as a international
diktat.
guaranteed lifting of sanctions on both Serbia and Montenegro;
By voicing conditional approval, the Serbs appeared to be hoping to weaken
the resolve of the contact group to impose punitive measures, and possibly
divide the group down the middle.
Russia, a traditional friend of the Serbs, will now be able to argue that
its proteges are being relatively co-operative and should not be punished
any further.
Serb officials said that if the international community insisted on a
straight yes or no, the existing peace plan would have to be put to a
referendum which would almost certainly deliver a rejection.
AP adds: The chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal for the Balkans
said yesterday he expected indictments against suspects from the former
Yugoslavia by the end of the year.
Prosecutor Richard Goldstone of South Africa also told a news conference
that he hoped the tribunal would be a first step in setting up an
international court to prosecute crimes against humanity.
The tribunal was set up in The Hague in February 1993 to investigate
hundreds of alleged war crimes committed in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
It is the first of its kind since the 1945 Nuremberg trials of Nazi war
criminals.
'If this tribunal is effective, it must act quickly,' said Mr Goldstone.
'Already too much time has elapsed. I will consider myself to have failed if
indictments are not brought before the end of the year.'

FT  20 JUL 94 / Berlusconi forced to retreat over judiciary decree:
Legislation withdrawn after split in Italian coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, suffered his first serious
reverse yesterday when he was forced to redraft legislation restricting the
judiciary's powers of arrest.
The legislation, approved in cabinet last Thursday as a decree, split
Italy's right-wing coalition and threatened to bring down the two month-old
government.
The decree will now be formally blocked in parliament and the government
will introduce new legislation. This will be in the form of a draft law that
addresses the most criticised aspects of the decree that provoked last week
the resignations of the Milan anti-corruption magistrates responsible for
exposing the corrupt practices of Italy's political and business elite.
'A crisis of the government at this stage would have caused serious damage
to the country, especially when important economic decision have to be
taken,' said Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the minister for relations with
parliament.
The lira weakened during the day, falling to L1,006 against the D-mark, but
recovered slightly on the news of the deal between Mr Berlusconi and his
rebel coalition partners.
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and one of the main
critics of the decree, said yesterday he had no wish to bring down the
government. However, Mr Bossi has taken advantage of Mr Berlusconi's
difficulties to undermine the prime minister's authority.
Yesterday Mr Bossi reportedly blocked plans by Mr Berlusconi to make a
nationwide televised address on the issue. Mr Bossi, who was in Strasbourg
for the European parliament, co-ordinated his position with Mr Gianfranco
Fini, the leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance.
These two partners in the coalition, who have both campaigned hard against
corruption, became increasingly critical of the decree as the public outcry
grew.
The draft will restore the discretionary powers of magistrates to use
preventive detention in cases of bribery, corruption and extortion that
involve the public administration.
It was the exclusion of these cases from preventive detention that caused
much of the public outcry and allowed nearly 1,800 people to be released
from jail. Of these, only 167 had been held on corruption charges.
The government did not clarify whether those just released would be obliged
to go back to jail. But the new law will not probably be passed by
parliament until mid-August.
The new draft allows magistrates to keep secret beyond three months their
investigations of persons suspected of belonging to the mafia. The decree
obliged magistrates to inform anyone immediately they were the subject of
investigations.
Restrictions have also been lifted on the press, which the decree forbid
from publishing details of the names of those under investigation -
restrictions that were ignored anyway.
But Mr Berlusconi insisted the broad lines of the decree would be retained
and he reaffirmed the need to prevent people's basic freedoms being abused
by over-zealous use of arrest and imprisonment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tutsi rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front yesterday named a Hutu, Mr
Pasteur Bizimungu, as president of what they say will be a broad-based
government of national unity, in an apparent attempt to reassure Rwanda's
Hutu majority that they have nothing to fear under the new regime.
The RPF is due to install a new government in the capital Kigali today as
the remnants of the old Hutu government and army joined the mass Hutu exodus
into Zaire.
As a long-time member of the RPF, however, Mr Bizimungu is not expected to
inspire confidence among supporters of the late Hutu president, Gen Juvenal
Habyarimana.
The new prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu, is also a Hutu, but real
power will almost certainly remain in the hands of Gen Paul Kagame, the
military commander who formed an army of Tutsi exiles in 1990 to fight the
Habyarimana dictatorship.
The RPF is understood to be offering government posts to members of the old
ruling party who were not implicated in the genocide of Rwanda's Tutsi
population following the assassination of Gen Habyarimana in April.
The new government's chances of receiving international recognition are
high, particularly since a special UN reporter on human rights identified
the former government as having been involved in directing the massacre of
hundreds of thousands of Tutsis.
The US has given representatives of the old government five days to leave
Rwanda. Their bank accounts have been frozen. Moves are also afoot in the UN
to expel the Rwandan representative on the Security Council.
'The UN will have little choice but to deal with the new government,' Ms
Alison Desfoges, a consultant with Human Rights Watch Africa, the US-based
human rights group, said yesterday. 'But the international community will
also be in a strong position to exert leverage over the RPF, as the new
government will be heavily aid-dependent.'
France's position will be critical to the success of the new regime. Its
military intervention in Rwanda came too late to save Tutsi lives, and now
not even the 'civilian safe havens' established by French troops in the
south-west of the country have been able to stem the flight of the Hutu
population into Zaire.
The retreating Hutu army is, however, sheltering behind French lines, and
there are signs that the French are uncomfortable protecting perpetrators of
genocide.

Pepsi-Cola faces a threat of a boycott from consumers in the Philippines'
main sugar-producing island of Negros because it is using imported sugar for
its production of soft drinks, writes Jose Galang in Manila.
The boycott is being instigated by Negros-based Confederation of Sugar
Producers Associations and National Federation of Sugar Planters, and has
gained support from Negros representatives in the Philippine Congress.
The dispute stems from the import of 15,000 tonnes of refined sugar worth
Dollars 1.9m made by Macondray, an affiliate of Pepsi. Macondray imported
the sugar due to a reported shortage of the commodity in the local market.
However, sugar growers in Negros insisted that the 13 sugar mills on the
island were holding sugar stocks of some 240,000 tonnes. The local sugar
industry directly employs some 500,000 people.

FT  19 JUL 94 / US firm over lifting sanctions on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US last night took a firm stand against lifting the embargo against Iraq
even as Baghdad sought improved relations with its Arab neighbours and
boasted of co-operating with the United Nations, writes Michael Littlejohns,
UN Correspondent, in New York.
As the Security Council conducted its periodic review of sanctions Ms
Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador, asserted that this 'limited
co-operation' was sporadic, selective and opportunist.
She said Baghdad was trying only to escape sanctions while ignoring other
requirements imposed by the Council.
The US was convinced that what co-operation had been seen would cease once
Iraq was enabled to sell oil. While Baghdad still had not revealed fully its
mass destruction weapons programme, it was already contacting former
suppliers or middle-men to purchase new armaments.
Although France, Russia and some third world states are eager to have the
Council acknowledge that Iraq has made progress towards implementing Council
resolutions, Ms Albright said it was premature to discuss either the terms
or the timing of modifying sanctions.
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime minister, who is in New York, has accused
some states - implicitly the US and Britain - of obstructing an easing of

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (10): The triangle breaks - A look at the
end of a political era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seismic upheavals in Japanese politics over the past year have caused the
old power structure to shift and crumble, but a new one has yet to take its
place.
The dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has just returned to
power after spending nearly a year in opposition for the first time in its
39-year life, has been terminally damaged. Unstable coalition governments
may be the norm for the next few years.
Japan's conservative post-war rulers were only able to seize power three
weeks ago thanks to the support of their lifetime enemies in the left wing
Social Democratic Party, a telling sign of how completely the old balance of
power has been upset.
It could take several general elections before stability returns. As so
often in Japan, underlying change is not as fast as it looks on the surface.
The LDP's defeat in a general election last year, precipitated by the
defection of reform-minded politicians from its own ranks, led by Mr Tsutomu
Hata and his mentor Mr Ichiro Ozawa, ushered in what looked like a radical
seven-party coalition. Led by an idealistic former prefectural governor, Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, it embraced a wide range of interests from the religious
right to the extreme left and promised to introduce a new poltical style and
structure.
Mr Hosokawa won instant popularity by staking his job on achieving
parliamentary agreement on a new political and electoral system designed to
curb corruption.
The Keidanren, Japan's powerful business federation, recognised that the old
system was really on the way out when it decided, days after Mr Hosokawa's
arrival, to stop channelling funds to political parties. Keidanren cash, in
return for a guarantee that government would be sensitive to big
manufacturing industry's voice, was crucial to binding the so-called iron
triangle of business, politicians and the bureaucracy together. The LDP's
return in no way tempts the Keidanren to change its ban on political
donations, says its new chairman, Mr Shoichiro Toyoda.
Failure to deliver on political reform, under debate for the previous five
years, had contributed to the decline of two former LDP prime ministers. So
it was no surprise that Mr Hosokawa had to water down his proposals to
obtain agreement from the reluctant LDP and SDP old-guards, many of whom
fear they will lose their seats under the new system.
The final plan, agreed in January, will tightly regulate political fund
raising and replace Japan's unique multi-seat constituency system with a
mixture of single seat districts and proportional representation. All that
remains is for new electoral boundaries to be drawn, to reflect the new
system and to increase the power of under-represented urban voters. The new
government of Mr Tomiichi Murayama aims to complete this by the autumn.
Soon after Mr Hosokawa's political reforms cleared parliament, his coalition
was plunged into a divisive argument over tax. At this point, old style
Japanese politics began to take its revenge. The LDP, resorting to a tactic
used against itself while in government, blocked parliamentary debate on
this year's budget to put pressure on Mr Hosokawa to disprove two not so
serious allegations of personal financial impropriety.
An increasingly tired and frustrated Mr Hosokawa joked over dinner with
friends that he might as well resign. Two days later, in early April, he did
just that, to the surprise of both his allies and enemies.
The old order, in which decisions are made by consensus in backrooms rather
than debated in open parliament, began to reassert itself. Evidence of this
was a secretive deal between centre-right members of the coalition to form a
parliamentary group, called Kaishin, or innovation, with the blessing of Mr
Ozawa, the government's brilliant but accident prone backroom strategist.
The SDP, the largest member of the coalition, promptly walked out in anger
at being excluded. This deprived the government of a majority only hours
after it had selected - ironically with SDP support - Mr Hata, the former
foreign minister, as the new prime minister. From that moment, the Hata
administration was doomed. The opposition consented to keep it in power only
until the current year's budget, already three months overdue, had cleared
parliament. Rather than lose a no-confidence motion supported by both the
LDP and an angry SDP, Mr Hata stepped down after the budget and after just
two months in office, in the hope of forming a majority coalition behind the
scenes. It had been the shortest-lived Japanese government since 1945.
In the event, Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa failed to attract the SDP back to their
camp. In a desperate final bid for power, they fielded as their leadership
candidate Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a reform-minded former LDP prime minister.
The stratagem failed. Mr Kaifu lost a parliamentary vote to Mr Murayama,
chairman of the SDP who agreed, in a flurry of last minute bargaining, to
form a government with his old foe, the LDP. The wily Mr Ozawa's
miscalculations consigned him - no doubt temporarily - to obscurity, just
two years after he was poised to inherit the LDP's most powerful faction.
The LDP-SDP marriage is strange by any standards. It remains to be seen
whether the LDP's leader, Mr Yohei Kono, is better at working with a divided
and erratic Socialist party than was Mr Hata, or whether the alliance will
break up like its predecessor. The desire to stay in power may be strong
enough to suppress policy differences.
The past year's political power struggle has been greeted with polite
bafflement by Japan's foreign partners. There is, however, a pattern to the
chaotic political events of the past 12 months. Most political experts think
that Japan is evolving from the one-party rule of the LDP era to a more or
less evenly balanced system of two or three parties, capable of taking it in
turns to govern.
The LDP has been weakened, with the first round of defections that provided
the foundations for the Hosokawa coalition and with the latest defection by
Mr Kaifu, who wants to form a new party. All this has created a fragmented
opposition of small moderate parties, which have begun to coalesce, with the
formation of Mr Ozawa's Kaishin. The SDP and the tiny Japan Communist Party
form a third group.
The LDP's return to government might look like a step back in Japan's search
for a new political system. Against that, there have been several steps
forward in the past year.
Firstly, there is the passage of the new laws on political reform. This
makes change irreversible so long as this unpredictable new government does
not have second thoughts about completing the new electoral boundaries.
Secondly, there is the creation, for the first time since the war, of a
moderate opposition capable of running a government. Finally, Japan has seen
the beginnings of an open television and newspaper debate on policies,
previously the domain of smoke-filled backrooms.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (8): So polite about the past - Asians
concentrate on bid for Japanese capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Asians fret about Japan these days, they are rarely concerned by
Japanese atrocities in Asia during World War Two or the tactless denials of
Japan's war record by right-wing politicians in Tokyo; they are usually
anxious about winning a share of the next round of Japanese investment.
Except in China, Korea and occasionally in the Philippines and Singapore -
whose peoples suffered most from Japanese imperialism - there is little
interest in Japan's tentative efforts to adopt a more assertive foreign
policy to match its economic power.
Asian governments and businesses from India to the Philippines are more
preoccupied by Japan's money and manufacturing skills than its history. This
is especially true of south-east Asia. Japanese investment in everything
from vehicle assembly to the manufacture of computer disk-drives and air
conditioners has been the driving force behind the rapid economic growth of
countries such as Thailand and Malaysia since the 1970s.
More than 90 per cent of cars in Thailand are Japanese marques, most of them
assembled in Thailand. In Malaysia, the factories of the Japanese company
Matsushita alone account for about four per cent of the country's gdp.
The recent liberalisation of the economies of China, Vietnam and India was
therefore regarded with some trepidation in south-east Asia, because it was
assumed that these three capital-hungry countries would receive so much
Japanese investment that the rest of Asia would be starved of new money.
At first the figures appeared to confirmed the hypothesis. Japanese
investment at the start of the decade rose sharply in China - Hitachi says
six of its nine joint ventures in China were established in the past three
years - and fell in some traditional south-east Asian recipient countries.
Governments hurried to improve their investment incentives.
They need not have worried. The remorseless rise of the yen against the
dollar has obliged Japanese companies to move increasingly sophisticated
production lines offshore where wages are lower, and the big corporations
are being followed by component suppliers which also need to reduce costs to
remain competitive.
Broadly, investments in China are designed to supply goods to China's huge
domestic market or to produce labour-intensive products for export. The
various national markets of south-east Asia are also important (especially
Indonesia and Thailand), but the purpose of many new Japanese investments
there is to produce medium or high-technology products for export to Japan,
America and Europe.
Mitsubishi Electric, for example, shifted production of its standard line of
elevators from Japan to Thailand in 1991. The same company says that since
last year it has been producing 90 per cent of its floppy disk drives in
Thailand.
Last year for the first time Japan imported more colour televisions than it
exported; the same is true of other products such as refrigerators. Hitachi
is in the process of shifting production of one type of refrigerator
compressor from Japan to a new factory in Ayudhya north of Bangkok, and is
building a facility in the Philippines to make mini hard disk-drives.
But the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) -
namely Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand
 -will have to deal with two potential problems in their partnership with
Japanese companies if they are to prosper in the midst of corporate Japan's
growing fascination with China and India: the first problem is the slow
evolution of the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta), and the second is a dispute
over technology transfer.
Although the influential Japanese motor industry managed through lengthy
negotiations to secure special tariff reductions for car components traded
between Asean countries - the so-called 'brand-to-brand complementarity
scheme' - Japanese and other manufacturers are often frustrated by the
difficulty of establishing integrated operations within Asean.
Car component maker Nippondenso, for instance, is in the throes of
negotiations with Asean governments; the company wants to specialise in
particular products at each of its factories in Asean instead of duplicating
its efforts in several different countries.
Afta is an attempt to deal with this sort of difficulty, but under the
present agreements individual countries can and do undermine free trade
principles by excluding numerous products they regard as sensitive from the
tariff cuts. Even for products embraced by Afta, tariffs are scheduled to
fall to between zero and five per cent only in the year 2008.
Economies of scale are therefore not always available in Asean, at least not
for the regional market. 'If they want to grow faster they have to give up
these nationalistic policies,' says Mr Minoru Tsukada, manager of Asian
business development at Hitachi.
If Afta succeeds, therefore, Asean members may have to watch Japanese
companies close down operations in one country and consolidate their
operations in another - a process which has from time to time caused
nationalistic outrage in parts of Europe.
And if Asean baulks at such rationalisation, Japanese companies can always
mention China. Mr Nobuhiro Ogura of Mitsubishi Electric says of the
company's television plants in Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore (the
Singapore operation is expected to move to neighbouring Johor State in
Malaysia): 'Either we still continue to produce in those three locations; or
by integrating and increasing the volume we reduce the cost; or we establish
a new facility in China and we discontinue those which produce in smaller
countries.'
As for technology transfer, non-Japanese Asians often accuse Japanese
investors of arrogantly refusing to pass modern technology to developing
countries or promote enough locals to management posts. This was
particularly true of Proton, the Malaysian carmaker in which Mitsubishi
Motors has a 15 per cent stake.
Japanese businessmen can barely hide their impatience at such accusations,
pointing out that technical knowhow takes time to acquire and cannot simply
be handed over like a car component. They complain of everything from a lack
of trained scientists to unstable electricity supplies.
But they acknowledge that they have been slow to move research and
development activities into Asia, and are gradually starting to do so now.
In spite of Japan's war record in Asia, and in spite of occasional disputes,
commercial relations between Japan and the rest of Asia seem to be warmer
than ever. A decade ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia;
now it exports a third more to Asia than to the US.
US trade officials look to Asia for allies when they argue with Tokyo over
Japan's trade surpluses, because, like the US, many Asian countries suffer
from severe deficits in their trade with Japan. One reason why the US finds
little sympathy in Asia is that Asian exports to Japan are increasing, and
many of those exports are Japanese branded products made outside Japan.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (9): Towards a new Far East role - Foreign
policy is in the melting pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If Japan evades the costs associated with free trade and stability, world
peace and freedom, we run the serious risk of denying ourselves our own
peace and prosperity.
'Despite the gravity of the situation, Japan's political world - which is
supposed to recognise harsh realities and steer the country in the right
direction - is at present unable to make any effective decisions at all.'
This passage from Blueprint for a New Japan, the political best-seller by
Ichiro Ozawa, the former government's backroom strategist, became painfully
relevant last month when the fourth government in the space of a year took
office, thus disrupting Japan's sensitive process of waking up to its
responsibilities in a newly unstable post-cold war era.
It is perhaps unfair to accuse Japan of not shouldering its burden, since it
has been the world's biggest provider of development aid for the past three
years. Moreover, Japan will lift its assistance budget by 1.6 per cent this
year, rather more than the overall state budget, at a time when other
leading donors are suffering from 'aid fatigue'.
Even so, the fact that until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 Japan
was spared the military or economic cost of stability is generally accepted
as an element both in its economic success and its diplomatic weakness.
While the US assured peace in Asia, partly through the presence of its
troops on Japanese soil, Japan concentrated on economic growth, a strategy
known as the Yoshida doctrine, after the prime minister who was the
architect of the post-war Japanese state. In return, Washington knew it
could count on Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia.
The US-Japan balance, the pivot of Tokyo's foreign policy, has now become
less predictable, partly because of the end of the cold war, but also
because of Japan's own vagaries.
In theory, the Social Democratic Party of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new
prime minister, wants to end the US-Japan security treatment, the staple of
Tokyo's special relationship with Washington. In practice, Mr Murayama, has
pledged to honour the treaty, reflecting the fact that he owes his position
to the support of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party.
The conservative nature of the new government may keep the special
relationship with Washington intact. But it also marks a break with the
policy, created by the previous two coalition administrations, of abandoning
Japan's passiveness in international affairs and seeking to make a greater
contribution on the world stage.
One of Mr Murayama's first acts as new leader was to tone down the campaign
to be admitted as a permanent member of the UN security council, the top
table of the world's top powers. Bafflingly for Japan's foreign partners,
this came only weeks after his predecessor, Mr Tsutomu Hata, made an
unprecedentedly explicit bid for the council seat. The Murayama
administration is also more cautious than the previous one possible
sanctions against North Korea, cause for some anxiety in Washington.
While the political storms rage overhead, Japan's professional diplomats
have been striving to keep foreign policy on course. Indeed, the frequent
changes of governments have increased their responsibilities more than is
the case for most bureaucrats.
In recent weeks, Japanese diplomats won praise from western officials by
lobbying China to obtain good behaviour from North Korea and helping to
smooth relations between the UK and China over Hong Kong. Two prominent
Japanese, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, and Mr
Yasushi Akasahi have played leading parts in Bosnia, a conflict in which
Japan's short lived governments have had no time to take an interest.
But perhaps the most sensitive task facing Japan's foreign policy makers
today is the subtle renegotiation of the relationship with the US.
The foreign ministry wants to keep the US security link as tight as ever,
yet at the same time other departments, such as the finance and
international trade and industry ministries, want to test the limits of
Japan's post-cold war freedom to be more assertive towards the US on trade
and economic issues. 'We are getting both more and less assertive towards
Washington,' says Mr Kiyoaki Kikuchi, a former ambassador to the UN.
Former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's agreement to disagree with
President Bill Clinton, at their summit in February, over US demands for
numerical targets for increases in imports to Japan, made it look as if
Japan was ready to tilt away from Washington.
It was a remarkable break with the comfortable tradition of US-Japanese
summits, in which the Tokyo side would hand over trade or economic
concessions in return for promises of everlasting protection.
Senior foreign ministry officials were, unsurprisingly, worried that the
trade row would spill over into security relations. To their relief, the
Clinton administration has softened its tone towards Japan.
The trade dispute might be under precarious control for the moment, yet it
is only the latest example of Japan's difficult search for a voice
independent of Washington.
It ignored Washington in 1990 by resuming aid to China after the Tiananmen
killings and was a persistent exponent of avoiding a link between trade and
human rights.
Japan ignored the US embargo on Vietnam two years ago and is now resisting
US pressure to step up aid to Russia because it first wants progress on the
disputed Russian-held Kurile islands north of Japan.
The common theme in these gestures of independence from the US is the
growing importance to Japan of its Asian neighbours. They represent Japan's
largest export destination, its fastest growing market and its fastest
growing destination for industrial investment.
Japan is cautiously feeling its way towards a new role in Asia. It is a
highly sensitive process, constrained by local wartime memories, which
prevent Tokyo from seeking regional leadership, and Japan's own wish not to
weaken that sacred link with Washington. 'How can we tilt towards Asia
without tilting away from the US?' muses one Japanese diplomat.
Japan's ministry of international trade and industry took an influential,
but discreet part five years ago in forming the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Forum, a grouping designed to foster economic cooperation in the
region.
But Japan has taken a low profile in Apec discussions. Its search for a
voice has not been helped by Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad's
calls for an East Asian Economic Caucus, to exclude non-Asians. Mr Mohamad's
scheme places uncomfortable pressure on Japan to do just what it wants to
avoid, choosing between the US and Asia.
So far, Tokyo has managed to suppress the dilemma thanks to an accord
between Asean countries to subsume Mr Mohamad's caucus into Apec. But Mr
Mohamad continues to criticise Japan's non-committal stance.
Japan will have an opportunity to move closer to Asia's centre stage next
year when Apec leaders are due to hold a summit for the first time in Tokyo.
Japan is, meanwhile, pushing regional cooperation on security through an
18-country Asean Regional Forum, inspired by a former Japanese foreign
minister, which will hold its first meeting in Thailand at the end of this
month.
Diplomats hope that this will at least start a regular exchange of security
information between often distrustful Asian neighbours, though the first
meeting is likely to be of merely symbolic value. The mere fact of getting
the militarily powerful China engaged in multilateral debat will be
valuable, say analysts.
The forum's Bangkok meeting will also be an indicator of the state of
Japan's regional image. Mr Hosokawa's unprecedentedly explicit apologies
last autumn for Japan's wartime record and the participation of Japanese
peacekeepers with the UN in Cambodia two years ago may have helped soothe
wartime memories.
Yet Japan's credibility was damaged by a former justice minister's claim in
May that an infamous wartime atrocity never happened; another reminder of
the constraints on Tokyo's tilt towards Asia.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (8): Like nowhere else on earth - Visitor's
guide to the principality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monaco is really little more than a smallish seaside city. Prince Rainier
rules over a country that stretches across three kilometres of rugged
Mediterranean cliff but is still one of the most popular destinations on the
Cote d'Azur.
The principality is divided into four areas. Monaco Ville, the original
heart of Monaco, is the political centre as the home of the vielle ville,
the old town, and the Grimaldis' candy-coloured palace. Monte Carlo is much
younger. It was a scrappy olive and lemon grove until the mid-19th century
when Prince Charles III, one of Prince Rainier's more imaginative ancestors,
built the famous casino and luxury hotels there.
Most of Monaco's foreign residents live in the jungle of modern apartment
blocks flung up in La Condamine, the flat area lying between the more
picturesque hills of Monte Carlo and Monaco Ville. The Monegasques
themselves occupy the cheaper housing that has been built in Fontvieille,
the strip of land to the south of Monaco Ville which was reclaimed from the
sea in the 1970s and now houses a small industrial zone.
Yet to most people Monaco is synonymous with the belle epoque glitz of Monte
Carlo. Nothing sums it up better than the Casino (tel: 9216 2121), an
extraordinary edifice designed by Charles Garnier, architect of the
Paris-Opera. The Casino merits a visit for its aesthetic excesses - from the
Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the Salle Europe which weigh more than 150
kilos, to the scantily clad women in the Galelli fresco on the ceiling of
the smoking room whose eyes are said to follow the visitor around the room -
even if you do not plan to risk frittering away your francs on the roulette
wheels or slot machines.
No superstitious gambler should go into the Casino without first wishing
themselves luck by stroking the knee of the bronze horse bearing Louis XIV
in the statue outside the Hotel de Paris (tel: 9216 3000). The hotel is
almost as elaborate as the Casino with an extraordinary bar where Monaco's
Chanel-clad residents knock back cocktails during afternoon piano sessions.
It is also the home of the Louis XV (tel: 9216 3004), one of the few
restaurants on the Cote d'Azur to boast three Michelin stars thanks to the
talent of Alain Ducasse, its young chef. Donald Trump was so impressed with
Ducasse's culinary skills that he once flew him over to Manhattan to cook a
family meal.
Anyone whose budget does not quite run to a meal at the Louis XV - let alone
to Concorde tickets for the chef - can dabble in the Trump lifestyle by
window shopping at Chanel, Valentino, Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels or any of
the other expensive shops around Place du Casino and along Boulevard des
Moulins. They can also stroll around the Casino gardens to gawp at the
stunning sea views or at the work of Cesar, the French sculptor who is the
subject of the latest summer exhibition.
There are more gardens to see in Monaco Ville, where the cliff tops have
been covered with Aleppo pines, agaves, and aloes to offer spectacular views
across the Mediterranean cliffs. The narrow streets of the vieille ville
still offer an occasional glimpse of the sleepy charm of medieval Monaco,
but most of the old town is a commercialised clutter of souvenir shops
selling Prince Rainier mugs and Casino tea-towels.
The Grimaldis' Palace (tel: 9325 1831) looks like a souvenir in itself with
its pastel pink walls and comic book battlements. The ceremonial changing of
the guard, which takes place just before noon each day, completes the
picture with the soldiers sporting black uniforms in winter and white in
summer. Day after day the Place du Palais is packed with tourists waiting to
see the soldiers or hoping for a glimpse of Prince Rainier, Princess
Caroline and the other Grimaldis.
The vieille ville is also the home of Monaco's two most interesting museums.
The Musee des Souvenirs Napoleon (tel: 9325 1831) in the southern wing of
the palace is a treasure trove of Napoleonic memorabilia with more than
1,000 of his documents and objects ranging from his socks and handkerchieves
to medals and weapons.
But the principality's main museological asset is Musee Oceonographique
(tel: 9315 3600), which was built in 1910 at the behest of Prince Albert I
and has since established itself as an important centre for scientific
research and one of Europe's best aquariums. It contains some 90 tanks of
rare fish from all over the world with stunning colours and shapes. It also
houses Prince Albert I's own collection of marine fauna and stuffed sea
creatures (including a 20-metre whale) together with models of his
laboratory ships.
The other academic curiousity in Monaco is the Jardin Exotique (tel: 9303
3365) high on the rocks above the principality. The gardens, which were
founded in 1933, now encompass more than 7,000 different types of succulent
plants including surreal cacti from central and southern America and giant
African Euphorbia. Tucked beneath the gardens is another surreal scene in
the Prehistoric Observatory Caves with their stalagmites and stalactites.
Finally, one of Monaco's main claims to fame and a fierce point of local
pride is AS Monaco, the football club which is widely regarded as one of the
most successful in France. AS Monaco has, like other European clubs,
brandished its cheque book to sign a number of imported players over the
years, including Mark Hateley and Glen Hoddle.
Similarly, no expense has been spared on its state-of-the-art stadium at
Fontvieille. The head of one foreign bank remembers sending a visiting
director from his London head office to see AS Monaco. 'All he talked about
after the match was the escalators that carry the supporters up to the
terraces,' recalls the banker. 'It was the escalators that made him realise
Monaco really isn't like anywhere else]'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (7): Newcomer finds its niche - The
principality has become an international landmark for art sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christie's, the celebrated London auction house, always knew that last
winter's sale in Monte Carlo of the contents of a Parisian apartment owned
by Hubert de Givenchy, the French fashion designer, would be a rather
special event: but it did not realise quite how special until after the
auction was over.
Givenchy had shown the same fastidious taste in furnishing his apartment as
in creating his haute couture. His rue de Grenelle apartment had contained
some exquisite examples of French painting and furnishings, including the
famous Hanover chandelier, a stunning piece in sterling silver.
Christie's had calculated that the sale of his collection should raise
between FFr100m and FFr110m. Yet the auction itself achieved a total of
FFr155m - which included a successful bid of FFr18m for the Hanover
chandelier alone.
For Humphrey Butler, head of Christie's in France, the Givenchy auction was
a prime example of the very best type of Monegasque sale. 'There's a glamour
associated with Monte Carlo which is absolutely ideal for the auction of a
very special private collection such as Hubert de Givenchy's,' he says.
'It's the sort of collection that probably sells better in Monaco than
anywhere else.'
Monte Carlo is still something of a newcomer to the art market, at least
compared to the old-established centres such as London, Geneva and New York.
The first big sale in the principality was staged in 1975 by Sotheby's,
chief competitor of Christie's, when it auctioned off the Dede de Rothschild
collection. That auction and subsequent sales were so successful that Monte
Carlo has since become a landmark on the international art dealing scene.
The merits of Monaco as an auction centre are easy to see. The location,
only a 15 minute helicopter ride away from Nice's busy international
airport, makes it easy for international dealers to fly into the
principality for special events. Sotheby's and Christie's even ensure that
they hold their six monthly sales fairly close together in June and December
to maximise attendance by foreign dealers.
Monte Carlo also offers the added frisson of a sprinkling of self-indulgent
local residents, and people driving over the borders from France and Italy.
Yet the main reason for Monaco's metamorphosis into an auction centre is the
idiosyncratic nature of the French art market, which is so tightly
restricted by anachronistic legislation that it is almost impossible for
leading international auctioneers such as Sotheby's and Christie's to hold
important sales in France.
France is the home of some of the world's finest art collections. French
painting and antique furniture is highly sought after by wealthy collectors
in other countries, notably in the US and Japan. Yet for decades the market
has been hidebound by stiff export restrictions which make it very difficult
for Sotheby's, Christie's or their international rivals to transport works
out of France to auction them in London, New York, Tokyo or Geneva.
The French government is empowered to stop any piece from leaving the
country for foreign auction by buying it at the minimum reserve price -
usually much lower than the 'hammer' price at which the auctioneer will
actually sell it. (If the piece is sold in France, the government must buy
it at the hammer price.)
However, the controls over the French market are so tight - the only people
allowed to practise as auctioneers are the small band of commissaires
priseurs, who are licensed by the justice ministry and can only apply for a
licence when an existing commissaire relinquishes one - that Sotheby's and
Christie's cannot operate in France. At the same time, the archaic nature of
the commissaire system means that the auction market is highly fragmented
and that individual auctioneers do not have the resources to stage and
market international sales on the same scale as Sotheby's or Christie's.
This state of affairs continued until 1975, when Peter Wilson, then chairman
of Sotheby's in France, decided to exploit a loophole whereby works could be
auctioned in Monaco free from the usual restrictions on foreign sales. In
other words, the French government is obliged to pay the full hammer price,
rather than the minimum reserve, if it seeks to stop French works leaving
the principality.
Monte Carlo has since become renowned for its sales of old master paintings,
antique French furniture and for other Gallic decorative specialities such
as Art Deco and Art Nouveau. It has also hosted a series of high profile
sales, including Sotheby's auction of the the Florence Gould and Claud
Cartier collections, the Christie's sales of Sir Charles Clore's furniture
and its auction last month of the contents of the Cap d'Antibes house owned
by Margaret Biddle, the wealthy American who was a leader of the Riviera
social scene in the 1940s.
The nature of the Monaco market means that it has been relatively robust
during the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The only area of the
market to have suffered is classic cars, which became a Monegasque
speciality in the 1980s (thanks to the principality's motor racing
tradition) but fizzled out in the economically depressed early 1990s.
Christie's and Sotheby's achieved well over their original estimates in last
month's Monte Carlo art auctions. The prize of the Sotheby's sale - a pair
of 18th century black lacquer corner cabinets by Bernard Van Risamburgh -
was sold for FFr5.45m, against an estimate of FFr5m.
The biggest threat to the Monegasque auction scene is not the economic
environment, but the forthcoming reforms of the French art market. In
theory, the French should have liberalised their arcane auctioneering system
with the onset of the single European market at the end of 1992. But in
practice, although proposals for change have been tabled, the system has
remained intact.
Yet even the most conservative commissaires accept that change is
inevitable. Jacques Toubon, the centre-right arts minister, has already put
forward a concrete plan for reform. 'The inflexibility of the art market
will soon be no more than a bad memory,' began a recent article in La
Tribune Desfosses, the French financial daily.
Liberalisation of the French market is almost certain to prompt the
international houses to switch some of their Monaco auctions to Paris.
Sotheby's and Christie's are already planning to do so. At the same time the
French commissaires have developed plans to band together in order to
compete more effectively against the London and New York houses.
Yet Christie's Humphrey Butler is still convinced that there will be a role
for Monaco on the auctioneering scene. 'I doubt very much that as soon as
the Paris market opens, we'll move everything there and close down in
Monaco,' he says. 'Monte Carlo serves a very particular purpose in the art
market. We may well have decided to hold a special sale like the Givenchy
there even if Paris was open to us. After all, we're all susceptible to
glamour.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (9): Healing waters of Monte Carlo -
Thalassotherapy complex rises again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the grand old Edwardian era when the cream of European high society
whiled away their summers in Monte Carlo, they spent each morning washing
away their worries about the previous night's amorous adventures or gambling
losses in the healing waters of the Sea Water Thermal Baths.
The thermal baths were a Monegasque institution which opened in 1908 after
Prince Albert I had noted the success of the sea baths at Roscoff in
Brittany.
They soon became a fashionable place where wealthy bathers could indulge in
the ancient practice of thalassotherapy, a form of healing that exploits the
soothing properties of exposure to warm water extracted from the sea.
The original baths were destroyed by a stray German bomb which fell on Monte
Carlo by accident at the beginning of the second world war. The debris was
cleared and the old baths became the site of a swimming pool for the Hotel
de Paris and Hotel Hermitage. That pool has now been closed while the
Societe des Bains de Mer, the owner of the old thermal baths, builds a brand
new FFr100m version.
Monte Carlo's new seawater baths will posit on the same thalassotherapeutic
principles as the original, whereby the body is exposed to sea water that
has been pumped from a depth of 30 metres and heated to around 35 degrees.
The temperature ensures that the microorganisms in the water, the
phytoplankton and zooplankton, stay alive to secrete antibiotic bacteria and
hormones with healing properties.
But the new baths, due to open next June, will be much more sophisticated
than the old ones.
The new complex will include two sea water swimming pools together with
seaweed cabins, sea water jet showers and a number of 'dry' treatment
facilities such as massage rooms and a gymnasium.
The complex has been designed by Dr Yves Treguer, one of France's leading
cardiology specialists and the man behind the successful Thalassotherapy
Centre at La Baule in western France.
He hopes to appeal to both people with medical conditions and to 'lay'
bathers who simply need a relaxing respite from their stressed-out lives.
Societe des Bains de Mer, which has been struck by the recent revival of
interest in thalassotherapy, hopes that its new Sea Water Thermal Baths will
enable it to challenge the established centres at La Baule, Biarritz and
Saint Malo: just as the old baths helped Monte Carlo to rival Roscoff in the
early years of the century.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (7): The bubble that burst - Finance houses
start to pick up the pieces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last few years have revealed a simple but unpalatable truth about
Japan's financial institutions. Though they rank as the largest companies of
their sector in the world by almost any measure, their strength was never
commensurate with their size.
Banks and brokers have been brought low by the bursting of the bubble that
inflated them in the late 1980s. Both look set for a long period of
reconstruction.
The banks boast that the last year was a watershed in the struggle to
discharge the bad loans of the bubble period. In their annual reports for
the year ended March 31 in May, most of the major city banks, trust banks,
and long-term credit banks declared that the worst of the problems were
over. All 21 banks announced sharp falls in profits as a result of heavy
provisioning for bad debts.
As Mr Kensuke Uchida, director for corporate planning at Sumitomo Bank puts
it: 'Our policy of provisioning for bad debts means that this year will mark
the end of the adjustment process.'
The main piece of evidence to support the claim is that total disclosed
nonperforming loans actually declined from September 1993, implying that
last autumn banks scaled the peak of the bad debt mountain. But more
important is the fact that the banks' loan loss reserves surged as the
companies finally grasped the bad loans nettle.
Declared non-performing loans now stand at a total of Y12.5 trillion, with
specific loan loss reserves at Y3 trillion. Banks have thus now made bad
loan provisions for 24 per cent of the total of disclosed nonperforming
loans, up from 16 per cent last year. This is a significant step in the
clearing up process and if it told the whole story would be an encouraging
development.
But it is, of course, only part of the overall picture. Banks' disclosed
nonperforming loans include only those to bankrupt borrowers and those on
which no interest has been paid for six months or more. They do not include
'restructured' loans, where interest rates have been pared to the bone to
keep troubled borrowers alive. Last month Mitsubishi Bank gave the first
tantalising glimpse of the real scale of the problem when it became the only
Japanese bank to release its accounts under US accounting rules. They showed
nonperforming loans to be twice the level declared in Japan.
Furthermore, even some of the improvement recorded in the figures for last
year is illusory. Last year banks sold Y3.3 trillion of their worst loans to
a newly established institution, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Council
(CCPC). The CCPC helps banks 'dispose' of their bad loans by buying them at
a discount. The banks write off the remaining charge.
But the banks have to lend the money to the CCPC to enable it to buy the
loans in the first place, so the risk, if the CCPC fails to dispose of the
collateral, remains with the banks. The really bad news is that so far the
CCPC has collected just one per cent of the value of the loans it has
bought. And the average discount at which the CCPC buys the loans has been
increasing sharply - last month it reached over 70 per cent. If it fails to
dispose of the loans it has bought, the banks will have further provisioning
to do.
These two factors lead most analysts to estimate that Japanese banks' actual
total problem loans are roughly twice the disclosed amount - more than Y25
trillion, or at least 6 per cent of total loans. That will require
significantly higher write-offs, and, consequently, several more years of
sluggish profits.
According to IBCA, the bank credit-rating agency, 'it will take another two
or three years for the average bank to clean up its balance sheet by using
operating profits and hidden reserves'.
But perhaps even more disturbing for the longer term is a growing weakness
in the banks' underlying performance. Pre-provision operating profit
declined for the first time in three years last year as interest rates fell
close to the bottom of the current cycle, and non-interest-related revenue
registered sharp falls in profits from forex and bond dealing.
In fact, stripping away the various layers that disguise the weakness of the
core performance, the only source of profits from which to offset the large
loan loss provisions remains sales of equities. Once again the major banks
are forced to rely on a rising stock market to support their profitability.
At least the country's four major stockbrokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and
Nikko - managed to record increases in pretax profits last year. But the
earnings recovery was weak, and from an unprecedentedly low base Nomura, the
largest stockbroker in the world, saw pretax profits rise to nearly Y50bn,
down from almost Y500bn in 1989-90.
But for the middle-sized and smaller brokers it was another difficult year.
Nearly half of all brokers listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange recorded pretax losses. The principal problem they face is heavy
dependence on equity commissions. Even the Big Four earn a third of their
operating revenue in this way. For many of the smaller firms the figure is
over 50 per cent.
They are thus heavily vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of investor interest
in the market. The last year has seen daily turnover on the TSE recovering
slightly from post-bubble blues, but at 368m shares per day, it is still
nearly 100m shares per day lower than the break even point for most brokers.
Getting that breakeven point down has been the key task for most, and
cost-cutting has been carried further in the sector than in most other parts
of the economy. Staff levels for the industry are down by 22 per cent to
129,000 from the peak of 167,000 in 1991.
The need to cut costs is made more urgent by the threat posed by
deregulation. In the last year, three banks have established broking
subsidiaries and later this year a further half dozen are expected to do so.
Though the banks are prohibited from trading equities, their underwriting
buiness is eating into the brokers' revenue base.
The large banks and brokers have sufficient capital to see themselves
through several more years of difficulties. But some smaller banks and
brokers have very little room for manoeuvre. The Ministry of Finance is
anxious to avoid collapses and is likely to try to organise a rescue through
merger should a failure come.
But this approach is itself symptomatic of Japan's problems. The financial
institutions have operated for too long on the assumption that they would
not be allowed to fail - hardly a major incentive to greater efficiency.
They claim that current problems are merely the backwash of the collapse of
the bubble economy.
But as the excesses of the 1980s recede further into the past, the truth is
that many companies never were world-class competitors. The last few
difficult years have merely exacerbated their problems; they did not create
them.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (6): Thirty percent and rising - Nuclear
power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the heat and humidity soar in the sweltering Japanese summer, electricity
companies have to shift gear to keep up with demand. Air-conditioners,
refrigerators and juice extractors make life more comfortable for those who
can afford them, but put a huge extra burden on generating capacity.
With energy use climbing steadily and no natural fuel resources of its own,
Japan has long put its faith in nuclear power, a policy reinforced by the
oil crises of the 1970s. More recently, the government and the nuclear
industry have gone to great lengths to win the population over to the idea
of yet more energy from uranium and plutonium.
Already accounting for 30 per cent of electricity generation - the country
has 46 nuclear power plants with seven more on the way - the scale of the
nuclear commitment is set to rise further.
Yet several factors have combined to slow down the nuclear energy drive.
Concern over nuclear proliferation, especially after North Korea's
reluctance to allow international inspection, has focused foreign attention
on Japan's technological prowess in the nuclear field, despite protestations
from Tokyo that it has no intention of using plutonium to make weapons.
Japan's growing environmental consciousness is also playing a role. So is
the fact that uranium, used in the present light water reactors, looks
likely to be in plentiful supply for many years. Thus the government has
just decided to hold back on further development of the fast breeder reactor
(FBR) programme, based on plutonium, and on building a second nuclear fuel
reprocessing plant.
This plant, on which a decision will not now be taken until 2010, would
follow one being built some 700km north-east of Tokyo in an area of lush
fields and low hills near the town of Masawa at a cost of Y1,250bn (Dollars
12.5bn). Chattering school children and attentive adults tour the visitors'
centre at the Rokkasho reprocessing and waste disposal plant near the
Pacific coast.
In the smartly designed centre, the workings of the facility are
demonstrated - from the treatment of spent fuel and the enrichment of
uranium to the storage of radioactive waste. A smiling hostess points to a
display of yellow drums in which low-level waste from power stations will be
buried in concrete; some 3m drums will eventually be stored.
Although the Japanese people broadly accept the case for nuclear energy,
they have reservations. The government says 70 per cent believe in its
necessity but only 40 per cent think it is safe. Also, said a recent report
by a nuclear advisory sub-committee of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (Miti), 'the public has a low degree of confidence in
information on nuclear power generation provided by the government and
electric utilities'.
The 7.5m sq m Rokkasho site, partly completed and partly a hive of
round-the-clock construction activity with tall cranes piercing the skyline,
is central to the government's aim of providing security of energy supply
for resource-poor Japan. The enrichment facility, in which the concentration
of heat-generating U-235 is increased, is building up its operations, while
the first huge pit for storing the drums is now in use.
Reprocessing will not start until around 2002, also a slight delay. But
Rokkasho is already a symbol of both the nuclear industry's ambitions and
the concern in and outside Japan over how far it intends to go down the
nuclear road. Despite constant reassurances from Tokyo, suspicions about the
possibility that the country may one day build nuclear weapons persist.
It certainly has the skills to do so. Even the previous prime minister, Mr
Tsutomu Hata, whose minority government collapsed last month, admitted as
much. Yet anyone who has visited the Peace Museum at Hiroshima with its
horrific exhibits from August 1945 when Japan became the only country to
suffer atomic bombing, will understand its reluctance to enter the nuclear
arms race. 'We have to show foreign countries how we are keeping to peaceful
uses of nuclear power,' says Mr Teruaki Masumoto, head of communications at
Tokyo Electric.
The overseas concern, especially in the US, has arisen mainly over Japan's
nuclear fuel cycle policy - with uranium reused after spent fuel is
reprocessed - which would result in the production of plutonium, which could
be used to make nuclear weapons. 'The idea that surplus plutonium could be
used to make a bomb is very controversial,' admits Mr Harushige Takeuchi, a
general manager at Rokkasho. 'Japan has no intention of doing that; the
point is to use the nuclear fuel resources in the most practical and
economic way.' Officials at Miti echo this. But while stressing the absence
of military ambitions, they argue that Japan's nuclear policy is vital to
secure long-term electricity supply in a country which is a voracious
consumer of energy.
Japan used to be heavily dependent on imported oil, which accounted for
around 70 per cent of its needs. Today, this is down to some 30 per cent. At
Tokyo Electric, the share of electricity produced from nuclear power units,
of which it has 15, is set to rise to 43 per cent in 2003 from 37 per cent
last year.
The company appears unworried about the FBR delay. The Y600bn Monju
prototype facility has now begun operations after technical problems. But
commercial use of fast breeders has been postponed by 10 years to 2030, with
the planned demonstration plant (to be built by industry) put off from the
late 1990s to early in the next century.
The slowdown in policy will lessen the supply of plutonium and should thus
abate concern over non-peaceful uses. But Tokyo Electric's Mr Masumoto
thinks the FBR will eventually go ahead. 'No-one knows if a third oil shock
will come. We have to prepare something as insurance.' So while the FBR
programme is on hold, R&amp;D work will carry on at full stretch.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (6): Mediterranean rendezvous - Driving in
and around Monaco is a treat in itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the nicest things about Monaco is its location: clinging to a cliff
on the picturesque Mediterranean with the Italian coast to the east and the
French riviera to the west.
The idea of being able to drive over the border for dinner in a foreign
country is always appealing. Nice, Cannes and Genoa are all within easy
reach. But if you tire of the glitz and gloss of Monte Carlo, there is also
the option of visiting some of the smaller towns and villages along the Cote
d'Azur and inland in rural Provence.
Driving in and around Monaco is a treat in itself thanks to the spectacular
views offered from the the corniches, or coastal roads, which run through
the principality from Nice to Menton. There are three corniches - high,
medium and low depending on the height at which they perch on the
cliffsides. All three are familiar settings from car commercials and Cote
d'Azur movie car chases.
Roquebrune is the first place you come to when leaving Monaco on the western
corniche. It is a 15th century village built around an 11th century castle
complete with a mock medieval tower added by an eccentric English owner in
the 1920s. The village has been colonised by souvenir shops and is now
something of a tourist trap, although the charm of its narrow alleys and
stairways is still apparent when the shops close down at night.
The coastline to the west of Roquebrune is accessible only by foot and
offers a stunning shoreline walk past the white rocks and pine trees of Cap
Martin. The path is called Le Corbusier after the famous modernist architect
who drowned there in the mid-1960s while staying at a house owned by the
Anglo-Irish designer, Eileen Gray.
The next stop after Cap Martin is Menton, the sunny seaside town nestling in
mountains and lemon groves which is, in many ways, a more subdued version of
Monaco. Menton and Roquebrune both belonged to Monaco until the mid-19th
century when they declared their independence. The then Prince of Monaco was
stoned on the streets when he came to reclaim them and later sold them off
to France for FFr4m.
Menton, like Monaco, has an Italianate vieille ville, or old town, with
candy-coloured houses and pretty little chapels. It also sports one of the
most sought-after Salle des Mariages, or register offices, in France
(tel:9357 8787) decorated by Jean Cocteau, the surrealist artist. Cocteau
not only filled the walls with friezes of love stories - from a Saracen
wedding party, to Orpheus and Eurydice - but even carpeted the floor with a
mock-panther skin.
Cocteau also created his own museum for Menton, the Musee Jean Cocteau
(tel:9357 7230), which lies between the vieille ville and the old port. It
houses a fine collection of his drawings, paintings, writing, stage and film
sets.
The corniches to the east of Monaco are also well worth exploring. The
hilltop village of Eze looks wonderful from a distance, with its medieval
houses and churches winding around the natural fortress of its hill. But on
closer inspection it is even kitscher than Roquebrune with a clutter of
souvenir shops and overpriced antique dealers.
Beaulieu, the next town along the coast, has the same sleepy air as Menton.
Its main attractions are the recently renovated Art Deco casino and the
idiosyncratic Villa Kerylos, a replica of a classical Greek villa built in
the early years of this century for Theodore Reinach, an archaeologist who
lived there for 20 years in the same style and dress as an ancient Athenian.
The other coastline folly is Fondation Ephrussi de Rothschild (tel:9301
3399) which perches high above the nouveau riche holiday homes of Cap Ferrat
to house the collections of art and furniture hoarded by the eponymous
Baroness de Rothschild. The baroness, like Theodore Reinach, had a penchant
for ancient Greece. Her pastel pink villa is cluttered with classical
columns, as well as vestiges of almost every period from Tiepolo frescoes,
to Louis XIV furniture and a tiny lover's room tucked away on the ground
floor.
Jean Cocteau crops up again in Villefranche-sur-Mer, yet another picturesque
fishing village to have fallen victim to souvenir shops and tourist traps.
But Villefranche does boast the Chapelle Saint-Pierre, a tiny 14th century
seafront chapel where Cocteau covered the interior walls with abstract
fantasies of Saint Peter frolicking with the Camargue gypsies.
Nice itself is filled with museums and restaurants. The nearby town of
Cagnes is now a jumble of modern villas but was once the home of the
painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir. His house has been turned into a museum, the
Musee Renoir (tel:9320 6107), which contains his old studio as well as some
of the paintings he did there and pieces by friends, such as Bonnard and
Dufy.
Then there is Saint-Paul-de-Vence, another pretty Provencal hill village
transmogrified into a tourist trap, where the Fondation Maeght (tel:9332
8163) offers one of the best collections of modern art in southern France
with works by Giacometti, Arp and Miro. The foundation, which was created by
a family of Paris art dealers, also stages temporary shows the latest of
which is a Georges Braque exhibition that runs until the autumn.
The last port of call before a longish drive back to Monaco could be La
Colombe d'Or (tel:9332 8002), the Saint-Paul restaurant run by the Roux
family since the 1920s where local artists paid for their meals with their
work. Luckily for the Roux the 'locals' included Picasso, Braque, Chagall
and Miro not to mention Fernand Leger, whose frieze decks the restaurant
terrace, and Alexander Calder, who made a mobile to bob above the swimming
pool.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (5): Golden triangle's glitter dims - The
property market has fared better than those of its neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a villa for sale in Monaco, the Villa Fauvette, which boasts no
fewer than six bedrooms, five bathrooms, balconies outside, marble floors
inside, gardens and terraces all around with a sweet little summer house
perched on its roof. The price is FFr15m, or just under Dollars 2.7m.
Villa Fauvette is a very special property. It is one of the handful of belle
epoque townhouses, or hotels particuliers built in the late 19th century to
house Monaco's wealthy residents and visitors, to have survived the
principality's post-war building boom.
If a suitable buyer appears Villa Fauvette will be handed over intact. But
the owners have another option. They could always sell the property to a
developer who, thanks to the scarcity of land in Monaco, would probably be
prepared to pay almost as much as the FFr15m purchase price. Villa Fauvette
would then become the latest in the long line of belle epoque relics to be
demolished to make way for yet another new apartment block.
Anyone glancing at the dozens of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs festooned
across the facades of Monaco's apartments, shops and offices could be
forgiven for thinking that there was no shortage of property already on the
market. The local property industry has been affected by the downturn that
has depressed the European market in recent years. Yet the idiosyncratic
nature of the Monegasque market - dominated by a small number of powerful
property owners and a high proportion of rich, relatively recession-proof
private clients - has enabled it to withstand the recession rather better
than its counterparts in other countries, notably in neighbouring France and
Italy.
The dearth of land, where sites for new development are so scarce that one
of the biggest projects is the construction of a new underground railway
station so that apartments can be built on top, has always ensured that
there is strong demand for unusual properties on prime sites such as Villa
Fauvette.
The seeds of the Monegasque property market were sewn in the early 1970s by
Prince Rainier and Gildo Pastor, the multimillionaire developer. They
presided over a building boom that filled most of the principality's
available sites together with reclaimed land in the 1970s and 1980s.
The price of Monegasque property escalated sharply with the cost of new
apartments rising from around FFr3,000 a square metre in 1971, according to
industry estimates, to FFr10,000 in 1980 and to FFr70,000 at the market's
peak in 1990. Prices in the golden triangle of Monte Carlo (in the area
around the Casino and the Hotel de Paris) rose even higher to anything
between FFr100,000 and FFr125,000 a square metre, which made them roughly
comparable to the most expensive parts of Paris.
Prices have since weakened. 'The Monaco property market has certainly been
affected by the economic recession,' says Yves Max, chief executive of
Credit Foncier de Monaco, one of the biggest banks in the principality with
interests in the property sector. 'But the downturn has not lasted as long,
nor has it been as strong as in other parts of the Cote d'Azur such as Nice
or Cannes.'
Mr Max estimates that the average price of residential property has fallen
by 'between 10 and 20 per cent' since its 1990 peak. Commercial prices have
probably fallen further, but that represents a relatively small part of the
Monegasque market. The speculation of the 1980s, whereby apartments would be
sold from the plans and resold several times before they had actually been
built, has fizzled out. Yet the upper end of the residential sector has
remained robust, particularly in the most expensive areas such as the golden
triangle where prices have barely changed despite the recession.
One of the main reasons for the market's comparative stability is the
presence of a handful of solid, local investors notably the Pastor group
(now run by Gildo Pastor's sons, Michel and Victor) and Societe des Bains de
Mer (SBM), the state-controlled hotel and casino operator. These companies
have a long-term commitment to Monaco. It is scarcely in their interest to
depress the market by dumping properties through panic selling. Further,
they are exactly the type of large, well-established businesses that can
afford a long-term approach to investment.
Similarly Monaco's wealthy residents have been spared the worst of the
recession. Many are affluent enough to have been able to hold on to their
old properties, rather than risk selling them at low prices. Finally, the
level of construction activity has slowed down, partly in response to the
recession and partly because of the land shortage.
As a result the market has already responded to the easing of recessionary
pressures in Europe. Local estate agents say that the price of new
residential property has returned to around FFr60,000 a square metre, just
below its peak in the late 1980s.
'We've definitely seen an increase in demand for residential property in
Monaco,' says Betty Bloom, director of the SPA Property Agency, which
specialises in the South of France and is the agent for Villa Fauvette.
'There's tremendous interest from Italians, but also from Germans, the
British and even from a few very rich Russians who have come on to the
market.'
The recent rise in Monegasque property prices reflects a general improvement
across the Riviera, but the idiosyncrasies of the local market coupled with
the particular attractions of the principality have ensured that the
recovery was faster there.
'No-one ever mentions tax, but it's obviously a major factor in drawing
people to Monaco,' says Ms Bloom. 'It's also a safe, clean and politically
stable place to live. Monaco is more popular than other Riviera towns, even
though you could buy a lovely property in a pretty part of Antibes for half
the price you'd pay in Monaco.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (5): Yes, we have no bananas - A look at the
potential for more de-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When The Body Shop wanted to sell in Japan shampoo made from bananas, it
took one-and-a-half years to get the necessary approvals. 'They never
thought of bananas as an ingredient,' says Mrs Mitsu Kimata, head of the UK
company's operation in Japan, about the attitude of Ministry of Health and
Welfare officials.
Water melons are also not on the approved list of cosmetic ingredients. So
bringing in a sun-care product made from this fruit is also taking time. 'I
hope we can get it next summer, but it was developed last year.' Not
surprisingly, she adds: 'Japan is one of the most restrictive countries that
Body Shop operates in.'
The complaint is echoed by a host of foreign, and many local, companies in
Japan. Despite government initiatives to promote deregulation - the latest
was announced last month - there is scepticism about the pace of change,
especially now the government has changed yet again. 'It'll take light
years,' says Mr Peter Woods, president of Rover Japan, about the prospects
for progress.
A recent survey of foreign companies in Japan, of which there are more than
3,000, showed that 58 per cent thought it was more difficult to operate
there than in other advanced countries. The extreme cost of land and rents
was the main reason, followed by high prices of goods - generally twice as
high as in other industrialised countries - and the number of government
regulations. However, the survey by LBS, a firm which provides services to
non-Japanese companies, did find that 39 per cent of respondents felt it had
become easier to do business in Japan.
But the progress of deregulation was well down the list of reasons for this.
Companies felt instead that more goodwill was now being shown to outsiders,
while they had developed a better understanding of Japanese business
customs. Either way, said Mr Homare Takenaka, a senior managing director at
IBM Japan (which helped set up LBS), in the survey's foreword, 'the Japanese
market as seen from foreign eyes is still fraught with many obstacles in the
form of regulations and puzzling business practices.'
The latest government package promised action on 279 regulations. These
cover housing and land, telecommunications and financial markets, as well as
the acceptance of foreign inspection data and standards for more imports.
There are more than 10,000 regulations inhibiting an estimated 40 per cent
of the economy. Former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa last year
launched a five-year campaign to sweep away this forest of rules after
previous governments had failed to reduce them.
Japan's bureaucratic system served the country well as the economy recovered
and grew after World War Two. 'The Japanese system has been built on the
philosophy that this is a country poor in resources but rich in people,'
says Mr Takenaka. But growth has changed all that. 'Now, we are at an
economic stage where Japan is not poor. It should be more open to foreign
companies and people, more free. But the historical heritage remains as a
barrier.'
One area where Japan has been most heavily criticised is car imports, still
only accounting for 5 per cent of the total market. For years, foreign makes
were hindered by high tariffs and a raft of regulations. The tariffs have
gone and it is much easier to sell foreign cars; the streets of Tokyo are
full of them. Helped by the strong yen, car imports have soared this year.
But there are still big hindrances, says Mr Woods. 'The Japanese are rather
consistent, stubborn and rather networked.' The Ministry of Transport is
slow to change its rules - especially on inspection - and has to be
persuaded, even if the pressure is coming from high political level; some
politicians, pursuing special interests, obstruct attempts to free up the
system.
Also, there are informal rules which are hard for outsiders to comprehend.
'Guidelines are operated which are almost not written. There is a tremendous
level of power in the hands of the bureaucrats.' This they will not give up
lightly. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of the Honda car company, notes:
'Everybody talks of deregulation - but if it is implemented full-scale,
there will be a lot of lay-offs among bureaucrats and civil servants.'
The high level of regulation keeps prices high. Japanese workers at Honda
making the same cars as its workers in the US earn more at the current yen
rate. 'Yet the standards of living enjoyed by the Japanese workers are far
below those enjoyed by the Americans.'
The experience of The Body Shop shows how regulations keep up costs.
Currently, it can sell less than 70 per cent of the full range of products
in Japan. Mrs Kimata hopes to raise this to 85 per cent next year. If
ingredients - such as exotic fruits or oils - are not on the ministry's
approved list for cosmetics, there are delays due to testing (for which the
company pays).
She hopes deregulation will ease the way for Body Shop products and make
them cheaper. But many Japanese companies would benefit, too. 'Deregulation
will create new businesses,' believes Mr Masaya Miyoshi, director general of
the Keidanren, the business federation. 'Companies, citizens and customers
will be encouraged to think about their own responsibilities. Finally, we
will get away from the umbrella government.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (4): It's tough at the top - Industry is
worried about its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the rest of the world, Japan still seems an unstoppable economic
leviathan which dominates many industrial markets, has a huge trade surplus
 -especially with the protesting US - and cultivates a work ethic superior
to that of most competing countries.
But while its products remain successful and its people hard-working and
disciplined, the picture is very different when seen from inside. Japan's
high costs and strong currency, which last month forced the dollar below
Y100, have put hurdles in the way of its continued industrial progress.
Industrialists and economists talk constantly about the potential 'hollowing
out' of Japanese industry as it opens more operations in lower-cost
countries in North America, Europe and South-east Asia. Big companies are
striving to make their employees more flexible and productive by
restructuring operations to cut costs and increase efficiency without
sacrificing lifetime employment and destroying loyalty and motivation.
It is proving tough. After investing heavily to meet demand during the
expanding 'bubble' economy of the late 1980s, many companies have too much
capacity.
'After the bubble, corporations faced a huge cost burden as they had
expanded too much,' says Haruo Shimada, economics professor at Keio
University. They have cut down on recruiting, leaving a trail of disaffected
graduates, and eased back sharply on pay. Many are also trying to move away
from the tradition of pay by seniority rather than merit and ensure that
able managers move faster up the ladder.
Making workers redundant to cut costs is virtually unheard of in
consensus-minded Japan. Not only is it culturally unacceptable, and legally
awkward, but some companies fear they may be short of labour again once the
economy picks up. Even so, workforces are being reduced as companies do not
replace those who leave.
'Japanese management is facing a huge challenge,' says Mr Masaya Miyoshi,
director general of the Keidanren, the Japanese business federation. 'The
system needs overhauling.' Some companies are taking tough action within the
constraints of the Japanese system. In cars and computers, Honda and Fujitsu
are shaking up their management structures, looking at every aspect of their
operations and trying to inject a more entrepreneurial spirit into them.
'It's not enough just to cut the workforce,' says Toru Katsurada, a director
of Fujitsu, which made a loss in 1992 but is now back in profit. 'We need to
review every business we are in.' The Nissan car company has even taken the
bold step of closing its plant at Zama to concentrate output in newer
facilities. But the closure is being spread over two years and the 2,000
production workers shifted to other sites; no-one is being laid off.
Nissan's plan is to cut costs by Y200bn (Dollars 2bn) up to 1996, much of it
by sharing more components between different models. Honda, Toyota and Mazda
are also rationalising the way they build cars. About 50 per cent of the
parts used in Honda's newest Accord family car are shared with the previous
model or with others in the range; previously, it was only 10 per cent.
This amounts to a big saving. But Honda is also trying to revitalise its
management by moving aside people who do not progress fast enough and
introducing performance-based pay. This is vital, says Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto,
Honda's president, if it is to move with the times. 'We are trying to cope
with the problem of the decline in Japan's competitiveness in world markets
due to the high yen and political issues.' The latter mainly concern US
attempts to persuade the Japanese industry to buy more parts there.
As Mr Kawamoto points out, many of the steps being taken by companies like
Honda go against the traditions built up in growth-conscious Japan after
World War Two. Until the post-bubble recession, companies prized their keen
and productive employees who in turn valued their lifetime connections with
an employer who gave them a sense of belonging and security.
But in these harsher times, companies need to become more flexible and their
operations more transparent. 'The traditional Japanese system is now in
direct conflict with the competitiveness-oriented system of the western
world,' adds Mr Kawamoto. Younger Japanese are more in tune with western
ways of living and working. So the actions of companies like Honda have to
take their aspirations and abilities into account.
Therefore,' says Mr Kawamoto, 'we have to survive through this period of
harsh competition and yet maintain the good features of the Japanese
tradition. We want to give the next generation something to hope for.' In
the opinion of Mr Shintaro Hori, managing director of the Bain consultancy
in Japan, this virtually means two companies in one. 'Honda needs a young,
motivated, fast track, performance-oriented company and another more
middle-aged, balanced, judgment-oriented company. If it can keep this
balance, then it has a great advantage.'
In the case of such globally-minded industries as cars and computers, this
may work. Mr Matthew Ruddick, car analyst at stockbroker James Capel Pacific
in Tokyo, believes the cost-cutting activities of the car companies will
benefit profits considerably. 'There is good reason to be optimistic about
the automotive industry.'
Even if the market improves, though, there will still be a surplus of jobs
and capacity. But reinvigorating Japanese industry as a whole, without
destroying the social and cultural values which helped it become successful,
is far more challenging. For one thing, much of the Japanese economy is
highly regulated which keeps up costs and hinders competition; moves to
change this are proceeding slowly. Also, notes Mr Shimada, 'we have a lot of
inefficient sectors'. He reckons only a third of manufacturing industry is
competitive in world terms, while large areas like construction, transport
and distribution have high costs and low productivity.
He adds, ominously: 'If companies and the government don't take drastic
reforming action, we'll be pulled into a declining scenario year after
year.' More operations will be carried out abroad and Japan's steadily
rising standard of living and ability to create jobs will be threatened
further. Not all see the future in such stark terms. But even the
Keidanren's Mr Miyoshi believes the pessimists among Japanese industry are
currently in the majority - 'by hunch, I would say 60 per cent pessimists
and 40 per cent optimists. I'm right in the middle.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (3): Catering for leisure seekers - Societe
des Bains de Mer is a Monegasque institution
</HEADLINE>

You could stay at the sumptuous Hotel de Paris and treat yourself to a
three-star meal at the Louis XV restaurant. You might risk some chips at the
Monte Carlo casino and stop for a cocktail on the terrace of the Cafe de
Paris before dancing the rest of the night away at Le Jimmy'z night club.
If you did all this you could spend a couple of days in Monaco - and a very
pleasant few days at that - without ever leaving the properties owned by the
Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the quaintly named leisure company which is
by far the biggest single business in the principality.
SBM is more than a business, it is a Monegasque institution. It is not only
the largest commercial concern in Monaco (with sales of FFr1.75bn in its
last audited financial year to March 30 1993) but is also the largest
employer with a workforce of 2,600 in a country with a population of 30,000.
Although SBM is a publicly-quoted company with shares listed on the Paris
stock exchange, its ownership is dominated by the state. The Monaco
government has owned 70 per cent of the group since 1966 when it bought all
the shares amassed by Aristotle Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate who was
one of the most profligate players at the Monte Carlo casino. Onassis had
for years been buying up small stakes in SBM until eventually he had control
and Prince Rainier decided the government should buy him out.
Yet the relationship between SBM and the Monegasque state goes back far
further than the mid-1960s. The company traces its roots to 1863 when Prince
Charles III gave a 50-year licence to operate a casino in Monte Carlo to
Francois Blanc, who had turned the Bavarian town of Bad Homburg into a
glamorous gambling centre.
Francois Blanc was charged with creating a casino and an hotel in Monte
Carlo, which was then a delapidated olive grove on the hill opposite the
royal palace. His company was christened, Societe Anonyme des Bains de Mer
et du Cercle des Etrangers, or the sea bathing society and circle of
strangers, as a euphemism to throw the French authorities off the scent in
case they objected to Monaco's newfound zest for gambling.
SBM has continued the practice of combining hotel ownership with casino
operation. Its interests, which occupy a twelfth of the land in Monaco,
include the Hermitage, Mirabeau and Monte Carlo Beach hotels, as well as the
Hotel de Paris, together with the Opera, Sun Casino and the sporting, golf
and country clubs.
Raoul Biancheri, the present chairman, insists that the SBM will not deviate
from its traditional role. 'Diversification isn't anything that we know
about or are interested in,' he says. 'Our expertise lies in owning and
operating casinos and hotels here in Monaco. That's what we're good at.'
The company's cautious attitude towards expansion is possibly reinforced by
the memory of its unsuccessful investment in Baudouin, a Paris stockbroker
that collapsed in the late 1980s. Yet Mr Biancheri also rules out the less
dramatic option of investing in hotels and casinos outside the principality.
'We're prohibited by our company statutes from becoming involved with
gambling outside Monaco,' he says. 'It may be that a similar restriction
applies to hotels. I don't know. But we're not a hotel and leisure company
in the conventional sense. We really do have a very particular
specialisation.'
SBM has instead been investing heavily in its existing interests. It started
to do so after a painful period in the mid-1980s when its profits fell,
reflecting heavy losses at the casinos and low occupancy rates at the hotels
which were then regarded as loss leaders for its gambling interests.
The group embarked on an upgrading programme, beginning by luring Alain
Ducasse, one of France's young superstar chefs, to the Hotel de Paris where
he has since won three Michelin stars for the Louis XV restaurant.
It has just completed a three-year investment scheme that included
refurbishing the Hotel de Paris and the Hermitage, rebuilding most of the
Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel and opening a new gaming room on the ground floor of
the Cafe de Paris.
SBM is now building a FFr100m new thalassotherapy centre, due to open next
June. It is also considering plans for a brand new luxury hotel on the
Larvotto peninsula, which would have 300 rooms and, possibly, a small casino
in a project costing between FFr600m and FFr700m.
Despite these investments SBM has not emerged unscathed from the economic
recession of the past few years, although Mr Biancheri is convinced that the
group would have fared even worse without them. SBM reported a fall in net
profits to FFr171m for the year to March 30 from FFr229m in the previous
year. Its audited accounts for the 1993/94 financial year are not yet
available. However, Mr Biancheri confirmed that hotel occupancy fell
slightly during the year as did gambling receipts.
One consolation is that the occupancy rate at the SBM hotels is still higher
than those of other Monaco establishments at around 54 per cent against 48
per cent. Similarly, its occupancy levels have not fallen as far during the
recession, which would appear to endorse its strategy of upgrading its
interests to stay at the top of the market.
Moreover, Mr Biancheri says that business has picked up since the start of
1994 as the economic strains have eased.
'There's definitely been an improvement in trading since the start of this
year,' he says. 'Hopefully we'll soon return to our normal level of
activity. We also ought to reap the rewards of our recent investments. We've
sewn the seeds. Let's see how they grow.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (4): Talking business is a big industry -
Chilly economic climate and French franc's rise hits tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few days ago a crowd of Flintstone fans crowded into the open-air
cinema at Monte Carlo to watch Fred, Wilma, Barney and their fellow
characters caper around in the movie version of The Flintstones; the smash
hit at the US box office this summer.
The Flintstones - La Famille Pierreafeu, as they are called in France - has
not yet opened for general release in Europe. It was screened as an al
fresco preview in Monaco this weekend as part of a summer season of English
language films at the open-air cinema. The special showing of The
Flintstones is only one of the attractions with which the Monegasques hope
to persuade more people to visit the principality at a time when the
European tourist industry is emerging from the recession.
Monaco remained relatively resilient to the downturn in tourism until autumn
1992, when the combination of the chilly economic climate and the French
franc's rise after the European currency crisis, triggered a steep decline
in the number of visitors.
Last year the full effect of the downturn became apparent. The number of
foreign tourists, which had been fairly stable at about 240,000 a year
during the late 1980s and early 1990s, fell sharply, Monaco Government
Tourism and Convention Office figures show a drop of just over 15 per cent
to 208,206 in 1993, from 245,592 in 1992.
One difficulty was an acceleration of the fall in the number of French
visitors, which had been in decline since the late 1980s. The French
recession deepened last year, with a devastating effect on foreign travel
and leisure expenditure. As a result the number of French visitors to Monaco
fell to 35,359 in 1993 from 41,352 in 1992. Tourism from the US, UK and
Germany was also down during the year.
Yet the chief problem for the Monegasques was a dramatic downturn in the
influx of visitors from neighbouring Italy, which had emerged as its single
biggest source of tourism in the 1980s when it ousted France from pole
position. The number of Italian visitors rose each year in succession from
43,169 in 1984 to peak at 86,097 in 1992. It plummeted to 67,727 in 1993.
'It's easy to see why Italian tourism was down so significantly,' says Raoul
Biancheri, chairman of Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the largest leisure
group in the principality, which owns the Monte Carlo Casino together with
the Hotel Hermitage and Hotel de Paris. 'There has been a great deal of
political instability in Italy for the past two years. Then there was the
anti-corruption drive and also the economic downturn culminating in the
devaluation of the lire.'
Yet the overall impact of the decline in the number of visitors has not been
quite so damaging to the Monegasque economy (which depends on tourism for
about a quarter of its gross domestic product) as the bald statistics
suggest.
The most depressed area of the tourist industry has been the least lucrative
 -the day trippers who pour across the borders from France and Italy. These
casual visitors provide a useful source of revenue for the principality's
cafes, souvenir shops, slot machines and tourist attractions. But their
absence has little impact on the more profitable part of the tourist
business - the luxury hotels, Michelin-starred restaurants, designer fashion
shops and exclusive gaming rooms.
The official figures do not identify the total number of day trippers but
they show that while the total number of visitors declined by 15 per cent to
208,206 from 245,592, the number of overnight stays fell at the lower rate
of less than 13 per cent to 601,111 from 698,047.
Similarly, although the overall rate of hotel occupancy was 7.2 per cent
lower at 48.3 per cent for 1993 against 55.5 per cent during the previous
year, the upmarket SBM hotels maintained higher occupancy rates of just over
54 per cent, thanks to the patronage of their wealthy private clients and
corporate customers.
One of the main reasons for the comparative strength of the upper end of the
tourism industry is Monaco's success at establishing itself as a business
conference centre. The principality only started to develop its conference
activities in the 1970s. It opened the Centre des Congres, its first
important venue, in the late 1970s, followed later by the Centre de
Rencontres Internationales.
Monaco now hosts large business conferences for the insurance and television
industries, as well as for individual companies which use it as a location
for internal meetings and promotional events (such as Elizabeth Arden's
elaborate launch this spring of the new Karl Lagerfeld perfume, Sun Moon and
Stars). The conference industry now accounts for almost a third of all
Monaco's foreign visitors, against under one tenth in the early 1970s.
The focus of future investment is in conferences. The main project in the
principality is the construction of the huge new Centre Culturel et
d'Expositions, which will provide more conference and exhibition space,
thereby enabling Monaco to host more than one big event at a time.
The opening of the new centre, originally scheduled for the end of this year
but delayed due to construction problems until 1998, might also catalyse a
new spurt of hotel construction.
The hotel sector has been relatively quiet since the openings four years ago
of the Abela and the Metropole. There have been no important new hotels
since then, although SBM does have one possible project: it is considering
building a new 300-room luxury hotel on the Larvotto peninsula.
In the meantime the Monegasques are anxiously waiting to see whether the
local tourist industry will fare better in 1994 than in 1993. So far the
signs are encouraging. The number of visitors during the first few months of
the year was healthily higher than in the same period of 1993. So far this
summer, thanks to The Flintstones and other attractions, it seems likely to
rise again.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (2): Crackdown on banks welcomed -
Reputation as a bolt hole persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a story in Monegasque banking circles that an Italian recently
appeared in one of the local banks bearing a cardboard box containing L7bn
in used notes which, he told the manager, was the profit from the sale of
his business back in Italy.
Such stories crop up from time to time in Monaco, although not as often as
they did in the past. The principality still has the reputation of being a
secure and discreet bolt hole for large quantities of cash. But the
introduction last year of tough new laws to crack down on money laundering
and to compel local banks to exercise tighter scrutiny over the source of
their clients' funds, gave a very clear indication of the way the government
plans to encourage the banking industry to develop.
'Monaco has established itself as a financial centre in a very short time,'
says Michel de Robillard, chairman of Credit Foncier de Monaco, the
subsidiary of Suez, the French financial group, which is one of the biggest
banks in the principality. 'The government realises that if Monaco is to
fulfil its full potential in the financial sphere, the banking industry must
be strong and clean.'
There has always been a small banking business in Monaco but it was only
after 1987, when the French government abolished exchange controls thereby
enabling foreign clients to move money quickly and discreetly in and out of
the country, that the local financial industry really took off.
The number of banks operating in the principality has since doubled to
around 40. The old independent Monegasque banks have all disappeared. The
banking market is dominated by the big French financial groups such as
Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale, Paribas and
Suez. Yet the other leading names in European banking are also represented.
Most Monaco banks concentrate on providing private banking services for the
wealthy private clients - or 'high net worth individuals', as they prefer to
call them - who want to take advantage of the country's tax advantages. Any
foreigner, apart from the French, does not have to pay tax on money
deposited or invested in the principality.
The private banking sector has expanded dramatically since 1987 with the
total value of client deposits almost quadrupling from around FFr22bn
(Dollars 3.95bn) eight years ago to an estimated FFr80bn today. The deposit
market grew by between 20 and 25 per cent a year during the late 1980s and
has continued to expand (albeit at a slower rate) since the start of the
economic recession.
'It's true to say that life is more difficult in private banking than it was
at the height of the boom three or four years ago,' says Martin Peake, head
of the Monegasque branch of Lloyds, the UK banking group. 'But we've had a
far easier time than private bankers in other places. The market here in
Monaco is still growing. It's just growing more slowly.'
The consensus among local financiers is that the value of private client
deposits rose by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent last year and has
increased by about 5 per cent in the opening months of this year. However,
these figures conceal a trend for clients to counter lower interest rates by
switching their money from deposits into more efficient vehicles such as
mutual or managed funds. As a result the local banks benefited last year
from an estimated 20 per cent increase in the value of the assets placed in
Monaco.
This expansion helped to counter the effects of the economic recession,
which has posed problems for the dozen or so local banks that are still
involved with commercial banking activities such as loans to local companies
and property finance. Monaco has not been as badly affected by the economic
downturn as nearby Nice or Cannes. However, some sectors of the economy,
notably the tourist industry and property development, have been depressed
with a knock-on effect on their banks.
The continued growth in private banking has also persuaded some new
international banks to sustain the financial sector's expansion by setting
up subsidiaries in Monaco. The latest arrivals include the ABN of the
Netherlands.
Local financiers suspect that one of the main reasons for the buoyancy of
the banking market is psychological. 'Monaco is an attractive place, but
it's also clean and peaceful,' says Mr de Robillard of Credit Foncier de
Monaco. 'There's virtually no crime, which means that our clients can feel
calm and comfortable when they come here. All that is very appealing at a
time of uncertainty.'
He is also convinced that the banking industry has benefited from becoming
more professional in recent years due to the restructuring efforts of the
banks themselves and the expansion in related areas such as the arrival of
international legal firms.
The new banking legislation has been welcomed as part of this process
particularly by those who remember the collapse of Banque Industrielle de
Monaco in 1989. The bank was closed by the French banking authorities after
an official investigation discovered that it had built a substantial
business by accepting 'cat's paw' bearer deposit notes in Monegasque names
for tax-evading French residents.
'None of us wants to see a repetition of the BIM debacle,' says one local
banker. 'It would be bad for Monaco's image and bad for business. Nor would
it be in anyone's interest for Monaco to become a haven for money
launderers.'
Monaco has always been subject to French banking regulations but most local
financiers believe that the new laws give them a necessary layer of extra
protection. 'This legislation won't actually alter the way that we operate,'
says Mr Peake of Lloyds Bank. 'But it should help us by sending out the
right signals. It might make our international clients feel more confident
about investing their money here.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (2): Solidity and maturity - The economy
stirs, but expect no miracles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's consumers, industrial companies and banks are starting to adjust to
the fact that they can expect nothing like the high growth of the 1980s
during the second half of this decade.
The change down in economic gear is one of the many factors forcing Japan to
challenge the values that used to lie at the heart of its economic power,
like the dominance of producers' interests over consumers, the lifetime
employment system and the tight-knit organisation of business into keiretsu,
or corporate families.
Japan may have to learn to switch to a mature consumer-led economy rather
than the fast growing industry-led exporter it used to be until the downturn
hit, just after the turn of the decade.
A faltering increase in private demand has just started to arouse the
economy from its longest and deepest recession in the post-war era. It may
only walk rather than run into its next recovery phase, but few doubt that
the worst is over.
Most economists in Tokyo believe that gross domestic product will recover
from stagnation last year to growth between less than 1 per cent and 2 per
cent this year, settling to something like one or two points below the 1980
average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. The main evidence for an upturn
includes a 3.9 per cent annualised increase in gdp in the first quarter of
this year, the best performance for three years. It could fall back again in
the current quarter for seasonal reasons, but the underlying forces at work
are clear, even if fragile.
Government spending packages have fed through to strong rises in housing
starts, private consumption and imports in the first three months of this
year. Imports, spurred by the yen's sharp rise, increased by just over 16
per cent in the year to last month, the clearest evidence that Japan's huge
and politically troublesome trade surplus might now be on the turn.
Private consumption rose by 5.8 per cent in the first quarter. There has
been a consumer spending spree in discount stores, often loaded with cheap
imported goods, and helped by the gradual breakdown of Japan's retail and
distribution cartels, incidentally one of the ways in which economic change
is producing an adjustment in the structure of society.
Industry has started to reduce its vast inventories of unsold goods, but
industrial production has yet to show a clear pickup. Output showed an
apparently encouraging rise in the first three months of this year by
comparison with the last quarter of 1993. Yet the monthly figures have
switched direction every month since last August.
Recovery is being slowed in its early stages by the yen's recent historic
break through Y100 to the dollar, an unwelcome new blow to the international
competitiveness of Japan's manufacturing industry.
Some business leaders, such as Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren
employers' federation, believe the yen's sharp rise could nip the recovery
in the bud, just as a jump in the yen did when a phantom upturn appeared
this time last year. Most economists, however, believe industry has cut its
costs so sharply during the recession that the latest rise in the Japanese
currency will merely slow, rather than choke, recovery.
Japan's chaotic political scene, with four governments in the past year, has
also slowed the recovery by hampering ministers' ability to make difficult
economic policy decisions.
Successive governments have, to their credit, delivered three public
spending packages worth Y45,000bn over the past 18 months. But badly needed
income tax cuts and further public spending have been delayed or blocked.
Japan's shaky governments have also done well to produce three deregulation
packages over the past year, marking modest steps in the attempt to reduce
Japanese costs and prices in line with international competitors.
But the political upheavals have delayed and possibly weakened the
implementation of the most recent deregulation package, published last
month. This is not all bad, since many economists believe deregulation
should in any case be slow, to avoid creating too much deflation at a time
when wholesale prices are already falling.
Looking beyond the immediate problems, the later stages of the recovery will
be constrained by at least two structural problems - surplus industrial
capacity and the weakness of the financial system.
Surplus capacity will force the industries that used to be the engines of
Japan's economy to hold down wage increases, new employment and investment
in the mature domestic market.
The car industry alone, for example, still has surplus production capacity
of 2m vehicles, equivalent to the entire car market of Britain or France. It
is not alone. The electronics, shipbuilding, engineering and financial
services industries are all going into recovery with bloated payrolls. Their
high costs are more of a handicap now than in the 1980s because of the sharp
rise in the yen, by 35 per cent in trade weighted terms since early last
year.
This means that Japanese companies will continue, as they did in the
recession, to curb recruitment and to encourage early retirement, as a way
to reduce capacity in line with demand without breaking the taboo against
heavy redundancies. Lifetime employment will come under strain, but it will
weaken rather than collapse, say Japanese managers.
According to a recent survey by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, companies will increase capital investment by 1.1 per cent in the
year to next March, yet most of this new cash will go to cheap production
sites in China and south-east Asia, which represent Japan's fastest growing
export markets and investment destinations.
The financial system, meanwhile, is making slow headway in running down the
burden of bad debts, inherited from the boom in lending on the back of
over-valued property during the sharp rise in asset values of the late
1980s. Since then, commercial property prices have fallen by up to 50 per
cent and have shown no clear sign yet of recovery.
It is feared that the experience has made banks so cautious over extending
new loans that the economic recovery may prove hard to finance. This is born
out by the weak performance of the benchmark indicator of money supply, M2
plus certificates of deposit. It turned the corner early last year, from a
three year decline, but grew at a mere 1.7 per cent in the year to May, well
below the 5 per cent annual growth which many economists believe is needed
to fund a revival.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (3): Some things are sacred - A storm is
brewing over imports of rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Koji Takada, a 44 year old rice farmer in Kitakami, northern Japan,
describes the future of Japan's farming as 'grim'. Although more than four
generations of his family have been farmers he doubts whether his children
will keep up the tradition.
He is one of the many Japanese rice farmers who have lost faith in the
government's policy, due to last year's decision to open the rice market to
imports, and to the confusion following the shortage of domestic rice
earlier in the year.
Japan will open its rice market to foreign imports next year under the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. For the first six years,
imports will have limited access. In the seventh year the market is expected
to be fully open. Meanwhile, the rice shortage caused by the exceptionally
cold weather last summer triggered a rice shortage row, and the government
was forced to import emergency supplies from the US, China, Australia and
Thailand.
The row over the opening of the market heightened the sense of sanctity of
homegrown rice, the cultivation and the harvesting of which remain at the
roots of Japanese traditions and rituals.
In ancient Japan, rice was not only food to fill the stomach but a symbol of
deities, or a means of connecting humans to the gods. The emperor, still
considered by many as a living god, today plants rice seedlings in his
private rice paddy behind the imperial walls.
Later, rice was used as taxes and traded like a currency, and would become a
sign of wealth. In medieval Japan, rice and rice cultivation was turned into
a cultural symbol by which Japanese would differentiate themselves from the
Chinese, Koreans, and westerners, an ideology broadened and popularised by
the military government during World War II.
Behind the symbolism, however, the opening of the rice market has
highlighted the rigidly controlled farming system, which has become
inefficient and outdated. Mr Takada's woes are shared with other farmers,
who are concerned with the country's agricultural future.
The protection of the farmers, whose are votes are highly valued by
politicians, has come in the form of farm subsidies. In order to keep afloat
the farming sector, which has an annual output of about Y10,000bn, the
government pumps in about Y6,000bn. The figure rises to around Y9,000bn if
subsidies from local government are included.
Others who have benefited from the system have been the 12,000 bureaucrats
in the Food Agency, which have nothing to do all year except during the
harvest, when they inspect rice. Around 350,000 people are employed by the
numerous farm cooperatives, which work as an intermediary between the
farmers and the government, selling agro chemicals and farming machinery to
the farmers and collecting and distributing the government's payments for
rice.
But aside from Japanese consumers, who have had to pay around seven times
the international price for rice, the farming community has paid the penalty
for such distortions. Dependent onsubsidies and the state run distribution
system, they have lost control over their livelihood. Farmers cannot buy or
sell their land freely due to regulations on farmland transactions, while
the state controls every aspect of rice farming from the planting to the
retail sales. 'The position of rice growers is little more than that of
serfs working on state-owned farms,' says Mr Taro Yayama, a political
analyst advocating the farm reforms.
And in spite of the government's subsidies, rice production is not
profitable. Mr Takada says while his income does not differ from office
workers of the same age, after paying for farming machinery, fertilisers and
pesticides, sold at higher than market prices by the farming cooperatives,
'there isn't much left to spend'.
The result has been a sharp fall in the country's farming population, which
has declined from 3.7m in 1985 to 3.1m in 1990. The figure is likely to fall
further to around 2.1m by 2000. At the same time the farming population is
ageing rapidly and, according to the ministry of agriculture, the number of
farmers under 60 in 1990 will be halved in 2000.
Not that the government is unaware of the problems. In 1992, the agriculture
ministry released a report on food policy, agriculture and rural life. It
called for consolidation of smaller farms for a more efficient system.
Reform advocates are calling for a more radical reform, including bringing
in the market mechanism by deregulating state control, and freely allowing
those who want to enter the sector.
However, the government has been slow to respond to the need for
agricultural deregulation and reform. The new Murayama administration merely
followed its predecessors by agreeing earlier this month to the ritual
annual increase of subsidies to the farmers.
Although Japan still has six years before the official opening of the rice
market, with no apparent gainers except consumers from full fledged farm
reform, politicians, farmers and agriculture bureaucrats may continue to
drag their feet. In the end, like so many other issues, Japan may once again
need the help of outside pressure to rationalise the dwindling farming
sector.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (1): An anachronism - but it works well -
Prince Rainier's achievements have recently been put to the test by the
economic recession, and so far he has passed with flying colours

One photograph hanging in the Monaco government offices shows the
principality in 1865 as a clutter of houses perched on the rock around the
palace. The picture beside it was taken in 1949 after the casino had ushered
in a new era of affluence, and a final photograph depicts the modern Monaco
where every scrap of land is crammed with high-rise apartments, hotels and
offices.
The three photographs tell the story of Monaco's metamorphosis from the
dusty old Mediterranean town of the mid-19th century to the leisure resort
and fledgling financial centre of today. They also illustrate how Prince
Rainier, who took the throne in 1946 as Europe's sole surviving absolute
monarch, has clung on to his country against the odds and turned what was
once a playboy's playground into a more broadly-based, if idiosyncratic
economy.
His achievements have recently been put to the test by the economic
recession and so far he has passed with flying colours. Monaco, like every
other European country, has been affected by the downturn, but it has fared
far better than most places, notably the nearby towns of Nice and Cannes.
The level of employment in the principality fell by less than 3 per cent in
1993 and, at the end of March, only 700 people from a population of 30,000
were out of work.
'We have felt the effects of the recession, but it has been much milder in
Monaco than in France or Italy,' says Jean Pastorelli, government counsellor
on finance. 'The recession has also been shorter here. The level of activity
has already picked up since the start of this year and many local companies,
having laid people off last year, are now hiring again.'
The key themes of Prince Rainier's reign have been to develop the local
economy thereby providing long-term employment for the 5,000 or so surviving
Monegasques and to nurture good relations with France, his powerful
neighbour. When he took the throne Monaco's only assets were its climate,
its picturesque position and its liberal fiscal system.
His principality had become, in the words of Somerset Maugham, a 'sunny
place for shady people' that risked falling victim to the sleazy side of the
Cote d'Azur underworld.
Rainier, helped by Grace Kelly, the Hollywood movie star whom he married in
1956, spruced up Monaco's image and restored its lost lustre. He created a
country which was scrupulously clean and virtually crime-free thanks to a
large, well-trained police force. He also kitted out Monaco with every
conceivable convenience including street signs, escalators, pedestrian
subways and even doggy shelters where pampered pooches can shade themselves
from the sun. The principality soon regained its old status as an upmarket
holiday resort and became a popular haven for wealthy tax exiles.
Monaco still fulfils those roles today. There might not be quite as many
rich tourists who are able, and willing, to check into its luxury hotels as
there were in the 1950s. But Monaco has recognised reality by building up a
business conference business and creating new facilities for the thousands
of day-trippers flooding in from France and Italy. The local tourist
industry was affected by the recession last year but not as badly as other
parts of the Cote d'Azur. The number of visitors fell by 15 per cent to
208,206 from 245,592 in 1992 and has been increasing so far this year.
The principality has also taken on a new lease of life as a tax haven. Only
a few years ago it was in danger of being seen as a retirement home for
elderly ex-pats of Prince Rainier's own vintage. It has since attracted a
new generation of ex-pats in the globe-trotting supermodels Claudia Schiffer
and Helena Christensen, who have joined long-time residents, such as Karl
Lagerfeld, the fashion designer, and Helmut Newton, the photographer. The
supermodels have also provided a new source of publicity after the
apparently endless paparazzi pictures of Rainier's children: Caroline,
Albert and the wayward Stephanie.
The influx of new residents, coupled with the expansion of the tourist
trade, has stimulated the property market.
The property business is no longer as frenzied as it was in the late 1980s,
but it is still relatively robust thanks to the scarcity of land and the
supportive presence of long-term investors such as Societe des Bains de Mer,
the state-controlled leisure company, and Pastor property group.
The price of residential property is only 10 per cent or 20 per cent beneath
its peak. Prices in Monte Carlo's prestigious Place du Casino are still
comparable with the most expensive parts of Paris.
Meanwhile, the local banking industry has flourished since the 1987
abolition of French exchange controls which enabled foreign investors to
move money in and out of Monaco more easily - and discreetly. The number of
banks in the principality has since doubled to just under 40 and the value
of private client deposits has almost quadrupled to FFr80bn. The banks have
recently experienced a slowdown in growth, but still expect an increase in
deposits and assets for 1994. At the same time the introduction last year of
tough new banking laws has been welcomed by bankers as evidence of Prince
Rainier's determination to prevent Monaco from becoming a money laundering
centre for French drug dealers and refugees from Italy's corruption
crackdown.
The banking laws are also illustrative of Prince Rainier's diplomatic
skills. He realises that his absolute monarchy and the continued existence
of a country with a population of 30,000 (only 5,000 of whom were actually
born there) is an anachronism. He also knows that France could take away
Monaco at any time as General de Gaulle demonstrated in 1962 when he sealed
off the border with troops in protest at the number of Frenchmen using it as
a tax haven.
Prince Rainier, nothing if not a realist, immediately agreed to exclude the
French from Monaco's tax privileges. He has since stuck to the same
conciliatory approach on the assumption that France will tolerate Monaco's
independence only for as long as it does not pose any problems. Hence his
government's zeal at cracking down on money launderers.
Yet the success of Prince Rainier's economic policy has given him another
defence in the political game against the French. The expansion of the local
economy has not only enabled him to protect the indigenous Monegasques by
giving them cheap housing (in the Fontvieille area that has been reclaimed
from the sea) and preferential employment rights, but also to generate jobs
for French workers.
The principality now employs just over 30,000 people only 7,000 of whom are
Monegasques, either living in Monaco itself or in cheaper places across the
French border. Some 3,000 Italians and 17,000 French also work there. The
French government would be loath to see those jobs disappear at a time of
high unemployment if Monaco lost its independence and its special tax
status.
Prince Rainier continues to finance new economic development projects such
as the FFr1.2bn new conference and cultural centre due to open in 1998 and
his FFr1.4bn scheme to liberate more land by submerging the railway station.
The government is also working on turn-of-the-century land creation projects
such as the construction of a new jetty beside the present harbour and the
creation of Fontvieille II on another sea reclamation site.
'The impression one gets is that Rainier is a very clever businessman in the
tradition of grands patrons, the great French bosses,' says one foreign
banker. 'He may be an absolute monarch, but he is far too astute to use his
power bluntly. There are never any surprises but you always know that a firm
hand is in control. Monaco might be an anachronism - but it works.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (1): In the throes of transformation -
Social upheaval is rare in Japan. When it takes place, it does so with
dramatic suddenness, as in today's radical changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
Japan does not evolve gradually like other leading industrialised countries.
Instead, it goes through decades of stability, punctuated by upheavals such
as the one happening now.
Evidence has piled up over the past year that Japan is starting to redefine
every aspect of its society. Old maxims, such as stability, consensus, the
subordination of the collective will to export-led economic growth, have all
been thrown into question.
A new blueprint is beginning to emerge. It is only partly drawn and will
take years to complete. But the first blurred sketch shows an unpredictable
Japan, in which open debate rivals consensus, individual initiative has
begun to challenge collective will, and the race for growth is giving way to
the challenge of adjusting to a slowly expanding mature economy.
Optimists liken the present phase to the start of the Meiji Restoration,
Japan's high speed transformation at the end of the 19th century from a
medieval to an industrialised society; or to the creation of Japan's
economic miracle in the decades after the second world war.
Realists point out, however, that for the moment there is no restoration.
Japan wavers tantalisingly between the partial destruction of the old order
and the construction of a new one. For every few steps forward, it takes a
step back.
'Change has been slower and more disorganised than many foreign observers
think, but it is real. It is also much stronger than many foreign observers
think,' says Mr Kiyoaki Kikuchi, a former ambassador to the United Nations.
Nowhere has the transformation been more visible than in politics. Formerly
stable Japan has produced four prime ministers over the past year. The
monolithic dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party has given way to a
shifting web of alliances between 12 parties, in which policies are
announced one day to be revoked the next.
The breakdown of the old political order began a year ago today, when the
electorate voted out the LDP after 38 unbroken years in power.
An LDP government returned to office three weeks ago, but this time under a
prime minister from the Socialist party, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the LDP's
traditional enemy since 1955. It is a partial step back to the old system,
but also an illustration of how severely the old structure has been
fractured.
While a humiliated LDP spent 11 months in opposition, two unstable coalition
governments led by a younger generation of reform-minded politicians managed
to achieve a long-delayed redesign of the political system and set curbs on
political funding.
The new rules, to be completed with the redrawing of electoral boundaries
this autumn, will make Japanese politicians compete for seats more on the
quality of their policy ideas, and less on their newly curtailed ability to
hand out favours.
The defeat and subsequent weakening of the LDP, which has seen its numbers
dwindle through a trickle of defections over the past year, was a terminal
blow to the so-called iron triangle of business, politics and the
bureaucracy. 'Business no longer knows where to go for favours and the
bureaucrats feel there is no power centre,' says Mr Kikuchi.
Elements of the old system, in which important decisions were made in secret
by LDP factions, are of course still intact. The pact between the LDP and
SDP that brought the odd couple to office shows that governments can still
be made by the backroom collusion of the LDP's heyday. The LDP and the SDP
remain the first and second largest parties respectively.
Yet the framework in which they operate has shifted irreversibly. Japan has
already moved from one-party rule to a system of three competing political
groups; the rump of the LDP; centre-right reformist parties like the Japan
Renewal Party and the Komeito clean government party; plus a left wing
loosely grouped around the Socialists.
Political upheaval may be linked to Japan's longest economic downturn since
the second world war, another challenge to the old power structure. There
are signs of recovery, but the recession has overturned several traditional
assumptions about Japan's economic strength.
Unlike previous recessions, this one was at least partly caused by internal
structural weakness, rather than just by external blows, like a rise in oil
prices. That is why the recession has been a long one, likely to be followed
by weak growth, rather than the shallow dips followed by vigorous recoveries
shown in previous cycles.
The recession has uncovered heavy overcapacity in the former engines of
economic advance, the car and electronics industries. These will take years
to correct and provide a drag on growth in the future. No industry is an
obvious candidate to power the economy in the next decade, as cars and
electronics did in the 1980s. The government is backing multi-media as one
possibility, but the international competition is intense.
There has also been a heavy external shock. In the past few weeks, the yen
has risen for the first time through the psychological barrier of Y100 to
the dollar, threatening to choke the fragile recovery by further squeezing
the yen value of export earnings. Business leaders are running even more
scared than they did in previous rounds of yen appreciation. The yen's
ability to defy gravity means that even as Japan comes out of recession,
there will be no let-up in the pressure on industry to restructure. The
outward shift of production capacity to cheaper locations in south-east Asia
is accelerating, as a result, raising fears that Japan may deplete its
industrial base.
Japan's formerly all powerful financial system has also been forced to face
up to structural weaknesses. This downturn has left banks straining under a
mountain of bad debts, inherited from the unsustainable rise in asset prices
of the late 1980s.
In previous recessions, banks could be counted on to tide their customers
through hard times and provide the funds needed to finance recovery. But
this time, banks are letting shaky corporate customers go under in record
numbers, rather than allow bad loans to pile up faster. It will take several
years for them to reduce bad debts to manageable levels, during which time
the banking system's ability to fund a recovery may well be weakened.
Economic upsets have gone hand in hand with social change. Japan's social
contract, in which companies guarantee a job for life in return for
life-time loyalty, is up for renegotiation. Prominent standard bearers of
life-time employment, such as NTT, Nippon Steel and Toshiba, have had to cut
their workforces. Others, including Sony and Honda, have replaced
traditional seniority-based pay with merit awards and encouraged staff to
compete for jobs.
One reason why Japanese industry still carries so much overcapacity is that
it has restructured to nothing like the extent of its US and European
competitors.
Yet the process has been radical enough to unnerve millions of salarymen who
used to think of the company as the staple of their personal lives and have
learned to value corporate loyalty above personal initiative. The tradition
of life-time employment is still intact, but no longer guaranteed.
Social change has stretched to the behaviour of Japan's formerly passive
consumers, who are flocking in record numbers to increasingly popular
discount retail stores.
This is partly a symptom of the pressure on wages. But many analysts believe
it also marks an underlying change in attitude. Consumers are starting to
realise that they can no longer tolerate the fact that Japan's consumer
prices are still on average 80 per cent above the OECD average.
Consumers' new taste for a bargain has wide repercussions. It challenges the
existence of the multi-layered distribution system, the main feature in
Japan's high prices and a factor in the orderliness of its social structure.
Deregulation, given fresh emphasis by governments over the past year, has
also played a part. The practical impact has been slight so far, but
deregulation is popular and widely accepted. Consumers' interests are
starting to assert themselves in a society traditionally dominated by
producers' interests.
It is no surprise that, with all these changes churning away at home, Japan
is redefining its place in the international community. The first step has
been to start renegotiating its traditional dependence on US leadership.
This is a belated response to the end of the cold war, which has reduced
Japan's role as a passive US-sponsored bulwark against communism in Asia.
Evidence of this is Japan's newly assertive stance on economic relations
with the US, as shown by its continued opposition to US demands for
numerical targets for increases in imports.
When Mr Morihiro Hosokawa met US President Bill Clinton in February, it was
the first time that a Japanese prime minister chose to come away from a US
summit without an agreement, rather than make concessions. Yet Japan's
dependence on US military protection is as strong as ever and may increase
with North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
While Japan rethinks its US relationship, it has - again belatedly - started
to make overtures to its increasingly important Asian neighbours. Mr
Hosokawa's unprecedentedly explicit apology for Japan's wartime record
helped, for a while, to reduce Japan's isolation in Asia. Unfortunately, the
gesture was ruined later when a justice minister in the next government
denied that a notorious wartime atrocity had ever occurred.
Japan's search for a credible voice of its own will be as sensitive and
difficult as the rest of the changes sweeping through the country. Japan is
changing from a passive economic machine to something different, but as yet
incompletely defined.

FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: DIY worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks with home improvement interests weakened in response to reports of
expansion plans by US DIY group Home Depot. Ladbroke, owner of the Texas
chain, slipped 3 to 175p, B&amp;Q parent Kingfisher declined 7 to 527p and Do It
All co-owner Boots fell 11 to 538p. Boots partner WH Smith was the one
bright spot, managing a rise of 5 to 481p.
However, stores specialists were mostly sceptical over the US group's impact
on the UK market. One said that Home Depot was aware of the difficult
trading environment in UK DIY and would more likely be targeting the German
and French markets as the focus of its European strategy. In addition, the
US company favours large store formats, which could run into planning
difficulties in the UK.
Boots was further undermined by weekend press reports that a consortium of
institutions was considering bidding for the company's drugs division. The
suggestion was met with general incredulity by analysts, who pointed out
that the offshoot was most likely to be bought by a kindred business, and
who also expressed surprise that the originally mooted price of Pounds 1bn
had apparently dropped to between Pounds 600m to Pounds 700m, according to
the reports.
Media conglomerate Pearson strengthened 22 to 660p, making a gain of almost
Pounds 1 a share over the past two weeks. Recent underperformance has been
redressed by a spate of buy recommendations and optimism that the
conglomerate will have a significant voice in the new Channel Five
television station.
Wm Low delivered J. Sainsbury the information requested by the country's
biggest supermarket group - a move which could trigger the anticipated
contest for the Scottish company following the friendly Pounds 154m bid from
Tesco last week. Sainsbury's mulling gave the sector a chance to pause for
breath after last week's heightened activity, with Low's shares adding just
3 at 256p, Tesco gaining 5 1/2 at 238 1/2 p and Sainsbury edging forward a
half-penny to 397 1/2 p.
Strong half-time results from Coca-Cola and the continuing hot weather
helped Cadbury Schweppes rise 7 1/2 to 451 1/2 p. Sugar processor Tate &amp;
Lyle firmed 5 to 415p. Unilever eased 5 to 1005p as the soap wars saga with
arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble rumbled on.
Buying of Wellcome, ahead of Thursday's interim results, was boosted by a
revival of speculation that the company was a takeover or merger target. The
company is changing its year-end and reporting figures for the four months
to the end of June. The shares put on 13 at 629p. Elsewhere in the sector,
SmithKline Beecham, which reports full-year figures today, fell 6 to 394p on
profit-taking.
High street lending banks Barclays and Lloyds were pulled in different
directions on switch advice from one securities house. Barclays was off 5 at
one stage after Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock from buy to hold.
However, the shares picked up with the market to close a penny ahead at
555p. Meanwhile, Lehman upgraded Lloyds on the expectation that it will
successfully merge with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society and
boost its earnings by 12 per cent in the first year. Also, SGST reiterated
its buy stance on Lloyds and the shares rose 9 to 566p.
Several stocks with hotel interests benefited from recent news on the
improving trading outlook. Forte gained 8 1/2 at 230p, Stakis 2 1/2 at 88p,
Bass 10 at 555p, and Whitbread 12 at 553p ahead of its agm statement today.
Engineering group Wagon Industrial closed a penny firmer at 500p as NatWest
Securities said its rating remained undemanding, although the sticking point
was the yield.
A stock overhang, together with general profit-taking, left shares in GKN
trailing 11 at 609p. It was also profit-taking that weakened Siebe, which
closed 9 down at 598p after trade of 1.8m. A two-way pull in FKI brought
volume of 3.2m as the shares closed unchanged at 180p, after the group
announced disposals of Pounds 46m. One market watcher said: 'This is a good
deal as it reduces debt and enables it to pursue its acquisition policy.'
Negative weekend press comment left conglomerate Tomkins 3 off at 221p.
Confirmation from dry cleaning company Sketchley that one of its two
executive deputy chairmen is to leave the company cast a shadow over the
stock. The shares eased 5 to 105p.

Daily Mail &amp; General Trust 'A' bounced 7 to 1000p as the market got wind of
reports that it was poised to unwind its loss-making stake in US multi-media
group Whittle Communications.
DMGT announced previously that this year's profits would be down by Pounds
20m because of losses at Whittle, prompting SG Warburg to cut its full-year
forecast to Pounds 62m. Yesterday a US trade press article claimed Whittle
was offloading its problem section to Reuters Holdings and selling half of
its educational TV service to an investment fund managed by Goldman Sachs.
Analysts said the move would not help this year's DMGT numbers but could
provide a boost next year. Reuters lost 1 at 476p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venture capital group 3i was a sprightly performer on its first day of
trading following the flotation of 45 per cent of the equity. Heavy
institutional demand ensured that the stock closed well above its issue
price on turnover of 27.5m shares.
The group is capitalised at Pounds 1.7bn and consequently expected to be an
early candidate for entry into the FT-SE 100 Index. As such, it would be a
vital component of investment institutions' portfolios.
The bookbuilding process saw Pounds 1.2bn of demand for the Pounds 530m of
stock issued to institutions at 272p a share. The remaining Pounds 180m of
stock went to retail investors, and the shares, which began trading at 283p,
ended the day at 292 1/2 p.
Although the flotation was set at a 13.5 per cent discount to net asset
value, there was a certain amount of relief at the level of demand. Analysts
said the asset value was calculated at 314p a share at the end of March but
had probably fallen since then, thus reducing the discount.
Mr Hamish Buchan of NatWest Securities said: 'This is a very good result.
Maybe the market is beginning to see 3i as a small companies' specialist,
rather than a venture capital specialist.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares turn higher on interest rate
optimism - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market's new 10-day rolling settlement system got off to a
smooth start yesterday, with no sign that trading volumes were affected to
any great extent. Share prices traced an uncertain pattern, taking their
lead from the bond markets, which turned higher in the second half of the
session.
At the close the FT-SE 100 Index was 7.2 up at 3,082, and responding to
activity in stock index futures, where the September contract on the Footsie
was within 3 points of 3,100. London markets turned higher in the second
half of the session after comments from a member of the Bundesbank council
raised hopes that the German central bank may decide to reduce its key
interest rates when its policy council meets on Thursday.
Equities opened nervously at the opening of a week which brings a heavy list
of economic data from the UK, Germany and the US. With investors still
nervous over the performance of the dollar and European bonds, markets are
likely to focus on tomorrow's testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as well as on the German M3 money
supply news expected this week and the meeting at the Bundesbank.
In early trading, the Footsie was down by about 14 points, unsettled by
falls in British government bonds as they awaited details of the bond
auction which was announced late on Friday. Traders commented that the big
securities houses, having established some excellent paper profits over the
previous three trading sessions, were inclined to hold back and watch the
European bond markets for a lead.
Shares began to steady after a member of the Bundesbank council suggested
that inflation forecasts might be lowered. Later, the Bundesbank said it
would hold a press conference after its Thursday policy meeting, which is
the last before the summer break. Both developments were taken
optimistically by the bond markets and equities soon followed suit.
The improvement in share prices was very modest but the Footsie crawled to a
net gain of 10 points in the early afternoon before slowing down as Wall
Street made an equally sluggish start - the Dow Jones Industrial Average
showing a 5-point fall in UK hours.
However, support spread across the broad range of the market, lifting the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 9 points to 3,560.3. The final picture was still
somewhat erratic, with media stocks standing out strongly as expectations of
an upturn in advertising revenues brought determined buying in relatively
thin markets.
Optimism over the outlook for interest rates helped some retail stocks, as
well as bringing sharp rises in those building and construction shares with
exposure to the German economy.
Banking shares, too, continued to respond to hopes that domestic interest
rates can at least be kept at present levels until the end of the year;
lower interest rates have helped the banks' bad debt lists as well as taking
some of the pressure off their customers. The insurance sector appeared
unaffected by press suggestions of further problems with pension transfer
policies, which already threaten the industry with significant compensation
liabilities.
Trading volume, as measured by the Seaq electronic network, totalled a
respectable 518m shares, with around 58 per cent of the figure coming from
non-Footsie stocks. On Friday, 856.4m shares moved through Seaq, returning
net worth of Pounds 1.57bn, comfortably at the higher end of daily averages.
Following the opening yesterday of the Stock Exchange 10-day rolling
settlement system, the Account Dealing Dates table, previously carried in
this column, has been discontinued.

FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US buying support and a rally in bonds combined to keep stock index futures
moving ahead in a session noted for its low turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 3,086 and moved
gently ahead on sporadic buying from US institutions for the next two hours.
A sell order, together with a brief retreat in UK gilts and European bonds,
saw the contract decline to hit a day's low of 3,065 at mid-morning.
However, this turned out to be only a brief setback and September recovered
to move ahead for the rest of the session, helped by the turnround in bonds.
Bear closing and a lack of sellers were said to have contributed to a
further advance by the contract in the afternoon. Having maintained a strong
premium to cash throughout the day, September finished at 3,098, around 10
points above its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume
remained low at 10,737 lots.
Turnover in the traded options was a healthy 32,291 contracts, though lower
than Friday's total.
The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 10,716 lots and the Euro FT-SE 3,352.
BT was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,145 contracts traded. The
total included a single trade of 3,000 lots in the August 420 puts.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Mainly muted response to
company news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities improved slightly yesterday in a quiet session highlighted by a
fresh batch of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.62 higher at 3,755.43, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.06 firmer at 455.22. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.04 ahead at 432.59 and
the Nasdaq composite added 1.26 at 722.62. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 227m shares.
The opening was weak, following a pattern which is typical of Monday
mornings which follow 'double witching' rallies. Yesterday, the Dow tumbled
about 15 points in the first minutes of activity, wiping out most of the
expiration-related gains struck in the final minutes of trading last week.
Apart from the technical considerations, the restrained tone reflected
anticipation of tomorrow's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by Mr Alan
Greenspan. The Federal Reserve Board chief will brief a Senate committee on
the state of the economy, and investors were hoping for hints on the timing
of the next move to raise interest rates.
As the day progressed, market indices managed to climb off the session's
lows, pushing into positive territory by mid-afternoon. An absence of fresh
economic news, and benign trends on the bond and currency markets, provided
an uncluttered vantage point from which to scrutinise the second-quarter
performances of several market bellwethers.
For better or worse, the reaction to the results was generally muted. Chase
Manhattan posted net income of Dollars 307m in the second three months of
1994, well ahead of its 1993 result of Dollars 233m, but the stock finished
unchanged at Dollars 38 3/4 .
Nationsbank also beat the forecasts of analysts, publishing a 42 per cent
improvement in earnings, but its share price nudged only Dollars 5/8 ahead
to Dollars 55 1/8 .
In pharmaceuticals, Upjohn issued a strong earnings report but the reaction
of investors was tepid. The stock added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 30 1/2 .
US West, near the top of the NYSE's most active list, dropped Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 40 3/8 in volume of 2.8m shares. The regional telephone group's
earnings showed no improvement from the previous year, but the downturn in
its share price was more a reflection of a decision to purchase two Atlanta
cable television operations and a downgrading by Goldman Sachs.
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft was marked up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50 1/2 after
settling a four-year federal antitrust lawsuit. Analysts played down the
impact of the agreement on the company's domination of the computer software
industry.
Synergen plunged Dollars 4 3/8 , or nearly 50 per cent, to Dollars 4 1/2
after announcing that its leading drug prospect had performed poorly in
recent clinical trials.
Canada
The Toronto market was also a shade higher following a session of low
turnover.
The TSE 300 composite index added 6.4 at 4,199.8 after spending most of the
day little changed from Friday's closing level. Advances outnumbered
declines by 369 to 342 after volume of 33.9m shares, well below Friday's
53.2m. Trading value was CDollars 276.4m.
The 14 stock groups were evenly divided between winners and losers. Real
estate recorded the day's biggest change, rising 1.85 per cent. Industrial
products and mining gained 1.15 and 1.07 per cent.

Gold shares in Johannesburg closed off the day's best in generally subdued

De Beers dipped 10 cents to R108.90 - the group announced yesterday a
diamond exploration joint venture in Canada. Anglos moved up R1 to R233.
The governor of South Africa's central bank cautioned at the weekend against
a premature abolition of the country's foreign exchange controls, saying the
cost could be too high, at least in the short term, Reuter reports from
Harare.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan tumbles 3% as political
crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a day of strong contrasts among the equity markets on the Continent,
with Italy and Paris heading in opposite dir-ections.
MILAN was unnerved by the deepening political morass, and the Comit index,
under additional pressure from a number of companies trading ex-dividend,
fell 21.43, or 3 per cent, to 689.69. The market was marked sharply lower
early in the session, in line with the bond and currency markets, before
steadying later in the day.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan commented that growing tensions
between the coalition partners over plans to curtail magistrates' powers had
raised doubts about the future of the government. 'Developments over the
weekend have made it hard to see how they are going to bolt the coalition
back together again,' he said. More immediately, it begged questions about
whether budget details, due on Thursday, would be ready on time.
The political uncertainty also took a toll on foreign investor confidence.
Daiwa Europe, which had maintained an overweight position, noted in its
latest strategy review that the Comit index had risen by 131 per cent in the
20 months to May, before the subsequent retrenchment 'restored a very
attractive level of potential appreciation for the end of this year, though
we recognise that political and economic setbacks could cause corrections
along the way'.
The weekend's developments left Mr Roger Monson, chief equity strategist,
reviewing the banking and securities house's stance on Milan yesterday, and
while he said that the market was one to be avoided in the short term, he
maintained his positive view in the mid to long term.
Selling was broadly based, with Montedison down L27 to L1,435. Stet, trading
ex-dividend, lost L130 to L5,350 and Generali fell L290 to L41,200,
ex-dividend.
PARIS enjoyed a strong performance on the first day of trading following the
long weekend break. Supported by bonds, the CAC-40 index added 50.54, or 2.6
per cent, to break through the 2,000 level for the first time since
mid-June, at 2,025.13.
The equity market has long been in the doldrums and has fallen steeply since
the start of the year. Analysts had been expecting a return to higher levels
for some time, given the strength of the underlying economy.
Kleinwort Benson, in returning its recommendation to neutral from
underweight, said at the end of last week that the strongest case for the
market at present was one of momentum. 'Earnings growth is strong, with
disappointments unlikely. Investors are much less overweight in French
equities then they were and in many cases underweight . . . most
importantly, sentiment is currently weak and it is difficult to see what
would make it deteriorate any further. France has underperformed for too
long.'
FRANKFURT pushed forward in official hours and then accelerated some more in
the post-bourse, the Dax index closing the latter with an advance of 13.42
to 2,116.96.
Merck Finck said yesterday that with the US currency remaining the key to
movements in the equity market, it did not expect a rally until later in the
summer, and from lower levels than at present. Consequently it said that it
was maintaining a defensive strategy, was remaining cautious on cyclicals,
with the exception of chemicals, and had reduced the utilities sector from
overweight to neutral. By contrast it was raising its weighting of
construction stocks from neutral to overweight, based on an improvement in
the sector.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by the gains of last week and strength seen
elsewhere on the Continent and the AEX index firmed 1.52 to 393.61.
The publishing sector was one of the main beneficiaries of the day, with the
Fl 3.00 gain in Elsevier, one of the index's heavyweights, to Fl 164.30
helping to push overall sentiment higher. However, the publishing group's
stock remains down more than 10 per cent from its level seen at the start of
the year.
ZURICH remained under pressure from Roche, and the SMI index fell 20.2
through support at the 2,500 level to finish at 2,494.7.
Roche certificates gave up another SFr170 to SFr5,260 in further response to
last week's disappointing first-half sales figures. Other chemicals were
also easier. Sandoz registered shares lost SFr10 to SFr647, although its own
first-half figures were in line with most expectations.
Insurers bucked the weaker trend on a positive view for the sector's
outlook. Swiss Re certificates rose SFr13 to SFr555 and Winterthur put on
SFr14 to SFr710 after the company confirmed a report that it expected
double-figure profits growth this year. Banks were little changed as
investors positioned themselves for half-year reports next month.
MADRID turned firmer as bonds recovered, although late profit-taking took
prices off best levels. The general index rose 2.16 to 304.95.
Repsol put on Pta70 at Pta4,020, and Sevillana added PTa19 at Pta683 as
17.9m shares were placed at Pta680 each in what was described as an internal
adjustment.
STOCKHOLM moved higher although turnover was reported as being below
average. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 13.7 to 1,430.9.
A number of factors contributed to the recovery of share prices, dealers
said: a further decline in domestic interest rates, gains on neighbouring
markets and optimism ahead of first-half earnings figures from Swedish
companies. Turnover came to SKr1.36bn.
WARSAW rebounded 6.3 per cent, overcoming Thursday's 5.9 per cent tumble and
returning to the winning ways of the previous seven sessions. The Wig index
rose 658.2 to 11,065.3, although the rise prompted warnings that the high
pace of recent gains, if sustained for long, could provoke another round of
profit-taking. Turnover rose 35 per cent to 1,400bn zlotys. Universal rose
9.5 per cent to 218,000 zlotys.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Positive signs but climate unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets enjoyed a markedly more positive time last week, but in the
current unsettled climate it must remain uncertain as to whether or not this
marks a turning point. Taken on a year to date perspective the figures do
not read so well - in dollar terms, Hong Kong, for instance, one of last
week's star performers, remains off nearly 25 per cent, although, on the
other hand, some good rises are still to be seen in Finland and Italy, up by
similar amounts, while Japan leads the way, up 31 per cent so far. The
European financial community will be waiting expectantly for the Bundesbank
meeting on Thursday, the last time it meets before the four-week summer
recess, although some analysts do not forecast a further rate easing, just
yet.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Taipei
rises 2% to four-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Technical trading limited share price fluctuations to a narrow range, and
the Nikkei index closed marginally lower on light index-linked trading,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Index-linked selling by institutional investors and profit-taking by
corporations countered buying by investment trusts, and the Nikkei 225 ended
52.51 off at 20,717.64. Without major moves on the currency and money
markets, many investors remained inactive due to the lack of news.
The Nikkei peaked at 20,816.46 in the morning session but fell to a day's
low of 20,688.34 in the last half-hour before the close. Foreign investors
were also seen placing small-lot sell orders.
Volume was 213m shares, against 288m. Many investors have been bracing
themselves for a further fall in the dollar this week, and are likely to
stay on the sidelines as Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve, gives congressional testimony this week and the German Bundesbank
policy-making council holds its scheduled meeting on Thursday.
The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 3.46 to 1,665.01, while
the Nikkei 300 lost 0.74 at 302.29. Falls led rises by 584 to 359, with 229
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.65 to
1,348.46.
Fanuc, the leading manufacturer of numerical control equipment, dropped Y300
to Y4,190. The issue failed to trade during the morning due to a lack of
buyers following reports that the Japanese subsidiary of International
Business Machines, of the US, was moving into the market.
Profit-taking depressed high-technology shares. NEC dipped Y20 to Y1,220 and
Toshiba Y5 to Y777.
Textile makers, which had gained ground recently as beneficiaries of the
strong yen, met profit-taking by domestic institutions. Teijin receded Y17
to Y557 and Unitika Y15 to Y375, but Toray Industries managed to recoup its
decline, closing a net Y5 up at Y772.
Tokyo Steel, the electric furnace steel maker, fell Y40 to Y2,470 after its
announcement that it was closing down a plant in central Japan due to the
water shortage caused by the recent drought in central and eastern Japan.
Other steel companies were higher in spite of reports of similar moves.
Nippon Steel firmed Y2 to Y344 and Kawasaki Steel Y5 to Y409.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 32.13 to 23,195.42 in volume of 17.4m
shares.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim saw mixed trading, with the reappearance of foreign demand
in some markets.
TAIPEI finished at its highest level since June 1990 as intensified buying
in the heavily weighted, and recently neglected, financial sector boosted
overall sentiment. The weighted index advanced 125.96, or 2 per cent, to
6,533.46 in turnover that rose to a high for the year of TDollars 131.04bn
amid the reappearance of strong foreign demand.
The banking sector gained 3 per cent as China Trust moved ahead TDollars 5
to TDollars 82.5 on sound profits expectations.
HONG KONG finished higher on foreign fund buying of selected blue chips but
profit-taking left the Hang Seng index below the 9,200 benchmark. It was
finally up 76.81 at 9,193.83 after a day's high of 9,228.50. HSBC showed
strength, adding HKDollars 2.25 at HKDollars 89.75.
SYDNEY saw a continuation of last week's gains and the All Ordinaries index
closed 14.3 higher at a month's peak of 2,072.3. Volume in News Corp was a
heavy 5.1m shares. The stock rose 10 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to a month's
high of ADollars 8.80. Elsewhere among blue chips, BHP gained 4 cents at
ADollars 18.64 and CRA traded in a 20-cent range before closing steady at
ADollars 19.08.
MANILA was supported by lower domestic interest rates and expectations of
strong second-quarter corporate earnings. The composite index put on 45.91
at 2,650.81.
PLDT led blue chips as the telephone stock jumped 3.4 per cent to 1,510
pesos. San Miguel 'B' climbed 4.1 per cent to 126 pesos. Benpres Corp led
second-line issues as it leapt 8.1 per cent to 9.30 pesos.
WELLINGTON advanced 1.1 per cent in improved turnover of NZDollars 41.4m,
with forest sector stocks again singled out as buys. The NZSE-40 capital
index gained 21.95 at 2,034.46.
Brierley Investments, which on Friday said it expected to report a record
profit for the 1993/94 year, firmed 1 cent to NZDollars 1.20 in higher than
usual volume of 6.27m shares.
SHANGHAI's A share index lost 3.8 per cent on news that the exchange would
enforce regulations banning short selling in state bonds and repurchase
agreements starting on Monday next week.
The index retreated 16.12 to 400.38 in thin volume of 202.2m as investors
fled the long-depressed A market, which has lost 75.60 per cent from its
peak of 1,640.71 in February last year.
The bond news also hit Shenzhen's A index, which fell 4.72, or 4.4 per cent,
to 101.82.
SEOUL extended early losses in very thin trade, sending the market to a
lower close for the third consecutive session. Many institutional investors
remained wary after the securities watchdog said it would monitor stock
price manipulation, leaving trading volume sharply reduced. The composite
index finished 4.93 down at 944.80.
SINGAPORE closed flat, with the broader market softening on profit-taking in
Malaysian shares traded over the counter.
The Straits Times Industrial index put on 0.83 at 2,199.15, with part of the
dampening influence attributed to a Merrill Lynch report which said it did
not expect a sustained rally in Malaysia on an announcement of a general
election.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower in sluggish trading as investors took
advantage of last week's gains to sell shares. The composite index receded
7.06 to 1,005.05 in volume that slid to 90m shares from Friday's 221m.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Cabinet row hits lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fallout from the cabinet squabble in Italy dominated foreign exchanges
yesterday as the lira fell to a 1994 low, writes Philip Gawith.
The first serious schism within the two-month-old government drove the
Italian currency to a low of L1,003.60 against the D-Mark before recovering
slightly to finish in London at L1,002, from L993.8 on Friday.
Traders were concerned whether what appeared to be Mr Berlusconi's first
serious policy error might not spill over into problems in management of the
economy.
Elsewhere, the dollar had a quiet day. Dealers said the US currency was in a
consolidation phase after its recent sharp fall. It was firmer against the
yen, closing in London at Y98.3550 from Y97.9050, but lost ground against
the D-Mark to finish at DM1.5428 from DM1.5558. In New York the dollar ended
at Y98.41 and DM1.5470.
The D-Mark was stronger on the back of political uncertainty in both Italy
and France, where the communications minister resigned over the weekend in
connection with corruption charges.
Sterling had an uneventful day, with the market ignoring the June public
sector borrowing figures, which were below expectations. Consistent with the
recent pattern, it was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5644,
from Dollars 1.5586 on Friday, but weaker against the D-Mark, finishing at
DM2.4135 from DM2.4248.
Analysts are currently playing down 'apocalyptic' scenarios for the lira,
but none rule out the currency testing the historic low of L1,010 per
D-Mark, touched in December 1993. The next important development will be the
parliamentary hearings into the constitutionality of the contested decree.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, senior economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the
dispute between Mr Berlusconi and his coalition allies was the first open
rift since they entered government. He said he doubted, however, whether
there was a 'great risk' in the next few weeks of a break-up of the
government.
But if this perception changes, it is likely to be accompanied by heavy
selling of Italian assets by foreigners, which would depress the lira.
At the moment, investors seem to be standing back from selling the lira. Mr
Radaelli said this might be explained by parliament going into recess on
August 4.
The parliamentary recess is normally a good time for Italian financial
markets. There is also hope that when parliament reconvenes, it will be to
pass a budget which gets to grips with the Italian deficit problem.
Mr Radaelli said the market was reluctant to push the currency far beyond
the important psychological level of L1,000, for fear of unleashing
'massive' intervention from the Bank of Italy.
He predicted, however, that so long as the currency did not fall too
quickly, the Bank would stand back until it reached a level of L1,025-L1,030
before intervening. Mr Radaelli said there was currently little risk of
imported inflation.
The bearish mood in Italian markets was evident in the Eurolira three-month
interest rate future contracts. After losing 16 basis points on Friday, when
the crisis first emerged, the September contract fell a further 35 basis
points to finish at 91.11. Volume was also heavy, the September contract
trading 12,418 lots.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that Italian
financial markets were used to political uncertainty, adding that lira
weakness 'tends to be quite short-lived'. He said the lira was also
suffering from the current environment of general D-Mark strength.
The main influence on the dollar was the comments of Mr Fred Bergsten, the
Washington economist with close ties to the Clinton administration. A long
time dollar bear, Mr Bergsten told the Wall Street Journal that 'the yen is
close to its peak and is probably going to turn around'.
He said it could go to Y90 against the dollar, but would not stay there long
if it did.
Mr MacKinnon said the markets saw Mr Bergsten, 'rightly or wrongly, as the
mouthpiece of the US Treasury'. Mr Bergsten said the markets would soon
realise that Japan's trade surplus was going to shrink, and this would allow
the dollar to stabilise at Y100-Y110.
The market is now looking ahead to the Humphrey Hawkins testimony of Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, tomorrow. But Mr MacKinnon said any references
to the dollar were likely to be too bland to be useful.
Overnight money traded between 4 and 6 per cent in the UK as the Bank of
England provided Pounds 792m assistance to the money market after
forecasting a shortage of Pounds 900m.
In Germany, call money rates firmed slightly to 4.90 per cent from 4.80/4.85
per cent. Analysts said they still anticipate a further decline in the repo
rate this week.
Volumes were low and price movements small in the interest rate futures
market. The December Eurosterling contract ended at 93.99 and the Euromark
contract at 95.13.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Economists urge US farm policy
overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Important aspects of US farm policy need a substantial overhaul if the US is
to preserve its competitive position in world agricultural trade, say Mr
Alan Barkema and Mr Mark Drabenstott, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Kansas City.
In a paper prepared for the bank's quarterly journal, Economic Review, the
authors note that US farm export programmes are heavily skewed toward bulk
commodities, where global trade is declining, and ignore fast-growing trade
in processed foods. Furthermore, entrenched export subsidy and credit
programmes underserve countries with the fastest-growing demand for farm
products.
After an intelligent discussion of changing trends in the global trade in
farm exports, the authors set out four rather surprising suggestions for US
policy reform. They say the time for discussion of these alternatives is
now, as policymakers plan farm legislation for the next five years, as part
of the 1995 US Farm Bill.
Their paper suggests that rather than continue to devote substantial energy
to wrestling down worldwide subsidies, the US should focus on stimulating
demand in emerging markets for farm goods. 'US agriculture has much to gain
from economic and trade policies that boost economic growth in regions like
Asia and Latin America,' it says.
The authors argue that US domestic farm programmes depress world bulk grain
prices while reducing US farmers' competitiveness in world markets.
'Eliminating commodity programmes may encourage US farmers to shift to
products with higher profit margins and brighter market prospects,' they
say.
On a closely related issue, the article concludes that programmes that
encourage US farmers to set aside acreage, and thus lower production,
throttles the highly-competitive US grain handling system and put the US at
a worldwide trading disadvantage.
Finally, the authors question whether the Dollars 5bn spent on US export
credits in recent years has been flowing to the markets with the best
long-term trading possibilities. The credits, they say, are often directed
toward political, rather than trade, alliances.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Producer sales cap palladium price
surge - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of PALLADIUM believed to be from Russia - the biggest producer -
capped prices after a rise to fresh five-year highs yesterday afternoon.
Palladium was fixed at Dollars 147.30 a troy ounce, up Dollars 1.05, helping
its sister metal PLATINUM to a three-month high of Dollars 416.75. Dealers
said the early price surge reflected investment fund buying on the New York
futures markets where the rally in the platinum group metals began on
Friday.
GOLD and SILVER silver benefitted from the trend.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers backs Canadian diamond
rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers of South Africa yesterday put 'a stamp of approval' on the diamond
rush in Canada's Northwest Territories. It agreed to take shareholdings
worth a total of CDollars 4m (Pounds 1.86m) in two junior exploration
companies and to arrange for up to CDollars 500m of finance for a mine on
the Yamba Lake prospect in the Lac de Gras area, centre of the diamond rush,
if it proved viable.
'Clearly this is going to be one of the premier diamond-producing areas of
the world before the end of the century,' said Mr Nick Fuller, analyst at
Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Mr Charles MacDonald, president of Tanqueray Resources, which owns 50 per
cent of the Yamba Lake project, said De Beers made the first approach and he
believed that it wanted to move ahead as fast as possible. 'We are aligning
ourselves with the best group in the (diamond) industry,' he said.
CLL's Mr Fuller suggested that, although two other major companies, Broken
Hill Proprietary of Australia and the RTZ Corporation of the UK, had about a
one-year start, 'De Beers wants to show them that it remains king of the
diamond business'. The two Canadian companies - Tanqueray and Mill City Gold
 -had extracted good terms and a tight timetable from the South African
group.
De Beers has 45 days to re-check in South Africa results from exploration at
Yamba Lake. If all is well it will subscribe for CDollars 2m of shares in
Tanqueray at CDollars 4.40 each and CDollars 2m of shares in Mill City at
CDollars 2.20 each. De Beers must evaluate the five 'pipes' so far
discovered by September, 1996, complete a feasibility study by the end of
1997, and, if it decides to bring a mine into production, will procure up to
CDollars 500m of financing to earn a 51 per cent interest in the project
area.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London cocoa futures jump to 6
1/2 -year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa futures shot to their highest levels for six and a half years in
London yesterday, taking over the baton from coffee on largely speculative
buying fed by fears that next year's supply deficit could be worse than
expected.
The London market took its cue from New York's performance on Friday, when
futures surged to four-year highs on a burst of fund buying. Traders pointed
to concern that the coming crop in the Ivory Coast, which produces a third
of the world's cocoa output, could be hit by dry weather.
The International Cocoa Organisation suggested in February that the deficit,
the fourth in a row, could rise to 209,000 tonnes in 1994-95 after a
projected 110,000 tonnes this year.
'Coffee has had an effect,' said one analyst. 'People have realised how
explosive things can become when you're in a situation of structural
deficit.'
He pointed out, however, that the likely size of the Ivorian crop would not
be known for about six weeks.
Buying interest in New York and London was also fuelled by concern that
labour unrest in the Nigerian oil industry could spread, and that Brazil,
another large producer, might suffer a port strike.
The September position in London broke through the Pounds 1,100 mark to a
day's peak of Pounds 1,112 a tonne but met profit-taking and closed Pounds
25 higher at Pounds 1,093. New York's September futures position added to
Friday's advance in early trading but backed off to Dollars 1,508 a tonne in
afternoon trading, down Dollars 14.
Coffee trading, meanwhile, had a thin day in London, consolidating last
week's record gains. The second position closed Dollars 53 lower at Dollars
3,775 a tonne.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post gains but activity
restrained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds posted moderate gains yesterday as the market followed
through on a two-session rally at the end of last week.
Late in the day, the 30-year government bond was  7/16 better at 85 1/4 ,
with the yield slipping to 7.50 per cent, and the two-year note was up  3/32
at 100 1/32 , yielding 5.963 per cent.
There was no economic news to dampen or reinforce the upbeat mood
established last week. Prices for gold and other commodities held steady,
and the dollar showed solid gains against the yen and D-Mark.
However, activity was restrained and bonds were unable to break out of their
tight trading ranges during the morning. Later, the gains were extended but
this was exaggerated by thin activity.
Traders were delaying new commitments until after tomorrow's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan. In his semi-annual briefing
to the Senate on the state of the economy, the Fed chief is expected to
signal whether the tightening of monetary policy has succeeded in slowing
growth without short-circuiting the recovery.
Technical factors, however, were partly offsetting a sanguine view of the
fundamentals. The heavy influx of securities in the coming weeks was already
having an influence.
Tomorrow, the Treasury will announce details of its regular two-year and
five-year note auctions. In early August, the government's quarterly
refunding operation will bring billions of dollars in new three-year,
10-year and 30-year bonds into the market, only days before the next meeting
of the Fed's policy-making arm.
After a soft start, most European bond markets ended higher, supported
towards the close by stronger US Treasuries and late short-covering in the
futures markets. Italy was the only exception, with mounting political
tensions weighing heavily on bonds and the currency.
Traders said many investors remained sidelined ahead of impending supply in
Germany and the UK, this week's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by the US Federal
Reserve chairman and the Bundesbank Council meeting on Thursday.
Italian bonds opened sharply lower on the deepening political turmoil over
Prime Minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi's recent decree barring preventive
detention in corruption investigations.
In an effort to control price fluctuations, Italy's clearing house made a
selective call for intra-day margin payments, while the London Clearing
House made an intra-day margin call on the Liffe's Eurolira futures
contract.
The September bond future was supported by technical support around 102 and
recouped some of its early losses on late short-covering. However, political
uncertainty, in addition to this week's release of the government's
medium-term fiscal package, are likely to make for continued volatility.
German government bonds rose nearly  1/2 point, undaunted by the prospect of
this week's 10-year bund issue. The first portion of the bonds will be
placed today by the federal bond consortium, with the second tranche to be
auctioned tomorrow. It is the first bund issue since the central bank
cancelled two issues due to lack of demand.
'The bund auction will be crucial,' said Mr Adrian James, European bond
strategist at NatWest Markets in London.
He expects it to go 'reasonably well', supported by increased demand for
long-dated paper by investors shifting funds from the short end to the
longer end of the yield curve.
Bunds were boosted by talk that June M3 money supply numbers, due to be
released this week, may show a significant decline and by the Bundesbank's
announcement that its council meeting would be followed by a press
conference. This fuelled hopes that the German central bank might cut
official interest rates on Thursday.
French bonds rose sharply, catching up with last week's gains in
neighbouring markets when France was closed for a national holiday. The
September notional bond futures contract on Matif rose 0.88 points to
117.16.
UK gilts were pulled up by the stronger continental markets, with the
September long gilt future gaining  11/32 to 103 27/32.
'After their recent rise, gilts are in consolidation mode, but on a robust
base,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets.
The Bank of England today is to announce the terms of next week's auction of
conventional gilts in the 2007 to 2011 maturity range. Most market
participants expect the auction to meet healthy demand from UK institutions
with a natural demand for long-dated assets like life insurance companies
and pension funds.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Two leading US retail names beat dollar
funding targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two top US retail names tapped the Eurobond market yesterday in
arbitrage-driven transactions which enabled both issuers to beat their
dollar funding targets by a comfortable margin.
A three-year Dollars 200m zero-coupon offering from Merck, the big US
pharmaceutical group, was designed to appeal to distressed holders of
floating-rate notes structured with minimum and maximum coupons. This market
has virtually collapsed in value in recent months due to the volatile
interest rate environment. Lead manager JP Morgan said Merck's bonds offered
these investors, mainly from Switzerland and the Benelux region, a way to
recoup their capital.
Mr Doug Rees, Merck's financing director, said the proceeds were swapped
into floating-rate dollars at a rate well below its normal US commercial
paper borrowing level. Syndicate managers estimated that Merck had made a
saving of around 20 basis points.
JP Morgan said about half the deal had been placed yesterday, though it
bought back around Dollars 30m worth of paper. When the bonds were freed to
trade, they rose to 82.82 from a re-offer price of 82.765.
However, other houses reported slower than expected sales, which suggested
that the aggressive pricing of 8 basis points below the US Treasury strip
yield curve had put off investors not caught in the so-called 'mini-max'
trap.
AT&amp;T also made a considerable saving, thought to be around 10 basis points
compared with its dollar funding levels, when it swapped the proceeds of its
Ecu150m four-year eurobond issue into dollars. SBC said the Ecu's good
performance against the D-Mark had prompted the issuer to pick that currency
for its first non-dollar eurobond. AT&amp;T had also considered lire, Canadian
dollars and D-Marks.
The European Community is expected to tap the Ecu sector later this week,
raising Ecu300m through an offering of seven-year eurobonds. The yield on
the bonds is likely to substantially less than the French government's 10
per cent Ecu bonds due 2001. Federal Home Loans Bank System is also due to
raise Dollars 1bn through its offering of two-year global bonds later this
week, via Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.
Elsewhere, Salomon Brothers, on behalf of the UK Treasury, said the
following privatised companies had repurchased their bonds offered in a sale
held yesterday: British Telecom, London Electricity, Manweb, National Power,
Scottish Hydro and Seeboard. In addition, SG Warburg Securities has been
appointed to sell a Pounds 37m Manweb bond due 2008.
The total proceeds received by the Treasury will amount to around Pounds
1.3bn while total proceeds from the sale of debt in privatised companies
this year will be some Pounds 1.8bn.
National Power said the repurchase would result in a charge to its profits
of Pounds 29.5m, which will be reported as an exceptional item in the
current financial year. Scottish Hydro is to charge about Pounds 18.8m
against current year pre-tax profits.

Bonton, a Czech entertainment group with interests ranging from record
stores to video production, is to raise up to Dollars 15m in a private
placing of shares with international institutions.
The transaction will be one of the first of its kind in the Czech Republic
and could value Bonton at up to Dollars 70m. Proceeds will be used for
acquisitions and to reduce debt.
Bonton also runs an investment fund with stakes in other media and
entertainment groups, and owns 5 per cent of Patria Finance, a Prague
investment bank.
The company had turnover last year of over Dollars 8m and made profits of
Kc837,000 (Dollars 30,000), according to CS First Boston Prague, which is
arranging the placing. Turnover this year is estimated at Kc600m (Dollars
21.4m) following acquisitions.
The share placing is expected to be completed in October. Bonton may seek a
stock market listing in two years' time.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Poor conditions check issue
flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adverse market conditions have checked the flow of international and foreign
bond new issues this year and reduced the average maturity of bonds
launched, according to the latest Financial Market Trends survey by the
OECD.
Also, the proportion of fixed-rate bonds has shrunk in relation to
floating-rate notes, particularly since interest rates began to rise in
February,
New issues totalled Dollars 180bn in the first five months of the year,
which implies a year-on-year decline of some Dollars 29bn, according to the
report.
However, a large proportion of this activity was concentrated in the first
two months, when new issue volume totalled almost Dollars 100bn, with an
unprecedented Dollars 62bn raised in January alone.
While long-dated bonds were easily placed even at the turn of the year, when
several borrowers issued 20-year and 30-year paper, the maturities of new
issues have since declined due to the change in market conditions, the
report notes.
Straight bond issues totalled Dollars 111bn in the first five months, a
contraction of almost 34 per cent, while total offerings of floating-rate
notes reached Dollars 44.6bn.
Straight bonds accounted for only 62 per cent of the market. The market
share of straight bonds has traditionally been around 80 per cent.
For currencies perceived by the market to be near the bottom of the interest
rate cycle there was a marked shift in the first two months from issuance of
straight bonds to offerings of floating rates, the report said, citing the
dollar, yen and sterling sectors.
Overall, the dollar sector of the international bond market remained the
most important, with a 34 per cent market share, but the D-Mark sector fell
back sharply from 14.3 per cent to 6.8 per cent.
The OECD says secondary market turnover of bonds and floating-rate notes
totalled Dollars 1,800bn in the first quarter, citing industry sources.
The report estimates scheduled redemptions and early repayments at some
Dollars 115bn in the first five months, implying net issuance of some
Dollars 65bn, which represents a decline of around 20 per cent.

<TEXT>
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, reported record revenue
and earnings for the second quarter.
It was the eighth consecutive quarter the company has achieved new revenue
and earnings records.
Rising sales of Pentium chips, Intel's latest generation of microprocessors
for use in high performance personal computers, helped drive second-quarter
growth, the company said.
The chip maker's second-quarter revenue rose 30 per cent to Dollars 2.77bn
from Dollars 2.13bn in the same period last year. Net income was up 12 per
cent at Dollars 640m or Dollars 1.46 per share, compared with Dollars 569m
or Dollars 1.30 in last year's second quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street projections.
'We had a solid quarter as growing sales of PCs increased demand for Intel
microprocessors,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive.
'We are particularly pleased with the rapid move of Pentium processor-based
systems into the PC mainstream, as we continue to drive the most aggressive
processor ramp in our history.'
During the quarter, PCs using chips produced using Intel's latest process
technology began to reach computer users. Microprocessors produced with this
technology were rapidly becoming the base for the highest performing,
volume-produced computers in each segment of the PC market, the company
said.
Revenue increased from first-quarter levels in all geographic markets, Intel
said, with the Asia Pacific region and Japan showing the strongest growth
rates. American revenues accounted for 51 per cent of sales, Europe 27 per
cent, the Asia Pacific region 14 per cent, and Japan 8 per cent.
For the first half of 1994, revenues were Dollars 5.43bn, up 31 per cent
from Dollars 4.15bn in the first half of last year. Net income grew 13 per
cent to Dollars 1.26bn or Dollars 2.86 per share from Dollars 1.12bn or
Dollars 2.53.

<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the struggling computer manufacturer which last week
announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs, yesterday announced a new structure for
its core computer systems division which involves turning all but its top
1,000 largest customers over to third-party sales and support organisations.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, who was named last week to head the division, said
Digital currently served about 8,000 customers, but the 1,000 largest
accounts made up some 75 per cent of the group's revenues.
He said the transition would be orderly and he expected customers to be
better served under the new system.
Mr Pesatori, who headed sales and marketing, and before that Digital's
personal computer operations, said the new division would consist of three
worldwide business units, each with profit and loss responsibility.
One is the company's PC division, to be headed by Mr Bernhard Auer, who
previously headed the company's European PC business.
A new systems business unit, which will be temporarily headed by Mr
Pesatori, will make Alpha workstations and client server systems and sell
them through business partners.
An accounts business unit, to be headed by Mr Vincenzo Damiani, who remains
president of European operations, will concentrate on sales to the top 1,000
accounts.

South Korea's Daewoo group yesterday said it would establish next year an
independent distribution network to market its cars in eight western
European countries.
Daewoo Motor, South Korea's third-largest car producer, was prevented from
selling its cars directly in Europe under its joint venture contract with
General Motors of the US.
But under the terms of the agreement ending the partnership in 1992, Daewoo
was granted the right to market its cars in Europe in 1995 and in the US in
1996.
Daewoo produced the Opel Kadett under licence for GM.
The car sales subsidiaries, to be managed by the group's trading company
Daewoo Corporation, will be in the UK, Germany, France, Switzerland,
Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
Daewoo will be the first South Korean car manufacturer to establish an
independent sales network in Europe.

Directors of Independent Holdings (IHL), the Australian wholesaler,
yesterday rejected the ADollars 133m (USDollars 97.7m) bid for the company
launched on Friday by its rival Davids Holdings. The managing director of
IHL, Mr John Patten, said he supported rationalisation in the industry, but
the Davids bid was 'grossly inadequate'.
The bid, at ADollars 4.25 cash a share, is the latest in a flurry of
corporate activity in the fragmented and incestuous Australian grocery
industry.
It follows last month's ADollars 501m move on wholesaler Foodland Associated
by New Zealand rival, Rank Commercial, and Australian retailer Coles Myer.
The bid for Foodland, which controls 18 per cent of IHL, has been blocked in
the Australian courts following intervention by the Trade Practices
Commission.

Reynolds Metals, the aluminium products group, has turned in second-quarter
net income of Dollars 12m or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of
Dollars 23m or 38 cents a share for the same period a year ago, Reuter
reports from Richmond.
Revenues in the latest period were Dollars 1.5bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn.
Aluminium shipments were 406,000 metric tons, compared with 387,000 metric
tons in the 1993 second quarter.
Mr Richard Holder, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Reynolds'
second-quarter results reflect significant contributions from previously
announced acquisitions and restructuring activities, as well as the benefits
of ongoing cost-reduction programmes.'
He added that all-time record shipments for any quarter, combined with
improving aluminium ingot prices and a shift in product mix toward the
higher value-added market segments, also contributed to the company's
results.
For the first six months, Reynolds posted a loss of Dollars 9m or 41 cents a
share, compared with a loss of Dollars 56m or 93 cents in the 1993 first
half. Revenues were Dollars 2.7bn against Dollars 2.6bn.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Santa Fe Gold undergoes
transformation - A look at the changes which have promoted the US gold
producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation was virtually unknown to international
investors a year ago. But since then it has emerged as the sixth-largest
producer of primary gold in North America.
In addition, it has listed 14.6 per cent of the company on the New York
Stock Exchange on terms which gave it a total value of nearly Dollars 2bn,
and immediately became an important element in the new Financial Times Gold
Mines Index.
Its parent, Santa Fe Pacific, the railways group, is to distribute the
remaining 85.4 per cent of the gold company to shareholders on September 30.
From then on Santa Fe Gold will have no big controlling shareholder but its
equity will be widely held in North America and Europe - about 7 per cent of
the company was snapped up by European investors in the recent share sale.
Santa Fe Gold includes some of the assets Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped
in June last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations.
That deal transformed Santa Fe Gold into a producer with an anticipated 1994
gold output of 900,000 troy ounces. It also has among the lowest costs in
the world: Dollars 187 an ounce cash costs and Dollars 267 total costs in
the last reported quarter. In North America only American Barrick, the
Canadian group, has lower costs.
And, like American Barrick, Santa Fe Gold has one of the biggest gold
reserves in North America, amounting to 14.1m ounces. However, these were
estimated using a gold price of Dollars 400 an ounce, which some analysts
feel was optimistic. With gold at Dollars 350, Santa Fe Gold's reserves fall
to about 12.3m ounces.
Santa Fe Gold, with headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has about 1,500
non-unionised employees and three mines. These are: Twin Creeks (a
combination of Hanson's Chimney Creek and Santa Fe's Rabbit Creek merged to
produce the third-biggest primary gold mine in the US) and Lone Tree, both
in northern Nevada, and Mesquite in southern California.
It is one of the biggest holders of mineral rights in the western US,
controlling more than 6.8m acres of private mineral rights, including more
than 1.8m acres in northern Nevada where most US gold is produced today.
Mr Dick Zitting, Santa Fe Gold chairman, recognises that investors in gold
companies look for growth and measure that growth by ounces produced.
He can promise no immediate large increase and says output will be static
for the next year or so. There are projects in the pipeline but it is taking
longer to bring them into production - the permitting process in the US is
now a long, drawn-out affair, he points out.
Santa Fe Gold intends to grow mainly by its own exploration efforts, Mr
Zitting insists. Both the old-style Santa Fe Gold and Gold Fields had good
exploration records and the merger produced an experienced exploration team
of 140 people. 'You get so much more added value when you find your own gold
rather than buying it from someone else,' he points out.
Nevertheless, 'we recognise that to maintain output or grow we will have to
make acquisitions'.
Santa Fe spent Dollars 22m on exploration last year and will spend between
Dollars 25m and Dollars 30m in each of 1994 and 1995. About 75 per cent will
be spent in the US and the rest in other countries where the group is
searching for gold, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Uruguay.
Mr Zitting says exploration efforts outside the US will gradually build
until spending there accounts for about half the budget.
Santa Fe Gold has agreed a joint venture with Codelco, the state-owned
Chilean group, on the Cerro Coya gold property near El Salvador. This
project, high in the Andes next to Homestake's El Hueso mine, will be
drilled when the spring weather comes to Chile.
Back in the US, Mr Zitting suggests Santa Fe Gold will by the year-end
decide whether to go ahead with the Mule Canyon advanced exploration
project, acquired in the Gold Fields exchange. This is 12 miles east of
Battle Mountain, Nevada.
Last year Santa Fe Gold spent Dollars 11.3m developing its mines and this
will rise to Dollars 12m in 1994. The 1994 capital budget is about Dollars
75m, including Dollars 14.2m to complete the Lone Tree mine expansion.
Since 1992 the company has spent Dollars 112m on this scheme, which enables
it to extract gold from refractory (difficult) ores at Lone Tree. Most of
the money went on an autoclave - similar to a huge pressure cooker - used to
oxidise ore.
Mr Zitting says the autoclave, completed in February, is 'going like a
jewel' and already processing at 110 per cent of rated capacity. The project
lifted Lone Tree's annual gold output to 200,000 ounces and increased the
mine's life by nine years to 14 years.
Santa Fe Gold is now considering putting a similar autoclave into operation
at the Twin Creeks mine at an estimated cost of Dollars 200m over two or
three years.
Mr Zitting points out that Santa Fe Gold might not be able to recover up to
57 per cent of the reserves at Twin Creek without the autoclave so 'it would
have to be very harsh circumstances for us not to go ahead'.
The Dollars 235m net proceeds of the recent share sale have been used
primarily to repay Santa Fe Gold's debts. It was left with Dollars 22m cash.
Pro forma accounts for 1993 show net income of Dollars 43.2m or 34 cents a
share. The company produced 847,000 ounces of gold and sold 825,000 ounces
at an average realised price of Dollars 377 an ounce.
A gold hedging programme enabled the company to do better than if it had
sold its metal on the London Bullion Market where the average last year was
Dollars 360. Hedging will continue, 'when deemed appropriate', says Mr
Zitting. At March 31 it had sold forward 646,000 ounces at an average price
of Dollars 395 an ounce and also bought 'put' and 'call' options on another
127,500 ounces.
Mr Zitting says Santa Fe Gold's capital outlays this year can be covered
from operations. And it intends to pay a regular dividend of 5 cents a
share.

President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest integrated food processing and

(USDollars 62m) in the six months to June 30, up 53 per cent from TDollars
1.07bn in 1993.
The increase was attributed to the TDollars 525m sale of a south Taiwan pig
farm to be converted into a condominium development. Pre-tax profits in core
operations, minus the land sale gain, rose 4.9 per cent on the year.
Total first-half revenues edged up 2.6 per cent to TDollars 11.8bn from
TDollars 11.5bn in the first half of last year.
United Micro Electronics, one of Taiwan's leading integrated circuits and
semiconductor manufacturers, saw preliminary pre-tax profit more than double
in the six months to June 30 to TDollars 2.71bn (USDollars 101m) from
TDollars 818.9m a year earlier.
First-half revenues rose 65 per cent to TDollars 6.64bn.

The second stage of the Philippines' largest privatisation, a public
offering of shares representing 20 per cent of oil-refiner Petron, got under
way yesterday in spite of attempts in the Supreme Court by the government
opposition to derail it.
Petron is the Philippines' largest oil refining and marketing company, with
an estimated 45 per cent share of the local market for petroleum products.
The latest offer of 1bn shares is intended to reduce the government's
holding to 40 per cent.
Last December, the Saudi Arabian Aramco oil group bought a 40 per cent stake
with a bid of Dollars 502m.
The new offer is being made in two batches. The first, on offer from
yesterday until August 5, is for 700m shares, at a price of 9 pesos a share.
This batch will be restricted to Filipino investors.
The remaining 300m shares will be offered in blocks of at least 6,000
shares, with a minimum tender price of 9 pesos a share.
Opposition members of Congress have initiated a case in the Philippine
Supreme Court to stop the sell-off which, they say, puts local investors at
a disadvantage.
The minimum price of 9 pesos for the current stock offering is higher than
the equivalent 6.70 pesos paid by Aramco for the 40 per cent it won last
December.

Time Warner, the US entertainment group, has reported a second-quarter net
loss of Dollars 23m, sharply reduced from the Dollars 83m loss a year ago
due to record earnings at its publishing, music, films and cable TV
programming businesses.
During the quarter, combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortisation (Ebitda) for the group and its Time Warner Entertainment
subsidiary reached Dollars 748m on revenues of Dollars 3.7bn, compared with
Ebitda of Dollars 711m on revenues of Dollars 3.4bn a year ago.
Earnings in the first half were Dollars 1.38bn, up from Dollars 1.34bn in
the first six months of 1993.
The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden
following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, tries to focus attention
on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying perform-ance.
Its Time Warner Entertainment unit (comprising the film, HBO cable channel
and cable systems businesses) reports its operating results on a
deconsolidated basis.
Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, singled out the contribution of the
group's publishing business, where Ebitda in the quarter jumped 19 per cent
to a record Dollars 125m. Gains in advertising sales and circulation of its
large stable of magazines were behind the improvement.
Time Warner's music unit made second-quarter Ebitda of Dollars 150m, also a
record, up 10 per cent from a year ago due primarily to improved operating
results at Warner Music International.
Record operating earnings were also posted by the group's filmed
entertainment and HBO cable channel units, where Ebitda reached Dollars 267m
and Dollars 67m, respectively.
Cable operations, however, did not fare so well in the quarter, reporting
Ebitda of Dollars 256m, down from Dollars 270m a year ago, as the impact of
the reduction in rates imposed by Congress last September offset gains
achieved from customer base growth.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola shrugs off private
label competition with 13% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, increased net profits by 13 per cent to
Dollars 758m in the second quarter in spite of competition from private
label colas in several of its biggest markets.
Last month PepsiCo, manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola, warned that its
second-quarter profits would be virtually flat, partly because of price
competition in the US soft drink market and because of poor results from its
fast food operations.
Coca-Cola said its soft drinks volumes grew by 6 per cent in North America
in the second quarter, helped by the introduction of new 'contour' packaging
for classic Coca-Cola and Diet Coke, and a successful Sprite advertising
campaign.
It did not report separate profit figures for North America. But the company
tends to be less directly affected by price competition than PepsiCo because
price cuts hit the bottlers first, and unlike PepsiCo, Coca-Cola does not
own its bottlers.
Internationally, Coca-Cola saw zero volume growth in the European Union
countries and only 1 per cent growth in Japan. It blamed poor economic
conditions for these results. But rapid growth in developing markets
produced total international volume growth of 7 per cent.
Group revenues rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 4.34bn and earnings per share,
as predicted by the company last month, rose by 13 per cent to 59 cents.
Half-year net income was 14 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.28bn.
Coca-Cola bought back 6m of its shares in the second quarter, taking the
year-to-date total to 10m. There are now 1.29bn shares outstanding.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Lac rebuffs takeover bid from
Royal Oak Mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lac Minerals, the Toronto-based mining group, has scathingly rebuffed Royal
Oak Mines' CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.4bn) takeover bid, describing the offer
by the Vancouver-based gold producer as inadequate and opportunistic.
Lac's board unanimously advised shareholders yesterday to reject Royal Oak's
cash-and-share offer, which was made on July 7.
It disclosed that it is considering a number of other options, but declined
to give details.
Royal Oak had no immediate response. Investors and analysts have given the
Vancouver company credit for drawing attention to Lac's shortcomings.
Several sizeable Lac shareholders have gone on the record in the past 10
days to support the rationale behind Royal Oak's bid.
Mr Jim Pitblado, a non-executive director of Lac who will act as the board's
spokesman in the unfolding takeover struggle, acknowledged yesterday that
'perhaps we can be criticised for hiding our light under a bushel basket'.
Nevertheless, many outsiders doubt that Royal Oak will emerge victorious. A
competing bid is widely expected to surface if Lac fails to find a white
knight.
Lac is about three times bigger than Royal Oak. But its share price has
under-performed other North Am-erican gold producers despite the high
quality of its assets.
Ms Peggy Witte, Royal Oak's pugnacious president, has estimated that she
could chop at least USDollars 40m from Lac's annual operating costs.
Mr Pitblado said that Royal Oak's offer would leave the proposed new company
'saddled with significant interest expense, stripped of cash, highly
leveraged and strapped for investment capital just as Lac is ready to move
ahead with significant new mine development programmes.'
Mr Pitblado described Royal Oak's offer as 'a blatant attempt to rob Lac's
shareholders of the true value of their investment with a low-ball offer
that provides no real premium and dilutes their interest in Lac's
significant growth potential'.
He drew an unfavourable comparison between the Lac and Royal Oak mines,
claiming that the latter had high-cost operations with unknown environmental
risks. Royal Oak has an average cash cost of Dollars 315 per oz, compared to
Lac's Dollars 180 an oz.
In a further bid to support its case, Lac yesterday raised its estimate of
its gold reserves from 8.6m to 13.5m ozs and announced decisions to go ahead
with several new projects in North and South America.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Algoma Steel rebounds strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algoma Steel, restructured in 1992 at the height of the recession, is
rebounding strongly. It has been boosted this year by rising demand for
sheet and most of its other products, higher prices and a lower Canadian
dollar.
In the second quarter to June 30, net profit was CDollars 33.2m (USDollars
24.1m), or Dollars 1.26 a share, against a loss of Dollars 4.5m, or 17 cents
a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 7 per cent to Dollars 262m.
It was the fourth consecutive quarterly profit for Algoma, which produces
about 2m tonnes annually.
In the first half the group recorded net profit of Dollars 49.2m, or Dollars
1.87 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 22.3m, or 85 cents, a year
earlier, on revenues which advanced to Dollars 528m from Dollars 446m.
Algoma said rolled products continued to perform strongly and volume was
improving in tubular products and structurals.
'The first half is indicative for the rest of the year,' said Mr Glen
Manchester, finance director.
Algoma hopes to list its stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the third
quarter. It was delisted during its 1992 reorganisation.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: US biotech groups top
expectations - Revenue up 21% at Amgen; Genentech income jumps threefold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US's two leading biotechnology companies, Amgen and Genentech,
experienced strong sales in the second quarter of the year, enabling both to
record profits which exceeded market forecasts.
Amgen, whose sales in the first three months of the year had failed to live
up to expectations, bounced back with revenue growth of 21 per cent in the
three months to June, to Dollars 414m.
Sales of Neupogen, its treatment for chemotherapy patients, rose 13 per cent
to Dollars 212m, while revenue from Epogen, used in connection with dialysis
treatment, advanced 26 per cent to Dollars 176m.
During June, the company won regulatory approval to use Neupogen in
connection with high-dose chemotherapy, and to recommend an increase in
Epogen dosages on its packaging, both of which should support sales growth
in future.
With research and development spending up from Dollars 53m to Dollars 64m,
Amgen reported net income of Dollars 107m, or 77 cents a share, up from
Dollars 100m, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. A legal award had added 6
cents a share to earnings in the 1993 quarter.
Half-year net income was Dollars 201m, against Dollars 190m.
Post-tax profits at Genentech, which is majority owned by Roche, the Swiss
pharmaceuticals group, jumped threefold in the second quarter as product
sales rose by more than a third.
The company reported net income of Dollars 33.4m, or 28 cents a share, up
from Dollars 10.4m, or 9 cents the year before, and broadly in line with
market expectations.
Behind the growth in product sales, to Dollars 152m, were a 32 per cent rise
in Activase, a drug used to prevent blood clotting, to Dollars 73.5m, and an
11 per cent advance in sales of the company's two human growth hormones, to
Dollars 59.5m.
Sales of Pulmozyne, taken by cystic fibrosis sufferers, launched in the
first quarter, reached Dollars 18.7m.
Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said Activase sales growth
could be further reinforced by a recent recommendation from a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee. This could lead to larger dosages of the
drug being taken in the treatment of heart attacks.
Research and development spending, at Dollars 73m, was down from Dollars 84m
a year before when a one-off charge of Dollars 13.7m was included.
Spending on R&amp;D would increase in the second half of the year as later-stage
clinical trials started on a number of additional products, Genentech said.
For the half-year as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 72m on sales of
Dollars 394m, up from Dollars 25m on sales of Dollars 323m.
Sales at Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals company, slipped in the second
quarter on growing generic competition to some of its biggest products. The
slowdown, however, was not as rapid as some industry observers had expected.
The company reported post-tax earnings of Dollars 120m on sales of Dollars
891m, down from Dollars 125m on its sales of Dollars 895m the year before.
Earnings per share, at 67 cents, were 3 cents lower than the corresponding
period but comfortably ahead of market expectations at around 60 cents.
Upjohn said US sales of Xanax, the anti-anxiety treatment which is its
biggest-selling drug, had fallen 64 per cent to Dollars 80m during the
period. US sales dropped 8 per cent overall, to Dollars 500m.
Outside the US, however, revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 391m, buoyed
in part by higher sales of Xanax.
Mr John Zabriskie, the company's recently appointed chairman and chief
executive, pointed to recent registration filings in 25 countries for
Freedox, a haemorrhage treatment, as a sign of Upjohn's attentionto the
development of new products.
Patent expiries on a number of its drugs in the US and the takeover of US
rival Syntex have pushed Upjohn to the top of most analysts' lists of
potential takeover candidates in the pharmaceuticals industry.
For the first half as a whole, net income fell to Dollars 255m, or Dollars
1.43 a share, from Dollars 253m, or Dollars 1.55, the year before.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney chairman has heart
surgery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney and the prime engineer of its
strong growth record over the past decade, underwent quadruple coronary
bypass surgery at the weekend, raising a question mark over the depth of
management at one of the world's most successful entertainment companies.
Mr Eisner, 52, is expected to leave the Los Angeles hospital in several days
and return to work in a few weeks.
In a statement released by Disney, his surgeon said the operation was a
'normal by-pass procedure without any complications'.
The illness comes at a delicate time for the company. Mr Eisner has been
operating without a number two since April when Mr Frank Wells, president of
Disney and Mr Eisner's closest associate, was killed in a helicopter
accident.
Disney is rumoured to be considering a bid for CBS, the television
broadcasting network which made itself a potential takeover target by
agreeing to merge with home shopping channel QVC, a deal now abandoned.
Many analysts think CBS would make a strong fit with Disney, which already
owns a cable television channel and makes programmes for the broadcasting
networks.
Disney is also locked in battle with a group of eminent US historians over
its plans to develop a historical theme park, called Disney America, on a
civil war site in Virginia.
Mr Eisner's condition will likely lead to calls for him to appoint a number
two quickly. One candidate is Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who heads the company's
film studios. He came to Disney with Mr Eisner from Paramount Pictures and
has built the studios into one of the most successful in Hollywood.
Disney shares were little affected yesterday by the news of Mr Eisner,
rising Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 42 on the New York stock exchange.

<TEXT>
Rohm &amp; Haas, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported that its 1994
results will be substantially above 1993 earnings and may exceed the
company's record 1988 performance of Dollars 230m, Reuter reports from
Philadelphia.
However, currency changes and the current upward trend in raw material costs
could influence the third-quarter results.
Rohm &amp; Haas said that price increases in key feedstocks, including ammonia,
methanol, acetone and styrene, would hit its third-quarter costs and force
it to raise prices for certain product lines.
The company reported earnings for the second quarter of Dollars 93m, or
Dollars 1.37 per common share, up from Dollars 61m, or Dollars 0.90 per
share in the second quarter of 1993.
'Earnings are up - that's good news,' said Mr J. Lawrence Wilson, the
company's chairman and chief executive.
'But they still are below the levels we feel we need to achieve to do well
in an industry where competition is becoming more and more fierce.'
He added that his company would have to do more to control internal costs.

issue next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is due to launch its
first issue of public debt in an eastern European currency on Monday with a
Ft1bn (Dollars 10m) bond issue, the first public bond in Hungarian forint
issued by an international borrower.
It is a move the EBRD hopes will lead to more funds being raised in regional
currencies, which would eliminate foreign exchange risk for borrowers and
assist the development of the country's capital market.
The issue, open to both Hungarian and foreign investors, and the first
tranche in a programme of up to Ft5bn (Dollars 50m), will help finance the
building of a toll motorway between Budapest and Vienna.
'If this programme is a success we hope to extend it as a standard bank
product to other eastern European markets such as the Czech and Slovak
Republics, and Poland,' said Mr Louis de Montpellier, director of funding at
the EBRD.
The initial Ft1bn tranche will be launched at par with a maturity of five
years and a coupon of 27.75 per cent per annum for the first six months
followed by a floating-rate coupon.

at Arco
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
The shrinking of the US oil and gas industry continued apace yesterday as
Atlantic Richfield announced a further Dollars 150m after-tax charge and a
plan to cut its workforce by 2,000 more people by the end of next year.
Late last year, Arco took a Dollars 450m charge and announced 1,500 job cuts
as part of a reorganisation of its US oil and gas business outside Alaska,
the location of its biggest US production activities.
Taken together, these moves will leave the company with annual costs which
are Dollars 400m lower by 1996, Mike Bowlin, Arco's president and chief
executive, said yesterday.
Like others, Los Angeles-based Arco is attempting to channel a greater share
of its capital spending into international ventures, which hold out the
prospect of bigger discoveries and higher profits margins.
Two weeks ago, Texaco announced it was cutting 2,500 workers and selling
half of its US oil-producing properties, while Chevron last week said it had
found a buyer for its San Francisco headquarters building, though the name
and likely sale price were not disclosed.
Among the latest round of job cuts at Arco, the company said it would reduce
its workforce in Alaska by 750. At the end of 1993, the company employed
25,000 people, 20,000 of them in the US.
The latest charge, to be taken in second-quarter figures due shortly,
results from improvements in the retirement and benefits package for former
workers. Much of the earlier, Dollars 450m charge reflected write-downs in
US assets.

Domtar will spend CDollars 250m (USDollars 182m) at the Quevillon mill to

American Barrick Resources, the North American gold producer expanding
internationally, has posted strong profit gains in the second quarter and
first half.
Gold output rose 24 per cent to 947,535 ounces in the first half, with most
of the gain at the Betze-Post mine in Nevada.
Average realised price was USDollars 404 per oz sold, against the average
spot price of Dollars 383 and with higher output, operating costs dipped to
Dollars 162 per oz, compared with Dollars 172 per oz.
Net profit in the June quarter was Dollars 62.4m or 22 cents a share against
Dollars 57.2m or 20 cents a year earlier, on gold sales of Dollars 207m,
against Dollars 175m. Gold sales were 513,412 oz, up from 427,741 oz.
First-half net profit improved to Dollars 122.8m, or 43 cents a share, from
Dollars 103.2m, or 36 cents, an increase of 19 per cent, on gold sales of
Dollars 395m, against Dollars 319m.
At June 30, Barrick had Dollars 382m in cash and short-term securities and
little debt.
According to Goldman Sachs and Salomon, Barrick will pass Placer Dome,
Newmont and Homestake to become North America's biggest gold producer with
output of 1.84m oz. It also holds one of the largest gold reserves.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Synergen hit by failure of its
main drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Synergen, once a star of the US biotechnology industry, has stopped
researching Antril, its biggest product, and announced a restructuring which
could lead to the company's sale.
More than half Synergen's 630 employees will lose their jobs as it reverts
to a business with no products in the pipeline for the medium term.
The Colorado company's manufacturing plant for Antril will be closed and put
up for sale. Selling the entire company was also a possibility, said Mr Greg
Abbott, chief executive.
Synergen shares fell yesterday by Dollars 4 to Dollars 4 7/8 . They were at
a peak of Dollars 66 1/4 in December 1992.
Antril, the company's main drug, was intended as a treatment for the complex
and dangerous condition called sepsis. It is the lastest in a series of
potential treatments to have failed and casts doubts on whether the
condition can be successfully treated by any single drug.

Skandia, the Swedish insurance group, said yesterday it had agreed in
principle to sell Skandia Texas Group, its Texan direct non-life operation,
to Omni Insurance Corp, a US company based in Atlanta, Georgia.
The move continues the Swedish company's efforts to disengage from direct
non-life business in the US, where it is giving greater emphasis to
reinsurance. It has sold two other direct non-life groups in the US over the
last year.
Skandia said its Texan operations, which generate about Dollars 55m in
annual premiums and were mainly focused on motor insurance lines, had not
been profitable enough. It said there were no plans to divest its remaining
US direct non-life businesses.

403m for Burns Fry

<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal plans to expand its investment banking operations in the US
and Canada with the acquisition of Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm.
The bank, Canada's third largest, will pay up to CDollars 403m (USDollars
290m) in cash and shares for Burns Fry, which is 26 per cent owned by San
Francisco-based Bank of America and 74 per cent by its employees. Bank of
America will receive just over CDollars 100m in cash.
Burns Fry, which has equity capital of CDollars 200m, will merge with
Nesbitt Thomson, the Montreal bank's wholly-owned securities subsidiary.
The deal is expected to close before the end of August.
The merged firm, to be known as Nesbitt Burns will employ about 3,700 people
and along with RBC Dominion Securities and Wood Gundy will be one of
Canada's main dominant securities dealers. All are owned by banks, which
were allowed to enter the securities business in 1987.
The Nesbitt/Burns deal is expected to increase pressure on ScotiaMcLeod, a
subsidiary of Bank of Nova Scotia, to expand through an acquisition or
merger.
Nesbitt and Burns have several overlapping businesses and outsiders predict
a large number of lay-offs, although Mr Brian Steck, Nesbitt chairman, said
yesterday redundancies would be minimal.
Executives of both firms yesterday identified opportunities in the US as one
of the main benefits of the merger.
Mr Steck said Nesbitt Burns would expand 'aggressively' its research
capability south of the border, build up an institutional salesforce based
in Chicago and New York, and seek a retail securities base.
Bank of Montreal has been the most active Canadian bank in the US.
It owns Harris Bankcorp of Chicago, and has set a goal of earning 50 per
cent of total income from US operations. The bank employs 160 people in its
US investment banking division.
Under the deal, Burns Fry shareholders will receive CDollars 283m in cash
and stock exchangeable over four years into a maximum of about 5m Bank of
Montreal shares.
Burns Fry shareholders can choose to receive up to CDollars 30m of the cash
payment in additional exchangeable stock.

<TEXT>
A group of black South African businessmen has announced plans to establish
a new R7bn (Dollars 1.91bn) company and list it on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange next month. If successful, the company will become by far the
largest black-owned and run commercial enterprise in South Africa.
The new company will be built around Methold, to be renamed New Africa
Investments Limited (Nail), a holding company under the control of Dr Nthato
Motlana, a medical doctor by training who until recently served as President
Nelson Mandela's personal physician, and several other prominent black
businessmen. Methold's main investment is a 10 per cent controlling stake in
Metropolitan Life, South Africa's fifth biggest life insurance company.
Nail will be 51 per cent owned by Corporate Africa, an investment vehicle
controlled by Dr Motlana and his partners.
Other leading shareholders will include Afrikaner-controlled insurance giant
Sankorp, the original owner of Metropolitan Life, with 20 per cent and trade
union federation NACTU with 9 per cent. There will be no public share
offering.
Prior to the listing, Methold will acquire a further 20 per cent of
Metropolitan. This will increase its stake to 30 per cent, the largest part
of the new company.
Methold will also acquire 100 per cent of Prosper Africa, another company
under the control of Dr Motlana, which has a controlling interest in The
Sowetan, South Africa's largest daily paper, and a 7 per cent effective
stake in MTN, one of the country's two main cellular phone providers.
To finance the transaction almost R500m has been raised from black business,
pension funds, provident funds and foreign and domestic institutions
including Morgan Stanley, the US merchant bank.
Dr Motlana will become executive chairman of the new group , which he hopes
will lay the foundation for a significant black presence in the South
African economy.
Other board members will include Mr Enos Mabuza, a former 'homeland' leader
turned businessman, Mr Jonty Sandler, a white businessman who has been
working with Dr Motlana for some time, and Mr Sam Motsuenyane, the founder
of the National African Federated Chambers of Commerce.

FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kugelfischer's ruthless survival
route - The ball-bearings group says its shake-up is unparalleled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter-Jurgen Kreher, chief executive of the FAG Kugelfischer
ball-bearings group, chuckles when he recalls giving a lecture to business
school students about the principles of crisis management.
'They sat there with their mouths open as I explained that the most
important thing was to do a daily check of your bank balance,' he says. 'You
must always know whether you've got any cash - or whether you've gone
broke.'
Such nitty-gritty details tend to be overlooked in Germany's academically
oriented business schools, Mr Kreher says. Had he not paid attention to the
daily fluctuations in cash flow when he took over at Kugelfischer early last
year, the group would not have survived.
As it is, Mr Kreher has implemented a restructuring plan which he claims is
without parallel in the Federal Republic of Germany - in terms of the speed
with which the plan was executed and the severity of the measures taken to
turn the group round.
At the heart of the group's restructuring was the near-halving of the
workforce - to 16,000 people at the beginning of 1994 from 31,000 a year
earlier.
Debts were halved to DM1bn (Dollars 625m) from DM2bn and turnover shrunk 13
per cent to DM3.12bn from DM3.56bn, reflecting the sale of a clutch of
subsidiaries identified as non-core businesses.
'We have achieved something gigantic here,' Mr Kreher boasted recently. He
predicted that the group, the second largest ball-bearings manufacturer in
the world after Sweden's SKF, would make a small profit in the current year
 -a reversal from heavy losses and near bankruptcy at the end of 1992.
The precarious position was in part due to worldwide recession which led
customers, especially car manufacturers, to cut back purchases of bearings.
But Kugelfischer's problems were compounded by heavy indebtedness and the
ill-fated acquisition of DKFL Deutsche Kugellagerfabrik, an east German
bearings manufacturer which Kugelfischer bought in 1990.
In a microcosm of the problems of eastern German industry, DKFL suffered a
large drop in sales as former markets in eastern Europe evaporated over
1991-92. When the deal was done in the heady days of German reunification
the assumption was that sales would reach DM1.2bn a year - but turnover in
the years after the acquisition was never more than a third of that level.
Recognising the gathering crisis Mr Fritz Schafer, a descendant of
Kugelfischer's founders who still owns a majority stake in the company,
called in a well-known company doctor in December 1992. This was Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, a former chief executive of the Hoesch steel group who was
hauled in by Germany's big banks last December to sort out the mess at
Metallgesellschaft, the metals, mining and industrial group which which came
close to bankruptcy.
Mr Neukirchen became chairman of Kugelfischer's supervisory board, devising
the ruthless blueprint for the company's survival. Mr Kreher, who was
appointed chairman of the management board, put the plan into practice. Mr
Kreher sums up the plan with a simple slogan: 'focusing replaces
diversification'. Important measures included:
The sale of all businesses which did not belong to the core activities:
these were defined as rolling-bearing manufacturing, sewing technology and
materials handling systems.
By January this year the group had sold 13 subsidiaries in sectors including
hydraulic brakes, textile machinery accessories, metrology and industrial
gauging and control systems, businesses which generated sales of DM720m in
1992. The quick-fire sales brought in DM740m and 5,200 jobs were shed in the
process.
In June last year, the group pulled out of its engagement in the
Leipzig-based DKFL, putting the subsidiary into liquidation and shedding
1,800 jobs. What had been one of the biggest producers of bearings in the
eastern bloc had lost about DM300m in 1992. The engagement cost Kugelfischer
DM1bn in total, Mr Kreher says.
Personnel reduction. On top of the jobs lost as a result of divestments,
Kugelfischer has made 8,200 employees redundant and plans further cuts this
year and next. The group has achieved annual net savings of about DM1bn as a
result.
Kugelfischer has cut costs further by using fewer materials, cutting
investment and stream-lining production. Management layers have been thinned
and the number of product-lines made by the group has been slashed to 25,000
from 320,000.
The net result of these measures was that Kugelfischer reported a sharp
reduction in losses last year. At the parent company they were DM94m after
DM630m in the previous year, although the losses would have been more
substantial but for DM35m in extraordinary profits.
Kugelfischer's restructuring is symptomatic of the kind of rationalisation
set in motion at dozens of big German companies during the recession. Among
German companies with a stock market listing, analysts expect large
increases in earnings for the current year as rationalisation takes effect.

<TEXT>
GEC Alsthom, the transport and power engineering company jointly owned by
France's Alcatel Alsthom and GEC of the UK, yesterday announced a rise of 7
per cent in net profits for the year to the end of March, to Ecu329m
(Dollars 279m) from Ecu308m.
The net result was achieved on stable sales of Ecu7.93bn and operating
profits of Ecu640m, a rise of 15 per cent over 1992-93.
The company, which was formed five years ago, said it had maintained its
rate of growth of new contracts, receiving orders worth Ecu9.32bn during the
year. This took the year-end order book to a record Ecu17bn, GEC Alsthom
said.
The figures for last year's orders do not include the Dollars 2.1bn contract
to supply high-speed trains and related equipment to South Korea. The
contract, which was signed in June, followed several years of negotiations
and was won in the face of competition from a German consortium headed by
Siemens.
Since the end of the last financial year, GEC Alsthom has expanded through
the acquisition of a controlling stake in Linke-Hofmann-Busch, a German
manufacturer of rail equipment. The acquisition, announced last month, is an
important step into the German market, and strengthen's GEC Alsthom's
presence in urban, suburban and inter-city rail equipment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leslie Wise Group, the clothing manufacturer and distributor, reported
static profits of Pounds 1.24m pre-tax for the six months to May 31, against
Pounds 1.23m.
The figure was struck after a Pounds 93,000 redundancy and trading loss at
the garment manufacturing subsidiary and a Pounds 50,000 loss incurred in
developing the new import division.
Turnover for the Leicester-based company rose 18 per cent from Pounds 22.6m
to Pounds 26.8m mainly because of the increase by the specialist design
companies.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 2.38p and the interim dividend is held
at 1.75p.
Mr Neil Wise, chairman, said the second half had started well with turnover
in June and July 'significantly ahead' of last year. He added that the
traditional trading pattern was moving towards a stronger second half.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: The world is its jigsaw - A look at
Medeva's strategy of adding value to acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Medeva's share price halved after a profits warning a year ago today,
Mr Bernard Taylor, the acquisitive pharmaceuticals group's chairman, said it
would take time to rebuild investor confidence. He was dead right.
Although the shares have regained some of the lost ground relative to the
market, they have recovered by less than 10 per cent. Yet Medeva has done
much to calm investors' concerns.
Following the warning it put its acquisition plans on hold and used the
pause to strengthen its management and controls. Its 1993 figures emerged
comfortably above the City's (lowered) expectations, showing strong
underlying growth, and its founder, Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, stepped down as
managing director, a move welcomed by some in the City.
But still the share price failed to respond, suggesting there may be more
fundamental concerns.
One is the general nervousness about the pharmaceuticals sector as a whole
caused by pressure on prices around the world and in particular healthcare
reforms in the US.
Relative to the depressed sector, Medeva's shares have performed rather
better, perhaps reflecting the company's claim that it will be less hurt by
the reforms than many of its rivals.
This is partly because many of its products are low-cost rivals to branded
market leaders, and may benefit from switching by purchasers. In addition,
Mr Bill Bogie, chief executive, believes that structural changes in the
industry will throw up more opportunities for Medeva.
'The majors have to cut costs and are looking hard at their product lines
and sales forces in order to concentrate on their strengths.'
Mr Bogie predicts that they will sell on more of their smaller products, or
at least put them through other companies' specialist sales forces.
When it comes to buying other people's established products, even the
sceptics cannot knock Medeva's record. In almost all cases the deals have
been successful, in some cases, spectacularly so.
In May 1991, Medeva spent Dollars 77m on MD Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer
of specialised generic drugs which has grown so fast it has virtually paid
for itself already.
This has been the most successful aspect of the strategy developed by Mr
Gowrie-Smith and Mr Taylor. The idea was to build a pharmaceuticals company
that could generate growth without heavy investment in research and
development by acquiring products which were already established or in the
final stages of development.
Medeva would add value partly by building an international sales force that
could push products which were only established in local markets.
Pursuing this plan, it has built up a number of specialist sales forces
around the world, notably in the US respiratory market. Now 220-strong, this
is now picking up some promising products under licence, most recently a new
hay fever treatment from Wellcome.
But there are clear gaps in its network. One close observer of the company
says: 'The profit warning caught Medeva in the middle of constructing its
jigsaw and left it with some large holes. In some areas it has products but
no sales force and in others a sales force but no products.'
The slump in the share price makes further acquisitions much more difficult,
and though it has a reasonably strong balance sheet, without a recovery in
its rating its options are much more limited.
It has been suggested that Medeva is interested in Boots' pharmaceuticals
division, but given that Medeva's market value of Pounds 375m is about half
the likely price tag of the Boots business, buying all or a large part of it
would be a very big step.
Mr Bogie admits that further geographical expansion is on hold for now and
that the focus is on building up the product portfolio. Although the group's
sales are showing strong growth, most of its products have a limited life
given their lack of patent protection. So the medicine cabinet will need
some new blood before long.
Yet a key part of the Medeva strategy, buying products in late stage
development, has yet to bring any results. Most disappointing has been the
year's delay on the expected filing of the Hepatitis B vaccine acquired two
years ago.
Although many City analysts are now positive about Medeva, some remain
sceptical about the prospects for a small company in an industry where size
and vertical integration are seen as increasingly vital.
One City observer says: 'Medeva has still got a lot to prove. Maybe the
strategy is sound and it will be possible to construct a significant
pharmaceuticals group along these lines. But maybe there was a window of
opportunity which Medeva is in danger of missing because of the share price
slump.'
Medeva has a number of attractive businesses, particularly in respiratory
products and vaccines, but some analysts question whether the whole should
be valued at more than the sum of the parts. If not, perhaps more value
would be generated by selling them off.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fleming American Investment Trust, which seeks capital growth through a
portfolio of mainly listed US stocks, had a fully diluted net asset value of

Available revenue for the half year improved to Pounds 845,000 (Pounds
590,000), for earnings of 1.26p (0.89p) per share. The interim dividend,

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lancs Enterprises rises 5% to Pounds 1.43m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancashire Enterprises, the local economic development company, made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.43m in the half year to April 30, an increase of 5 per
cent.
The interim dividend rises 8 per cent to 1.35p (1.25p). The shares are
traded on a matched bargain basis.
Earnings per share were 5.4p (4.5p), after taking into account a share split
and a 1-for-1 scrip issue in March.
Turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds 7.55m (Pounds 6.17m), but profitability
was affected by business development costs, including the launch of
Partnership UK, which offers packages of employment and economic initiatives
to local authorities, and a consultancy service for developing countries,
particularly in eastern Europe.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Medeva founder shows preference for privacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, who stepped down as managing director of Medeva in
March, is not really cut out for public company life. Apart from anything
else, when things go wrong it is just a bit too public for his taste.
He is a relaxed and outgoing Australian but also values his privacy and has
not enjoyed the media attention he has received over the past year.
It has been a pretty mixed press. Even before last year's profits warning
there was talk of a whispering campaign aimed at ousting him from the board.
After the share price plunged it was suggested that only his removal would
restore City confidence. And coverage of his move to a non-executive role
centred on the size of his pay-off.
No whinger, he is nevertheless clearly hurt by his treatment at the hands of
the press. He particularly resents the suggestion that he was responsible
for the problems at the two US subsidiaries last year, pointing out that he
was only briefly non-executive president of the American operations.
He also attacks the suggestion that the problems revealed a fundamental flaw
in the group's hectic acquisition strategy. 'Every acquisition has an
element of gamble and it is the total result that determines success or
failure.'
Although Medeva is a long way from becoming 'one of the most successful
companies in British corporate history', as he predicted, he is proud of
what he has achieved since founding the company in 1987.
Then called Medirace, Mr Gowrie-Smith brought it to the market with just the
rights to a drug whose development has since been dropped. 'The market was
looking for Aids and cancer plays at the time and one thing I am good at is
spotting opportunities and selling ideas.'
Another thing he is good at is doing deals. 'He may not have gone down that
well with everyone in the City but you have to admit he pulled off some
great acquisitions for Medeva,' says one analyst.
He hopes to do more working for Medeva on a consultancy basis through his
company Brightstone. Formed with long-time business partner Mr David Lees,
who resigned as Medeva's finance director in March, the company is looking
at a number of projects as well as searching out deals for Medeva. Mr
Gowrie-Smith is particularly interested in commercial property where he
believes there are now many opportunities.
He is guaranteed consultancy fees from Medeva of almost Pounds 1m over the
next three years. But he has an incentive to produce the goods as a large
part of his wealth is tied up in Medeva shares.
He admits to being much happier outside Medeva, which is inevitably
developing the big company culture he hates.
As a result, he says it is unlikely he will return to the public company
scene; but then he pauses; 'You can run quite a large property company
without a large head office. The real question is whether being public is
worth the loss of privacy.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish in Pounds 4.2m expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As part of its expansion programme, Court Cavendish Group, the nursing home
operator which came to the market a year ago, has acquired three care homes
in Cambridgeshire for Pounds 4.19m cash.
Dr Chai Patel, executive chairman, said the purchase of the homes, with a
total of 108 registered beds, gave a good start to the current acquisition
programme which aims to add about 500 beds.
Two of the homes have the potential to add 35 more beds.
The last financial statements of the two companies owning and operating the
homes showed a combined operating profit of Pounds 365,023 and a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 171,699. The three homes are now producing operating
profits at an annualised rate of Pounds 675,000.
In the year to April 30 1994 pre-tax profits of Court Cavendish rose from
Pounds 194,000 to Pounds 3.09m before exceptional costs of Pounds 600,000.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low responds to request from Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group which is the target of an agreed
takeover bid by Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket chain, confirmed
yesterday it had responded to a request for information from Tesco's bigger
rival, J Sainsbury.
Tesco, which in a deal worth Pounds 200m is offering 225p in cash for each
Wm Low ordinary share and 105 1/2 p for each convertible preference share,
is expected to issue its offer document this morning.
However, speculation continued to mount yesterday that Sainsbury was
preparing to make a counter-bid for the retailer, which has 57 stores and 7
per cent of the Scottish grocery market.
Wm Low said it had responded to a list of questions from Sainsbury - and
agreed the terms of a confidentiality letter - giving it the same
information it had supplied to Tesco.
Sainsbury does not have a history of making hostile bids, but analysts
believe Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, may be prepared to break with the
past.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: N&amp;P launches home insurance products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National &amp; Provincial Building Society yesterday launched a new range of
home insurance products in what could be a prelude to a move into general
insurance under the proposed new powers for societies.
N&amp;P, the UK's eighth-largest society, said it would go into general
insurance if it decided that customers would benefit, for example, through
greater flexibility in products that could be offered.
'The new legislative plans open up quite a big opportunity for building
societies,' said Mr Michael Pendle, N&amp;P's director of general insurance.
He said the new Homechoice range of insurance policies was competitively
priced and offered great flexibility.
Mr David Conway, customer requirements director, said the price
competitiveness had been achieved partly through negotiations with the
insurance companies to reduce the costs of manufacturing the policies, and
partly through N&amp;P cutting its margins 'in some cases very substantially'.
'Building societies have perhaps been too cosy with insurers,' he said.
N&amp;P is initially targeting the new products at its existing 2.8m customers,
savers as well as borrowers.
Some 400,000 to 450,000 customers already have building and contents
insurance with N&amp;P.

pay-off

<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan's former finance director and former chief executive, who
both resigned from the Glasgow-based waste contractor unexpectedly, received
a total of Pounds 761,000 in compensation payments.
The payments cover Mr Roger Hewitt, the chief executive who resigned in
January when the group issued a profits warning, and Mr Alastair Fowler, the
finance director who resigned at the end of September. They are disclosed in
the group's annual report.
The company, which last month cut its dividend by 43 per cent after
announcing a plunge into the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 6m for the
year to March 26, declined to identify the size of the individual payments.
However, Mr David Downes, who succeeded Mr Fowler as finance director, noted
that both men had three-year employment contracts. All executive directors
are now on two-year contracts.
According to the annual report the compensation payment includes the
estimated Pounds 10,000 value of a car.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: OIS shares fall 18p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning by OIS International Inspection, which provides technical
inspection services to the construction, petrochemical and power generation
industries, knocked a third off the share price yesterday.
Shares in OIS, which came to the market at the end of 1992 at 50p, closed
18p down at 36p.
Mr James Mayne, chairman, said reduced margins and the loss of a number of
contracts meant the company expected 'no better than a break-even position'
on turnover of Pounds 19m when it reports interim results in September.
Mr Mayne said the company had already acted to reduce overheads and achieve
annual cost savings of more than Pounds 1m.
He said the directors believed the steps being taken would 'result in a
return to profitability in the second half of the year'.
However, results for the 1994 year were likely to be significantly lower
than last time when pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.21m on turnover of
Pounds 46.7m.
For the six months to June 30 1993 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.44m on
turnover of Pounds 24.2m.
Mr Mayne said most of the company's operations had suffered from deferred
contracts but that the losses had been most keenly felt in the Aberdeen and
African locations.
Shell, BP, British Gas and Nuclear Electric are among OIS's customers, while
its overseas operations are concentrated in the Middle East, east Asia and
Africa.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brewin Dolphin, the private client stockbroker, pleased the market with a 94
per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 2.55m for
the 27 weeks to June 17.
The shares, which started trading on June 9, rose 5p to 149p, compared with
the flotation price of 150p.
The profits growth was aided by a full six month contribution from its Bell
Lawrie subsidiary, which had provided only two months input in 1993.
In addition, the previous figures were affected by a Pounds 330,000
provision, reflecting the cost of the cancellation of Taurus.
Total turnover increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 11.5m),
helped by strong trading volumes during the first quarter of the year.
Mr John Hall, managing director, said the advisory and execution-only
business had been adversely affected by the slowdown in the stock market in
the second quarter of the year, but profits were still ahead of the previous
year.
The company is paying a 1p interim dividend, which was half the rate it
would have paid if it had been listed for the entire period.
It has undertaken, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to pay a
final distribution of 4p.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Administration costs push ML Laboratories
into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML Laboratories, one of the larger start-up healthcare companies quoted in
London, saw a sharp rise in costs in the first half of 1994 as it moved
towards marketing its first product, Icodial, a kidney failure treatment.
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 1.4m in the six months to March 1994,
from Pounds 894,742 a year earlier, pushing the company to a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 953,047, compared with a profit of Pounds 65,089.
Sales fell from Pounds 467,242 to Pounds 385,851 because of deferred royalty
receipts.
Pre-tax profit was also affected by a fall in investment income from Pounds
737,792 to Pounds 339,551 as the company ran down its cash pile to pay for
the increased administrative costs. The company ended the period with Pounds
11.3m (Pounds 14.8m) on deposit.
Losses per share were 0.7p, against earnings last time of 0.1p.
Icodial was launched in the UK last month. Mr Stuart Sim, finance director,
said there would be no significant sales until the next financial year.
The company is in talks concerning a detailed marketing agreement with
Fresenius, the German specialist in dialysis. In March, an interim
arrangement gave Fresenius exclusive rights to sell Icodial in all markets
apart from Japan.
ML Laboratories was floated on the Third Market in 1987, and moved to the
USM in 1990.
COMMENT
ML Laboratories is either wildly overvalued or one of the most extraordinary
bargains on the London Stock Exchange. If its drug is a success, it should
take a huge slice out of a Pounds 500m-a-year market and make its current
market capitalisation of almost Pounds 300m look puny. Failure means a
return to obscurity. The bull story is that ML Labs now has a product on the
market, which means that two of the biggest risks - scientific and
regulatory - have been overcome. The third risk is marketing, which is being
addressed by the deal and continuing talks with Fresenius. Finally, can the
entrepreneurs that launched a small company take the business into world
market? The details of the Fresenius deal should not only sort out any
lingering doubts over marketing, but demonstrate whether top management has
the skills to fight it out at the highest level.

Wellman, the specialist engineering group, yesterday announced a large-scale
expansion through the Pounds 46m acquisition of three businesses from FKI,
the electrical engineering and components group.
The deal, funded partly by a Pounds 32m placing and open offer, will
increase Wellman's market capitalisation from Pounds 12m to Pounds 54m, with
turnover predicted to jump from Pounds 22.3m to about Pounds 130m.
Under the transaction, Wellman has agreed to pay FKI Pounds 30m from the
placing and open offer - involving 88.9m new ordinary shares at 36p - while
also issuing to FKI Pounds 10m of convertible preference shares and Pounds
6m of loan stock.
Existing shareholders will be offered new shares on a 5-for-4 basis, and
5-for-1 for preference shareholders. The issue has been underwritten by
Singer &amp; Friedlander.
Mr Geoffrey Iley, Wellman chairman, said the acquisition would transform the
Midlands-based group from a lossmaking operation into one with the potential
for profits and growth.
'This deal gives us critical mass. After some pretty poor results, we had to
make the existing business viable and to expand.'
It follows more than six months of talks with FKI, which has agreed to sell
three subsidiary groups: Transport Equipment, comprising four businesses
making equipment for the automotive, garage and car parking market; Data
Recording Instruments; and Babcock Robey, the boiler and pressure vessel
manufacturer.
The FKI companies made operating profits of Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 3.61m) on
turnover of Pounds 91.8m (Pounds 91m) in the year to March 31 1994. Mr Iley
said the figure had been dented by exceptional restructuring provisions of
Pounds 2.07m which were 'unlikely to recur in the future'.
For the same period, Wellman reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.07m (Pounds
681,000 profits).
Wellman, however, said its performance had improved following the arrival
last November of Mr Alan Baxter, a former FKI director, as chief executive.
Mr Baxter, who first approached FKI with the acquisition proposal, has been
credited with cutting Wellman's costs by 16 per cent and winning record
orders of Pounds 24m this year.
Mr Iley also announced a dividend for the current year of not less than
1.44p, pending approval of the deal.
For FKI, yesterday's deal marked another stage in its phased withdrawal from
non-core businesses. Mr Eric Bowers, finance director, said the disposals
would enable the group to concentrate on four main areas: automotive
components, hardware, engineering, and materials handling.
'It was always our aim to get rid of peripheral businesses, and Wellman was
the only group to make an offer for the lot.' FKI plans to use the Pounds
30m payment to cut its Pounds 122m net borrowings, reducing gearing from 60
per cent to 44 per cent.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Unipalm exceeds its forecast at flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unipalm Group, the Cambridge-based computer communications company which was
placed on the main market in March, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 272,000 for the 12 months to April 30, exceeding the flotation
forecast.
The outcome, which compared with profits of Pounds 605,000 last time, came
on turnover ahead to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 8.39m).
As well as its Unipalm interconnection software distribution activities, the
company has high hopes for Pipex, a specialist in attaching commercial
customers to the Internet - a self-regulating global computer network.
The distribution side reported profits of Pounds 716,000 pre-tax, partially
offset by losses of Pounds 444,000 at Pipex, reflecting substantial
investment in 'people, equipment and infrastructure' according to the
company.
Mr Peter Dawe, managing director, said, however, that Pipex had had 'a
remarkable year'. Turnover jumped from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds 1.43m. It
had achieved a growth rate of 10 per cent a month with record orders in
June. Public interest continued to grow, he said, with more than 250
organisations now using Internet through Pipex.
'We've shown that we've put the foundations in. Now we're building the upper
storeys,' he said.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.89p, down from 2.9p, but again beating the
company's own estimate at flotation.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ready for China to westernise - A look at
Zeneca's moves to exploit the changing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, the agrochemicals and
pharmaceuticals group, believes his company is putting the building blocks
in place for what will be a long-term and lucrative involvement in China.
Speaking in Beijing recently after announcing plans to invest Dollars 100m
(Pounds 66m) over the next five years in China, he said Zeneca's approach
was to 'treat each market as a domestic market and develop from within'.
In seeking to position itself in China, Zeneca has opted for a two-pronged
strategy that rests on production locally of agrochemicals such as paraquat,
the active ingredient in the Gramoxone wide-application herbicide; and on
the establishment of co-operative arrangements in the marketing and eventual
manufacture of pharmaceuticals.
For a company of Zeneca's size and reach - 1993 turnover was Dollars 6.7bn -
its involvement in China is modest. Sales of its agrochemicals and
pharmaceuticals totalled just Dollars 44m last year. This represents a
negligible share of regional sales, which account for about 15 per cent of
Zeneca's global business. The company was floated in London and New York
last year following its demerger from ICI.
But Mr Barnes is confident that, in spite of its limited presence in China,
Zeneca is poised for fairly rapid expansion. Within the next few weeks it
will announce an agreement with a Chinese joint venture partner to produce
paraquat, probably in the Yangtze delta within reach of its biggest markets.
The company is also fairly close to agreement on the establishment of a
plant in the Shenzen special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong to produce
specialty chemicals used in high value-added products such as dyes, printing
ink and resins.
At the same time Zeneca is in the process of forming a joint venture
consultancy to be known as the Sino-Pharm Development Consulting Company.
Its partner in this venture is Sino-Pharm, the foreign trade corporation of
the State Pharmaceutical Administration of China.
This strategic link with the state pharmaceutical marketing authority is
aimed at opening China to a number of Zeneca's more sophisticated products,
including Diprivan, its intravenous anaesthetic, Tenormin, a heart drug, and
Nolvades for the treatment of breast cancer.
The company hopes the consultancy will lead to manufacturing ventures as
demand among affluent Chinese increases for 'expensive' drugs.
Indeed, Western-style medicines have been growing at a faster pace than
traditional Chinese medicines and account for 65 per cent of the total
Chinese pharmaceuticals market, which was worth about Dollars 4bn in 1992.
Imports of pharmaceutical products account for about 10 per cent of the
total and have been achieving year-on-year growth in excess of 20 per cent
for the past decade.
Zeneca executives say an important new and helpful development in China is
the fact that the Chinese now appear to be taking more seriously
international concerns about infringements of intellectual property rights.
Dr David Jones, Asia Pacific representative for Zeneca agrochemicals, said
that a 'tightening up' on abuses of patents has 'given us the confidence to
bring in our best technology. Before we were not sure we could defend our
technology'.
Dr Jones said that in China these days there was 'tremendous demand' for
high quality herbicides. He expected sales of paraquat to 'grow
exponentially' as farmers sought more effective ways of reducing their
workload.
The new Zeneca agrochemicals plant will produce initially 15m litres of
paraquat, sufficient for the manufacture of 3,000 tonnes of Gramoxone - more
than enough for China.
Zeneca pharmaceuticals expects that, in time, it will secure a 'significant
franchise' in the anti-cancer field in China. Among factors weighing in the
company's calculations is the likelihood of an increase in various cancers,
including colon and rectal cancers, as living standards rise.
Mr David Nelson, general manager of Zeneca Pharma International, said the
aim was to 'build a broad purpose pharmaceutical company'. The Zeneca
Sino-Pharm consultancy was merely a first step. Planned initial investment
is Dollars 20m.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Archer to acquire rival agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Archer Group, the Lloyd's agency, is to acquire Cox Group, a rival agency.
Cox's principal operating subsidiary is the Cox Tudsbery &amp; Wills members'
agency. The acquisition is one of a number of takeovers by bigger agents at
the insurance market, which has been hard hit by five years of heavy losses.
Under the proposal, Archer, which has a market capitalisation of about
Pounds 19m, will issue to Cox shareholders new shares equal to approximately
5 per cent of Archer's outstanding equity.
Subject to regulatory approval the deal will be completed during October.

FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Strong second quarter at WMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste Management International, the UK-listed arm of WMX Technologies of the
US, reported strong second-quarter turnover and profit increases underpinned
by volume growth and acquisitions.
Pre-tax profit for the three months to June 30 increased by 18 per cent to
Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 37.1m) on revenues ahead 22 per cent to Pounds 286.9m
(Pounds 234.9m). The quarterly results lifted pre-tax profit for the first
half to Pounds 82.2m (Pounds 71.5m) on turnover up 19 per cent to Pounds
542.9m (Pounds 455.7m). Mr Nigel Wilson, finance director, said volume
growth accounted for 14 percentage points of turnover growth in the second
quarter, price increases generated 2 percentage points of the increase and
acquisitions added 8 percentage points, while currency movements reduced
growth by 2 percentage points.
Operating profits in the second quarter increased by 20 per cent from Pounds
39m to Pounds 46.7m and from Pounds 73.3m to Pounds 88.6m for the first
half.
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the group had made 'good progress'
during the second quarter with sustained growth in both revenue and profits.
'These results have been achieved through a balance of new projects,
acquisitions, productivity gains and cost reductions,' he said. 'While
pricing has remained weak, we have experienced volume growth in some
markets. In Europe, our business performance has been mixed, in part
reflecting the slow and uneven economic recovery in the region.'
During the quarter the group spent Pounds 13m on 16 small acquisitions
including purchases in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
Sweden and the UK.
Earnings per share increased by 9 per cent to 7.3p (6.7p) for the quarter
and by 7 per cent to 13.6p (12.7p) for the half year, with higher minority
interests partly offset by a reduced tax rate.

FT  19 JUL 94 / 3i shares jump 20 1/2 p on first day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of 3i, one of the largest of this year's share offers,
provided a pleasant surprise for subscribers yesterday when its shares
jumped 20 1/2 p to 292 1/2 p on their first day of trading.
The shares had been marketed as a quality institutional shareholding rather
than a stagging opportunity, and the public offer was only 1.1 times
subscribed.
In contrast, Exco, the moneybroker which starts trading today, was seen as a
better target for stags because of its relatively cheaper price. Its offer
was 3.2 times subscribed and a healthy premium is expected today above its
175p offer price.
Analysts attributed 3i's strong performance to instutitional buying in the
market after their allocations had been scaled down. The institutional
offer, valued at Pounds 533.6m, had been 1.7 times subscribed.
'I am pleasantly surprised,' said Mr Hamish Buchan, director of equities at
NatWest Securities. 'But people should bear in mind that small companies
have been weak since March 31, and they have not participated in the latest
stock market rally.'
The FT-SE Small Cap index has fallen 5.9 per cent since 3i's assets -
investments in small companies - were valued on March 31. Analysts suggested
3i's assets would have fallen in value by a similar degree.
At the issue price, 3i shares were valued at a 13 per cent discount to their
March asset value. The company offered 45 per cent of its shares (261.6m in
total), of which three quarters went to institutions. The institutional
portion was well supported, but only a small proportion of the 385,000
private investors who registered for a prospectus actually applied for
shares.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Microsoft rises as Gates plays down settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft's settlement of anti-trust charges with the US Justice Department
and European competition authorities will have 'no material impact' on
financial performance, according to Mr Bill Gates, chairman and founder of
the software company.
The settlement, which requires Microsoft to modify its operating system
licensing practices, 'eliminates something that could have become a major
distraction', Mr Gates said yesterday.
He reiterated his belief that Microsoft had never done anything
'inappropriate or illegal'. The company's success in selling operating
systems programs for PCs was based on demand, not on licensing terms.
Industry analysts said Microsoft 'got off easy' on Justice Department
charges that it 'built a barricade of exclusionary and unreasonably
restrictive licensing agreements to deny others an opportunity to develop
and market competing products'.
Investors appeared to concur with this view as Microsoft's share price rose
Dollars 1 7/8 yesterday to reach Dollars 50 1/2 by the close.
Mr Gates said Microsoft's future remained dependent upon its ability to
'continue to come up with great products'. The settlement provided the
company with an opportunity to do that without the burden of a costly legal
battle.
Competition authorities had examined several issues raised by competitors,
Microsoft said. Most were not pursued and the settlement covered only
licensing practices and non-disclosure.
The settlement does not address concern in the software industry that
Microsoft gains unfair advantages as a developer of both operating systems,
which control the basic functions of a computer, and applications programs
such as wordprocessors, games and spreadsheets.
Microsoft is the largest seller of applications for use with its own Windows
operating system. This dual role is its principal advantage, according to
software industry executives, because Microsoft's applications developers
have earlier and better access to details of next-generation systems than
their competitors.
However, Mr Bill Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said this issue did
not come up in the discussions. 'We can conclude that the government decided
that it had no basis on which to act on these complaints.'
For the next six and a half years, the duration of the settlement,
Microsoft's business activities will be monitored by the US Justice
Department and European competition authorities.

FT  19 JUL 94 / BBA executive departs after disagreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday announced that
one of its most senior managers was leaving after a fundamental disagreement
with Mr Roberto Quarta, the chief executive recruited last year to conduct a
root-and-branch restructuring.
Mr Peter Crawford, chief executive of the group's automotive division, was
told early yesterday that his tier of management was being abolished and
that Mr Quarta was taking over his responsibilities.
Mr Quarta, who earlier this year announced a proposed dividend cut and 2,000
job losses, said Mr Crawford's departure was part of a general review. He
did not rule out further job losses among senior executives.
The 44-year-old chief executive, who arrived from BTR last November, said he
had given the existing management six months to respond to new objectives.
'I spelt out the aim to achieve double-digit growth by 1996, and the
automotive division was the key to that improvement.'
Profits in the automotive division fell 42.8 per cent to Pounds 21.5m last
year, while its turnover of Pounds 574.1m represented 40.5 per cent of the
group total. Following that performance, Mr Quarta is said to have clashed
with Mr Crawford over strategy.
Mr Crawford is understood to have called for increased investment in product
development in the hope that the division would exploit an upturn in motor
manufacturing. Mr Quarta, however, was keen to cut the cost base.
'I decided it would be better to deal directly with the businesses in
automotive,' he said. 'I believe in short lines of communication.'
Mr George Cartwright, chief executive of the friction materials business,
and Mr Bob Gaunt, managing director of power transmission systems, will
report directly to Mr Quarta.
Mr Crawford, who earned around Pounds 150,000 a year on a two-year rolling
contract, was yesterday said to be discussing his severance terms.
Although he has been a director of the division and its predecessor
Automotive Products for almost 10 years, it is thought unlikely he will
receive the full Pounds 300,000 pay-off.
Mr Quarta added that he wanted to expand the automotive division's new
friction materials business in North America.
The shares fell 2p to 206p.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Synergen hit by failure of its main drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Synergen, once a star of the US biotechnology industry, has stopped
researching Antril, its biggest product, and announced a restructuring which
could lead to the company's sale.
More than half of the group's 630 employees will lose their jobs as Synergen
reverts to a business with no products in the pipeline for the medium term.
The company, based in Boulder, Colorado, had built a manufacturing plant for
Antril. This will be closed and put up for sale. Selling the entire company
was also a possibility, said Mr Greg Abbott, chief executive.
Synergen shares fell yesterday by Dollars 4 to Dollars 4 7/8 . They were at
a peak of Dollars 66 1/4 in December 1992.
Antril, the company's main drug, was intended as a treatment for the complex
and dangerous condition called sepsis. It is the lastest in a series of
potential treatments to have failed and casts doubts on whether the
condition can be successfully treated by any single drug.
Other companies researching similar sepsis treatments include UK
biotechnology companies Celltech and British Biotechnology, Wellcome of the
UK and Japan's Fujisawa.
Mr James Noble, finance director of British Biotechnology, conceded
yesterday that no one drug would ever be able to cure all sepsis patients.
Earlier this year, Californian biotechnology company Chiron abandoned its
sepsis research programme. Other failures in recent years include Centocor
and Xoma, whose share prices collapsed when, like Synergen, they abandoned
research in Phase III development, the last and most expensive of the phases
of clinical trials.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Battling with the double whammy: Why the heat is on
corporate treasurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reversal in the interest rate cycle and resulting turmoil in the bond
markets this year has hit corporate treasurers with a double whammy, as
funding costs rise and the value of investments falls.
In recent years, many companies have raised fixed-rate finance but swapped
the proceeds into variable-rate debt. When interest rates rise, these swaps
are likely to become costly.
At the same time, companies with large amounts of cash to invest may also
have been hit by the fall in bond prices. Glaxo's Pounds 100m loss  - mainly
on structured bonds and collateralised mortgage obligations - has focused
corporate treasurers' attention on the potential risks lurking in their
investment portfolios.
Like the losses on derivatives incurred by companies such as Procter &amp;
Gamble and Metallgesellschaft, the lesson seems to be that unless controls,
on both the investment and liability sides of the business, are tightly
drafted and strictly enforced, there is no guarantee that individual traders
will act responsibly or that risk will be managed effectively.
'Our philosophy is to have a floating-rate portfolio, which will not
substantially alter in value (as rates go up and down) since it might be
needed by the company,' said Mr Stephen Crompton, director of treasury at
SmithKline Beecham. The Anglo-US healthcare group sold its investment
portfolio before the acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services in
May.
The rapid reversal of interest rate trends this year has created an
extremely difficult environment for corporate treasurers. 'The violent
reaction of US rates has made us reconsider the balance of fixed versus
floating rate,' said Mr Doug Rees, financing director at Merck, the US
pharmaceuticals group.
He said that the company, which has outstanding commercial paper borrowings,
would like to reduce the floating-rate component of its debt portfolio.
However, because of the steepness of the yield curve in the US bond market,
it is not a very attractive time to lock into longer-dated fixed-rate
borrowings.
'It shouldn't be regarded as the treasurer's role to chop and change the
interest rate profile of assets and liabilities around short-term
considerations,' argues Mr Derek Ross, partner in charge of treasury at
Touche Ross. 'That's the route to running into problems, on investment
portfolios and on derivatives.'
Glaxo is unlikely to be the only company to have suffered substantial
investment losses. One pharmaceuticals and chemicals analyst said he knew of
several European companies which are suffering from the effects of turmoil
in the financial markets, including the currency markets.
'Obviously companies that are cash-rich and asset-rich are the hardest hit
at a time when there is a spike upwards in interest rates,' said one dealer
at a large London-based corporate treasury. However, this is not always the
case. For example Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company renowned for its
cash pile, stated that in the first six months of the year its financial
income was again ahead of the first six months of 1993.
However, many companies are loath to discuss what their policies are, and
many analysts are struggling to factor in potential losses made on
investments this year. Further complicating such calculations is uncertainty
about how fully companies with substantial US sales have hedged themselves
against the decline in the dollar.
'My experience is that most companies seem to give their treasury a lot more
flexibility than I would expect them to,' said Mr Archie Donaldson, a
director of the MTM Partnership and former treasurer of ICI.
Mr Ross also thinks there is some room for companies to tighten up
procedures.
'The area where there is weakness is that very few companies have a clear
strategy of what the mixture of fixed-rate and floating-rate liabilities
should be for a minimum risk profile,' according to Mr Ross. 'Most have gone
through that process with foreign exchange but the skills for undertaking
this process on the interest-rate side are less developed.'
The Association of Corporate Treasurers, of which Mr Ross is chairman, is
preparing guidelines for companies dealing in the derivatives markets, which
are likely to be similar to the Group of Thirty's recommendations for
dealers published last year.
In some cases, the issue comes down to the conflict over how to run a
treasury division, in particular, whether it should operate as a profit
centre or a cost centre.
'If management puts the treasurer under pressure to achieve returns which
are out of line with market rates, then inevitably a higher degree of risk
will be assumed,' Mr Ross believes. In some cases treasurers have a package
which relates to their contribution to the business, and may encourage them
to seek profits more aggressively, even if this involves greater risk.
However, Touche Ross recently completed a survey of 50 UK companies which
showed that only 7 per cent treated treasury as a profit centre, and only 10
per cent allowed companies to trade rather than just hedge positions.
For the derivatives specialists at investment banks, the problems of
corporate treasurers have brought in some fresh business.
'There are plenty of corporate treasurers who got themselves into trades
which started to look pretty ugly,' said one investment banker. 'Those who
are running treasury operations as profit centres have had a good run in the
last couple of years and had started to get more adventurous.' For example,
he says that corporate treasurers who undertook 'range' trades - taking the
view that interest rates or currencies would remain within a certain
designated range by entering swap transactions or buying structure notes -
found that instead of owning higher-yielding investments, they were left
holding loss-making and often illiquid positions.
As for company treasurers, perhaps they will take comfort from the fact that
those worst hit by the turmoil in the financial markets this year are banks
and securities houses, whose first- half results have shown more than a dent
already.

FT  19 JUL 94 / One-off factors help US banks advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan and Nations-Bank, two of the US's biggest commercial banks,
comfortably beat market forecasts with post-tax earnings gains of 32 per
cent and 43 per cent respectively in the second quarter.
Both benefited from one-off factors, though the results also demonstrated
stronger than expected underlying earnings growth against rising US interest
rates and turbulent financial markets.
At Chase, post-tax profits of Dollars 307m (Pounds 201m), or Dollars 1.46 a
share, were up from Dollars 233m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, while
NationsBank's net earnings rose to Dollars 437m, or Dollars 1.58, from
Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.20.
Chase reported a Dollars 55m gain on the sale of its Arizona bank, higher
mortgage banking fees due to an acquisition and an unspecified boost to
trading income from an exchange of its Brazilian loans for bonds. However,
its earnings growth was driven mainly by lower credit costs, higher fee
income and an increase in net interest income, despite tighter margins.
Fee income jumped by Dollars 98m to Dollars 480m, with contributions from
consumer and investment banking and the trust business. Trading income fell
Dollars 36m to Dollars 151m.
The provision for bad loans dropped to Dollars 150m, from Dollars 225m a
year before. Chase said it had put much of its commercial property problems
behind it: just 18 months after announcing plans to sell off Dollars 2bn of
properties, only Dollars 45m remains.
NationsBank's earnings were boosted in part by takeovers. Non-interest
income of Dollars 629m was 31 per cent higher than a year before, and would
have risen by only 7 per cent had it not been for acquisitions.
Average loans during the period jumped 23 per cent to Dollars 92.6bn, with
half of the growth coming from increased loan demand and the rest from
takeovers. The bank's net interest margin remained largely un-changed at
4.15 per cent.
The earnings advances boosted return on equity at Chase to 16.1 per cent,
from 15 per cent a year before, and at NationsBank to 17 per cent, from 14.7
per cent.
First-half net income rose to Dollars 671m from Dollars 386m at Chase, and
to Dollars 854m from Dollars 587m at NationsBank.

FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Before Mr Silvio Berlusconi rode on to the political stage promising radical
change, investors used to fret about Italy's political volatility and its
public debt-GDP ratio - the second highest in the industrialised world.
Three months later, those same worries are re-emerging.
There now appears a real risk that the coalition government will unravel.
Given the unpopularity of his current stance, it is not certain that Mr
Berlusconi would profit from any ensuing elections. The Comit index
yesterday dropped 3 per cent on the uncertainty. The currency and bond
markets shuddered too.
The markets seem likely to continue punishing Italy until the political
uncertainty is resolved. A convincing plan for correcting the budget deficit
is also needed. The worry is that a strong political will is essential to
make inroads into the 1995 deficit given the need for structural reforms to
pension and health spending. The task grows harder as the yield spread of
Italian bonds over bunds widens. It is now 415 basis points, making the
deficit ever costlier to finance.
Italy's underlying economy is recovering well. Inflation has fallen to its
lowest level for 25 years. The weak dollar will help ensure Italian
inflation remains suppressed while the strong D-Mark makes Italian exports
all the more competitive. The economy is forecast to grow at about 2.5 per
cent next year promising a strong rebound in corporate earnings. Mr
Berlusconi must make sure that, after Italy's promising build-up, he does
not shoot the gains over the bar.

FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the UK economy has survived April's tax increases better than
expected, it stands to reason that the impact would be felt on government
finances. The gratifying feature of the first quarter of the current
financial year is the buoyancy of revenues: Inland Revenue receipts are up 9
per cent, those from Customs and Excise 7 per cent. Since low inflation has
also helped keep spending under control, the PSBR for the full year could
turn out lower than the government's current forecast of Pounds 36bn.
This is reassuring for a bond market which has been inclined to worry about
oversupply. The ease with which the market absorbed last week's Pounds 800m
tap is testimony to the renewed international appetite for gilts. So is the
Bank of England's decision to auction conventional stock this month, even if
the expected 2010 maturity only just falls within the definition of long. By
comparison with other countries, such as Italy of which more below, UK
government finances are starting to look in good order.
There is no guarantee yet, though, that the gilts market can simply resume
its bull run. Yields have already fallen some 90 basis points from their
recent peak and there is always the risk of a weak dollar triggering further
international upset. Above all, cyclical improvement in the PSBR does not
mean the structural problem is solved. The market would still look askance
if the authorities used the opportunity to ease up on spending or yielded to
pressure for tax cuts.

FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft has escaped the nightmare of being broken up. But its weekend deal
with the US Justice Department and the European Commission is more than a
slap on the wrist. To avoid a lengthy court battle over claims that it
behaved anti-competitively, the software giant has had to accept
restrictions on the way it conducts its business. While the detailed terms
certainly do not spell an immediate end to its near-monopoly in supplying
personal computer operating systems, rivals should find it easier to
penetrate the market.
Even more serious is the risk that close monitoring by the competition
authorities for the next six and a half years will cramp Microsoft's style.
One of the secrets of the group's success has been an aggressive
no-hostages-taken approach to competitors. It may now feel it has to tone
down this aggression.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder, was playing down such risks yesterday.
According to him, the deal eliminates the possible distraction of a court
case and allows the company to focus on devising new products. Certainly,
Microsoft's main challenge will be in the marketplace. Computer technology
is advancing at such a pace that the group will need to innovate to retain
its dominance in desktop operating systems. As Microsoft seeks to establish
itself in other segments of the software market such as networking and
multimedia, the need for innovation will be even greater.

FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Gas mask slips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What is British Gas up to? In its public statements, the company says it
wants the government to press ahead with legislation this autumn to open up
the domestic gas market to competition. But at the same time, Gas is
planning to 'rebalance' its prices to bring them in line with costs - a
phrase that conjures up the idea of higher gas bills for little old ladies.
The government is already dithering about whether to abolish Gas's domestic
monopoly. Hints about higher bills could be all that is needed to scupper
legislation.
The Machiavellian interpretation is that this is precisely what Gas is
after. If so, it is being foolish. So long as Gas retains its monopoly, it
will face tight regulation. The company may feel the current regulatory
burden is suffocating, but matters could get worse under a Labour
government. Gas should, by contrast, embrace competition and use its advent
as a spur to change the organisation's still rather moribund culture. Since
Gas is gradually getting this message, a Machiavellian interpretation of its
latest moves seems unlikely. The more plausible explanation is that the
company has yet to craft a new and internally-coherent public image.
This is not to suggest that Gas has nothing to fear from the abolition of
its monopoly. Although its regulator has promised to create a level
playing-field, until the rules are set in stone there remains the
possibility that rivals could 'cherry-pick' its most attractive customers.
But the best way to protect itself from such an eventuality would be to
fight for fair competition rather than to scare the politicians.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Construction industry reform 'could reduce costs by 30%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical proposals to reduce contract abuses and improve services could cut
construction costs in Britain by 30 per cent by the end of the century,
according to a wide-ranging review of the industry published yesterday.
The independent review sponsored by the industry and government called for
new legislation to improve payment and disputes procedures.
A Construction Contracts bill would require independent adjudicators to be
appointed to resolve conflicts, reducing the need for costly litigation.
Trust funds would hold contract cash to protect companies should customers
or contractors fail.
The bill would also allow sub-contractors to charge punitive interest for
late payments. The measures would be expected to become standard features of
all construction contracts.
The report was welcomed by the industry and its customers. Mr Stuart Humby,
National Westminster procurement director, said: 'The experience of
companies in the US and Japan has shown us that a modern partnership
approach can reduce conflict and dramatically drive down construction
costs.'
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Construction Industry Employers Council,
described the proposals as 'bold and perceptive'.
The Department of Environment, which is thought to strongly support the
recommendations, is due to publish its response next week. The review, led
by Sir Michael Latham, a former Conservative MP and ex-director of the
Housebuilders Federation, was the biggest inquiry into the industry since
the Branwell report in 1964.
It calls for the formation of a powerful new industry steering group - led
by the environment secretary - which would assist in the development of new
contract forms and management practices.
A new code of practice to be sponsored by the DoE would establish a well
defined framework of management and contractual responsibilities for a wide
range of jobs.
The bill would also include legislation on building defects, including a
mandatory requirement to insure developments for up to 10 years after
construction. A levy on premiums would be used to fund construction
research.
The review also calls for a customers' forum, representing the industry's
leading private sector clients. Registers of approved consultants and
contractors for all public sector work would be operated by the DoE to
reduce tendering costs.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Bonn drops threatened ban on UK beef exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany last night decided not to impose a unilateral ban on British beef
exports after European Union agriculture ministers agreed tighter
restrictions against 'mad cow' disease.
A European Commission spokesman said the Germans would totally withdraw
their threat of a ban. 'It's peace in our time,' he said
The German move followed unanimous agreement by the ministers to limit
exports of British beef carcasses to herds that have been free of the
disease - bovine spongiform encephalopathy - for six years, instead of the
current two years. The tighter limits were recommended by the Commission's
veterinary committee.
The ministers' decision and German reaction appeared to end a worsening
German row over BSE with both Britain and the European Commission, which had
threatened legal action against Bonn if it took unilateral steps to stop
imports.
Last week, the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house, voted in favour of an
immediate, six-month import ban on all British beef from cattle more than
three years old, or from herds not certified free of BSE for at least four
years.
However, a German government spokesman in Brussels said last night the
lifting of the threatened ban was a matter for the Bonn government and would
not require Bundesrat approval.
Following the agreement, Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister who
initiated the proposed ban, has cancelled his scheduled attendance at the
second day of the agriculture ministers' meeting in Brussels today.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, said the breakthrough was a
'victory for common sense'. Although Mr Seehofer has argued there might be a
risk to human health from BSE, Mrs Shephard has accused him of acting for
electoral rather than scientific reasons.
Welcoming the new restrictions and the German decision, she said last night:
'This shows the whole Community including Germany now believes that our beef
is safe.'
A British official said sales of carcass beef containing bones accounted for
the bulk of beef exports. He conceded that the new rules would make life
tougher for exporters. But he insisted the restrictions reflected
differences in procedures for deboning beef and disposing of waste in
Britain and other member states, rather than any criticism of UK controls.
The National Farmers' Union said the six-year rule would mean extra problems
for farmers because of the need to trace the health history of carcasses for
export.
British officials say the incidence of BSE is declining, with the number of
cases reported in the first six months of the year down by 23 per cent on
the same period last year.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Cut-price gas bills planned for reliable customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas aims to cut the prices it charges its best residential customers
during the run-up to the introduction of competition in 1996 in a move that
could also result in bigger bills for millions of other households.
The price differentials between customers are likely to emerge as the
company lifts cross-subsidies. British Gas claims that 2m-3m of its most
profitable domestic customers subsidise many more problem payers and those
who use relatively small amounts of gas.
It is thought that 5m customers might benefit from lower prices, but as many
as 8m households could be hit by increases.
Company officials say the 're-balancing' of costs might occur abruptly if
the government sticks to the present timetable for ending its monopoly over
the sale of gas to 18m households starting in 1996, with full liberalisation
due in 1998.
A delay of six to 12 months in the first phase of competition, which British
Gas has proposed to ensure that its computer systems have been upgraded and
tested before deregulation, would allow it to introduce price changes more
gradually, officials said.
The company might also be able to offer packages to the 2m customers a year
who pay bills late or not at all to persuade them to change their habits.
These could include incentives to pay by direct debit.
Officials say the late payment problem is so large because disconnection
procedures are cumbersome. They also complain that as a result gas bills are
paid last, after electricity.
The company said yesterday it was committed to competition, and wanted to
see the necessary legislation in the Queen's speech this autumn. But it also
wants to ensure that the rebalancing of its cost base is completed before
its monopoly is lifted.
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, said a rebalancing of costs between
consumers would require its approval. It would also have to take place
within the complex pricing formula set by the regulator - a cap which is
based on the retail price index minus 4 percentage points.
But the regulator confirmed that British Gas can raise prices for different
market segments if it can show it is not recovering the costs of serving
such customers.
British Gas executives say they have little faith in the ability of Ofgas to
prevent independent gas marketers from targeting its best customers, while
avoiding the millions of small customers or problem payers.

A recent FT report on Everton football club obviously touched a sore spot.
The item suggested the club betrayed a mean streak by not offering
shareholders even a cup of tea at its annual general meeting.
Now it's not just tea, but gin 'n T. At last week's shareholders meeting -
to discuss the club's rights issue - chairman David Marsh said the Goodison
Park bar would be open afterwards for free drinks 'as a result of adverse
publicity in the Financial Times'.
If only other bars were so easily prised open . . .

Ignoring the fact that nature helpfully provided most people with 10

The gift - featuring black plastic beads on a steel frame - went to those in

Of course, merely a bauble; no suggestion that some types actually need aids

Don't talk about roast chicken in Japan; it's something of a problem right
now.
Some southern parts of the country are experiencing the driest, hottest
summer for 20 years. Very nice for tourists perhaps, but tough on chickens.
In the past three weeks, some 110,000 chickens have expired on poultry farms
in Tokushima, a southern state where 6.4m, or about 5 per cent of Japan's
chicken population live.
The problem is the heat. Last week, local temperatures reached 38.4 degrees
Celsius - 101 Fahrenheit - the highest since records started in 1929.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Though hardly a useful
motto for chickens.

It has its problems, but Mexico still spawns dollar billionaires, according
to Forbes magazine, which reckons there are now 24 Mexican billionaires,
against 13 last year and just two in 1991.
Topping the list, weighing in at an estimated Dollars 6.6bn, is Carlos Slim
Helu, head of the national telephone company. He's closely followed by
Emilio Azcarraga, Dollars 5.4bn, chairman of the principal television
network.
Not far behind is the Zambrano family - Dollars 3.1bn - which controls
Cemex, Mexico's main cement company, followed by a new entry, the Peraltas -
Dollars 2.5bn - who have just sold a chunk of their cellular phone business.
Forbes' annual rich list is not universally adored; some of its Mexican
members believe it saves Mexico's kidnappers from doing their own research.
One irate member describes it as 'total stupidity'. Not that he was afraid,
he added - the bandits would be far better informed than Forbes.

What's this? A charity turning down donations?
Shared Interest, the Newcastle-based organisation that lends money to
disadvantaged groups in the Third World, is evidently a little particular
about where its cash comes from.
Its international partner, the Ecumenical Development Co-operative Society,
was recently offered a Dollars 10m interest-free loan, as well as a Dollars
450,000 grant to help its activities in eastern Europe.
But the offer came from the foundation set up by market speculator George
Soros. Shared Interest voted against accepting the donation out of moral
disapproval of the way Soros profited from the plunging pound on 'Black
Wednesday' in 1992.
Being black-balled is probably a novel experience for Soros. Still, the path
to sainthood has never been easy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who'd be a British hack in Brussels? Things could turn a shade unpleasant,
now that Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene - vetoed by John Major as
the man to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission -
has publicly pinned the blame on an alleged British media conspiracy.
Dehaene told the Belgian newspaper De Standaard yesterday that 'the British
tabloid press turned me into a caricature'.
Delors could have told him that, regrettable though it may be, such
shabbiness went with the brief.
More intriguingly, Dehaene also wagged a finger at that supposedly objective
institution, the BBC, which he accused of depicting Belgians as 'some sort
of European ayatollahs' when Belgium held the European Union's rotating
presidency last year.
To imply today's British media is somehow in cahoots with John Major does
show remarkable imagination. Maybe Dehaene should have got the job, after
all.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Pressurised gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are signs that the government may be hesitating about deregulating the
British gas industry. A long-awaited Gas Bill has yet to emerge, and reports
suggest that the Cabinet may have decided to demote the subject on its
agenda.
If this is the case, something must have deflected the government from the
course it adopted at the beginning of this year when it set a clear
timetable for reform of the gas market. One guess is that ministers have
taken a closer look at the price implications of deregulation, and heeded
the warnings from British Gas that millions of households would end up with
higher gas bills as a result of greater competition. This is because an open
market would drive out the cross-subsidies which have kept the bills of more
modest consumers of gas low at the expense of larger users.
But it is late in the day for a change of heart. Last year's thorough report
by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that deregulation would
be in the national interest. And although the arguments have received a
further airing since then, no fresh problems have surfaced that could not be
dealt with by the market regulator.
It is true that, from the government's point of view, there is little
short-term mileage to be had from deregulating gas: there are no
privatisation proceeds, and any price rises that do occur will be unpopular.
But this anxiety has to be set against the longer term economic benefits of
improving the efficiency of Britain's energy infrastructure by encouraging
competition. Ministers should not give up just as they enter the last lap.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Algeria's agony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'The status quo is no longer tenable.' That remark about Algeria was made
some weeks ago by Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. It is the
nearest France has come, in public, to admitting the failure of its policy
in that country - a policy of backing the present military regime on the
grounds that, whatever its faults, it is preferable to the Islamic
alternative.
The thinking behind that policy is easy to follow. Islamic militants have
been increasingly ruthless and indiscriminate in their use of violence, and
increasingly intolerant in their social attitudes, especially towards
emancipated women and secular intellectuals. Some of their leaders have
openly rejected democracy as incompatible with Islam. Others' espousal of it
may be purely tactical or, if sincere, might not survive once they were in
power and facing serious opposition. An Islamic victory even by democratic
means - such as was about to happen in January 1992 - could easily be a case
of 'one man, one vote, once', as an American diplomat has said. It could
also trigger the flight en masse of Algeria's westernised middle class, most
of which would head for France.
But the policy is not working. Two and a half years after the elections were
cancelled, Algeria is further than ever from civil peace. Foreigners,
including diplomats, have become regular targets of terrorism, and the
regime seems powerless to protect them. Attempts at dialogue with the
imprisoned leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have been abortive,
even though those leaders have now more or less abandoned the conditions -
release of all political prisoners and new elections - on which they were
insisting earlier in the year.
Many observers believe President Liamine Zeroual is prevented from pursuing
this option by the the hardline group of 'eradicateurs' around the chief of
staff, Gen Mohamed Lamari. The methods favoured by that group may be said to
have 'worked' in Syria, when President Hafez al-Assad destroyed the ancient
city of Hama and killed tens of thousands of people in 1982. It is highly
questionable whether they can work in Algeria, or if they can whether the
price is worth paying. For the moment they have produced a civil war in
which no quarter is given, in which terrorists enjoy the legitimacy of
frustrated democrats, and in which Algerians of liberal persuasion are as
likely to be victims of one side as of the other. Many have already fled to
France, ostensibly as visitors, or are trying to get visas to do so.
Unpleasant facts must be faced. The longer Mr Juppe's untenable status quo
is maintained, the more bitter and uncompromising an eventual Islamic regime
is likely to be. French, European, and indeed western policy should now be
directed at ending the violence and ensuring a smooth transition. Further
economic aid to Algeria should be made conditional on the early holding of
free elections, with this time firm guarantees that the result will be
respected whatever it is.
If the result gives power to the FIS, its leaders will then have both
instruments and incentives to curb extremist violence, which at present they
lack. They would also have a strong incentive to maintain good relations
with the EU. (The EU takes 70 per cent of Algeria's oil and gas exports, on
which in turn the country depends to feed and employ a population growing at
2.7 per cent annually.) Algeria would not for some time be a liberal
democracy, or a paradise for westernised intellectuals. But it could stop
being the hell for all its inhabitants that it is now.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Antitrust and global markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the impact on the computer industry of this weekend's settlement of
monopoly proceedings against Microsoft, the world's largest software
company, it marks a milestone in antitrust law. The unprecedented
co-operation between authorities in Washington and Brussels which it
occasioned seems bound to add to the growing debate about how competition
policy should be adapted to the realities of global markets.
Admittedly, it is still uncertain how far the case will set a pattern for
the future. The international co-ordination involved was possible only
because Microsoft authorised the two authorities to exchange information -
an arrangement which their own rules would normally preclude. Yet the fact
that such co-ordination was deemed desirable underlines the growing
propensity of competition issues to spill across frontiers.
Concern about how to respond to this trend has taken a variety of forms
since the 1970s, when many developing countries clamoured for tighter
international controls on multinational companies. In the 1980s, the focus
switched to averting conflict due to the extra-territorial application of US
and European competition policies - a problem which led to the conclusion of
a bilateral treaty.
In the 1990s, two more issues have emerged. One is the worldwide spread of
national competition laws, introduced as part of market-based economic
reforms. This proliferation of different rules and procedures threatens to
impose a heavy compliance burden on companies which operate internationally,
and to create a regulatory minefield.
The second issue is the growing inter-play - and potential conflict -
between antitrust and trade policies, as economies become more exposed to
global competition. That has prompted demands that the matter be placed on
the agenda of the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Some experts believe these pressures will ultimately lead to the creation of
a global cartel office. But the surrender of sovereignty which that would
require makes it improbable in the foreseeable future. A more realistic way
forward is through closer co-ordination of national policies, bilaterally
and within regional economic blocs.
That should reduce the risk of regulatory and procedural disparities between
countries. However, closer co-ordination is unlikely to solve all the
problems arising from the complex linkages between competition and trade
policy. Indeed, it could exacerbate them if, for example, it encouraged the
US and the EU to try jointly to impose their competition policy precepts on
other countries in an attempt to prise open their markets.
Such tactics have already been invoked by the US in its trade dispute with
Japan. They represent an unacceptable intrusion by one government into
another's domestic affairs, which threatens severe international friction.
That is the strongest argument for placing competition and trade policy on
the WTO agenda, so as to ensure that the debate is anchored in a
multilateral framework. The first priority should be to identify precisely
how the two policies inter-act. Among the issues to be resolved are the
links between competition policy and anti-dumping measures, and how far
alleged market barriers are due to deficient competition laws, as opposed to
cultural and consumer preferences.
The US and the EU should build on the mutual understanding evident in the
Microsoft case to further these objectives.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Personal View: Exports must drive UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's new evidence that consumer spending is continuing to grow, in the
June Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey, will be
welcomed as a further sign that the recovery remains on course. But in front
of every silver lining sits a cloud. How long can a consumer-led recovery
proceed, before the authorities take fright at the inflationary risk and
seek to dampen it down with an interest rate rise?
The latest official sales figures show volumes up by 4 per cent on a year
ago. And the survey published today shows that sales grew more strongly in
the year to June, after a slight slowdown in the annual rate of increase in
the early part of this year.
Retailers report that sales growth is back on the improving trend seen in
the second half of last year. And they are optimistic about the future,
expecting the pace of recovery to be maintained.
Of course there are some sectoral differences. The strongest improvements in
trade are reported by off-licences, shoe shops and furniture stores.
Booksellers and stationers are doing well, too, though hardware and
do-it-yourself retailers report falling volumes compared with a year ago.
On these hot summer weekends we are sitting at home in a new chair with a
can of beer and a good book, leaving the decorating to itself: the prime
minister's image of a nation at ease with itself, perhaps.
The housing market remains in an uncertain condition, perhaps partly because
there remain well in excess of 1m households with negative equity. The
withdrawal of attractive fixed-rate mortgage offers has also set things
back. But even there we see some signs of a slightly improving trend, and of
associated increases in sales of household durables and carpets.
The overall tone then, remains strong, stronger than many had predicted in
advance of the large personal tax increases which began to take effect in
April. Why have those increases had so little effect so far?
Partly, we think, because not all of the effect has yet been felt. The
increases in National Insurance contributions, and the reduction in the
value of mortgage interest relief, have clearly hit pay packets already. But
the impact of 8 per cent VAT on fuel bills will not be fully appreciated
until later in the year when fuel bills begin to rise in the cold weather
and the full 17.5 per cent rate follows next April.
Reductions in unemployment may also be helping to offset the tax rises.
Unemployment has now declined by more than 270,000 over the past year,
giving a larger than expected boost to personal disposal income. Downward
movements in the savings ratio, as interest rates fell, have also continued
to boost consumption. And although consumer credit expansion has slowed a
little in recent months the trend is a growth rate still higher than it was
last year.
It is clear from all this evidence that consumer spending has been the main
engine of recovery for the last two years. Given the poor international,
especially European, background that was perhaps inevitable. But if the
recovery is to be sustained, we need to be looking over the next 12 months
for a greater contribution from investment, and from net trade.
So far, private sector investment has barely begun to pick up. Even now, the
CBI's Industrial Trends Survey shows only slightly more manufacturers expect
to increase investment in plant and machinery next year than to cut it. This
is a somewhat disappointing picture after nine quarters of expansion. Public
sector investment has not taken up the slack.
And, on the trade front, while the figures for transactions with the rest of
the European Union are more than usually suspect, there are still no strong
indications of a significant improvement in our trade balance.
Anecdotally, there are signs that improved business confidence may soon
bring a boost in investment. That is what companies tell me as I travel the
country. And the improving tone of the UK's leading markets in Europe is
producing a more favourable trading environment than for some time.
But we need to see some more tangible results soon, or the authorities will
surely take further action to dampen consumer spending and boost saving.
Our hope - and expectation - is that the balance of recovery will shift
towards investment and exports later this year, and that the Bank of England
will not need to tighten policy sharply to stop consumer spending growth
accelerating. But the next three months will be a crucial period, in which
the shape of the recovery will be determined.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Feeling the pinch around the middle: Why some - but not all
 -manufacturers' margins are being trimmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the latest UK business statistics tumble on to desks, economists might
hear the echoes of a small corporate squeal.
Official figures in the past week have shown that raw materials prices are
rising but retail prices are not. Caught in the middle are manufacturers
which face the same unenviable choice confronting retailers: can they carry
on as before, planning to pass on price rises? Or must they knuckle under in
a new business environment in which sale volumes, not profit margins, will
distinguish winners from losers? The decisions manufacturers make will
influence the inflation rate in coming months and signal whether the
government has been successful in persuading industry to develop a
low-inflation psyche.
The sums behind the dilemma facing companies are stark. Figures from the
Central Statistical Office last week showed that the price of raw materials
and fuel for manufacturers had risen by 0.8 per cent between May and June,
and by 4.4 per cent since January. The main cause appears to be the
worldwide surge in commodity prices.
Prices of goods leaving factory gates, by contrast, did not rise in June,
and have risen by a mere 0.8 per cent since January.
Survey evidence suggests most companies expect the pinch to continue. A
British Chambers of Commerce survey on Thursday is expected to list input
costs as the biggest business worry. But a recent Confederation of British
Industry manufacturing survey showed that 79 per cent of manufacturers
expected prices to remain flat, or fall, over the next four months. This is
in spite of a pick-up in retail sales, as shown in today's CBI distributive
trades survey.
The main reasons manufacturers have decided not to increase output prices
are competition from overseas and the continuing price sensitivity of
consumers. A Gallup survey last week showed April's tax rises had not
significantly dented consumer confidence, but it is well below pre-recession
levels.
Consequently, as Ms Kate Barker, chief economist with the CBI, says:
'Companies are not getting margin growth that everyone thought we would this
year. Unit labour costs and commodity prices are clearly less favourable
than last year.'
But as she points out, input prices represent only a small part of the
business balance sheet. Commodities, for instance, are estimated to account
for about 5 per cent of overall manufacturing costs, whereas labour accounts
for up to 40 per cent. At the same time, as Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at
brokers Midland Global Markets points out, profit margins are still at a
high level compared with the past 15 years. He estimates manufacturers'
margins - defined as the proportion of final prices accounted for by profit
 -were just under 22 per cent last month.
Some economists believe this means that many companies can hold prices down.
As Mr Robin Aspinall of broker Panmure Gordon argues: 'UK companies have had
a pretty easy time of it so far. Demand has been picking up, they have
trimmed costs, and so you have seen big profit growth.'
But others are voicing concern about specific sectors. Economists at brokers
Kleinwort Benson, for example, say they are warning their customers to avoid
companies dependent on commodities, such as metals, because of the fears of
a price squeeze on profits.
The problem, though, is that the trail of products in the metal industry -
from iron ore through metal package manufacturer to a can of baked beans on
a supermarket shelf - shows margins under pressure in some areas, but not
others.
British Steel, for example, says that its raw materials - principally coal
and iron ore - have, if anything, become cheaper in recent months, partly
because most are priced in dollars, a currency down 5.7 per cent in value
against sterling since January.
But British Steel has apparently decided that the market can withstand a
price hike, after what it describes as 'a disastrous fall in steel prices in
1990' that reduced average prices by 20 per cent. British Steel product
prices have risen by an average of about 13 per cent since January.
British Steel's customers are unhappy about this. For example, the cost of
tin-plate, made by British Steel and sold to packaging makers such as
Carnaud Metal Box, the Anglo-French group, and France's Pechiney has risen
this year by 8 per cent, says the UK Metal Packaging Manufacturers
Association. Mr Robin Davis, the association's director, says: 'Continental
tin-plate suppliers also raised their prices by about 8 per cent this year
and our members are not finding it possible to pass on that increase in
total.'
The main reason manufacturers cannot pass it all on, he says, is the heavy
competition in international packaging. Consequently, tin can prices have
risen by only about 5 per cent this year, says Mr John Nichols, managing
director of HL foods, a subsidiary of the Hillsdown food manufacturing
company.
Similarly, the buyers of cans - the food 'packer-fillers', such as Hillsdown
 -have not been able to pass on all of their increased costs. 'Can prices
have gone up, bean prices have gone up, but our prices have not yet gone
up,' says Mr Nichols. He says cheap imports of canned foods and supermarket
price wars have all acted to constrain the prices his company charges.
But if the steel products manufacturing chain provides some evidence that a
crunch on profit margins has begun in parts of the manufacturing chain, the
picture is not as clear in other sectors, such as oil-based products.
The oil price has risen by about 20 per cent in sterling terms since the
beginning of this year, leading to similar rises in the price of the main
raw materials for the chemicals and plastics industries.
German chemicals company BASF, which has plants in the UK and continental
Europe, says raw material prices are rising faster than output prices,
particularly for naphtha, used to make ethylene and some plastics,
cyclohexane, used in fibre manufacture, and methanol, a raw material for
glues.
But Mr David Glass, of specialist chemicals industry consultancy Chem
Systems, says these rises are not hitting the profitability of the chemical
industry, because demand is leading to rising volumes. In a
capital-intensive industry such as chemicals, the cost of producing an extra
tonne is low once a plant is constructed and running.
'The chemicals industry is highly geared to volume, which is improving
margins in spite of the fact that naphtha prices have risen so much,' says
Mr Glass.
In fact, the chemicals industry is having to rely on volume growth to
preserve profits, because customers are unwilling to pay more. Mr Stuart
Wallis, chief executive of Bowater Packaging, a big plastics user, says: 'We
are big enough to say to our suppliers that, until we can raise our own
prices, we will not pay more.'
Not all companies are big enough to gain from economies of scale and
bargaining muscle. As Mr Richard Brown, deputy director of the British
Chamber of Commerce, points out, smaller manufacturers often suffer more
than the largest groups.
The message from the government and many economists is that, with inflation
low, manufacturers large and small must learn to thrive without relying on
price rises.
To a large extent, that adjustment has been taking place for some time.
Treasury figures show that the gap between the trend growth rate of input
and output prices has been narrowing steadily over the past 20 years.
But as Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, admitted last
November, adjusting to lower prices and smaller profit margins will not be
easy. Many businesses are still looking for returns more suited to a
high-inflation era, he argued. These expectations needed to be reduced if
Britain was to sustain a low-inflation economic recovery, he insisted.
At the time, his comments piqued some manufacturers. But rising raw
materials prices are forcing businesses to think again. The next few months
will reveal the choice made by industrialists, and the effects of that
choice on UK industrial health.

FT  19 JUL 94 / BAT-man's opening: A look at the tobacco giant's strike into
Uzbekistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chzhen, deputy prime minister and privatisation minister of the
ex-Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, saved his bombshell until the last moment.
Executives of the UK-based tobacco and financial services group BAT
Industries, meeting ministers in the capital Tashkent, were expecting to
clarify details of a preliminary agreement to acquire a majority stake in
Uzbekistan's tobacco industry. Towards the end of the meeting, however, Mr
Chzhen made a 'suggestion'. Might BAT perhaps buy not 51 per cent, but 97
per cent of the industry immediately - involving an extra up-front payment
of some Dollars 54m?
BAT's chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy said he would discuss the proposal with
his team; within 24 hours a carefully worded letter was despatched to Mr
Chzhen informing him that his suggestion was 'regretfully unacceptable'.
Such are the uncertainties of doing business in Uzbekistan. Although its
former communist president, Mr Islam Karimov, has embraced market reforms,
the country has a reputation for being a tricky place in which to operate.
But in spite of bureaucratic wrangling, and poor infrastructure and
communications, companies such as BAT are showing that it is possible to do
deals with a republic which for centuries straddled the Silk Road trading
route, and has ambitions once again to be a centre of east-west trade.
The 22m-strong state is starting to attract interest from both east and
west. The first products of a joint venture between Coca-Cola and a local
company appeared in Tashkent last month; US mining company Newmont has a
gold-mining project; and Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate, has a joint
venture to produce cars from next year.
The BAT deal, which should be completed within weeks, is Uzbekistan's
biggest privatisation. BAT is spending Dollars 60m on its 51 per cent stake
in Uz Tobacco, a state enterprise comprising the republic's only cigarette
factory, in Tashkent, and tobacco-processing plants in the second city
Samarkand, and in Urgut, a tobacco-growing centre.
BAT plans to invest a further Dollars 232m over five years, refurbishing the
Tashkent plant, building a cigarette factory in Samarkand, and installing
new equipment in Urgut. Within five years it hopes to increase domestic
cigarette production from 4bn cigarettes a year to up to 25bn - outstripping
the republic's estimated demand of 20bn a year. BAT's equity holding is set
to increase to 97 per cent over five years as it puts money into the
venture.
'This is the first time we have agreed such a large joint venture, and in
effect handed over a whole industry to a foreign partner,' says Mr Ismail
Jurabekov, Uzbekistan's first deputy prime minister.
Getting to this stage has, however, taken eight months of negotiation and
been fraught with difficulties. BAT's team in Tashkent says operating in
Uzbekistan can be more frustrating than in the third world. Its biggest
complaint is the bureaucracy. 'In Africa, you may be kept waiting, but
usually you are dealing with someone who can make a decision, and after a
while they will make a decision,' says a team member. 'Here, nobody wants to
make a decision.'
One reason may be the political struggles going on inside the government,
where ministers jostle for position and appear anxious not to make political
mistakes.
Another problem is the lack of proper legal and tax frameworks. Land-leasing
is unknown in central Asia, and in establishing the rent for its 99-year
leases on its factory sites, BAT is setting the benchmark for future
investors. It is urging the government to equalise the tax treatment of
imported cigarettes, which are excise-free, and those produced domestically,
which are subject to an excise tax of 900 per cent - a relic of the Soviet
era when imports were small.
While some difficulties have been surmounted, risks remain. The ruthless
political efficiency of the ruling People's Democratic Party, which has
outlawed the main opposition movement, has not been matched by economic
performance. Inflation was running at an annualised 1,500 per cent in the
first quarter of this year; there are negative real interest rates and cheap
credits are propping up near bankrupt state enterprises. There is little
hope that the som, the new currency introduced this month, will hold its
value any better than its predecessor.
If the value of Uzbekistan's currency is questionable, so is the worth of
its industrial assets. At the Tashkent cigarette factory, the most modern
equipment dates from the 1960s; the oldest from 1922. In the factory,
electric cables dangle from the ceilings. Subjected recently to a standard
BAT factory safety inspection, Taskent scored 2.3 per cent. The pass mark is
70 per cent.
'The machinery and buildings in these places really have negative value,'
says Sir Patrick. 'What you are buying is the business, and the market. You
have got to have a lot of confidence that you are buying this negative base,
but you can make money from it.'
Sir Patrick is confident that his deal will make money for BAT, and for
Uzbekistan. BAT gets a monopoly of domestic cigarette production for five
years. It acquires the rights to local brands, and the opportunity to
manufacture locally, 'value-added' international brands. It gets a skilled,
but low-cost workforce (average wages are about Dollars 10 a month) and
manufacturing capacity that should eventually enable it to export cigarettes
to other former Soviet republics.
For its part, Uzbekistan gets much-needed dollars, and an industry rebuilt.
The new factory in Samarkand will create 500 jobs, and the government can
look forward to increased excise and value-added tax revenues as cigarette
output rises.
It should also earn more from tobacco exports - currently more than 30,000
tonnes a year - as BAT will provide technical assistance to Uzbekistan's
farmers, and hopes to introduce, alongside the existing 'Oriental' tobacco
crops, the Virginia and Burley varieties needed for producing
international-quality cigarettes.
Some evidence that such ventures can succeed in former Soviet republics can
be found 2,000 miles west, in eastern Ukraine. In Priluky, BAT bought 65 per
cent of a newly-privatised tobacco factory last year. In a republic whose
economy is arguably in a worse state than Uzbekistan's, and selling
cigarettes for the equivalent of a few US cents a pack, the Priluky plant
made a profit last year. New technology has enabled it to introduce a
higher-quality brand.
'These areas may be risky,' says Sir Patrick, 'but if you take a long-term
view, the opportunity is there to get in at a low price, and add value.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Essential that green belt remains
strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM WALTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paul Cheeseright's article (Property, July 15) noted that a number of
developer interests had expressed the wish that the environment secretary
should relax the currently defined West Midlands green belt when issuing his
forthcoming strategic planning guidance for the region.
However, they should understand that the secretary of state is constrained
in the matter by his more general advice on green belts contained in
Planning Policy Guidance Note number 2 issued in 1988, currently under
review, which states the need for 'exceptional circumstances' when proposing
alterations to established green belt boundaries.
Given that it is most unlikely that the secretary of state will delete this
policy requirement from the emerging policy advice on green belts, any
proposed relaxation of the West Midlands green belt must be supported by
very convincing reasons.
While it is undeniable that potential investment in housing and commercial
development that is prohibited from its preferred location on the urban
fringe by green belt policy will not necessarily take place in inner city
areas where it is needed most, it remains that a strong green belt policy is
required as part of an overall strategy for government policies on urban
regeneration and sustainable development.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No point to government proposal on
delegating pay bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Publication of the white paper on civil service reform continues the
depressingly regular process of the government announcing the introduction
of new policies, while quietly signalling the demise of others ('Whitehall
faces sweeping reform', July 14).
The delegation of pay to all departments and agencies by April 1 1996, the
latest ministerial fad, will only result in both a massive extension in
costs, as well as in the actual numbers of people who will now need to be
employed on annual negotiations exercises.
National pay bargaining arrangements, by and large, have worked very well.
In their place will come 150 bargaining units and an increase in negotiators
and back-up staff from a handful based in the Treasury to an estimated 3,000
across every department and agency.
There is, of course, no evidence that the fragmentation of pay bargaining
will either reduce the overall pay bill, or ensure that particular groups of
staff will have better performance rewarded.
All that has happened this year, for instance, in those areas that already
have delegated pay, is that the hundreds of extra hours of negotiations in
different agencies have resulted in remarkably similar, if not exactly
identical, pay deals. And, as in the case of Railtrack, the potential for
disputes will mushroom because Treasury ministers will still be breathing
down the necks of these 3,000 negotiators. So what on earth is the point?
The birth of a new policy also sees the timely death of another - market
testing. Buried deep within the white paper is the announcement, quite
unthinkable at the start of this year, that the Treasury will no longer
insist on departments establishing market testing programmes with centrally
set targets. Market testing has been an enormously costly disaster, which
ministers now admit, even if they still will not say so in so many words. I
have no doubt that within a few years delegated pay is likely to go exactly
the same way.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cultural trends in German equity
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E H CLAUSSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Waller's report misses two aspects when he lists actions required
for overcoming the lack of an 'equity culture' in Germany.
First, the leading German banks, including Mr Rolf Breuer's Deutsche Bank,
must create incentives for young people to become involved in stock
exchanges.
For decades, these banks have erected ever higher barriers for young
newcomers to these exciting markets. I guess the bankers consider the
short-term costs for such programmes too high and they have failed to
recognise their primary long-term responsibility. Without a broadly based
participation, starting with the young, I cannot see an 'equity culture'
developing in Germany.
Second, several decades ago, the German government created the 'Volksaktie'
when selling, for example, Volkswagen. If the government finally decides
again to sell off state enterprises such as Lufthansa, Telekom, etc, I hope
it looks to the UK and learns from the series of successful privatisation
programmes. Sid could be useful in helping the German government and banks
to develop an 'equity culture'. E H Clausson,

<TEXT>
Sir, On July 14 I attended a manufacturing engineering conference where
discussion centred on the competitiveness of European industry. We
consistently heard examples both from the speakers and from the floor of
long-term views and solid investment in Germany (and elsewhere) and the lack
of such investment and vision in the UK.
It was typical that on the same day I should find a report in the FT, by
David Waller, on the lack of a share culture in Germany, as if it were some
kind of disability ('Resisting the bait of equity ownership'). I think what
he meant was that they don't have a share trading culture - because they
recognise that wealth creation is a product of custodianship in which share
trading can only ever be secondary.
Do we get a balancing article on the lack of an ownership culture in the UK?

<TEXT>
Whatever his shortcomings, Mr John Major is not politically stupid. Or is
he? The UK prime minister must know how dangerous it would be to allow his
Conservative coalition to be led by the hard right. He has recently been
urged to avoid this pitfall in speeches by Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth
Clarke and Mr David Hunt, to name all three. Thanks to the first two, the
Tories' fragile concordat on Europe holds, but, as to domestic economic and
social policies, a reversion to the harsh theme music of the 1980s may seem
tempting. There is so much internal discord. Will this noise never cease?
Not while the government stays divided. If you cannot beat the Thatcherites,
Mr Major might reason, then for the party's sake allow them to win.
If he succumbs, we must ascribe his failing to weakness. He will not have
the excuse of ignorance. The Tories belted out the anthems of the narrow
right at their conference last October. Look where that got them. The
promotion this week of ministers who are at their merriest when singing
songs of purple patriotism and perverse parsimony would raise the spirits of
some, but dismay the gentle English soul. What the uncompromising right
tends to forget is, not that the party to which they have attached
themselves won the last four elections, but that in 1979, 1983, 1987 and
1992 Labour lost. It cannot be relied upon to do so a fifth time.
We voters are motivated by self-interest. But altruism, a sense of concern
for others, is also part of the general make-up. Many years ago, the late
professor Richard Titmuss wrote The Gift Relationship, in which he
demonstrated that the blood given for free by English donors was better,
less prone to infection, than the blood sold to hospital services by the
poor in the United States. This has not changed, much. The American
blood-buyers are doubtless more picky than they were, but in England a
brand-new quango, the National Blood Authority, headed by a gentleman
farmer, still collects the fluid from volunteers' arms. Cash does not come
into the equation.
It is possible that the electorate is shrinking from cash-ism. Not so far
that it wants a return to the 1970s, but that is not on offer from any
source. The potential appeal of the Labour party, tamed as it has been by 15
years of frustration, is that it will offer the voters reassurance as to
their self-interest, but add a dash of altruism - not too much, mind you -
to the for-mula. Middle England is uneasy about everything - unemployment,
house prices, crime and the steady, unceasing hammer of change, change in
schools, hospitals, local government, police authorities, the judicial
system, all the institutions that once seemed so familiar, so reliable. If
the Conservatives will not conserve, anxious voters will ask themselves, why
not dismiss them?
This is not to say that the government's market reforms are wrong. They are,
mostly, an improvement, or a promise of one. The process is, however, too
crude, too naked. The British polity is being reformulated by accountants
sitting in quangos managed by Tory puppets. The values of the bottom line
are undiluted. There is no provision for altruism in the cash-ist
revolution.
Here I sympathise with the Right Reverend Mark Santer, Bishop of Birmingham.
In his recent address to the British Medical Association, he acknowledged
that change in the management of the health service is inevitable, but spoke
also of practitioners 'fulfilling a vocation . . . offering a service of
love and duty to their fellow men and women'. This kind of declaration is
pointless if it denies the need for simple fiscal prudence. That is not,
however, at issue. Voters understand, if the brainless bean-counters do not,
that a sense of vocation has driven the NHS since 1948. Destroying that
willingness to serve could be costly. Subtle mar-ket reformers would
understand this.
The electorate may also dimly apprehend the relationship be-tween the
polarisation of our two nations and the increase in anti-social behaviour.
Two nations? Of course. In ours, you have a job, own a house, run a car,
keep in with your bank manager, take foreign holidays, and know, deep in
your heart, that you could, at a stretch, buy your family's way ahead in the
health queue, or change your children's school. In theirs, they have none of
these things. British society is becoming more divided every year. The
evidence is in 'Households Below Average Income', published last week by the
Government Statistical Service.
It shows the proportion of the population living on below-average income as
59 per cent in 1979, when this government first took office. In 1991-92, the
latest period for which numbers are available, the equivalent figure was 62
per cent. Some 9 per cent of our people scratched by on less than half
average income when the then Mrs Thatcher arrived; 13 years later the figure
had risen to 25 per cent. Yes that's right. A quarter of us. The sums look
much the same if you exclude housing costs. The worst off fared worst.
Average net income rose by 36 per cent in the period, but none of the extra
fat went to the lowest fifth of the population.
As to the lowest tenth, real median income actually fell by 17 per cent. The
poorest individuals in 1979 may have been replaced by others by 1992, but
that observation, among many other explanations in the accompanying
commentary, does not feed the children. Undeclared black economy income may
have helped some of the underclass get by, but the overall picture is likely
to have deteriorated since 1992. The family expenditure survey, on which the
government's figures are based, excludes people in institutions and those
living rough or in bed and breakfast accommodation.
The harsh truth is that nobody has a satisfactory answer to any of this. The
proponents of one-nation policies, be they Conservative or Labour, do at
least show some inclination to try. Whatever their protestations, however
generous their personal behaviour, the Tory right cannot easily persuade us
that kindness, the essence of charity, figures in its calculations. Clear
away those beggars] Deny those single parents] Forget the poor] Exclude]
Banish] Despise] Their slogans are depressingly easy to caricature. If Mr
Major allows those who purvey them to prevail, he, and his party, will
deserve to lose.

Sir, Further to your coverage of the Takarazuka Revue (Arts: 'Cross-dressing
Japanese style', July 13), please allow me a brief word in reply.
Is it really necessary to take everything in life so seriously? Or do people
in England not feel that there are moments when you can say 'It may be crazy
but I love it', or 'It may be kitsch but it's fun . . .'? You see, all that
I am trying to do through my work is to bring a little more light into the
world.
And if we do have to be serious, please at least remember that, unlike some
people, we do not set out to hurt anyone. I believe that it was your
countryman John Lennon who said it best: 'All you need is love.'

   From Mr PETER MILLER

<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan is right to point out that soaring house prices are
unhealthy for the economy (Economic Viewpoint, July 7). But he fails to
comment on the problems caused by a depressed housing market.
Without a strong housing market - remembering that the phrase refers as much
to the number of transactions as to prices - the economy cannot reap the
benefits of the increased outlay on goods and services that go with moving
house.
The 'wealth effects' that a modest rise in residential property prices
create cannot be measured, but without their reassuring presence to the
home-owner, consumer spending is unlikely to play a large role in
facilitating the economic recovery.

BBC1's new panel game Gagtag is described as a comedy trivia quiz and a
battle of wit. It is chaired by Jonafan Woss, sorry Jonathan Ross, and the
team captains are Bob Monkhouse and Frank Skinner. Like 'Relate' which is
now described as what it isn't ('the organisation previously known as the
Marriage Guidance Council') Skinner has to be defined as the one on 'Fantasy
Football League' who wasn't David Baddiel (8.00 BBC1). The following
programme is presented by the other Ross: Nick. Crime Limited (8.30 BBC1)
undertakes to 'look at crime from the viewpoint of victims and their
families' which means that viewers get the usual ration of dramatised mayhem
but develop a warm glow of worthiness at the same time. Clever. Chandler And
Co is also managing to have things both ways: the women are attractive,
gutsy and bright while the men are bald, unfaithful and wimpish; standard
stuff in the tunnel vision age of feminism. But at the end of Episode 1 one
woman began to see some of the hazards of the current belief in female
infallibility. Promising. (9.30 BBC1).

FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: The triumphant return of the Empire - A look at an
inspiring triple bill worthy of Edinburgh's refurbished theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have two vivid memories of the old Empire Theatre in Edinburgh. Festival
habitues still speak of the terrible crashings and ill-muffled cries that
attended scene-changes. (Gang warfare? Burke and Hare recruiting fresh
bodies?)
During a Royal Ballet visit to the 1962 festival, Kenneth MacMillan's recent
Baiser de la fee, with glorious decors by Kenneth Rowell, was presented.
Lynn Seymour, as the Bride, made her first appearance through an arch. As
she did so, the structure keeled forward, and nearly guillotined Donald
MacLeary, her waiting beloved. A decade later, de-commissioned as a theatre,
the Empire was pressed into service for the festival, when John Cranko
brought his Stuttgart Ballet for its first visit.
Somewhere there is a photograph of Cranko and MacMillan standing either side
of the notice which had been so graciously provided by patrons: 'The
management regrets the inconvenience to patrons. Bingo will resume in three
weeks.' Ah, the Athens of the North]
Edinburgh's need for another lyric theatre - larger than the pretty Kings;
less like Moscow airport than the dour Playhouse - has at last rescued the
Empire from its fallen state. As David Murray reported from its Wagnerian
opening last month, we now have the revised, refurbished, re-thought
Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and jolly good it is, too.
It is especially good in its stage - broad, deep, well-equipped - and in its
gleaming glass and steel facade and spanking new front-of-house. (Gone are
the dingy days of crowded foyers, strange side-doors through which people
could sneak in, and a lingering whiff of something un-dainty.)
The entrance is bright, spirit-rejoicing, with glassed-in promenades, bars,
balconies, and a sense (as at the Opera Bastille) of an immediately
welcoming and user-friendly location.
About the auditorium I have reservations. The policy has been to restore the
old and familiar setting that had existed since 1924. Such nostalgia accepts
the dreary colour scheme - omnipresent mulberry for seats, walls, curtain; a
good deal of cream paint with a built-in hint of grime - that may recall the
good old days, except that I doubt if they were in any way decoratively good
at all. But the house is spacious, with a fine acoustic and sight-lines.
It offered an admirable showcase for English National Ballet, which has just
completed a two-week season. (Several more dance visits are scheduled, which
is good news.)
Were anyone to seek concrete evidence of the transformations wrought by
Derek Deane in the year since he assumed artistic control of the troupe, it
was there in the triple bill I saw in company with a large and enthusiastic
audience.
Triple bills are notoriously hard to sell nowadays. ENB played an even more
dangerous game by programming three less than sure-fire pieces: the Shades
scene from Bayadere; the new XNTricities; and Etudes. All are plotless. All
make big demands on their casts. The audience reaction was, clearly, one of
delight.
The evening was, on these terms, inspiring. And no less so on terms of most
of the dancing. The Bayadere showed a corps of 18 girls who understood the
nuances and academic grace of Petipa's sublime inventions: they made
complete and beautiful sense of every moment.
Margaret Illmann, a guest with the ENB, does not yet have the stylistic
command to show us Nikiya's transcendant purity - in drama as in step. Her
partner was Thomas Edur, and with him we see classic dancing whose dignity
and emotional power is uniquely satisfying. He is a rare balletic being: an
authentic, pur-sang aristocrat, able to give noblest utterance to every role
he assumes. His Solor was princely in technique  - the dance sure, luscious
 -and emotionally true.
XNTricities, by the young Italian choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti, has
settled well into ENB's repertory. Its imagery combines sexual and physical
challenges. Its players strut and race, and are riven by curious tensions
and confrontations. Its great merit is that Bigonzetti holds our interest by
choreographic means.
No less real is the brilliant response of its cast to their tasks, led by
Yat Sen Chang, who tears through the action like a well-guided missile.
Etudes, still fascinating as a portrait of dancers in class, seemed to me
under a bit of a cloud. I must in all fairness record that I lately saw it
in brilliant performance by the Paris Opera Ballet. ENB's dancers work with
a will, and I salute the 18-year-old Giuseppe Picone, who whipped through a
leading role with exultant clarity and a joie-de-danser that presage
wonderful things to come.
A second evening brought Swan Lake in Raissa Struchkova's version of the old
Bolshoi staging.
It is effective, and the company dance it with much goodwill: the first act
waltz had a pleasing swing to it. Margaret Illmann and Rex Harrington were
guest principals from the National Ballet of Canada. Their interpretations
were well-meaning, and Harrington is a fine partner, but their manner
suggested the emotional basics of soap-opera - Santa Barbara, perhaps -
rather than the sublimities of this predictable but still-hallowed text.
As a traveller's note, let me recommend to anyone visiting Edinburgh the
upper rooms of the National Gallery of Scotland, where the French paintings
are a small but marvellous treat. Cezanne, of course, but also two
miraculous Boudins, and a stunning Mauve, Vaut le detour.
English National Ballet will open a week's season at the Coliseum on July
25.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: Tricks or memory treats - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The more I watch Harold Pinter's plays, the more I love the way he plants
images in the air and lets them grow there. A simple example in his 1978
play Betrayal is Jerry's recollection of picking up young Charlotte one
Christmastime, of lifting her high and down and up, of how she laughed, of
how everyone present laughed. Charlotte (never seen in the play) is the
daughter of Robert (Jerry's best friend) and Emma (who was/is, for some
years, Jerry's mistress). 'Everyone' present at that Christmastime includes
Jerry's own wife and children.
The first irony about this memory is that Jerry and Emma evoke it when they
are alone together. Thus they make it an image of the innocence that existed
around and between them once, before their affair began; before they
betrayed it. The second irony is that Jerry twice remembers the event as
having occurred in Emma's kitchen; and that she twice corrects him - his
kitchen. The deceptiveness of his (or her) memory has an
ah-yes-I-remember-it-well charm, and yet also becomes poignant. Memory
matters, but plays tricks.
And it is this image that Matthew Warchus makes luminous in his new
production of Betrayal at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Between each of the
nine scenes, different clips of a film of a child - like a home movie - are
projected on to the ceiling above the stage. (The audience, seated on four
sides of the stage, can all see.)
The child's radiant smile, tumbling hair, constant motion all make an
impression. At first, we watch her objectively; later, when she looks
directly at the camera, we are touched; gradually, as we see - like the
close-ups in Antonioni's film Blowup - increasingly near but blurry views of
areas of her hair and face, we are confused.
Which works brilliantly. For one thing, it reminds us that Jerry and Emma
have betrayed not only Robert but also their children. For another, it shows
us the paradise of that bygone innocence: a paradise that is not a fact but
an idea. And, further, it catches the method of Pinter's play, which moves
to and fro in time but basically backward, from 1977 to 1968, from the time
when the affair is wholly over to the point when it began.
The production reveals that, in its small-scale way, Betrayal operates as a
Proustian effort to rediscover lost time. But lost time is lost. We never
actually see Jerry lift Charlotte. We merely return to thinking about it,
from changing distances and perspectives.
Warchus is strong on such poetic use of visual imagery: as in his 1991
National Youth Theatre Coriolanus and his current RSC Henry V. In the matter
of shaping individual performances, his touch is not so sure. In Betrayal,
Leslee Udwin is a surprisingly unenigmatic Emma, Richard Hope is an amiably
unquestioning Jerry, and Timothy Walker is a Karenin-like Robert.
Intelligent interpretations, with fresh touches that reveal new facets in
the play. And Laura Hopkins' designs help them effectively to shed years as
they move back in time.
But all three performances need more fine-tuning. There are actorly effects
of pacing and dynamic contrast that do not convince, strokes of
characterisation that should be developed. Surely all three characters,
moving in artistic circles, should be more sophisticated?
At the Courtyard Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: Poor Super Man throbs with power - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brad Fraser is the Canadian playwright whose award-winning Unidentified
Human Remains And The True Nature Of Love made such an impact in Edinburgh
and London last year, and coincidentally reaches the cinema screen this
week.
The Ugly Man, brought to last summer's Edinburgh Festival by a Canadian
company, was a huge disappointment - a dose of Tennessee Williams baroque
turgidly combined with Cold Comfort Farm.
Now the same city's Traverse Theatre, where Fraser had his first UK success,
presents Poor Super Man - A Play with Captions. The writer is back on the
territory he knows best: the isolation of the city-dweller, the
disorientation of the emotionally lonely, the sexual odyssey of the
unattached, eternally seeking the ideal relationship.
In Human Remains the shadow of a serial killer darkened the lyricism, comedy
and pathos in this study of a small group of friends. In the new play the
killer is identified from the outset: the HIV virus.
Shannon is denied a sex-change operation by his worsening medical condition.
His eventual suicide focuses and sharpens the self-analytic gropings of the
play's four other characters.
Chief among these is his flatmate David, an established painter, who (like
the hero of Human Remains) takes a job as a waiter to dispel terminal
jadedness - professional and personal. He falls in love with Matt, the
married owner of the cafe; a development that echoes the central
relationship of Remains. David (as in the earlier play, a questing seeker of
love, assailed by self-disgust) has a loyal if possessive woman friend, the
rueful, wisecracking journalist, Kryla; another throwback to Remains.
If much of this seems like a rerun of Fraser's most successful material,
there is no denying he does it extremely well.
The reality of urban life nags like a throbbing tooth throughout. The
characters live on a knife-edge between self-mocking buoyancy and suicidal
despair. And the use of projections, the 'captions' of the title, reveal the
floundering beneath the brittleness; the urgency under the badinage.
Thus when David tells his new employers in the cafe that he is gay and they
hastily confirm that this is 'not a big deal', the word 'queer' appears. 'Do
you dislike me?' asks the cloying Kryla to her dismissive friend; his denial
is countered by a projected 'maybe'. The titles are used naturally to note
time and place, to encapsulate a scene ('lie','revelation') and sometimes as
a descant to the spoken dialogue ('me me me').
Even more than Remains the play's central thread is the stuff of homosexual
wish-fulfilment fantasy: the gay who makes straight men fall exclusively for
him: 'There's something about you, things you say, the way you look at me,'
says the capitulating heterosexual.
In Ian Brown's direction of the European premiere such passages escape the
trap of novelettishness thanks to the production's rhythm and pace - but
without the external threat of a killer as in Fraser's previous success, the
tension is finally diffused by the short, cinematic takes of the play's
construction.
The piece is uniformly well-acted though Ian Gelder's David is rather
unfocused, uncertain how much his actions are rudderless bewilderment, how
much simply the result of selfishness. Christopher Simon's Matt is a fine
study of puzzled sexual self-discovery, Elaine Collins is a lovely wry
Kryla, and Kathryn Howden makes more of Matt's hurt, loving wife than one
suspects the part is worth.
As Shannon, dying without achieving his ambition to become a woman, Jude
Akuwudike goes through the play in dress and wig looking like one of the
Supremes, in a beautifully judged blend of delicately camp self-parody and
increasing anger.
The production returns for the festival, then transfers to Hampstead.
Fraser's fans will recognise the expertise of his variations on favourite
themes, but may well begin to wonder what else he can do.
Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Stay secure on safety - A look at
costly new product regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN SIDKIN and NIGEL MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the summer is out, new product safety regulations will impose onerous
and costly obligations on unsuspecting British businesses selling products
to consumers. The lack of awareness of among businesses reflects the minimal
publicity given by the Department of Trade and Industry to the regulations.
Their The impact of the regulations will be exacerbated by the absence of a
transitional period. Although they are still in draft, and therefore subject
to change before being passed they pass into law, businesses must anticipate
should be ready for their impending arrival.
The regulations, which implement the European Community's (correct, have to
call it this because of its legal status) general product safety directive,
They significantly extend 'the general safety requirement' which was
introduced by in the Consumer Protection Act. They create a criminal offence
of placing on the market a product which is not 'a safe product'. But,
However, as has been the case with other commercial law directives made by
the European Council of Ministers, the drafting of the directive is poor and
the language vague. The regulations will be superimposed on to existing
product safety legislation, thereby creating a complex web of legislation
covering the same subject but in different terms.
Only products intended for - or likely to be used by - consumers are
covered. by the Regulations. A consumer is someone acting otherwise than in
the course of a commercial activity, such as a business or trade. Goods used
exclusively in the course of a trade or business (such as production
equipment and capital goods) are therefore excluded. from these Regulations.
However, products which are used mainly in the course of a trade or
business, but which might be used by a consumer for private use, are
covered. by the regulations.
The regulations place obligations on 'producers' and 'distributors'. In each
case, the nomenclature is misleading.
A wide definition is given to the term 'producer'. It includes the
manufacturer of the product within the European Union or someone who
presents himself as the producer by affixing to the product his name,
trademark or other distinctive mark (for example, retailers selling
producers products under their own label). If the manufacturer is outside
the EU, ropean Union, his the representative or importer will be treated as
the producer.
The definition goes on to also includes any other professional in the supply
chain, insofar as his activities affect the product's safety properties. of
the product. However, no there is no definition is given as to who is a of
'professional'. Any person who reconditions the product will also be a
producer.
The same problem arises in respect of a distributor. This means any
professional in the supply chain whose activity does not affect the
product's safety.
No guidance is given by the regulations as to what constitutes the supply
chain. It clearly includes manufacturers, importers, own-branders,
wholesalers, distributors, retailers and leasing companies. It could extend
to transporters, packers and warehousers.
The general safety requirement is that no producer will place a product on
the market unless it is a safe product. For this purpose, a safe product is
one which, under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, does
not present any risk, or only the minimum risks considered as acceptable and
consistent with a high level of protection and the safety and health of
persons. Risk is to be assessed on the basis of a number of factors,
including:
The product's characteristics, including its composition, packaging and
instructions for assembly and maintenance.
The product's effect on other products.
The product's presentation, labelling, instructions for use and disposal,
and other information provided by the producer.
The categories of consumers who would be at serious risk when using the
product. Particular consideration is to be given to children.
The producer must provide consumers with certain information to enable them
to assess the risks inherent in a product throughout its period of use. This
could be, for example, through the use of warnings. The withdrawal of a
product from the market could be the end result. This obligation is a
continuous. one.
In turn, a producer must ensure that he is informed of the risks that the
products might present. Post-marketing surveillance departments will have to
be established.
The regulations give non-exhaustive examples of the steps a producer might
take. These include marking a product so that it can be identified, sample
testing of marketed products, investigating complaints, and keeping
distributors informed of such monitoring.
The regulations also impose duties on distributors. By definition, a
distributors is are not able to influence the safety of the product. His
Their duties are:
To help ensure compliance with the general safety requirement.
Not to supply products to any person that he they know, or should have
presumed on the basis of information which he they had and as a
professionals, are dangerous products.
To be involved in the monitoring of the safety of products placed on the
market, the distributors must pass on information on the products and
co-operate in action taken to avoid risks.
Where the safety of a product is already governed by specific EC law, the
regulations will not apply. This is subject to a proviso: if EC sectoral
directives do not cover every aspect of safety, the regulations will still
apply to those aspects not covered. This can be expected to cause difficulty
to businesses and has been criticised by the Institute of Directors.
There are criminal penalties for breaking the regulations. An offence under
the regulations can result in a maximum of three months' imprisonment or a
maximum fine of Pounds 5,000 or both. It will be a defence to show that the
defendant took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid
committing an offence.
Local weights and measures authorities will enforce the regulations. They
have the power to inspect goods and enter business premises, to require
production of business records, to seize and detain goods and records, to
require the opening of any container or vending machine and, if refused, to
break it open.
The regulations impose an onerous duty on both producers and distributors to
become involved in actively and continuously monitoring the safety of
products. Relying simply on measures taken and procedures adopted to comply
with the Consumer Protection Act will be insufficient. Producers must adopt
proactive, rather than reactive, procedures. in their business operations.
The regulations dictate that producers and distributors review their
arrangements with suppliers and customers. In each case, suppliers will need
to include provisions in their agreements requiring the other party to
participate in product safety monitoring and marking procedures. This will
enable information to be obtained.
But obligations cannot stop there. The other party should be contractually
obliged to provide information to customers and be required to participate
in product recall campaigns, as well as investigating complaints. At the
same time, buyers should included provisions protecting them from any
failure by a supplier higher up the chain to comply with the regulations.
Penalties for offences may be avoided or reduced if these courses are
followed. They may also provide some contractual relief if claims are made
by consumers., whether under the Consumer Protection Act or otherwise.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Pregnant woman illegally dismissed -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A woman who was dismissed from her job for becoming pregnant was unlawfully
discriminated against on grounds of her sex, the European Court of Justice
held last week.
The case concerned the employment and dismissal of a British woman, Mrs
Webb. She had been hired to replace another employee who would be taking
maternity leave. This leave would not begin for six months, and it was
planned that Mrs Webb should undergo training during that time. It was
envisaged that Mrs Webb should continue to work for the company after the
return of the other employee from leave. Some three weeks after starting
work, it was confirmed that Mrs Webb was pregnant. A week later, she was
dismissed for becoming pregnant. Mrs Webb brought proceedings before the
industrial tribunal, alleging sex discrimination contrary to the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975.
The industrial tribunal dismissed Mrs Webb's case, finding that there had
not been direct sex discrimination, in that the real reason for her
dismissal was not her pregnancy but the anticipated inability to carry out
the primary task for which she had been recruited - to cover the job of the
other employee while the latter was on maternity leave.
According to the industrial tribunal, if a man had been recruited for the
same purpose and he had told the employer that he would be absent for a
comparable period to the likely absence of Mrs Webb, he too would have been
dismissed. The tribunal also found that there had been no indirect sex
discrimination. Although more women were likely to be unable to do the job
for which they had been recruited because of the possibility of pregnancy,
the employer had shown that the reasonable needs of its business required
that the person recruited be available during the other employee's maternity
leave.
Mrs Webb's appeals to the employment appeal tribunal and court of appeal
were both unsuccessful. Mrs Webb then appealed to the House of Lords. The
court decided on the basis of ECJ case law that it had to construe the
applicable national legislation, so as to accord with the provisions of the
relevant EC directive. It sought a preliminary ruling from the European
Court of Justice.
The Court first emphasised that the purpose of the relevant EC directive was
to put into effect throughout the European Community the principle of equal
treatment for men and women as regards access to employment. The directive
made it clear that equal treatment meant there should be no direct or
indirect sex discrimination.
The Court reiterated its jurisprudence in this area: first, that the
dismissal of a female worker on account of pregnancy constituted direct sex
discrimination and, second, that the directive in question recognised the
legitimacy, in terms of the equal treatment principle, of both protecting a
women's biological condition during and after pregnancy and of protecting
the special relationship between a women and a child in the period after
childbirth.
The Court further held that notice should also be taken of a recent
directive, which was not due to be implemented into national law until
October 1994. This directive prohibited the dismissal of pregnant women in
the period from the beginning of their pregnancy to the end of their
maternity leave.
The Court then held that there was no question of comparing the situation of
a pregnant woman incapable of fulfilling the task for which she was
recruited with that of a man similarly incapable for medical or other
reasons. Pregnancy was not comparable with a pathological condition.
Further, the protection offered by Community law to a woman during pregnancy
could not be dependent on whether her presence at work during maternity was
essential to the functioning of the company.
Thus termination of a non-fixed-term contract on grounds of an employee's
pregnancy could not be justified by the fact she was temporarily prevented
from performing the work for which she was employed.

EU - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private claims brought by individuals in the European Union cannot rely
directly on EC directives where member states have not passed implementing
legislation, the European Court of Justice has reaffirmed.
In Faccini Dori v Recreb, the Court upheld the current position that only
public sector employees can rely directly on EC directives where national
legislation has yet to be passed.
The case concerned a Miss Faccini Dori, of Milan, who cancelled a language
course contract. She claimed protection under the EC's directive 85/577
concerning consumer rights over contracts. No legislation has been passed in
Italy to implement this directive. The Court ruled that consumers such as
Miss Dori could not rely on directives, but added that, in the application
of national laws, these have to be interpreted in the light of the
directives.
However, the court also reaffirmed the principle established in 'Francovich'
that individuals could seek damages from national governments for breaches
of a state's obligations. The case had been watched by UK employment lawyers
concerned that, had the Court supported Miss Dori's application, it could
have prompted changes in employment law where implementing legislation
differs from directives.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: Dial M for meters - A look at a trial scheme to
measure water and energy consumption by telephone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the beginning of next year, telephones in the office and in the home
could be leaking information about our lives as we sleep.
The information they will relay is likely to concern our energy consumption
and how much water we use, and the callers they will be 'talking to' will be
the utilities that bill customers for these services.
Up to 150 residents in Doncaster, in the north of England, are taking part
in a trial in which their telephones are used to read their electricity and
water meters. The trial, which runs until the end of the year, is a joint
project between Yorkshire Water, Yorkshire Electricity, British
Telecommunications and Schlumberger Industries.
The latter supplies the meter interface unit (MIU) which converts the data
from the meters to a central database via the telephone network. A
subscriber line access controller (Slac) calls the MIU when instructed by
the companies' computers to read the meters. Four ports on the MIU enable
four different meters to be read. The Yorkshire trial is using just two.
The trial uses technology developed by BT which enables the telephone lines
to convey data without ringing. The aim is to leave customers blissfully
unaware that their telephone lines are involved in any activity. If a
customer uses the telephone while the meter is being read, the call from the
utility will automatically end. No call from an electricity company will
delay a call for an ambulance, for example.
The introduction of the no-ring facility, which negates the usual ringing
current of normal calls, has required a big investment by BT and involved
large-scale infrastructure changes. The costs of installation have been kept
down because the facility has been installed at the same time as other BT
developments, such as being able to identify a caller. Changes both to the
telephone exchanges and the software used in digital exchanges have been
implemented.
BT plans to install this 'no-ring' facility on most of its 25m lines before
the start of next year when it will be available for commercial use. Future
applications could include equipment monitoring and control for photocopying
machines and a 'home automation' system whereby heating, lighting and
security can be checked automatically.
But, says Andrew Batchelor, services development manager at BT: 'We are
focusing on the utility sector as our first market. This is because the
utilities have a more pressing requirement to have some technology available
to help them out of a commercial difficulty.'
This 'pressing requirement' felt by the water and electricity industries is
the need to cut costs before forthcoming large-scale reviews by industry
regulators. Both reviews will consider pricing controls and will take into
account the companies' ability to cut costs and improve efficiency.
The onus after the reviews will be on both industries to prove to investors
that they can still increase dividends based, among other things, on
continuing to cut costs.
The Yorkshire trial is one of a number involving utilities, particularly
electricity companies, and automatic meter reading. Joint ventures such as
the one in Yorkshire also point to a move towards multi-utilities with one
company providing both electricity and water.
A few smaller multi-utilities in the US are testing the use of
telecommunications for meter reading. But Peter Harrie, marketing manager at
Schlumberger Industries, says the scale of the potential market in the UK -
which has some of the biggest utilities in the world - makes the Yorkshire
trial particularly exciting.
The City appears to be watching signs of such closer co-operation with great
interest. Robert Miller-Bakewell, utilities analyst at NatWest Securities,
predicts that there will be seven multi-function utilities in the UK by
1997. 'We will see a move towards more multi-function utilities in the UK,
perhaps along the lines of those in the US but probably bigger. One of the
things driving this forward is the need to cut costs and eliminate the
overlap.'
Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, also foresees closer co-operation at
both operating and management levels. 'In terms of billing, for example,
telecoms must be in a pole position for utilities.'
But there are still a number of questions concerning the cost-effectiveness
of automatic metering. The meters used in this system are more expensive
than traditional ones and costs will not come down until they are produced
and used in bulk.
Most industry analysts accept that the 'man in a van' system with an
engineer making regular, if infrequent, readings will remain cost-effective
until 'special' reads need to be carried out. These include returns to homes
where nobody was in or an address changes.
Having a qualified member of staff visiting premises has other advantages,
although as Harrie says: 'Some people find it difficult arranging a
convenient time for their meter to be read and others don't like strange
people coming into their homes anyway.'
Proponents of the scheme argue that 'added value services' should be added
to any cost benefit analysis. For utilities' customers, improvements could
include the elimination of estimated bills, immediate informed response on
queries and complaints, and flexible tariffing and billing. The electricity
industry already sells energy to big industrial users in 30-minute lots that
could be accurately gauged with such advanced metering.
The system will also enable water companies to detect leaks more easily and
to prepare load profiles of customers.
A shared billing system between the water and electricity companies could
lead to shared information about bad-debt customers. In the Yorkshire trial,
each utility has access only to its own meters but the possibility of
utilities sharing information is likely to cause alarm.
'This is certainly a complex subject, which is why nobody is rushing into it
and why we're having trials to see how customers react to having their
phones used in this way,' says Batchelor.
'We're taking this fairly slowly, although we have been impressed by the
reaction so far,' he adds.
Yorkshire Water is also tentative. 'Our main aim is improving services. We
are not doing this purely for the sake of new technology.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: When IT fails to measure up - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of information technology is rarely questioned by users these
days. In schools and businesses, the belief is widespread that computers
make classrooms more effective and offices more productive.
The uncomfortable fact that vast investments in computers have shown only
modest or, in some cases, no productivity increases is often dismissed as an
irritating measurement problem.
The US National Research Council said at the end of last year that US
service companies spent at least Dollars 750bn (Pounds 493bn) on
communications systems, computer hardware and software in the 1980s. During
this period, their annual productivity gain was a mere 0.7 per cent. Many
other studies also indicate that the correlation between IT spending and
productivity increases is barely measurable.
The general reaction to such studies is that the data is wrong or has been
misinterpreted; or there is serious mismanagement of IT. It is true that the
economic data is often difficult to collect, but it should be difficult not
to notice an impact on the economy from such a large investment.
This has become known as the productivity paradox, and there have been many
attempts to analyse economic data in different ways to reveal the
productivity that such large investments in computer technology must have
made possible.
If it is difficult to discern what the broad benefits of IT are, how can the
smaller issues be evaluated? How does a manager decide whether investing to
upgrade a company's PC systems to faster computer models, or to install
improved software, will be rewarded through greater productivity?
It is this lack of effective measurement of the benefits of investing in
computer technology that forces many companies to make the equivalent of a
leap in the dark when making significant investments in IT. One senior
executive at a leading US bank describes the decision-making process as
being based on a 'gut feeling'. It seems strange that a Fortune 100
corporation would make important business decisions by instinct but, lacking
other measures, it may be as good as any other yardstick.
The computer industry rarely mentions the productivity paradox. Computer
companies routinely talk about increases in productivity, but these claims
are made within the context of the technology. A new word processor is
described as performing more quickly or data from a large database as being
retrievable in less time. These measures of productivity are reassuringly
self-validating but do not address the larger question of how IT should be
used to increase productivity.
Clearly, this question can be answered only by IT users. And the answer to
the productivity paradox lies within itself. The paradox begins with the
assumption that IT improves productivity and yet we do not see the results.
Surely the answer is that IT is like any tool and its effectiveness is
determined by the user.
Lester Thurow, the US economist, believes that many corporations have
misapplied IT. They have made large investments in IT without fully
understanding how that technology should be used within the organisation.
Many organisations allow departments to buy PCs and software with little
control over which software packages are used and how those systems are
applied. Thus employees find that computers allow them to do more work of
different kinds. But there is often little or no distinction made as to
whether that work should be done in the first place.
Unless IT is managed with discipline and serious rethinking by companies
about how they operate, its effects on the bottom line will not only be
negligible but may be harmful. Organisations which solve the productivity
paradox by focusing on strong management and appropriate use of IT will gain
competitive advantage and unleash the true power of computer technology.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: Japan's People World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saburo Goto hopes that in a few years' time it will become second nature for
many of his fellow Japanese - at home and abroad - to use personal computers
for buying goods, ordering services such as restaurant tables and even
finding out about medical care.
In a country where PC use is far lower than in much of the west - Japan has
only a third as many PCs per head as the US, though ownership is rising
steadily - the race to link homes and businesses to a variety of electronic
and multimedia-based services is speeding up.
As head of IBM Japan Services Business Company, Goto is involved with the US
group's attempt to penetrate the still small local market for PC-based
network services, using locally-developed software to cope with the complex
Japanese language. With Mitsubishi Corporation, Hitachi and Toshiba, it has
set up People World to encourage greater private use of PCs in Japan.
The system will be easy to use, says Goto. 'It is not necessarily aimed at
professional people but also at housewives and older people.' It will
compete with PC-Van (run by NEC, the Japanese electronics group) and
NiftyServe (run by an affiliate of Fujitsu computers).
By 1999, IBM hopes to have more than 1.5m users of People World. The other
services now have about 1.3m between them. People World is working with such
providers of content as Hanako, a women's leisure magazine which will offer
shopping information about sales and promotions in the Tokyo area.
'That kind of information is very important to improve the standard of
living,' believes Goto. 'But equally important is medical information - the
older we get, the more we need special services.' Since Japanese hospitals
are closed at weekends - except for emergencies - People World will also
tell users where to turn to for their unexpected healthcare needs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellman, the specialist engineering company, yesterday announced a
management overhaul as part of its Pounds 46m acquisition of three
subsidiary businesses from FKI, the electrical engineering and components
group.
Geoffrey Iley, the 64-year-old non-executive chairman, said the six-man
Wellman board would be augmented by three new executive directors to oversee
the expansion.
They will be led by Barry Jameson, 49, currently group managing director of
FKI's precision controls division. Jameson, who has overall control of two
of the FKI subsidiaries being sold, has been named managing director of the
transport and technology division at Wellman.
He will be joined on the board by Tony Fletcher, 44, who replaces Jon Smith,
46, as finance director.
Fletcher, who was recruited from his own consultancy business, is a former
finance director and company secretary at Mono Group, the pumps business.
Smith, meanwhile, is to become a divisional finance director within the
Wellman group.
The company has also promoted Roger Hancox, 45, currently managing director
of Wellman Furnaces and Wellman Process Engineering. As a board director, he
will oversee the process engineering division.
The shake-up is thought to have been masterminded by Alan Baxter, who joined
Wellman last November as chief executive.
Baxter, 43, was an FKI director until June 1992.

The London Securities board of directors has effectively been turned over to
its 29 per cent shareholder; yesterday an extraordinary general meeting put
forward a third Nu-Swift director to its four-man board.
Andre Chudnoff, a long-time associate of Nu-Swift's majority shareholder
Jacques Murray, was voted on to the board at a meeting which was initially
called to vote on the removal of the company's chairman and executive
director.
This move was forestalled by the resignation earlier this month of David
Pearl and Richard Prickett. Chudnoff said London Securities did not expect
to pay any compensation for their resignations.
Michael Evans, a director of Nu-Swift, was appointed non-executive chairman
last Wednesday, and Jean-Jacques Murray, another Nu-Swift director, joined
as an executive director earlier in July.
Nu-Swift, the parent company, was only privatised in March, but it is
planned that London Securities will act as its listed property arm.
Proposals are currently being finalised for the acquisition of a number of
Nu-Swift properties by London Securities, in order to reactivate it from its
current position as a cash shell.
Two independent directors are due to be appointed to the board later this
month.

Triplex Lloyd, the Midlands-based engineering group, completed a management
reshuffle with the appointment, announced yesterday, of Graham Lockyer
(above) as group operations director. He put his feet under the desk on
Monday last week.
Lockyer, 47, is an experienced engineer who was managing director at Dowty
Aerospace Landing Gear. He joins the ranks of Dowty senior executives, like
Bruce Ralph, now managing director at Glynwed, who have wandered off into
Midlands manufacturing posts since the takeover by TI.
His appointment at Triplex Lloyd follows the departure last December of
Norman Price, development director but in charge of operations. Since then,
Triplex Lloyd has swept away a tier of divisional management and Lockyer
will have responsibility for all operations, reporting to John Foley, the
managing director.

FT  19 JUL 94 / People: John Richardson collects his ticket from Sketchley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sketchley, the dry cleaning and photo processing group, yesterday announced
that John Richardson, joint executive deputy chairman, would leave the
company when his contract expires at the end of October.
Richardson, 51, and Tony Bloom, the other joint executive deputy chairman,
joined Sketchley in 1990 when it was losing Pounds 800,000 a month and
heavily overborrowed. The two are credited with bringing it back from the
brink.
Richardson says he is leaving because 'the job is done' and because he wants
to return to Asia. Australian-born, he spent 18 years in Hong Kong with
Hutchison Whampoa. He will be returning to Hong Kong to join BZW and
Barclays Bank as chairman of their Asian operations.
Richardson says he and Bloom worked in tandem, selling off businesses with
no future, rationalising the company's structures and introducing stricter
controls on working capital. But most important, he says, was that they
introduced a strong management team.
Through the successful management merger of dry cleaning and Supasnaps,
which involved the closure of many unprofitable shops, they significantly
reduced the groups's retail operating costs. Supasnaps, the photo processor,
was acquired for a total cash payment of Pounds 6m in 1993.
During the past financial year, Supasnaps offset a difficult year in the
core dry cleaning business. In June Sketchley reported pre-tax profits up by
6 per cent before exceptionals to Pounds 5.1m in the year to April 1.
The new division contributed Pounds 1.4m to operating profits of Pounds
6.6m. Excluding Supasnaps, sales fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 101.4m.
Bloom will remain as an executive deputy chairman but will step into a
non-executive role once a new chief executive has been found. He says he has
no immediate plans to leave Sketchley.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Juggling the finances -
Arranging start-up funds was like being in a circus act for Tech-Board's
chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement yesterday that a venture capital-backed start-up will
revitalise the UK's moribund hardboard industry should have been a cause for
rejoicing.
The Pounds 40m project will be the biggest manufacturing start-up backed by
institutions in the UK. The plant will create at least 200 jobs in Gwent,
South Wales and should cut the UK trade deficit by substituting large
quantities of imported hardboard.
But the story of how Malcolm Graham, chief executive of Tech-Board, and his
advisers raised the equity and debt is not encouraging to entrepreneurs
seeking start-up finance. When the deal was finally signed yesterday
morning, more than six years had elapsed since Graham first sought backing.
During this time, he spent all his savings. He also learned what many others
have learned - that with some exceptions venture capitalists and commercial
banks are reluctant to back start-ups.
The venture capital industry is frequently criticised for this. But the
brickbats are often ill-aimed. In the first place, many venture capitalists
manage funds raised expressly for investment in management buy-outs - not
start-ups. Asking them for start-up capital would be like asking a car
insurance salesman to sell cars. Second, the industry has learned from
bitter experience that many start-ups fail.
Graham points out that the Tech-Board project was different. 'Most start-ups
fail because there is no market,' he says. 'Here was a project with an
established process and market, but it still did not get a good reception.'
This was in spite of the fact that the corporate finance department of KPMG
and lawyers at Steggles Palmer said they would work for Graham on a
contingency fee basis.
Graham had become general manager of UK Paper's hardboard division in 1986,
just before its management led a buy-out from Bowater Industries. Its
Kemsley plant in Kent was designed to produce 5,000 tonnes, but it was
operating at three times this level and was falling down.
Yet this mill constituted the UK's hardboard manufacturing capacity. Not
surprisingly, 90 per cent of the UK's 200,000-tonne annual demand was
imported.
In 1987, Graham received board approval from UK Paper to build a new plant,
but by 1988, when the company was floated and later acquired by Fletcher
Challenge of New Zealand, the plan had been put on the back burner.
At this point, armed with little more than plans for a new plant, Graham
decided to raise the money himself.
'I met 3i who told me I needed a finance director, a managing director and a
complete management team if they were to support the deal,' says Graham. 'It
was not an easy route to satisfy.' He spent two years knocking on doors
looking for equity backing. Then he met Peter Learmond, the former steel
trader who in the early 1970s went through similar hoops to raise money to
start Sheerness Steel, a mini-mill.
After three months - and another KPMG review of the business plan - Learmond
said he would back the project and found an offshore investor, Persis, who
put up Pounds 500,000 of interim funding. 'What attracted me was that there
were no other producers in the UK,' says Learmond. 'Every tonne is imported
and costs money to transport. If we had a plant that could deliver on a
just-in-time basis we would have a tremendous edge on imports.'
With the backing of Persis, Graham headed back to his contacts at 3i - after
they had been warmed up by KPMG. 'Start-ups are extremely rare - nothing
quite like this has ever been done before as an industrial start-up,' says
KPMG's Nick Theakston. 'I went to 3i on my own so that they would not say no
at the first mention of start-up.'
By April 1992, with 3i on board, success seemed much more assured. But most
other potential equity providers either wondered why no one else had set up
a plant, could not believe the margins or wanted to buy into something that
would generate an immediate yield.
As a result it took until July 1993 to agree the equity layer of the funding
 -Pounds 2m of pure equity and Pounds 13.5m of subordinated loan stock. Even
then the consortium included a number of foreign investors - alongside 3i,
Persis, Rothschild Ventures and RIT are Tinicum Inc of New York and
Heffernan of Toronto, a group that backed Learmond's Sheerness Steel.
What Graham had not counted on, however, was the difficulty he would face
raising Pounds 15m of debt.
As soon as the equity was in place, NatWest, which is also a substantial
shareholder in 3i, withdrew its commitment to put a loan proposal to its
credit committee. The bank says it was not fully informed of the progress
towards raising equity and that its circumstances had changed.
Graham says the process of keeping the equity suppliers happy while it
raised the debt was like keeping plates spinning in a circus act. Eventually
Tech-Board found two merchant banks, NM Rothschild and Henry Ansbacher, and
one commercial bank, the Midland.
The result is that this August civil works will begin in Gwent. The new
plant will have a capacity of 88,000 tonnes a year and supply the
automotive, furniture, toy and bed-making industries. In theory, 20 per cent
of output will be exported and the plant will displace Pounds 25m worth of
imports.
Only after three years will Tech-Board's assumptions about market
penetration and margins be properly tested. By then the memory of so many
presentations to largely unenthusiastic City audiences will have faded. But
the experience has left many people including Learmond disillusioned by the
UK financial community's capacity to raise finance for ordinary industrial
projects.
'With the great exception of 3i, the greater part of British institutions
are terrified of green field projects,' he says. And has it become easier
than when he started-up Sheerness Steel? 'No. Probably it is worse today,'
he says.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Weighed under by green
tape - Smaller companies may about to get a shock when they fall within the
scope of new environmental laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as smaller companies might have thought the burden of red tape was to
be lifted from their shoulders by a concerned government, the spectre of
environmental legislation is looming large on the horizon.
Many larger companies are successfully implementing measures brought in by
the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, in particular the concept of
integrated pollution control (IPC) which covers air, water and waste
emissions. But smaller companies have been less affected by the legislation.
That is changing. Within the next 18 months, many more of them will fall
within the orbit of environmental protection legislation.
All the signs are that managers of these companies are confused and
frightened by the complexity of the rules and the cost of compliance.
Whatever the merits of the legislation, it is introducing new areas of
expertise that busy owner-managers must master.
Last year the Greater Manchester Business Innovation Centre set up
Envirotech with local sponsors and funding from the Department of Trade and
Industry and the European Union's Regional Development Fund to offer
companies a free environmental audit. The uptake, though improving, has been
disappointingly low, says business manager Adele Neale.
'For those companies that know about the legislation the reaction tends to
be one of fear and 'what is it going to cost us?',' she says. 'Many smaller
companies are adopting a stick the head in the sand attitude.'
This fear is not entirely surprising. Take the principle at the heart of the
Act, which says companies must adopt the 'best available techniques not
entailing excessive cost' - a concept that labours under the clumsy acronym
Batneec.
This principle is applied by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution when
issuing companies with authorisations for certain prescribed industrial
processes. Regulations in this area already cover most heavy industries such
as mining, power supply and chemicals. Now the inspectorate is drawing up
regulations and guidelines, which will be available next May, to include the
industries not yet covered.
These include paper making, timber treatment, coatings and animal and
vegetable matter processes. Many of the companies in these industries are
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The trouble is that the guidelines, being drawn up after consultation with
trade organisations, are necessarily vague. Batneec is site-specific, the
inspectorate says. What is an 'available technique' at one factory may not
be available at another within the same industry. And what does 'excessive
cost' mean?
While the inspectorate accepts this definition is not clear, it says it is
not trying to put companies out of business.
According to HMIP, smaller companies need not be too disconsolate.
Inspectorate officials say the initial confusion in companies first covered
by the IPC was fairly quickly resolved.
More generally, while larger industries were initially critical of the Act
some of the hostility has subsided. 'Our impression is that by and large big
industry has done an excellent job in getting its act together from quite a
low start,' says Robin Bidwell, managing director of Environmental Resources
Management, a consultancy.
Smaller companies are also increasingly likely to find themselves affected
by waste management legislation. With some exceptions - in fact no fewer
than 43 categories of exception - any company that keeps, treats or disposes
of waste will need a licence. Many have already applied for licences. What
may not be widely recognised by SMEs is that companies exempt from needing a
licence must register that exemption by December or risk paying a fine of up
to Pounds 5,000.
The welter of legislation has meant a growth market for consultancies. Some,
such as ERM, say companies are beginning to realise that the environment
need not be a threat but can save money.
And as the scope of Integrated Pollution Control has spread, so has interest
in BS 7750, the environmental management equivalent of the BS 5750 quality
standard. From April next year, companies will also be able to register
under the EU's equivalent standard, the eco-management and audit system.
The question being raised, however, is why companies already inspected by
the pollution inspectorate should go through the additional cost of seeking
and maintaining BS 7750.
The DTI says there may be additional value in BS 7750. While IPC focuses on
processes, BS 7750 is more concerned with ensuring an environmental
management system is in place. What is more, the officials say, BS 7750 is
better than its quality assurance cousin because it clearly encourages
continuous improvement.
Nevertheless, the DTI stresses that accreditation is not a badge of quality
or greenness, only a management tool to help achieve a corporate goal.
While the government may not yet have stopped the spread of environmental
red tape, it is at least aware of the problem for SMEs. As one DTI official
said. 'In the SME sector there is probably a misunderstanding or lack of
knowledge about legal requirements. There are no clear channels for
communicating our intentions or planned changes.'
The DTI and Department of the Environment plan to improve the way they
communicate the impact of environmental legislation to smaller companies.
Unless they are successful over the next six months or so, some companies
are going to have a nasty shock.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Exchange unveils listings rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange yesterday unveiled new rules designed to make it
easier for small companies which have been listed on its Unlisted Securities
Market to obtain a full exchange listing.
The new rules are necessary because the USM is scheduled to close at the end
of 1996 and will not accept any new companies from the end of this year. The
exchange agreed early last year that the USM was not a viable mechanism to
ensure investment in smaller companies. The decision followed the early
1990s' recession during which trading in the smallest companies almost came
to a standstill.
Earlier this year the exchange announced a seven-point plan to encourage
interest in small companies but rejected a call from one of its own advisory
panels for an independent small companies exchange.
Under the rules announced yesterday those companies which have been listed
on the USM for at least two years and are not issuing new securities will be
able to avoid the expense of filing full listing particulars, which require
the production of statements of working capital and of total indebtedness.
They may do so by filing an exempt listing document within 42 days of
signing off unqualified accounts in accordance with a new European Union
listing particulars directive.
The document will contain three years' unqualified accounts, any interim
report prepared since the last accounts, any prospectus published within the
previous 12 months, a directors' responsibility statement and a letter
confirming that the company has complied with all the requirements of the
USM.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Pounds 40m Welsh plant is largest start-up venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 40m hardboard factory is to be built in south Wales in the largest
UK manufacturing start-up to be backed by venture capital.
Tech-Board, a new company, will make the first hardboard in Britain for five
years since the closure of UK Paper's elderly factory at Kemsley, Kent. The
new plant is expected to create 200 jobs and will use home-grown wood.
The factory, with a capacity of 88,000 tonnes a year, could meet about half
of the UK's requirements for hardboard, which is principally used in the
furniture, automotive and building trades. The company intends to export to
continental Europe.
Mr Malcolm Graham, the former general manager of UK Paper's hardboard
division, has spent the last five years since the Kemsley plant closed
putting together the financing package that was agreed yesterday. He will be
chief executive of Tech-Board.
A syndicate of UK and international banks and venture capital houses
includes 3i, which will be represented on the board.
The Welsh Office is providing a Pounds 3.4m grant and additional finance is
being provided by Gwent County Council and Pounds 250,000 of loan and equity
is coming from British Coal Enterprise, the corporation's job-creation arm.
The 12-acre factory site is on reclaimed mining land on an industrial estate
near Ebbw Vale. Male unemployment in the area is 20 per cent.
The new company's chairman will be Mr Peter Learmond, who raised Pounds 12m
in the early 1970s to form Sheerness Steel, a mini-mill, in what was then
the UK's largest industrial green-field start-up.
Construction of the Tech-Board factory will start next month with production
due to start within 18 months.
The equipment will be imported from Sweden. Mr Graham said that the
hardboard would be produced 'using wood harvested from managed UK forests,
it will contain only minimal man-made chemicals and the manufacturing
process will develop virtually no waste'.
Tech-Board expects to gain a significant competitive advantage over foreign
hardboard suppliers because of its lower transport costs and through more
efficient production techniques.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Call to overhaul medicine charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A restructuring of the way National Health Service patients pay for
medicines is expected to be recommended tomorrow by the Commons health
committee, Paul Abrahams and David Owen write.
It will publish a report proposing that exemptions for prescription charges
should be based on the ability to pay rather than arbitrary categories.
At present broad categories - such as women over 60, men over 65, nursing
mothers, and some people with long-term illnesses - are exempt from the
charge. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry says this
means that as many as 85 per cent of prescriptions are free.
The MPs will call for a significant reduction in the Pounds 4.75
prescription charge. Their report is not expected to propose a figure to
which the charge should be reduced.
It is understood that the report was not unanimously agreed, with some
Labour MPs on the committee voting against some of the more radical
proposals.
The committee is expected to call for a thorough overhaul of the
pharmaceutical price-regulation scheme, by which the government controls
drugs company profits. Some MPs are understood to want its abolition.
The report will urge the Department of Health to establish a national
formulary - a list of drugs paid for by the NHS and prescribed by hospitals
and general practitioners. Patients prescribed drugs not on the list would
have to pay for their medicines privately.
The committee wants pharmacies to be able to dispense cheaper generic
medicines if doctors prescribe a branded alternative.
The report will add pressure on the government to continue its efforts to
limit the growth of the NHS drugs bill, although the committee has no power
to force the government to implement its recommendations.
The conclusions are likely to draw significant criticisms from the
pharmaceuticals industry, which has warned that efforts to reduce the growth
of the NHS drugs bill could undermine the UK's position as one of the
world's leading centres for medicines research.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Review builds hopes for a constructive relationship: A look
at the broad support for plans to overhaul costly building practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The almost universal praise with which the construction industry and its
customers yesterday greeted the Latham Review indicates broad support for
proposals to overhaul costly contract and management practices which have
soured commercial relationships and increased the cost of buildings.
The cost of building an office block was estimated in a recent study to be
30 per cent higher in the UK than in parts of the US. Repeated arguments
between different parts of the UK industry over whose fault this is
emphasises the atmosphere of conflict.
It was in a bid to encourage a less adversarial climate that the independent
review of construction management and practices, the first for 30 years, was
sponsored by the Departments for Trade and Industry and the Environment last
year.
Its biggest success has been to weld an unlikely alliance between customers,
construction professionals, contractors and tradespeople who have welcomed
measures proposed by Sir Michael Latham, who led the review.
Sir Michael, a former Conservative MP and ex-director of the Housebuilders
Federation, recognises that little will be achieved if this broad support is
allowed to disintegrate into renewed factional fighting. It is essential,
therefore, that there is strong backing from the environment department when
it responds to the proposals next Monday.
The department is expected to play a central role in developing new contract
forms and codes of practice intended for adoption by public and
private-sector purchasers.
A construction contracts bill would make it mandatory for all contracts to
include common features to improve the flow of payments to contractors and
sub-contractors, with interim payments based on pre-determined milestones.
Trust funds would be required to hold contract cash to protect companies
should customers or contractors fail. Contracts would require pre-determined
adjudicators to be appointed to rule on disputes, reducing the need for
costly court cases.
Variations to design or contract terms, a common cause for claims for
additional payments, would have to be priced in advance with provision for
independent adjudication if agreement could not be reached.
The 'new engineering contract' developed by the Institution of Civil
Engineers already contained many of these features, Sir Michael said. He
hoped the new contract would be used on a third of all government
construction work over the next four years.
Legislation would be supported by a new code of practice, backed by
construction employers and customers and sponsored by the environment
department.
Its aim would be to promote closer co-operation between various construction
disciplines and to provide a checklist of management responsibilities which
could be incorporated into contracts.
The code would be circulated to all public-sector purchasing bodies
including hospital trusts and self-governing schools and colleges.
Public bodies would be encouraged to introduce more efficient tendering
procedures. Companies and consultants would be required to complete a single
form to qualify for public-sector contracts. If accepted they would be
placed on a national register of approved companies. A star system based on
performance might be incorporated for jobs above a certain size, Sir Michael
said. The move would bring Britain into line with continental European
countries which require companies to be registered with a European
Union-approved body before they can tender for work. Companies appearing on
registers would pay a small levy to pay for the cost.
Public-sector contracts would continue to be subject to price competition in
open tender but purchasers would be encouraged to consider quality as well
as price. Guidelines restricting the number of companies shortlisted for
contracts would be applied more vigorously.
The review also calls for legislation to determine who should be responsible
for building defects after construction is completed.
It proposes to make it mandatory for buildings to be insured for up to 10
years against defects. A small levy charged on insurance premiums would help
to fund construction industry research.
'The measures, however,' said Sir Michael, 'must be accepted as a package.
It will fail if organisations seek to pick out the bits they like. Just like
the Dodo in Alice in Wonderland, we want everybody to win, with prizes for
all.'
Constructing the Team. HMSO, PO Box 276, London SW8 5DT. Pounds 19.95.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Dorrell promise on M-way charging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday told the
Commons transport committee that the government intended to proceed with
direct charging for motorway use, probably through electronic pricing.
He could not, however, put a date on when charging would be introduced or
how much it could be expected to raise.
He said the charges would be in addition to existing taxes. The hope was
that the money would be ring-fenced and spent on motorways.
A green paper issued by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, earlier
this year said that direct charging for motorways could raise Pounds 11bn a
year but this would depend on the level of tariffs.
Mr Ian Wilson, a Treasury official, said transport taxes raised Pounds
22.4bn a year, far more than was spent on motorways, but it went into an
integrated budget.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Asda refund pledge steps up price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda, the UK's fourth-largest grocery retailer, is stepping up the
supermarket price war with a promise to refund the difference on a basket of
goods if customers can buy the same goods more cheaply elsewhere.
The store chain said its guarantee did not mean it would refund the price of
individual goods but it would make up the difference if customers found they
could purchase their weekly shopping for less at a rival store.
The move will put further pressure on profit margins in the grocery market,
which has seen a huge expansion in selling space and the rapid growth of a
new breed of cut-price discount stores. It comes as the UK's three largest
groups - J Sainsbury, Tesco, and Argyll, owner of Safeway - were predicting
that margins would stabilise after falling since last autumn.

FT  19 JUL 94 / 'Phantom' agent revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Life, the insurance company, has discovered a 'phantom' agent who sold
23 of its pensions without being registered by the company and without
having received full training.
The discovery came about after the agent, Mr John Maxwell, contacted the
Financial Times to complain that he had not been paid for his work in
selling Royal Life products.
Royal Life, a subsidiary of the Royal Insurance investment group, said it
would be talking to the 23 people to whom Mr Maxwell sold pensions to
determine if they had received proper advice.
The disclosure comes after months of controversy about the methods used by
insurance companies to sell products.
Mr Maxwell said that for a few weeks in 1989 he sold pensions for WF Lemon,
a 'tied agent' in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, which sells life products on
behalf of Royal Life. Mr Fred Lemon, manager of WF Lemon, told Royal Life he
did not recall Mr Maxwell's name.
Neither did Mr Maxwell's name crop up in Royal Life's records on the 23
policyholders. Later inquiries revealed, however, that the policyholders had
been sold the products directly by Mr Maxwell.
Royal Life said: 'From our investigations so far it has been obvious that Mr
Maxwell was selling policies on an unauthorised basis.' The company said it
was keeping Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the insurance
industry, informed about the case.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Lautro to probe leak on Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regulator for the life insurance industry has launched an inquiry into
how an internal paper on an investigation into the Prudential Corporation's
selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational
schemes became widely available.
Lautro said yesterday it was taking action to investigate and deal with the
circulation of a confidential briefing paper.
A particular cause of controversy will be the paper's reference to 'a sharp
telephone exchange' between Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the
Prudential, and Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro chief executive, after which Lautro
agreed to drop a formal investigation and instead carry out an informal
inquiry.
The memorandum is also sensitive because Prudential, the UK's largest life
insurer, has taken a high-profile stance on pension transfers. Last year,
against a background of widespread public concern on possible pensions
mis-selling, it launched an advertising campaign intended to reassure
customers that it had behaved properly in this area.
Earlier this year Mr Newmarch said Prudential did not need to make any
provision against possible claims for compensation from people who had
suffered as a result of taking poor advice to transfer out of an
occupational scheme. Prudential has about 45,000 personal pension holders.
The Lautro memorandum says that by late June it had become clear there was
evidence of 'significant cause for concern' that although Prudential's
salesforce had generally followed the company's procedures, the practices
they used did pose a risk and had, in a significant number of cases, 'caused
actual harm to investors'.
Lautro said yesterday that this comment should be read in the context of an
inquiry in which 159 sample cases and 59 complaints had been examined, and
should not be seen 'in relation to Prudential's business as a whole'.
Prudential said yesterday that Lautro had approached it in April with a
request for an informal review to validate the regulator's pension transfer
rules for the future, and that it had agreed to co-operate.
The company said: 'Our approach to the sale of pension transfer contracts,
which Lautro now seems to be questioning, was developed within Lautro's
rules for the benefit of our customers. Prudential challenges any contention
that it has acted improperly with regard to pension transfers.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Suspension lifted on fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fimbra, the regulator for financial intermediaries, managers and brokers,
yesterday lifted the 11-month suspension of the individual registrations of
Mr Paul Hogarth and Mr David Warnock, co-owners of Bankhall Investment
Management of Altrincham, Cheshire.
The suspensions last August followed a dispute between Bankhall and Clerical
Medical International over the alleged unauthorised transfer of Pounds 20m
to an account at Lombard NatWest Bank in Limassol, Cyprus, for a complex
investment scheme involving offshore financial instruments.
The account was in the name of Hanover Bank, which is authorised by the
government of Antigua. When CMI - a Clerical Medical offshoot based in the
Isle of Man - tried to recover the money Kinitor, a Cypriot company involved
in the scheme, obtained an injunction freezing the funds.
Legal proceedings were started by Kinitor against Hanover and Lombard
NatWest, as well as by Managed Opportunities, another Clerical Medical
subsidiary, against Kinitor, Hanover and Lombard NatWest. Mr Hogarth and Mr
Warnock also alleged defamation by CMI.
Following a secret out-of-court settlement, all actions have been withdrawn
and the money returned with interest.
Bankhall, which employs 15 people and manages about Pounds 50m of private
client funds, was not suspended and has continued to trade throughout
Fimbra's inquiries, some of which are understood to be continuing.
Mr Hogarth and Mr Warnock can resume giving advice to Bankhall clients. Mr
Hogarth said yesterday: 'Bankhall has worked closely with the regulator
throughout in bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. I would
like to thank our clients and professional connections throughout the UK for
their support.'
Fimbra said the two fund managers had been suspended under a Rule 7
direction, which can be made against individuals or a member firm.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Westminster plan could end 'eyesore'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to relocate 3,000 civil servants from the central London headquarters
of the Departments of Environment and Transport - and transform the
Westminster skyline in the process - were put forward yesterday.
Sir George Young, housing minister, announced that an outline planning
application to demolish three 21-storey tower blocks in Marsham Street had
been made.
The application to Westminster city council for a development of offices,
shops, houses and parking spaces was made through Property Holdings, a
government agency. Demolition will not take place until at least 1997.
Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, announced two years ago
that the building, whose three towers loom above the Houses of Parliament,
was so badly designed that demolition was the only solution. Marsham Street
has been described as the ugliest building in London.
It was suggested at that time that the workers at the Ministry of
Environment and Ministry of Transport would move to new offices in
Docklands. It now seems that they will be relocated to other sites in
Westminster.
Sir George Young said yesterday that the maximum height of any new buildings
would be half that of the existing buildings.
He said: 'The magnificent silhouette of the Houses of Parliament will be
restored.'
The outline planning application envisages 690,000 sq ft of offices, 175,000
sq ft of houses and 30,000 sq ft of shops and restaurants.
The site is valued at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m, but it is not clear
whether the government will develop it or sell it to private developers.
Sir George said: 'The government will be staying on the site for another two
years and will then take a judgment as to whether it needs the site. If so,
we will develop it ourselves, if not, we will dispose of it on the open
market at the time.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Hunt promises to ease difficulties of teleworkers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday gave its most enthusiastic endorsement yet of
teleworking - using information technology to work from home - and promised
to review any regulations and restrictions which prevent its growth.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said: 'We need to know of any areas
where legislation or its interpretation is creating special difficulties for
telework so that we can deal with them.'
He also revealed that Whitehall has established a Teleworking Special
Interest Group to serve as a contact point for all with interests in the
subject.
Mr Hunt said at a seminar organised by the Social Market Foundation and
3Com, the US telecommunications company, that a recent Department of
Employment survey found that one in 20 British companies employed
teleworkers.
The Henley Centre for Forecasting has estimated that there will be 3.3m
teleworkers in Britain by next year, or about 4.6 per cent of the workforce,
and some estimates say that 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the workforce in
many developed countries will be teleworking to some degree by the end of
the century.
Mr Hunt said: 'Teleworking can have great benefits for both employers and
employees, but it can also have pitfalls. We need to learn from experience,
so the pitfalls can be identified and avoided.'
Mr Hunt said that the employment department survey found a high level of
satisfaction among teleworking managers. More than three-quarters of
managers interviewed were 'very satisfied' with their present teleworking
arrangements, and a further 19 per cent 'fairly satisfied'.
The main reasons they gave for this, according to Mr Hunt, were higher
productivity, higher reliability and work quality, high staff loyalty and
lower staff turnover.
Ms Janice Roberts, vice-president of 3Com, told the conference that studies
in California had found that teleworking increased productivity by between
15 per cent and 20 per cent.
She said that if it was necessary to mix working from home with coming into
an office the best balance was usually three days at home and two days in
the office.

FT  19 JUL 94 / North-west reports industry busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry and commerce in north-west England is at their busiest for four
years, even though nearly three-quarters of companies are still operating at
less than full capacity, say the region's 12 chambers of commerce.
The chambers' survey of the second quarter of this year says confidence is
high but no longer growing, while a previously steady recovery in investment
has fallen slightly.
The survey covered 1,032 companies employing about 100,000 people, split
almost evenly between manufacturers and the service sector. The region, the
largest in the UK after London and the south-east, accounts for about 10 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Domestic sales and orders returned to an upward trend that started early
last year, after faltering in the first quarter. Export markets also
appeared to be expanding again, with 25 per cent more companies reporting
rises than falls in orders, one of the highest balance levels since 1990.
There were also signs of more jobs, with 16 per cent more companies
recruiting than shedding labour and more than half staying the same size.
Recruitment is expected to increase in the third quarter, with 18 per cent
more companies saying they would take on people than shed them.
The chambers say recovery is still fragile, however. Capacity is shallow in
some sectors and nothing more than a slow, steady growth can be sustained
without affecting cashflow, costs and prices and pushing up demand for
imports.
Investment in plant and machinery was ahead of last year, but less money is
going into buildings. This reflects continuing rationalisation of space.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Mayhew sparks N Ireland talks row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp differences have emerged between the British and Irish governments
over whether the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland is the key
obstacle to the stalled peace process.
The Irish government has responded with annoyance to an interview with Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in the Daily Telegraph
yesterday in which he emphasised that the republic's territorial claim to
the province was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint
'framework document' aimed at encouraging Northern Ireland's parties to
return to the negotiating table.
An Irish government spokesman emphasised that any new constitutional
arrangement for the province had to be 'balanced'.
He said: 'What we are seeking is a balanced constitutional accommodation as
expressed in the (Downing Street) declaration, not some constitutional
one-way street.'
Last Friday in Brussels Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British
and Irish prime ministers, agreed to postpone a planned July summit until
the autumn to allow more time for differences to be resolved.
The political situation in the province is expected to be high on the
agenda, with security, when Mr Major meets Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster
Unionist party leader, and other senior UUP figures in London today.
The meeting was portrayed at Westminster last night as the latest in a
series of discussions with leaders of the province's main political parties.
Mr Major met Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic
and Labour party, last week. A meeting with Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the
hardline Democratic Unionist party, is understood to have been pencilled in
for July 26.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday that he was
'surprised' at the comments attributed to Sir Patrick and did not agree that
the republic's territorial claim was the central issue.
He said a 'number of issues remain to be resolved, and all of those will
have to be resolved together'.
The Irish government has emphasised that the 1920 Government of Ireland Act,
the basis of Westminster's rule over Northern Ireland, should be modified as
a quid pro quo for modifying the claim.
Mr Dermot Ahern, a prominent backbencher of Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party
and co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish joint parliamentary body, yesterday
accused Sir Patrick of trying to 'cherry-pick' aspects of last December's
Downing Street declaration.

FT  19 JUL 94 / MP seeks curb on car boot sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, is to introduce a private
member's bill to the Commons today to restrict car boot sales. Under the
bill all such events which were not run for charity would have to be granted
a licence by the local authority.
The bill has no chance of becoming law because parliament is about to rise
for its summer recess but is a means of raising interest in the subject.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Scotland faces new charity rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure to extend some controls on English charities to Scotland will be
generated by the report today of a Department of Trade and Industry
taskforce set up as part of the government's deregulation exercise.
The taskforce has been seeking ways to reduce accounting, fundraising,
trading and other burdens on charitable activities and its report will make
a number of recommendations in these areas. But as far as Scotland is
concerned, it will have the effect of arguing for more regulation.
In Scotland the charitable sector is less strongly policed than in England
and Wales. There is no Scottish equivalent of the Charity Commissioners and
the 1992 Charities Act, designed to tighten up on potential abuse, does not
apply there.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Tory MPs urge limit on postal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative backbenchers who are opposed to the privatisation of the Post
Office yesterday put forward a parliamentary early day motion opposing the
sale of a majority shareholding, Roland Rudd writes.
The move is an indication of the determination of some Conservative MPs to
ensure that the corporation remains in the public sector with more
commercial freedom.
The motion, which has attracted all-party support, welcomes the recognition
that the Post Office needs more commercial freedom but says it can be
achieved without full privatisation.
Mr Jim Lester, Tory MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, said: 'I cannot see
the economic case for selling off more than half the shares in the Post
Office when it can have commercial freedom within the public sector.' Sir
David Knox, Tory MP for Staffordshire Morelands, said the 'postal delivery
service should continue to be protected by the state'.
The government's preferred option is to sell 51 per cent of the shares in
the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. Tory MPs opposed to this would compromise on
a flotation of between 30 per cent and 49 per cent.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Move to start cable TV in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission plans to try again to bring cable
television to Northern Ireland, more than 10 years after the first
experimental licence was awarded.
The ITC is expected to advertise a licence or licences in the autumn and has
not ruled out the possibility of advertising a single licence covering all
of Northern Ireland - and not just Belfast and its surrounding area.
If a single licence is advertised covering the more than 500,000 homes in
the province it would be one of the largest cable television franchises in
the UK - on a par with franchises such as the west Midlands.
A cable franchise for the Belfast area was one of the first 11 experimental
franchises to be offered in 1983 but the consortium, including British
Telecom, STC and Ulster Television, did not make any progress. The lack of
movement led to the licences being revoked in 1991.
In March Mr Desmond Smyth, chief executive of Ulster Television, said he
believed the time was now right for cable in Northern Ireland and admitted
the company was in preliminary talks with Mercury Communications.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the ITC, said yesterday: 'I don't think
cable is out of the woods yet but the environment is very different from
even three years ago.' Unlike the franchises awarded by the old Cable
Authority, the new 'local delivery franchises' go to the highest bidder.
The signs are that there will be more than one potential operator interested
in Northern Ireland, one of the largest uncabled areas of the UK and a
region where there is a high interest in television choice and, almost
certainly, in competing telecommunications services.
The ITC has already advertised this year four of the new local franchises -
the latest last Friday for southern East Anglia covering Thetford, Diss,
Bury St Edmunds, Sudbury, Clacton and surrounding areas. This involves about
250,000 homes.
The first of the new franchises, which allow over-the-air broadcast of
channels using microwave frequencies as well as cable, attracted the
surprisingly high annual bid of Pounds 1.6m when advertised in west Kent.
The franchise went to Eurobell, a cable operator with franchises in the
Crawley area of West Sussex and in Devon.
The new franchise areas often include semi-rural areas that are of interest
to cable operators in nearby large cities.
Last month the ITC announced that Cable Communications Fylde and Wyre had
won the new licence for Blackpool and Fylde with a cash bid of Pounds
762,000. The ITC also advertised a licence covering Chesterfield, Bolsover,
Matlock, Belper and the surrounding area.
Cable television is now available to about 3m homes in the UK with more than
650,000 of them subscribing to modern networks increasingly offering
telephone services as well as television channels.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Treasury on course for PSBR target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's budget deficit fell to a lower than expected Pounds 2.86bn
in June from Pounds 4.3bn in May. This indicates that the Treasury is well
on course to achieve its recently set target of Pounds 36.1bn for the public
sector borrowing requirement in the financial year to the end of March 1995.
The Treasury and the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the
PSBR fell to Pounds 11.4bn in the three months to the end of June from
Pounds 13.4bn in the first three months of the 1993-94 financial year.
Excluding last month's privatisation proceeds of Pounds 180m from the sale
of Northern Ireland Electricity shares, the PSBR in June was Pounds 3.04bn.
Without privatisation income the deficit shrank by Pounds 3bn to Pounds
11.9bn in the three months to the end of June from Pounds 14.9bn in the same
period last year.
The June deficit was markedly lower than the City's Pounds 3.7bn consensus
forecast. The Treasury said early tax payments by the self-employed ahead of
a July 1 deadline boosted government revenues. Income tax receipts jumped to
Pounds 5.53bn in June from Pounds 4.18bn in May and Pounds 4.8bn in June
last year.
The overall improvement in the government's finances so far this year
reflects relatively strong revenue growth and only a small rise in
government outlays.
Cash receipts were Pounds 17.1bn in June and Pounds 50.5bn in the first
three months of 1994-95 to show a 4.3 per cent rise compared with Pounds
48.4bn in the same period last year.
Cash outlays were Pounds 20.6bn in June and Pounds 62.4bn in the first three
months of the financial year, up 1.6 per cent on spending of Pounds 61.4bn
in the equivalent period of 1993-94. These were boosted, however, by higher
interest payments and lower privatisation proceeds, which count as negative
expenditure. Net departmental outlays in the three months fell 1.5 per cent
compared with a year ago to Pounds 58.9bn.
Yesterday's figures had no impact on financial markets but economists were
impressed. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers
International, said that the scale of improvement in the fiscal deficit was
likely to be sustained over the rest of 1994-1995. 'Assuming that the
November Budget does not shift the fiscal stance, the PSBR could be down to
Pounds 25bn or 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1995-96' compared with Pounds 45.9bn
in 1993-94, he said. This would be 'among the smallest deficits in the
European Union'.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Clarke says economy set for success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's economy is 'poised for success', Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, told the Commons yesterday in an optimistic end-of-term report
which heartened Tory MPs as they prepared for the summer break.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, made a sustained attempt to cloud
the horizon by saying that Mr Clarke had made clear his preference for a
broader-based valued added tax which permitted a lower uniform rate.
Mr Brown quoted a letter written by Mr Clarke to one of his constituents in
which he said: 'I have always thought we exempt far too many goods and
services from VAT in this country.'
He insisted that Mr Clarke, far from wanting to lower taxes as he claimed,
was committed to the principle of extending VAT.
Mr Clarke intervened to protest that it was 'utterly pathetic' of Mr Brown
to make such a charge on the basis of one letter sent to a constituent.
The chancellor explained that in his view it would have been better when VAT
was introduced to have had fewer exemptions and a lower rate.
Earlier Mr Clarke said that the government's strategy had produced
'potentially the most favourable set of economic circumstances which Britain
has enjoyed for over a generation'.
He said: 'At this stage of recovery from recession no government since the
war has produced an economic climate combining steady economic growth with
falling unemployment, rising productivity and low inflation of the kind we
now have.'
Growth was not only set to continue at its current healthy rate, but was
becoming increasingly balanced as the recovery spread throughout the
economy.
Mr Clarke reaffirmed the government's determination to stick to its
inflation target of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent - and reducing it to
the lower end before the next general election.
Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, attacked the
chancellor for delivering a speech of 'staggering complacency'.
A Labour demand that the increase in VAT on domestic fuel from next April
should be reconsidered was defeated by a majority of 41 (302-261).

FT  19 JUL 94 / Retailers record strongest sales so far this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British retailers achieved their best sales so far this year in June and are
looking for further robust sales growth this month compared with a year ago,
the Confeder-ation of British Industry reports.
The CBI's latest distributive trades survey, released today, suggested that
April's tax increases have yet to make a significant adverse impact on
consumer spending.
The survey of 502 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between June 14
and July 6 found that retail sales volumes bounced back from a disappointing
performance in May and increased more than expected compared with June last
year.
Of the 302 retailers polled 48 per cent said sales were up compared with a
year ago, 21 per cent said they were down and about 30 per cent said they
were unchanged.
The resulting balance, which the CBI considers a good guide to the trend of
sales, was a positive 27 per cent compared with 12 per cent in May. This
balance was the highest since December, when on balance 34 per cent of
retailers said sales had risen. In the previous survey a balance of 22 per
cent of retailers said they expected sales to rise in June.
The survey found that nearly two-thirds of retailers considered their sales
were average for the time of year in June, with 15 per cent describing them
as good and 21 per cent complaining that they were poor. The balance of
replies - at minus 6 per cent - was the least negative since December, when
on balance retailers found sales were good for the time of year.
Elsewhere, the CBI reported that wholesalers' sales volumes grew in the year
to June at their strongest rate since September 1987. A balance of 64 per
cent of wholesalers reported sales up on a year, while altogether 87 per
cent of the 136 companies polled said that sales were either good or average
for the time of year compared with only 13 per cent saying they were poor.
Only motor traders appeared to experience less than buoyant trading
conditions last month.
On balance, 12 per cent of motor traders reported an increase of sales
compared with June last year - the slowest rate of growth so far this year.
The responses showed that on balance 21 per cent thought sales were below
average for the time of year and were expected to stay flat in July.
By contrast, retailers and wholesalers are expecting further sales growth
this month. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades
panel, said: 'Retailers' expectations are at their highest since last
December.'
But he warned: 'We still need to be cautious as consumers have yet to feel
the full impact of the tax rises announced last year.'
Among retailers the strongest increases in sales were reported by footwear
and leather merchants, off-licences and booksellers and stationers.
Only hardware, china and do-it-yourself stores reported significant falls in
sales. About half the retail sectors reported sales above average for the
time of year.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Portfolio of work gets jobless off the dole: A look at an
employment scheme being tested by Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six months ago Mr Brian Richards, an agricultural drainage worker, had been
unemployed for two years. Now he is self-employed and working on a variety
of drainage jobs including one at Nottingham Forest football ground.
The opportunity for Mr Richards, 56, to get off state benefits was provided
by a pilot scheme operated by Lincolnshire Training and Enterprise Council.
It is based on the premise that most of the new jobs being created are
part-time, but the benefits system discourages the unemployed from taking
them.
The scheme is called Job Match. It is one of 26 job-creation experiments
being piloted by Tecs, which administer training programmes in England and
Wales. Job Match helps long-term unemployed people assemble a portfolio of
part-time jobs, or take a part-time job in the hope that it may become a
full-time one.
In one pilot - considered to be one of the most successful - participants
are provided with a subsidy of Pounds 50 a week for up to six months. They
can also apply for a one-off grant of up to Pounds 300 for training.
Mr Richards, who was not eligible for family credit, started with a
part-time job and eventually built up enough work to become self-employed.
He used his Pounds 300 voucher to update his skills by undertaking a course
on drainage technology and installation. He feels the future now looks 'very
promising'.
Many unemployed people reject part-time work because the wages are often
close to, or sometimes below, benefit levels. Single people and the
childless are not eligible for state top-up benefits, called family credit.
Others take a part-time job and still claim benefit.
Lincolnshire Tec regards its experiment in 'portfolio' working as a success.
Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Tec, said: 'There are no miracle
cures for unemployment, but this is a useful tool and I would like the
scheme extended. Long-term unemployed people need practical support to get
back to work.
'It takes a lot of confidence to leave a secure benefits arrangement. Most
people are earning more on Job Match than they would have received on
benefit.'
The scheme's apparent success with its clients is of particular relevence at
the moment because Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is considering
extending family credit, a benefit for low-paid workers with children, to
cover single people and childless couples.
Mr Peter Ashby, a consultant with Full Employment UK, an employment
consultancy, said: 'The crucial lesson from Lincolnshire is that unemployed
adults need to know where they will stand before they take the jump into
employment. Family credit can be complicated to obtain, which is why a new
style family credit would need to be simpler and more vigorously marketed.'
About 350 people in Lincolnshire have taken part in the scheme, which
started in September.
Portfolio working typically is concentrated on the lower end of the wage
scale and involves the unskilled.
So far 126 people have completed the six-month period during which they
receive the subsidy. Only five of these have gone back on benefits.
Several participants are using the scheme to get back to self employment,
including single parent Mrs Julie Elphick, who has used Job Match to take a
part-time teaching job and develop a knitwear design business.
She said: 'It is so difficult in this country for single parents to lift
themselves out of the poverty trap. But this scheme has got me back into the
jobs market. I am very grateful for it.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Scotland faces new charity rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure to extend some controls on English charities to Scotland will be
generated by the report tomorrow of a Department of Trade and Industry
taskforce set up as part of the government's deregulation exercise.
The taskforce has been seeking ways to reduce accounting, fundraising,
trading and other burdens on charitable activities and its report will make
a number of recommendations in these areas. But as far as Scotland is
concerned, it will have the effect of arguing for more regulation.
In Scotland the charitable sector is less strongly policed than in England
and Wales. There is no Scottish equivalent of the Charity Commissioners and
the 1992 Charities Act, designed to tighten up on potential abuse, does not
apply there.
This has given rise to concerns that enforcement of the act in England and
Wales is likely to encourage a growth in dubious fundraising and other
abuses north of the border.
The taskforce report is likely to accept the case mounted by the Scottish
Council of Voluntary Organisations that there should be common standards
throughout the UK, governing issues such as the regulation of fundraising
and the role of charity trustees.
More than a third of nearly 200 recommendations in the report have been
accepted by the government, and further studies will be commissioned in some
other areas.
Voluntary sector representatives told the taskforce that one of the most
effective ways of reducing tax burdens on charities would be freeing them
from value added tax on their activities, but this is unlikely to be agreed
by the government.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Uncertainty deters house buyers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lack of confidence in the recovery from recession is continuing to deter
prospective house buyers, a survey published today shows.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the survey,
said prices remained broadly stable in the three months to the end of June
compared with the previous three months, but estate agents reported that
there had been a further marked slowdown in the number of people searching
for new homes.
This continues the downward trend first reported in April after a buoyant
first three months of the year.
The institution said potential homebuyers were being unnerved by talk of
rising interest rates and frustrated by lack of choice.
Fragile consumer confidence and the continued stand-off between buyers and
sellers meant that the number of sales and purchases was similar to last
year.
Mr Peter Miller, the institution's residential property spokesman, said:
'Buyers seem unwilling to take on long-term commitments. To return to a
sustained recovery so essential for the wider economy, the volume of sales
must increase so that the market can acquire its own momentum.'
Many properties remained overpriced, the survey said, but 72 per cent of
chartered surveyor estate agents reported no change in prices in the last
three months. The remainder split evenly between those reporting higher and
lower prices.
London and East Anglia enjoyed the busiest conditions while the market was
weakest in the north-west.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Squeeze put on eligibility for council housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday unveiled plans to tighten the rules by which the
homeless can apply for local authority housing, triggering a furious protest
from opposition parties and independent pressure groups.
The plans, announced in the Commons by Sir George Young, the housing
minister, will mean that certain social groups - including single mothers -
will no longer be given priority treatment for accommodation. Some of Sir
George's proposals, which could be followed by legislation next year,
represent a substantial climbdown from ideas that were floated in a
consultation paper produced by the Department of the Environment six months
ago.
Labour said the plans were 'mean-spirited'. Shelter, the housing charity,
said they 'did nothing to increase the supply of affordable rented housing'.
Specific groups, including pregnant women and young people, will lose their
automatic right to permanent council accommodation. Ministers have regarded
the right as unfair to those with 'underlying needs' who are not made a
priority. They want most applications to be filtered through a single
waiting list.
The government also wants local authorities to ensure that applicants for
accommodation are 'unintentionally' homeless. Ministers say that a flaw of
the present system is that young people deliberately leave home and single
women deliberately become pregnant so that they can be eligible for
accommodation.
Sir George told MPs that vulnerable people would not be 'left to live on the
streets or in unsatisfactory accommodation'.
But Mr John Battle, his opposition counterpart, said that his statement
represented 'an attack on the basic rights to housing provision that not
even Mrs Thatcher . . . was prepared to contemplate'.
Mrs Sheila McKechnie, the director of Shelter, also criticised the
proposals. She said: 'We urge the government not to change the law. This can
only mean misery for the thousands of people in this country who are
currently homeless or living in poor conditions.'
Nevertheless, the government has softened some proposals from those in its
consultation paper:
Local authorities will still have discretion over how they allocate housing
 -providing accommodation for a single year to applicants who are judged to
be 'in priority need'.
The length of time that local authorities should provide accommodation is
longer than had been envisaged. Environment department officials stressed
that ministers had wanted to avoid the 'revolving door' syndrome, whereby
the homeless are constantly being shunted from one home to another.
Councils will have an obligation to extend accommodation to single mothers
living in women's hostels, against the recommendations of the consultation
paper.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Tougher rules demanded on low-rent homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Housing experts have called for tougher regulation of housing associations,
the voluntary organisations that provide almost all new low-cost homes for
rent.
Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the Housing Corporation, the quango
that distributes government grants to associations, said yesterday that he
needed stronger powers to regulate housing association finances.
And in a report out today, Professor Valerie Karn of Manchester University
and Ms Linda Sheridan of Liverpool University call on the government to
impose minimum building standards on housing associations.
Mr Mayer said he had asked the government for stronger regulatory powers as
he launched the corporation's annual report. This showed that the number of
cases the corporation identified as requiring supervision last year was 81,
up from 44 in the previous year.
Mr Mayer said that the Department of the Environment would soon be
publishing a discussion paper on new powers for the corporation.
These would include proposals for faster intervention in associations when
financial problems arose. Mr Mayer said that the existing procedures for
intervening were 'cumbersome' and should be replaced by powers similar to
those of receivers in companies that went into liquidation.
The corporation wants associations to provide it with information on their
unregistered subsidiaries. These subsidiaries, often set up to build
low-cost homes for sale, can have a significant impact on association
performance.
The call for stricter regulation on building standards comes in a report
published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research
organisation. The report says that building standards are falling. It says
most new homes have insufficient storage space and many lack enough space
for families to eat together.
The authors call on the government to specify minimum standards for housing
association homes.
Mr Greg Lomax, deputy chief executive of the corporation, said that the
research had been undertaken in 1991 and did not take account of
improvements made since then. Independent research carried out for the
corporation had indicated no cause for concern.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Tighter checks on societies urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British banks yesterday called for improvements in building societies'
accountability to their members following the government's decision to allow
societies to diversify into new activities such as unsecured commercial
lending.
The British Bankers' Association said societies should have to obey rules on
consulting shareholders and seeking approval for significant acquisitions
similar to those imposed on listed companies under Stock Exchange rules.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the association, said that it appeared
'unsatisfactory that organisations are allowed greater freedom of operation,
which means greater risk, without levels of accountability being improved'.
Sir Nicholas' remarks, at the association's monthly press briefing, follow
the disclosure of the first stage of a review of the 1986 Building Societies
Act which will allow societies to broaden their funding base and activities.
Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, said at the announcement of the
liberalisation earlier this month that the government intended to require
society boards to inform members of non-confidential takeover offers.
Sir Nicholas said, however, that takeovers were not the main issue.
Societies should be required to consult and notify members on broader
changes in strategy.
He said: 'It does not seem to us to be right that a mutual can find itself
involved in new forms of business that affect the state of the undertaking
without shareholders being adequately informed.'
He suggested that societies should send copies of annual reports to members,
as well as having to seek their approval for acquisitions of a size greater
than 25 per cent of their existing assets.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Labour accuses Lyell of insolence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, was accused of being 'insolent' in
the Commons yesterday when he declined to answer questions about Mr Tim
Devlin, Tory MP for Stockton South, who ceased to be his parliamentary
private secretary last week.
The charge was made by Mr John Morris, the shadow attorney general, who
asked for an assurance that Sir Nicholas had not been approached by Mr
Devlin in a case involving alleged drug offences.
The attorney general said in February that Mr Devlin had not been involved
in a consultation about the case.
Mr Morris also asked for confirmation that Mr Devlin - who says he resigned
but whom government whips say was sacked - would not be replaced. Sir
Nicholas answered: 'I am surprised that the shadow attorney general should
concentrate on such a matter.'
Mr Morris asked: 'Are you unable to give a categorical assurance or are you
just plain insolent?' Sir Nicholas said he was able to do so, but the matter
did not arise from the original question. The case of alleged drugs offences
had been handled by Customs and Excise.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Subsidies deal averts US sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement on eliminating shipbuilding subsidies reached on Sunday
follows five years of negotiations, chiefly at the insistence of the US.
Two main issues that nearly scuppered the discussions earlier this year were
hammered out at last week's talks: European objections to the US Jones Act,
under which a fixed proportion of cargo passing through US ports must be
carried in vessels built in US yards; and concern about South Korean plans
to increase shipbuilding capacity by 40 per cent over five years.
Mr Staffan Sohlman, the Swedish chairman of the OECD committee overseeing
the talks, made clear that last week's meeting was 'make or break'.
Under the agreement, the Jones Act stays in place but its scope is limited.
France is still objecting to this part of the deal, although it could be
overruled in a European Union vote.
There is still some concern about capacity increases in the absence of
subsidies, but other concerns helped to concentrate minds in the final days
of the OECD talks: the US threats of unilateral action over subsidies, and
the prospect that a trade war could follow. The Clinton administration made
clear earlier this year it was ready to back legislation enabling penalties
against subsidised vessels. The Gibbons bill before Congress would have
authorised sanctions on subsidied foreign vessels entering US ports.
It was realised that failure to secure agreement could threaten a ruinous
price and subsidy war and remove any chance of controlling dumping. In these
circumstances, retaliation could have brought about a wider trade war.
Details of the agreement are still confidential until discussed in the EU
Council of Ministers. However, the main points are:
All subsidies, direct and indirect, except for research and development,
will be banned from January 1 1996, when the agreement takes effect.
Subsidies already granted will be permitted after the ban comes into effect,
but limited to ships for which contracts are signed before the end of 1995
and which are delivered by the end of 1998. Some experts fear that this
allowance may produce a last-minute subsidy rush.
Export credits for ships are brought under the 'Helsinki rules', the
disciplines already agreed in the OECD for the application of general export
credits. Disputes procedures have been agreed, so that suspected breaches
can be challenged judicially.
A mechanism has been established to prevent 'injurious pricing', such as in
cases of dumping. This was an important concession, especially by the
Koreans and the Japanese, who had long resisted the idea. It will be
enforced by disputes panels, similar to those in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which will have the power to award damages.
The US has agreed to a cap of 250,000 gross tonnes annually on the capacity
built under Jones Act provisions. If the US exceeds this ceiling, disputes
procedures may be opened against it.
Countries may provide domestic credits on terms equivalent to export
credits.
Talks were conducted within the OECD, rather than Gatt because the normal
Gatt principles do not apply to ships, which technically are never imported.
The agreement, which will be monitored, covers 75 per cent of world
shipbuilding. The rest is carried out mainly by Russia, Ukraine, Poland,
China and Brazil.
Efforts will be made to extend the agreement to these countries. In Poland's
case, the issue may be raised during its talks on planned membership of the
OECD. Prospects for Russia, Ukraine and China appear less hopeful. However,
the OECD participants plan wider talks on the industry with these countries
in the next 12 months.

<TEXT>
Foreign ship orders received by Japanese shipbuilders during the first six
months of 1994 rose to 5.2m gross registered tonnes (grt), a level attained
for the first time in four years, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'The major reason was the mass order of nine very large crude carriers
(VLCC) in that half of the year,' a spokesman for the Japan Ship Exporters'
Association said.
A large part of those orders was for the Saudi Arabian National Shipping
company's orders for five double-hulled VLCCs, signed with Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries.
The last time Japan's ship orders for a first half were at this level was in
1990, when 5.5m grt of orders were reported, the association spokesman said.
Total orders for all of calendar 1990 stood at 8.6m.
However, orders for June were down from May, at 635,586 grt. May registered
the largest increase this year when orders peaked at 1,649,910 grt.
Japan produces about 40 per cent of the world's ships and there are
virtually no direct subsidies to the Japanese shipbuilding industry.
Even so, Japan provides indirect subsidies in the form of loans to
shipowners through the Japan Development Bank. In fiscal 1992, such loans
totalled Y53.3bn, according to the transport ministry.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: France urged to block shipyard pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French shipbuilders yesterday condemned the weekend agreement on eliminating
subsidies in the shipbuilding industry, claiming their competitors would
benefit from indirect subsidies that would be left intact. Shipbuilders also
urged the French government to try to block the accord.
'It is a very bad agreement,' said Mr Fabrice Theobald, general secretary of
the Chambre Syndicale des Constructeurs de Navires, the French shipbuilders'
association. He compared it to the Blair House agreement on agricultural
trade between the European Union and the US, which reduced farm subsidies
and was bitterly opposed by French farmers.
The French government was alone in rejecting the agreement reached after a
week of negotiations at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development in Paris. France said it wanted negotiations to continue - to
reach a consensus 'which respects the interests of all parties'.
According to Mr Theobald, the principal French industry objections relate to
indirect subsidies which, he says, are left intact under the agreement. He
cited home credit schemes, under which shipowners get preferential interest
rates for ordering ships at domestic yards and development and research
grants.
The French industry also opposes the Jones Act, under which US coastal trade
is restricted to vessels built in US yards. 'We see no reason why this act
should receive a blessing in the agreement,' said Mr Theobald.
The CSCN said that the French government could and should block the OECD
agreement by invoking vital national interests.
Mr Theobald said that the French industry had restructured as far as
possible and that, over the past 10 years, the number of big shipyards had
been reduced from seven to two, while the number of shipyard workers had
fallen from 20,000 to 5,000. 'We have no more fat left, only nerves and
muscle,' he said.
France yesterday played down suggestions that it would invoke special powers
to protect subsidies paid to its ailing shipyards which have come under
threat from the new international agreement.
At a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the French reiterated their
opposition to the deal between the US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Finland,
Norway and Sweden to end direct and indirect subsidies to shipyards in these
countries.
The French argued that the agreement would not ensure fair competition
because it allowed certain countries - notably Spain, Portugal and Belgium -
to continue paying subsidies linked to existing programmes. France was
offered a similar deal but turned it down, preferring to hold out for total
exemption.
Suggestions that France would evoke the so-called Luxembourg compromise  -
which allows a country to veto an agreement - were dismissed as premature.
The matter is likely to be discussed again at the next foreign ministers'
council meeting. The agreement must be ratified by all participants and is
due to take effect at the beginning of 1996.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: 'No clear winners and losers' - Industry
cautiously welcomes OECD shipbuilding deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's main shipbuilding countries and shipowners yesterday welcomed
the multilateral agreement to scrap subsidies, but differed on who would be
the winners and losers.
Observers said that while anything that removed a distortion of free trade
was a positive step, other factors such as the industry's manufacturing
capacity and the state of the shipping market were more important influences
on the supply and demand balance that dictated prices.
'We are very pleased. This is a solution that the US has been working to
bring about for five years,' said Mr John Stocker, president of the
Shipbuilders' Council of America. The agreement (which was negotiated at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) was not perfect, but
would reduce government interference in shipbuilding and impose discipline
on the industry.
Large shipowners, he said, would benefit as marginal owners would not be
supported by subsidised prices. On the other hand, overall prices would have
to rise, as they would have truly to reflect shipyard costs.
Shipowners accepted this was a likely consequence, but remained unflustered.
The UK's Chamber of Shipping, which represents shipowners, said excessive
subsidies caused too much ship-buying, which lead to 'over-tonnaging' - too
many ships chasing too little freight business.
Mr Nick Granger, director of the UK's Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers
Association, said the effect on the UK shipbuilding industry would be
broadly neutral, so long as the agreement worked as it should do.
It would not have been in anyone's interests to allow a spiral of state aid
to the industry, he said. 'But unless there is more or less a balance
between supply and demand, you will not have conditions where zero subsidies
can stick.' UK shipbuilders, therefore, were worried by the 'massive amount'
of shipbuilding capacity increases being planned by South Korea.
Mr Granger also warned that, unless countries were in the OECD, their ships
would not be covered by the agreement's mechanism to prevent injurious
pricing. 'The Chinese, Malaysians and others are all putting ships on to the
market at cut-throat prices, which I don't think have much to do with
reality.'
According to Mr Simon Quarrell, a consultant at KPMG Peat Marwick and author
of a 1992 report on the competitiveness of European Union shipyards, the
winners in the European shipbuilding industry would be the low-cost,
high-efficiency yards which could compete on a fair and equal basis with
other yards, if that was allowed.
'These would be some yards in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, and
individual yards across Europe, including Italy and France, where some yards
are world-class in certain market sectors.
'But there are other yards which are effectively being buoyed up by
subsidies that should be given the chance to go bankrupt.'
Kvaerner, Europe's biggest shipbuilder, saw itself as a winner from the
deal. 'If this agreement is fully implemented, it will boost our
shipbuilding potential significantly,' said Mr Diderik Schnitler, head of
shipbuilding at the Norwegian company.
Kvaerner claimed its competitive position would be enhanced because the
average subsidy for its yards - six in Norway, two in Finland, Govan in
Scotland and Warnow Werft at Rostock in Germany - was already considerably
lower than many competitors.
The Finnish yards, for example, in effect get no subsidies. However, the new
regime could make the going tougher for Kvaerner's Govan yard, which has
traditionally benefited from high subsidies.
The group also said it believed the OECD accord would enhance prospects for
stability in the notoriously volatile shipping markets, because generous
subsidy levels would no longer entice shipowners to order new vessels in the
face of adverse markets.
There were contrasting views on what the agreement would mean for the US
shipbuilding industry, which has been trying to reduce its dependence on
defence work but has found it difficult to match subsidised prices offered
by rival commercial yards.
Mr Quarrell said the US shipbuilders had over-estimated the effect of
subsidies on the market, but under-estimated the productivity gap between
themselves and the world market level. So the removal of subsidies would not
provide the US with a cure-all.
But Mr Stocker believed the deal at last gave US shipbuilders - which had
not received subsidies for the past 10 years - the opportunity to enter a
market which is forecast to improve 'fairly dramatically' over the next five
years.
He contended that the agreement would radically shift the industry away from
the Japanese shipbuilders which, with the added problem of a strong yen,
would find it hard to keep making ships.
But the view from Tokyo is different. The deal was expected to work in
Japan's favour, as direct subsidies to the Japanese shipbuilding industry
were virtually non-existent, a transport ministry official noted.
At the same time, the anti-dumping code - together with specification of
what constitutes dumping - is looked upon favourably in Japan as a measure
that will help to prevent severe pressure on Japanese shipbuilders to reduce
prices during recessions.
However, the view is that the agreement would not necessarily act to the
disadvantage of Japanese industry alone, since other countries also provide
huge indirect subsidies, but would help to make the market fairer.
The relaxed reception of the OECD agreement reflects the confidence felt in
the competitiveness of Japan's shipbuilding industry. In the first six
months of this year, the industry managed to increase orders by more than
two-fold to 130 vessels. Additional reporting by Christopher Brown-Humes and

<TEXT>
Argentina closed its borders and placed police outside synagogues yesterday
after an explosion had ripped through the offices of a leading Jewish
organisation in Buenos Aires, killing at least 17 and injuring at least 127,
said a government official.
The blast, which nearly levelled the building, in a mainly Jewish district,
was a dramatic reminder of the attack two years ago on the Israeli embassy
in Buenos Aires, when a car bomb killed 30 people and injured some 250. The
source of that attack remains undiscovered.
President Carlos Menem initiated a high-level official inquiry yesterday and
instructed border guards to ground all flights and seal all borders.
Two foreigners were detained for questioning as they were about to board a
flight out of the country, said Mr Raul Burzaco, the presidential press
secretary. Telam, the domestic Argentine news agency, reported that they
were a German woman and an Iranian man, at Buenos Aires international
airport.
An estimated 100 people had worked in the building, which housed the
Delegation of Argentine-Israeli Associations, the country's principal Jewish
community organisation, and the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, a
charity group.
There are some 250,000 Jews in Argentina, most of them in Buenos Aires.
In Jerusalem, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he was sure
the explosion was a terrorist attack, while the World Jewish Congress in New
York called on all Jewish organisations to take immediate security

<TEXT>
The British Columbia Labour Relations Board has ordered the province's pulp
and paper unions to negotiate with companies individually, reversing a
50-year tradition of industry-wide bargaining, reports Robert Gibbens from
Montreal.
The unions have been without a contract for several months and, with surging
company profits, had insisted that industry-wide bargaining be a
precondition of serious negotiating.
The board ordered the unions to proceed with negotiating new labour
contracts with a dozen big companies. It said the unions' stand for
industry-wide bargaining flouted current labour laws requiring bargaining in
good faith. The companies ended industry-wide bargaining last January.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Nabisco and Pfizer launch fat substitute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nabisco Foods Group and Pfizer Food Science yesterday announced the launch
of a fat substitute, Salatrim, to be used in low-fat chocolate bars, ice
cream and cheeses.
Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco, hopes to launch the product in chocolate
bars by mid-1995, breathing new life into the faltering fat substitutes
industry.
Satisfactory fat substitutes have been difficult to develop without
destroying the taste of products, as fat carries taste to the mouth.
Those that have been developed have also experienced difficulty in gaining
Food and Drug Administration approval. Procter &amp; Gamble's Olestra has been
mired in the approval process for years.
However, Salatrim is unlikely to get delayed by the FDA, according to Mr
Hank Sandbach, a spokesman for Nabisco Foods Group, because it is made from
natural substances.
It has also solved the problem of taste, its makers claim, by combining fat
substitutes with fat.
Derived from short-chain acids found in vinegar and cheeses, and steric
acids found in vegetable oils, Salatrim contains fewer calories than
traditional fats because it contains more large molecules, which are not so
easily digested.
Salatrim contains five molecules of fat per gram - more than competing fat
substitutes, but less than traditional fat.
The market for low-fat products in the US is potentially great, with
Americans showing increasing concern about their weight, as evidenced by the
explosion of the diet industry.
Americans also seem to be fighting a losing battle with fat. The number of
obese adults in the US has surged dramatically over the last ten years,
according to a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics,
part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Between 1960 and 1980, a quarter of all American adults were judged obese.
By 1991, that had jumped to one third.
'The government and health organisations have been pushing Americans to
lower their fat intake for years,' said Lyn Nabors, executive director of
the Calorie Control Council in Atlanta. 'But the message is not really
getting through. Consumers don't seem to want to sacrifice taste at all,
which is why a good-tasting fat substitute is so important.'
Pfizer Food Science says it hopes to launch ice creams, cheeses, and baked
goods made with Salatrim soon. Margarines and spreads will be introduced
later. So far, the company has not found a way to use the product for
frying.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The office of Mexico's attorney-general has widened its investigation into
Grupo Financiero Havre, a financial services group in Mexico City, for
alleged embezzlement of more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) from state
development banks.
The government alleges that Havre set up more than 70 phantom companies
which illegally borrowed more than Dollars 100m (some in pesos, some in
foreign exchange) from Nafinsa and Bancomext, two state development banks.
The money was alleged to have been diverted into other companies owned by
the family of Mr Julio Mariscal, the Havre chairman.
He is one of Mexico's most prominent businessmen. In addition to controlling
Havre, he owns the Mexican concession to sell General Motors cars.
In 1992, Mr Mariscal bought the brokerage Casa de Bolsa Mexico for about
Dollars 60m.
Havre is Mexico's 18th largest financial services group, with insurance,
brokerage, factoring and leasing subsidiaries. Government officials have now
assumed supervision of the group.
Last month, Havre's insurance arm was accused by the finance ministry and
the national banking commission, a regulatory body, of failing to report
financial information, of alteration of financial records and over-reporting
its level of capitalisation.
The attorney-general is taking legal action against at least 24 Havre
executives, including Mr Mariscal, his son, the company's top legal officer,
Mr Ricardo Nevarez, the vice-chairman of the insurance arm, Mr Jose Antonio
Aguilar, and the company's entire board of directors.
Mr Mariscal is reported to be in hospital in the US, with proceedings under
way to extradite him to Mexico, while Mr Nevarez has is reported as having
disappeared.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, and leaders of the 10 provinces
yesterday signed a long-awaited deal to ease internal trade barriers.
The agreement falls short of the federal government's aim of dismantling the
plethora of non-tariff curbs maintained by the provinces but business groups
have welcomed it as an important first step.
Yesterday's signing ceremony in Ottawa was also designed to send a message
to Quebec, where the ruling Liberals are about to embark on an uphill
election campaign against the separatist Parti Quebecois.
Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's outspokenly federalist premier, needs to show
voters that the francophone province will fare better as part of Canada than
by breaking away. Mr Johnson is expected to call an election later this week
for September 12.
The PQ leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has scoffed at the inter-provincial
trade agreement, noting that it falls short in many respects of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and multilateral trade pacts to which
a sovereign Quebec would be a signatory.
Among areas covered by the package are government procurement, labour
mobility, transport licences and product standards. The deal also includes a
weak dispute settlement mechanism. However, Ottawa and the provinces were
unable to agree on contentious areas such as energy, alcohol and
agriculture.

FT  19 JUL 94 / IMF 'facing a busier future'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund's second half-century will be busier than
its first, if Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director, has his way.
Setting out his vision of the IMF's future at a Washington news conference,
he said it needed to play a larger role as a manager of the international
economic system, while increasing its efforts to promote sustainable growth
in former communist countries and the developing world.
He said big changes in the 50 years since the IMF and World Bank were
created, at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, included the greater mobility of
international capital and the bigger role of developing countries in the
global economy.
The globilisation of economic activity brought about by capital mobility
made national economies more inter-dependent and made effective central
co-ordination of policies more necessary than ever. However, he signalled
that the consultative process of the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries was not ideally suited to the task because it excluded developing
countries.
It was 'crystal clear that we must try to promote more participatory
decision-making', with developing countries playing a role commensurate with
their economic importance.
The IMF's interim committee, which meets twice a year and includes 24
finance ministers from industrial and developing countries, provided a
'remarkable framework for participatory decision-making.' Its role should be
strengthened to reflect the challenges posed by globalisation of the world
economy.
Mr Camdessus brushed aside a suggestion by the Bretton Woods Commission  -
an independent group of experts headed by Mr Paul Volcker, a former chairman
of the US Federal Reserve Board - that the IMF should focus on its global
monetary responsibilies and not duplicate the work of the World Bank in
promoting growth in developing countries.
The fund, he said, needed to do more, not less. It was working on a package
of measures to increase economic support for clients, especially
ex-communist countries, involving increased access to its loan facilities
and a new allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs), the fund's artificial
reserve asset created in the 1960s to supplement global stocks of gold and
foreign exchange reserves.
Mr Camdessus said countries planning to implement strong adjustment
programmes under stand-by or extended fund facilities should be able to
borrow up to 90 per cent, rather than 68 per cent, of their quotas with the
fund. (An IMF quota is akin to the membership fees paid when joining a
club.) He also favoured increased access to the systemic transformation
facility, a loan facility designed for former communist countries.
On SDRs, two options were being discussed. Equity considerations justified a
restricted allocation to the 37 countries (including some eastern European
countries and the former Soviet Union) which had joined the fund since the
last allocation in 1981. However, he believed there was also a strong case
for a general increase in SDRs to all members to increase global liquidity
when inflation was low.
Mr Camdessus said he would continue to press all members to make their
currencies fully convertible on current account transactions. At present,
only 93 of 179 had achieved this.
But it was time 'for the IMF to go an extra mile' and insist that members
also liberalise transactions on capital account, which had not been
envisioned by the fund's founding fathers. Free capital flows would promote
greater efficiency in resource allocation.
However, although greater capital mobility was desirable, it also raised the
'risk of sudden crises', even in countries with sound policies. So, Mr
Camdessus would continue to press for the creation of a new IMF facility to
give members resources with which to defend themselves against speculative
attacks in financial markets.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Murayama promises a more gentle and humane Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, yesterday sought
to improve the weak popularity of his government by promising a more gentle
and humane Japan, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
The fourth administration of the past year will be 'people friendly. . . a
government you can feel at ease with' and will strive to make Japan 'not to
be a powerful country but a caring country,' Mr Murayama told parliament in
his inaugural policy speech. He promised tax cuts, 'trustworthy politics,'
no change in defence policy, and a more discreet international profile, in
an attempt to assuage popular anxiety over the coherence of the left-right
coalition, which seized power in a parliamentary coup three weeks ago.
Mr Murayama openly confirmed for the first time yesterday that he would
abandon some of his Social Democratic party's more extreme policies, such as
seeking to disband the military, so as to fall in line with the dominant
coalition partner, the conservative Liberal Democratic party.
Policy rows with the left wing helped destroy the previous two centre
right-led coalition governments, but Mr Murayama's socialist colleagues
appear readier to suppress old ideologies to stay in power now their leader
has become prime minister.
Mr Murayama took care to avoid controversy yesterday. He made no direct
reference to a rise in sales tax, which the finance ministry insists is
needed to fund the drop in income tax and pensions.
However, Mr Murayama planned to 'seek the understanding of the people' to
reform the tax system by the end of the year. He aimed to put government
finances, where the state has over Y200,000bn (Pounds 1,310bn) of
outstanding bonds, on a 'sound footing.'
On the economy, he promised to strive for exchange rate stability and for a
'highly significant decrease' in the current account surplus, which reached
a record Dollars 60.01bn (Pounds 38.5bn) in the first half of this year. To
that end, Mr Murayama's government will press ahead with deregulation, to
cut prices and to dismantle barriers to new businesses.
On defence, he promised to uphold the US-Japan security treaty, under which
24,000 US troops are deployed in Japan, and to maintain a minimum defence
capability. This will help assuage widespread public anxiety on Japan's
readiness to face a threat from North Korea, but implies a steep climbdown
by the SDP's left wing when the party holds its next policy conference in
September.
On foreign affairs, Mr Murayama toned down Japan's bid for a permanent seat
on the UN Security Council and said he wanted a 'thorough discussion of the
rights and responsibilities' involved. His call for a nation of peace that
does not flaunt economic or military power marks a contrast to the previous
two governments' desire for a higher world profile.
On domestic politics, Mr Murayama confirmed that he would not call an
election until after new constituency boundaries have been drawn, the final
stage of a five-year campaign to curb corruption and make politics more
responsive to the electorate.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in Japan's money supply slowed in June for the second successive
month due to stagnant bank lending, as the sluggish economy continued to
affect demand for funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Bank of Japan said M2 plus certificates of deposit grew 1.5 per cent
from a year earlier, down from 1.7 per cent for May. Money supply grew 2.2
per cent in April.
While recent hot weather has boosted retail spending, spurring hopes of an
imminent economic recovery, demand for funds for capital investment remains
weak. Bank lending in June fell 0.1 per cent from the previous year compared
with the 0.3 per cent rise in April and the 0.1 per cent rise in May.
Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd said growth of M2 plus certificates of
deposit could recover to 3 per cent by the year-end if currency markets
stabilised, prompting a modest economic recovery.
However, deterioration of balance sheets at banks may curb credit creation
once recovery is under way, in turn limiting the economic rebound.

India and China yesterday agreed to reopen an ancient trade route after 32
years, as Mr Qian Qichen, China's vice-premier and foreign minister, said
during a visit to New Delhi that he hoped border disputes between the two
countries would be resolved soon, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Mr Qian and Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, signed an
agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal
and tax evasion. The agreement provides for lower rates of taxation for
income generated by transfer of technology and investment, with guidelines
to resolve tax disputes and provisions for exchange of information on tax
evasion.
An ancient trade route through the Shipkila Pass on the border of Kinnaur
district in Himachal Pradesh was formally restored with the signing of a
protocol by the two governments.
The route, closed in 1962 after the occupation of Tibet by China and the
Indo-China war, will be serviced by trading complexes at Chhapan on the
Indian side and Jueva on the Chinese side.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's economic growth rate tapered off in the six months to June from last
year's unsustainable levels but inflation was high, according to official
statistics yesterday, Our Beijing Correspondent writes.
Real gross domestic product rose 11.6 per cent compared with the same period
last year, according to the State Statistics Bureau. This compares with 12.7
per cent growth for 1993 against 1992 and 13.9 per cent for the first six
months of last year compared with the same period in 1992. The slowdown
reflects the Chinese government's credit restrictions and other measures to
prevent overheating.
The consumer price index in the 35 biggest cities was up 22.7 per cent for
the six months compared with the corresponding period last year. For all of
1993 the rise was 19.6 per cent.
The latest growth rate for fixed investments was 25.2 per cent, sharply down
from the runaway rate of 61 per cent a year ago.
Consumer spending was growing at a real rate of 4.8 per cent, according to
yesterday's figures, compared with 21.6 per cent a year ago, indicating that
a wave of panic buying last year has ended.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front yesterday claimed victory in Rwanda's
bitter civil war and declared a ceasefire after taking the last government
stronghold, Gisenyi, in the north-west of the country.
The rebel leader, General Paul Kagame, said his forces had advanced as far
as the French protection zone in south-western Rwanda but would not go
beyond positions they now occupied.
The RPF, dominated by members of the minority Tutsi tribe, named a Hutu, Mr
Pasteur Bizimungu, as president of what it says will be a broad-based
government of national unity. His selection is an evident attempt to
reassure Rwanda's Hutu majority that they have nothing to fear under the new
regime.
The RPF is due to install the new government in the capital, Kigali, today,
as remnants of the former Rwandan government and army join the exodus of
Hutus into neighbouring Zaire.
Up to 1m refugees, mainly Hutus, have fled Rwanda in the past week for fear
of RPF reprisals following the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis
during the chaos in Rwanda of the past three months.
As a long-time member of the RPF, Mr Bizimungu is not expected to inspire
confidence among supporters of the late Hutu president, Gen Juvenal
Habyarimana. The new prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu, is also a
Hutu. But real power will almost certainly remain in the hands of General
Kagame, the military commander who formed an army of Tutsi exiles in 1990 to
fight the Habyarimana dictatorship.
The RPF is understood to be offering government posts to those members of
the old ruling party who are not implicated in the killing of Tutsis in the
wake of Gen Habyarimana's death in an air crash in April.
The new government's chances of getting diplomatic recognition abroad are
high, particularly since a special UN adviser on human rights has claimed
that the former government was involved in directing the massacre of Tutsis.
The US has given representatives of the old government five days to leave
and their bank accounts have been frozen. Moves are afoot in the UN to expel
the Rwandan representative on the Security Council.
'The UN will have little choice but to deal with the new government,' Ms
Alison Desfoges, a consultant with Human Rights Watch Africa, the US-based
human rights group, said yesterday. 'But the international community will
also be in a strong position to exert leverage over the RPF, as the new
government will be heavily aid-dependent.'
The British charity Oxfam called yesterday for an urgent relief operation on
the scale of the 1940s Berlin airlift to prevent the flight of Rwandan
refugees turning into a humanitarian disaster.
Oxfam said an airlift was the only way to provide the 500 tonnes of supplies
needed each day.
President Bill Clinton said the US was sending another Dollars 19m (Pounds
12.2m) in aid for Rwanda relief, bringing the US contribution up to Dollars
139m for the year. In Brussels, EU foreign ministers announced plans for
humanitarian aid worth Ecu173m (Pounds 136m) for Rwandan refugees.

<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank, is to test
investor sentiment towards the transfer of sovereignty to China when on
Monday it offers HKDollars 500m (Pounds 41.5m) of three-year notes that
mature on July 28, 1997.
The authority said yesterday that Beijing's approval had been obtained to
conduct a borrowing programme, even if repayment was beyond July 1, 1997,
the day sovereignty passes to China. Through Mr Joseph Yam, its chief
executive, the authority has established close working relations with the
People's Bank of China, Beijing's central bank.
The authority said it expected the notes would be well received. They carry
a coupon rate of interest of 6.95 per cent. 'We believe the market has
discounted the 1997 factor,' an official said.
The issue of three-year paper is part of the authority's attempt to
establish the basis for a debt market in Hong Kong. It now issues securities
with maturities ranging from three months to three years and is considering
the issue of a five-year note.
The notes and bills are sought after by banks. The authority operates a
discount window at which banks can cash notes and bills for overnight
funding.
Bills have been issued since 1991. The value of outstanding notes and bills
at the end of June was HKDollars 44bn. These securities are backed by Hong
Kong's exchange fund, a government reserve established to maintain the value
of the Hong Kong dollar, which the authority manages.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Sino-Indian trade route reopens

India and China yesterday agreed to reopen an ancient trade route after 32
years, as Mr Qian Qichen, China's vice-premier and foreign minister, said
during a visit to New Delhi that he hoped border disputes between the two
countries would be resolved soon.
Mr Qian and Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, signed an
agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal
and tax evasion. The agreement provides for lower rates of taxation for
income generated by transfer of technology and investment, with guidelines
to resolve tax disputes and provisions for exchange of information on tax
evasion.
An ancient trade route through the Shipkila Pass on the border of Kinnaur
district in Himachal Pradesh was formally restored with the signing of a
protocol by the two governments.
The route, which was closed in 1962 after the occupation of Tibet by China
and the Indo-China war, will be serviced by trading complexes at Chhapan on
the Indian side and Jueva on the Chinese side.
Mr Qian said he hoped bilateral trade, which increased to Dollars 675m
(Pounds 433m) in 1993-94 from Dollars 220m the previous year, would register
further dramatic growth. The two countries also agreed to strengthen
economic and technical co-operation in the steel sector. India's iron ore
exports to China touched nearly 4m tonnes in 1993-94.
Mr Qian's visit is the latest in a series of talks aimed at improving
relations between Asia's two largest countries. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, Indian
prime minister, visited Beijing last September, when an agreement to
maintain peace along the 4,000km Sino-Indian border was signed.
However, the two countries have been unable to reduce troops along the
border or resolve several long-standing disputes, including China's refusal
to accept the merger of Sikkim, a state between Nepal and Bhutan, with India
in the 1970s.

Indonesia yesterday marked the 18th anniversary of its annexation of East
Timor by offering to negotiate with guerrillas opposing the takeover, but
the authorities warned that they would come down hard on lawbreakers, Reuter
reports from Dili.
East Timor came under renewed international scrutiny after hundreds of
mainly Catholic protesters were beaten back last Thursday by police. It was
the most violent confrontation there since troops gunned down up to 200
demonstrators at a funeral in Dili in 1991.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Central Vietnam wants to join high-flyers: Provincial
officials are tired of being passed over by investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the moment the communist government began liberalising the economy in
1987, the inhabitants of central Vietnam complained that almost the only
signs they saw of foreign investors and tourists were the glinting wings of
aircraft 30,000 feet up shuttling between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Of the Dollars 8bn in foreign investment projects approved throughout the
country, only 25, valued at Dollars 163m (Pounds 104m), are located in
Quangnam-Danang, the most important of the central provinces sandwiched
between the South China Sea and the mountains on the Lao border.
And of that Dollars 163m, only a quarter has actually been spent so far,
according to local officials. Investments include a gold mine, a granite
processing factory, seafood and furniture export businesses, and a
German-Italian-Vietnamese venture making freight containers.
'We have a lot of investment in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi and not enough
here,' says Mr Doan Ngoc Dau, a member of the communist provincial people's
committee in Danang.
After years of neglect, the national government is attempting to revitalise
the stagnant economy of central Vietnam. Foreign investors facing stiff
competition elsewhere are also looking at the region's opportunities for
industry and tourism with renewed interest.
Among the main obstacles to economic growth were the conservatism and
corruption of the communist cadres and army officers who control the region,
scene of the fiercest battles in the Vietnam war. In May, however, the Hanoi
government cleared out some of the dead wood.
According to Mr Dau, the chairman of the provincial people's committee was
retired, the regional Communist party chief was replaced with someone more
dynamic, and the chairman of Danang city people's committee and one of his
deputies were fired for making 'mistakes in land distribution'.
The reshuffle was welcomed by the emerging private sector in Danang where
most businesses in the area are still controlled by the armed forces or the
Communist party and where official discrimination against those whose
relatives fought on the American side was only recently ended.
'Leaders here have been frightened of making decisions, because they are
afraid they will be responsible for any problems,' says Ms Truong Thi Kim
Anh, of the Danang branch of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
'But now the bureaucratic system is improving a lot.'
Although state companies remain dominant - only 20 of the chamber's 200
member companies in the central region are from the private sector -
entrepreneurs have gradually begun moving into import-export businesses,
retailing and tourism services, including small hotels.
Many such individuals are former government employees, including one of Ms
Anh's colleagues, who recently decided to set up his own business exporting
furniture.
For potential foreign investors, tourism has been the main focus in central
Vietnam. The area around Hue, the former imperial capital, has many tourist
attractions, not least the Vietnam war battlefields now frequently visited
by Americans.
Danang is close to the picturesque old town of Hoi An and to many beaches,
including the one known to Americans as China Beach. The annual number of
foreign visitors to Danang trebled to 33,000 between 1991 and 1993, and some
28,000 have already arrived in the first half of this year, many on cruise
ships.
A Hong Kong company has begun work on a Dollars 24m beach hotel due to be
completed at the end of next year, and an American consortium has plans to
build a Dollars 250m resort with several hotels and a golf course; both
projects are joint ventures with the local authorities.
On the industrial front, a Malaysian-Vietnamese venture has started to build
a Dollars 24m export processing zone near Danang. Quangnam-Danang province
alone wants to attract Dollars 1bn in foreign investments by the end of the
decade. Boasting of its mineral, agricultural and marine resources, the
province has drawn up a list of more than 70 possible projects.
Foreign investors, some frustrated by bureaucracy and corruption in the
past, are likely to remain cautious, but there are signs of more activity.
Shipping companies are opening offices in Danang and the number of cargo
vessels calling at Danang port has risen to about six a week, says Ms Anh.
An attempt to make Danang an international air gateway with flights to
Taiwan failed but at least some of the domestic flights packed with tourists
and investors are landing at Danang these days.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Nigeria oil strike deaths mount
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's striking oil unions said yesterday their leaders had disappeared,
as witnesses to clashes in the commercial capital Lagos between
demonstrators and security forces reported a number of deaths.
The Campaign for Democracy, which is seeking the removal of the military
government, alleged that 20 people were killed. One witness described seeing
a man in military uniform left dead by a rioting crowd while another
unconfirmed report said eight people were shot by armed security forces.
The oil workers are demanding that General Sani Abacha's regime uphold the
result of the June 1993 presidential election, which was annulled after Mr
Moshood Abiola emerged as the apparent winner, and reverse its cuts in
investment in the oil industry. Mr Abiola has been arrested and charged with
treason and faces trial at the end of this month.
Nupeng, the junior oil workers union which is entering the third week of its
strike, says its leader Mr Frank Kokori is under arrest, which is denied by
the police. Pengassan, the senior staff union which joined the strike a week
ago, says it does not know where its two top officials are.
The oil workers yesterday ruled out an end to the strike until the military
government hands over to civilian rule and denounced as a sell-out talks at
the weekend between the government and other trade unions over an end to the
strike.
Some of the 41 unions which make up the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) began
a two-day meeting in Kaduna yesterday to consider a national stoppage in
support of Nupeng, especially if any of the strikers were badly treated. The
NLC has sided with the government in previous crises and avoided all-out
strikes, but as an umbrella for the labour movement it does not control
individual unions.
Factory workers have been on strike in support since last week in Lagos,
where most of the industrial area is shut either because of strikes or lack
of electricity and fuel.
Some multinationals operating in the Lagos area say they have between a
week's and two weeks' supply of industrial fuel, diesel and petrol. The
strike has stopped deliveries of petroleum products to filling stations and
big industrial users, mainly in the south-west of Nigeria.
Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's estimated 2m barrels of oil a day,
said: 'It is affecting production in a small way but we are meeting tanker
delivery schedules. Gradually the strike is taking effect.'

   ISRAELI-JORDANIAN BORDER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the most long-standing and most
intractable conflicts of this entire century, is drawing to an end,' Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said triumphantly yesterday after
he met Israeli leaders on the first day of a Middle East shuttle.
Mr Christopher's optimism reflected the rapid pace of the Middle East peace
process as Israel and Jordan opened their first talks in the region
yesterday, marking the beginning of a week of intense US-Arab-Israeli
diplomatic activity.
The Israel-Jordan negotiations came as Israeli and Palestinian delegates
opened a new round of talks in Cairo and Mr Christopher arrived in the
region for meetings with the leaders of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Egypt. Mr
Christopher will shuttle among Middle East capitals seeking to further
Israeli-Syrian peace process, start talks on economic co-operation and
regional integration and prepare for next Monday's summit in Washington
between King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister.
The optimism may prove to be misplaced in a region which has often defied
prediction and has been in a state of war for almost half a century.
However, Jordanian and Israeli delegates who opened talks in a tent in the
Arava desert yesterday said they had had a 'very fruitful' day and expected
to announce results today, particulalry on one of the key issues -
demarcation of the disputed border.
Both sides said there were difficult obstacles to overcome but said they
were determined to reach solutions to the other two issues - water resources
and security - and finalise them in a treaty of peace. 'The prospects for
peace are good,' said Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation.
The bilateral talks conclude tomorrow and the process moves to the Jordanian
side of the Dead Sea where Israel, Jordan and the US are to discuss economic
projects such as regional tourism, connecting electricity grids and perhaps
a transnational oil and gas pipeline. The US, expected to fund many of these
projects, is considering paving a road between Israel and Jordan via Eilat.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, who on Wednesday will become the
highest Israeli official ever to visit Jordan publicly, said yesterday: 'The
main point is this peace will create unprecedented economic opportunities.'
Mr Peres also said Israel and the Palestinians were determined to press
ahead with peace efforts despite Sunday's bloody clashes in the Gaza Strip.
'There's always a place for fear and there's always a place for regret but
that won't take away the necessity to go forward,' he told Israel radio.
The Israeli-Syrian track has been deadlocked for nearly three years over the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but Israel recently accepted Syrian
sovereignty over the area.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Desert tribes meet to bury differences in the sand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like two warring desert tribes, Jordan and Israel met yesterday in a modern
version of a Bedouin tented camp on their sun-baked border to settle old
scores and draw up a peace treaty.
Sheltering from the 40`C desert heat in an air-conditioned white and yellow
striped tent, Israeli and Jordanian officials and army generals sat at a
table straddling the disputed border and shook hands.
The bilateral talks, the first to be held publicly in the region, focus on
border, water and refugee issues and aim to lay the groundwork for peace.
Tight security ringed the sandy area where Israel, amid isolated palm trees
and scrub, cleared away barbed wire and land mines and constructed a small
encampment complete with generators, portable toilets and dozens of
telephone lines and faxes. In the background loomed the chocolate brown
hills of Wadi Rum from where Lawrence of Arabia descended to capture Aqaba
in 1917 and spark the Arab revolt against the Turks.
Both sides emphasised the significance of the site of the talks. Mr Elyakim
Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, said: 'This meeting takes place
in a tent. The tent is tentative, but peace should and will be permanent. We
are at a very warm spot of our two countries ..it is only natural to express
the hope that the Israeli-Jordanian peaceful relations will be warm
forever.'
Ambassador Fayez al-Tarawneh, head of the Jordanian delegation, said: 'We
hope that our location which bears testimony to the imperatives of
geographic proximity and inter-dependence will inspire us to arrive at
tangible results so that the fruits of our common endeavours may be felt by
ordinary men and women in our long-suffering region.'
Israel put up a new white iron gate in the razor-wire border fence and many
Israeli officials, soldiers and journalists who passed through it were
taking their first steps on Jordanian soil in their lifetimes.
Several Israelis posed for photographs to capture the sense of history.
Outside Israeli soldiers milled around sipping cola at a portable snack bar
set up by Shechem, the Israeli army caterers.
On the Jordanian side, guests at the Aqaba Holiday Inn watched as an Israeli
television journalist talked in Hebrew on his mobile phone to Jerusalem
while issuing instructions to his Jordanian camera crew. Mobile phones and
citizens of Israel are banned in Jordan.
On the exit road an Israeli dished out a glossy promotion brochure on the
tourist resort of Eilat with a special statement from the town's mayor, Gabi
Kadosh - a long-time enthusiast of Jordanian-Israeli co-operation in
tourism. He called for urgent co-operation and sharing of facilities such as
airports, transport and water resources between Eilat and Aqaba. 'Since our
first presence in this region we have dreamed of peaceful relations with our
next-door town of Aqaba. Eventually this day has been reached.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Europe's Changing Cities: Odessa flexes its old mercantile
muscles - The city can do again what it always did best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even 70 years of communism failed to tame Odessa, established by Catherine
the Great in the 18th century as the Russian Empire's most bustling warm
water port.
Soviet rule pushed some of Odessa's sharp traders into the black market and
others, from the Jewish community which accounted for a third of the
population before the revolution, into emigration. But, with the collapse of
communism Odessa, part of independent Ukraine, is again flexing its never
entirely atrophied mercantile muscle.
Well appointed, if somewhat flamboyant, Greek, Jewish and Italian
restaurants and boutiques are beginning to bring back some sparkle to the
dilapidated tsarist mansions that line Odessa's main boulevards.
The men in shiny suits who dine there while their bodyguards and BMWs wait
outside, are engaged in the business which has always been Odessa's natural
mainstay - trade.
The flagship of Odessa's traders is Blasco, the Black Sea Shipping Company
which is the largest merchant fleet in the former Soviet Union. In moving to
the market, Blasco enjoys an advantage shared to a lesser degree by Odessa
as a whole and by other former Soviet port cities, such as Vladivostok and
St Petersburg.
'Regardless of whether we were part of the Soviet Union or in independent
Ukraine, we've always been a marine company which has worked 100 per cent on
the world market,' says Mr Pavlo Kudiukin, president of Blasco, whose office
is decorated with antique furniture and shiny western gadgetry. 'Every
single one of our sailors has worked in a market economy every day of his
life.'
This early exposure to the market means that Blasco is responding to the new
realities of economic life in Ukraine with a nimbleness unusual in a massive
state-owned company. It is ordering new vessels from shipyards in Ukraine,
Slovakia and Germany to revive its rusty fleet, has set up a company in
Cyprus to help attract foreign business and, within the next few months, is
to be privatised with the help of the International Finance Corporation, the
World Bank's private sector arm.
Mr Kudiukin is reluctant to disclose exact financial figures, but says
Blasco's profits over the past five months were in the tens of millions of
dollars.
However, for Blasco, as for the other large Ukrainian companies, the
transition from the centralised Soviet economy has not been entirely smooth.
To start with, they were cast financially adrift with the collapse of the
Soviet Union. At the time Blasco had Dollars 100m on deposit in
Vnesheconombank, the USSR's foreign trade bank. 'Now that the bank is
outside the borders of Ukraine it is unlikely we will get our money back,'
says Mr Kudiukin.
Under the old regime, 70 per cent of Blasco's business came from central
planners in Moscow. Now a third comes from Ukraine and the rest from
Germany, China and Russia in that order.
Blasco ships the metals, sugar and grain that are Ukraine's traditional
exports. An emerging new breed of Odessa merchants, such as Mr Mikhail
Chertkov, head of Karolina-Nord, a private financial company, deal in more
liquid assets.
Mr Chertkov, whose spartan office is decorated with lists of countries in
which it is easy to set up off-shore accounts, caters to those Odessa
businessmen who need help negotiating the financial labyrinth of the former
Soviet Union with its various, non-convertible currencies and who wish to
keep their hard currency earnings safely abroad.
'Given our anarchic banking system, our clients find it convenient to use
our company to make swift hard currency payments for them within the former
Soviet Union,' Mr Chertkov explains. 'The old command economic structures
are gone, but no effective new mechanism exists.'
One result of Ukraine's financial chaos, according to Mr Chertkov, is
capital flight which he estimates at Dollars 15bn, between Dollars 6bn and
7Dollars bn of which he believes has left Ukraine over the past two years.
'This is all because of the idiotic tax policies of the government,' Mr
Chertkov says.
'If the investor climate changes all that capital will flow back and the
EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and the IMF
(International Monetary Fund) will be superfluous.'
However, Mr Chertkov says his clients are prospering and re-directing their
businesses. Russia, once the dominant economic player, now ranks behind the
Baltics, Israel, Greece, Germany and the US in his clients' trade.
'Spiritually, we are very close to Russia, but in business we've very
quickly re-oriented ourselves,' Mr Chertkov says. 'We've found better
partners in the world market.'
Mr Chertkov hopes that Odessa can become 'the great wholesale bazaar for the
entire former Soviet Union'.
It is a dream shared by Mr Edvard Gurvitz, who survived an often implicitly
anti-semitic campaign to be elected Odessa's mayor in elections on July 10.
A free-wheeling businessman who is credited with sprucing up Odessa's centre
when he was a city councillor, Mr Gurvitz hopes to establish a free-economic
zone in the city.
Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's new president and one of Mr Gurvitz's political
allies, supports the idea and consultants, funded by the EBRD, are already
in Odessa to help work out the details of the plan, which, barring
administrative obstacles, could come into force late next year.
Mr Gurvitz is hopeful that, with the added fillip of a free economic zone,
Odessa's traders will be able to help pull the rest of the nation out of its
economic doldrums.
'It's like what the Americans say about General Motors,' Mr Gurvitz says.
'What's good for Odessa is good for Ukraine.'

Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, will have his term as one of
Germany's two European commissioners extended next year, the liberal Free
Democratic Party said yesterday. FDP general secretary Werner Hoyer said
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had agreed to renew Mr Bangemann's appointment in
talks on Friday with foreign minister and FDP leader Klaus Kinkel. The
renewal of his appointment would depend on Mr Kohl's 12-year-old
centre-right coalition retaining power in elections on October 16. There had
been speculation in Bonn that Mr Bangemann and his colleague Mr Peter
Schmidhuber, a member of the Christian Social Union, would be replaced when
their current term expires. Political and diplomatic sources said last month
that Mr Kohl, the Christian Democrat leader, and Social Democratic (SPD)
opposition leader Rudolf Scharping had agreed that members of their two
parties should take up the commission posts. The main candidates were said
to be Mrs Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, for
the CDU, and deputy SPD leader Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul.

Investment grants and tax incentives for enterprises in eastern Germany,
which were due to end next year, will be extended until 1998, Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said yesterday. He said a further
DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) in addition to the annual DM10bn would be put aside for
investment grants, or subsidies, while companies will be allowed to continue
to write off against tax 50 per cent of capital investment in equipment. In
addition, DM1.2bn will be allocated to research and development in the five
eastern states. The east German economy is expected to grow by about 8 per
cent this year, but any growth is coming from a low base - the region's
gross domestic product fell by over 30 per cent between late 1990 and 1991,
and unemployment, officially at 16.2 per cent, is slowing down not as a
consequence of the availability of new jobs, but, according to economists,
because the unemployed, particularly women, are no longer being registered
on the unemployment register.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Poland tries to halve debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Poland yesterday sought to encourage international creditors to commit
themselves to financing proposals which will allow Poland to complete a 46
per cent reduction on its Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds 8.6bn) London Club debt in
the first half of September. Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Poland's chief debt
negotiator, said he was 'extremely close' to obtaining the consent of
holders of 95 per cent of the debt needed for the deal to be implemented in
its entirety. Mr Krowacki said bearers of over 55 per cent of the debt want
to change it into discount bonds at a 45 per cent reduction rate, while
holders of 26 per cent of the debt have agreed to a Polish proposal to buy
back their paper at a price of 41 cents to the dollar. The exchange of debt
into discount and par bonds would go ahead even if the 95 per cent consent
for buy-back is not achieved, as agreements from only half the debt holders
are needed in this case. One London-based debt trader commented yesterday
that the government's decision to hold a press conference showed that
'agreement was slow in coming at the end' but saw no reason to doubt that
the 95 per cent target would be reached, especially as the buy-back element
was 'generously priced'. Poland will be financing the reduction from its own
reserves and loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

The European Union signed free trade agreements with the three Baltic states
yesterday. The accords, which provide for free trade in industrial goods and
limited concessions in agriculture, bring the Baltic states closer to their
goal of joining the EU. German foreign minister Mr Klaus Kinkel said at the
signing ceremony that increasing trade was the most important way to further
economic reforms in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Estonian foreign minister
Mr Juri Luik said his country hoped to fulfil all EU membership requirements
by the year 2000. Mr Luik welcomed the European Commission's proposal to
hold initial talks by the end of this month on an association accord similar
to those with other east European countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British companies pay their bills later than anyone else in Europe, and most
of the late payment is deliberate, according to a survey commissioned by
Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest debt collector. It polled just over 4,000
European companies, and found that payments in Britain are on average 23
days late, compared with a European average of 14 days. Some 54 per cent of
late payment by British companies was intentional, whereas the most common
reason for paying late in the rest of Europe was financial difficulty. 'The
British clearly pay as late as possible, probably because, with little
effective legislation to stop them, they know they can get away with it,'
Intrum Justitia said. The British government has recently come down against
legislating on late payment, but Intrum Justitia found that 88 per cent of
companies in the UK favoured the idea of a statutory right to interest on
overdue money all across Europe. A large majority also wanted the right to
compensation for the costs involved in chasing debts, as well as simpler
legal procedures.

President Francois Mitterrand is expected tomorrow to leave the Paris
hospital where he has undergone prostate surgery. The president, 77, was
admitted to hospital on Sunday and had the operation yesterday to remove an
obstruction to his urethra which was affecting his kidney. The surgeon, who
treated him two years ago for prostate cancer, said that yesterday's
operation had been completed 'satisfactorily' and that the president's
condition was stable. Mr Mitterrand's wife, Danielle, underwent heart
surgery last Friday. Mr Mitterrand has persistently ruled out the
possibility of standing for re-election in next April's presidential poll
but has long insisted that, his health permitting, he plans to serve out the
remainder of his term in office.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Turkey finds it hard to sell idea of buyer's market in state
assets: A look at Ankara's difficulties in realising its critical
privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tezcan Yaramanci is fond of remarking that privatisation is now a buyer's
market. As the man in charge of Turkey's sell-off programme, he still has to
convince the buyers.
For Turkey's privatisation is at a critical juncture. With access to the
debt markets cut off, the government would appear to have little choice but
to push ahead with rapid asset sales to bolster the balance of payments and
see off a possible debt rescheduling.
Yet, only this month, the government has had its way blocked. The
constitutional court invalidated its use of decree powers to speed up the
programme, with the effect that parliament's approval will have to be sought
for any legislative changes to prepare companies for sale.
The Turkish programme is suffering from a credibility gap. The latest
wrangle over pricing in the oil industry, one of the sectors earmarked for
disposal, merely points up the conflicting policy objectives of a government
desperate to raise revenues for the budget, but also keen to keep a grip on
headline inflation.
The companies on offer include oil refining and distribution,
telecommunications, the state airline Turk Hava Yollari and a steel concern.
Back in May, Mr Yaramanci predicted privatisation receipts would reach
around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1994. Today, he is less confident.
'It's still the target we're running after. But if you consider we only
managed to raise Dollars 1.7bn, in 10 years since the programme was
launched, you know what we're up against,' he says.
For few developing countries have talked about privatisation for so long
with so few results. In some respects, Turkey's privatisation effort is a
casualty of what a US banker called reform fatigue. Even today the
government is engaged in little more than a revenue raising exercise - the
Thatcherite targets of spreading share ownership and increasing economic
efficiency are no longer mentioned. Indeed, in the current financial chaos,
public offerings have been abandoned, with Mr Yaramanci concentrating
instead on block sales of strategic stakes to industrial or trade buyers.
The programme faces three main challenges. First, the international market
is abrim with privatisation offers from eastern Europe to Latin America and
the Far East.
Second, it is all but impossible to put a value on Turkish assets, with the
lira having depreciated by around 50 per cent since the start of the year.
Exacerbating the problems, the government has yet to clarify key issues like
labour restructuring and pricing, without which buyers are not able to
forecast future earnings.
Third, there are any number of special interest groups who need to be won
round to the programme, from labour unions concerned about redundancies,
civil servants and politicians worried about loss of status and patronage -
even some private sector companies fear increased competition that might
result from divestiture. For example, it was on an appeal from Social
Democrat deputies that the constitutional court on July 6 overruled the
government's fast track legislation.
In today's conditions, bankers also point out that any disposal is likely to
have to be at a large discount. This could play further into the hands of
those who charge that this is little more than a distress sale. 'It's the
destiny of the man sitting in this chair,' concedes Mr Yaramanci. 'As you
cannot possibly make an auction where all 60m Turks participate, there will
always be criticism.'
Labour issues remain particularly sensitive. The government has made some
progress, introducing a job loss insurance fund which will compensate
workers laid off for up to eight months after their dismissal. The catch is
that financing for the fund has to come from the sales proceeds from
privatisation.
As for labour restructuring, there are signs that the government may be
backtracking on its earlier pledge to close down the loss-making Zonguldak
coal mines and the Karabuk iron and steel works. Mr Yaramanci now talks of a
'partial closure, laying off some personnel'.
Only two weeks ago, the government had a foretaste of the sort of battle to
come, when it publicly invited domestic bids for its 51 per cent stake in
Eregli Iron and Steel company (Erdemir). Mr Yaramanci's comments to
reporters that the company was probably not worth its replacement value,
pitched him into a slanging match with one of the company's directors, who
called his comments 'criminal' and called for a stock exchange inquiry.
The decision to go to public tender for Erdemir is understood to have been
against the advice of the consultants CS First Boston. The move is seen more
as a measure of the pressure Mr Yaramanci is under from the politicians,
motivated by the need to show the World Bank and others supporting the
privatisation effort that the programme is still on track. Moreover, by
inviting local bids, the government is also hoping to see off the criticism
that domestic investors have been ignored - a problem which led to court
action on earlier sell-offs.
Mr Yaramanci is understandably frustrated. However, not all the problems are
within his control. The telecommunications sector has been embroiled in an
embarrassing legal tussle. In April, Teletas - a joint venture with Alcatel
Bell and Turkey's first privatisation - was forced to seek court protection
from its creditors, as a result of the failure of the state telecom monopoly
PTT to pay for its equipment supplies. The issue has since been resolved
with Citibank last week lending Dollars 165m to the government to allow the
PTT to settle its debts. However, the incident can hardly have helped the
planned PTT privatisation.
Conflicting policy objectives are equally apparent in the petroleum sector.
Here, the foreign oil majors, now being courted to take a stake in the
industry, complain that the government is using its control over the state
run Tupras refinery, to hold down domestic oil prices, causing additional
losses at both Tupras and the state-run retailer Petrol Ofisi.
Mr Yaramanci insists that with privatisation of Tupras, 70 per cent of
refining capacity will be in private hands, ensuring a level playing field.
'We will offer comfort and security to investors,' Mr Yaramanci declares.
However, in the next breath, he reveals that the government may seek certain
industrial conditions 'to protect employment and secure some capacity
increases or additional investments'.
As one banker put it: 'He may talk about a buyer's market, but then he seems
obliged to introduce all these seller's conditions.'

FT  19 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Swedish jobless rate climbs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's unemployment rate climbed to 8.5 per cent of the workforce in June
from 7.1 per cent in May, according to the central bureau of statistics. The
latest figure was swollen by school-leavers and was in line with market
expectations. It was lower than a year ago when 9 per cent of the workforce
lacked a job. Economists say that, adjusted for seasonal factors, the
unemployment rate is steady. This may disappoint the centre-right
government, which is anxious for clear signs of economic revival just two
months before a general election. An encouraging sign is that the number of
people in jobs rose in June to 4.05m from 3.88m in May. The number of people
participating in special training schemes was also down, falling to 177,000
from 240,000. Christopher Brown-Humes, Stockholm
Finnish unemployment rose to 19.9 per cent in June from 19.0 per cent in
May, the Labour Ministry said yesterday.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Italian coalition's divisions damage lira and equities:
Berlusconi defends decree limiting magistrates' powers of arrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian lira and the Milan stock market fell sharply yesterday as Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, tried to prevent his right-wing
coalition government splitting over a decree limiting the judiciary's powers
of arrest.
The lira touched a low of L1,003 against the D-Mark before recovering to
L1,002 compared with L993.8 on Friday. It also lost ground against the
French franc, falling from L289.9 to L292.1. But it remained virtually
unchanged against the dollar at just over L1,547.
Milan's Comit share index steadied after a sharp fall to close 3 per cent
down.
Mr Berlusconi, who provoked the crisis last Thursday by approving a decree
that has allowed dozens of leading corruption suspects to leave prison,
appeared on television last night to defend the decision and to attempt to
quash speculation about the future of his government.
'We are absolutely not a step away from a government crisis, ' he said. 'The
decree is not an amnesty for anyone. We need to have civilised debate, not
screaming in the piazza.'
A spokesman for the prime minister said Mr Berlusconi was not taking a rigid
line on the decree. He said it was open to amendment, although the basic
principles underlying the decree must remain.
The decree led to the immediate resignation of the popular team of Milan
magistrates who have been largely responsible for attacking civil service
and business corruption in Italy in the past two years. But it has also
shaken Mr Berlusconi's two coalition partners, the Northern League and the
neo-fascist MSI/ National Alliance, which benefited in the spring election
from anti-corruption records and which want the decree repealed.
The subsequent infighting between Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and the
two coalition partners has already led to the senior League member of the
government saying he had been deceived over the decree. Forza Italia
ministers came close yesterday to accusing him of lying.
The row has poisoned already poor relations between the coalition partners,
particularly between the League and Mr Berlusconi and, although threats by
both sides to either resign or provoke new elections seem unlikely to come
to a head, scope for compromise is limited.
Analysts believe that the government, whose popularity has been dented by
the affair, may be able to reach a quieter compromise by the time it is
discussed in parliament, which has to ratify the decree within the next
three months.
But there was little evidence of an improvement in the political atmosphere
yesterday. The League said that it would today ask a parliamentary
commission that the decree on the custody of corruption suspects be
withdrawn.
That tension will continue to worry the markets, analysts say. Mr Paolo
Azzoni, a Milan stockbroker, yesterday described the situation as dangerous.
Foreign investors were reducing their exposure in Italian stocks and Mr
Azzoni said that markets needed a clear sign that the split in government
had been resolved. Without this, stock prices were likely to slip further.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Spain and France tighten drift net fishing controls
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain and France have welcomed a decision to give EU inspectors greater
powers to check fishing boats for oversized drift nets after skirmishes on
the high seas between Spanish and French fishermen at the weekend, Reuter
reports from Madrid.
Spanish agriculture and fisheries minister Mr Luis Atienza said: 'I think we
have achieved a notable strengthening of the processes of inspection and
control which will be carried out by EU inspectors.'
After a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels yesterday, Mr
Atienza said France and Spain had agreed to let EU inspectors travel on
national inspection vessels to check fishing boats.
'(The decision) will reassert the credibility of the inspection process.
Until now, inspectors came from individual countries and practice showed
that French patrol boats . . . were not sufficiently diligent,' Mr Atienza
said.
On Saturday, 60 Spanish boats clashed with five French vessels 700km off the
northern coast of Spain in the latest skirmish in the so-called 'tuna war'.
A French trawler, La Gabrielle, was rammed and set alight with petrol bombs.
Spanish fishermen claim it carries oversized nets.
Spain's 300-strong fleet headed home on Monday with La Gabrielle in tow. Mr
Atienza said the trawler would be returned to France after checks by Spanish
authorities and EU inspectors.
The French agriculture ministry welcomed the Brussels agreement but stressed
that France 'would never and in no way accept Spanish constraints imposed by
force'.
Mr Alain Parres, president of the French fishermen's national federation,
said he would demand that France lobby Spanish authorities for compensation
for the La Gabrielle incident.
'We're going to demand compensation for the material damage and for the
financial cost of lost catches,' Mr Parres said before meeting French
agriculture minister, Mr Jean Puech. Mr Parres said he would also request
better protection for French fishermen.
EU rules forbid the use of nets longer than 2.5km and Spanish fishermen have
consistently accused French boats of contravening these norms.
French fishermen say the Spanish are trying to drive them out of the water.
The environmental group Greenpeace reiterated its call for a total ban on
drift nets. It said the existing ban was insufficient and regularly violated
by EU fleets.

<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb fighters have rounded up hundreds of Moslem civilians in
Bijelina, north-eastern Bosnia, imprisoning many and expelling some over the
frontline, UN officials and eyewitnesses said yesterday, writes Laura Silber
in Belgrade.
The Serb Population Exchange Commission, in concert with the Panthers, a
Bosnian Serb paramilitary group, imprisoned 800 Moslems, said witnesses in
the town on Bosnia's frontier with Serbia. UN spokesmen said at least 135
women, children and elderly men were also forced across the frontline near
Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east, after
being robbed and beaten.
'We fear for our lives,' said a non-Serb woman speaking by telephone from
Bijelina amid the biggest wave of forced expulsions in over a year. 'This is
just like the Gestapo in the second world war,' she added.
Mr Kris Janowski, spokesman of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in
Sarajevo, said: 'They were told that they were being exchanged (for Serbs)
or sent abroad and they had to renounce claims to their property. Then they
were robbed at the confrontation line and pushed over to the other side. . .
with some shots fired over their heads.'
Up to 4,000 Moslems remain in Bijelina. Moslems comprised the majority of
the population of 35,000 before Serb paramilitaries, with the Yugoslav army,
waged war against Bosnian independence in April 1992. All but a handful lost
their jobs, property and homes.
'It is now terror on the streets. They are trying to clear out the last
Moslems,' said a 29-year-old Serb inhabitant. The expulsions are another
sign of Serb refusal to abandon their self-proclaimed state and endorse a
plan to preserve Bosnia-Hercegovina as a unified country composed of two
loosely joined ethnic mini-states.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Ruhe gives lift to Polish hope of joining Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has said Poland could join Nato
by the end of the decade, while he sees no prospect of Russia or Ukraine
ever doing so.
Mr Ruhe's remarks were quoted in the Polish media as he began talks with his
French and Polish counterparts on Warsaw's role in the Nato-inspired
Partnership For Peace programme.
The German minister also said that his country and the US were the only
existing Nato members that were enthusiastic about the idea of extending the
alliance eastwards, and some members were cool towards the idea.
'Not all countries are in favour of expanding Nato,' he was quoted as
saying.
Mr Ruhe's comments were in line with the strident declarations of unanimity
that were heard in Berlin last week from President Bill Clinton and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl over east European questions.
His remarks were an unusually blunt acknowledgement that, although all
candidates are supposed to join PFP on equal terms, not all of them can look
forward to full acceptance as a Nato member.
Russia, after considerable hesitation, last month became the 20th country to
sign up to PFP, a programme that promotes joint military exercises and
defence planning.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said at the signing
ceremony that the alliance should not alienate Moscow by rushing to
incorporate countries to its east.
Nato officials hailed the fact that Mr Kozyrev did not unequivocally
denounce the notion of expansion. However, Russian sensitivity over the
strategic orientation of Poland remains extremely high.
Moscow has made it clear that it feels unhappy about its former east
European 'satellites' being admitted to any arrangement from which Russia
itself is barred.
Mr Ruhe's comments follow a vote in the US Senate to facilitate the transfer
of surplus western defence equipment to Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic. The resolution, approved by 76-22, was intended by its sponsors to
accelerate the process of making the arsenals of those three countries
compatible with Nato equipment.
It has already drawn a complaint from Slovakia that distinctions are being
drawn between central European countries in a way that could undermine
stability.
Senator Hank Brown, one of the amendment's sponsors, said it was intended to
ensure that 'reasserting control over Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
will no longer be considered viable by anyone in Russia'.
Opponents of the measure argued that, by singling out three countries, it
would create jealousies within eastern Europe and foster nationalist forces
in other countries.
In Warsaw, Mr Ruhe said Russia would have no influence on Poland's
eligibility for Nato membership. Poland has been the keenest of the east
European countries to take advantage of the PFP, and it will host the PFP's
first full-blown military exercise in September.
Poland has also held a series of bilateral war games with west European
countries and, in October, it will send troops to France for a training
exercise with the French and German armies.
Warsaw has also asked to join the Franco-German Eurocorps, the
Strasbourg-based unit seen by its supporters as the core of a mobile
European land army. This proposal has so far been treated with caution in
western capitals and it is likely to be viewed with deep alarm in Moscow.
Senator Brown said his resolution had been supported by such veterans of the
US foreign establishment, and advocates of a tough line with Russia, as Mr
Zbigniew Brzezinski and Mr Henry Kissinger. Mr Brzezinski has called for the
formation of a 'common security area' grouping France, Germany and Poland.

crisis, regardless of the fate of the latest peace plan, according to senior
western officials.
The Moslem-led Bosnian parliamentary assembly in Sarajevo yesterday voted to
accept the peace plan. The Bosnian Serbs, at their assembly in nearby Pale,
adjourned late last night without making a decision. Earlier Mr Radovan
Karadzic, their leader, had told the assembly that acceptance of the plan
would be 'less honourable' than rejection.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said as he began a tour of seven
Balkan countries the US was ready to send a 'significant number' of troops
to Bosnia if the peace plan won acceptance, while Washington would also
accept an expanded military role in the event of renewed fighting.
US officials said that, if an agreement were to take hold, President Bill
Clinton would propose despatching at least 15,000 US troops, to make up
about half a peacekeeping force. In the event of the plan's failure, the US
air force would be involved in tougher policing of no-fly zones and safe
areas.
At Nato headquarters in Brussels, officials said they were considering three
scenarios for deeper involvement, following their talks with the senior
members of the UN operation to former Yugoslavia over the weekend.
One was a heavy Nato engagement on the ground in implementing a peace plan
which had won broad acceptance by the parties.
The second was increased use of Nato air power to minimise the extent of the
fighting, while retaining some UN presence on the ground. This would go
ahead if the outside powers which have been working for a settlement in
Bosnia resign themselves to a less ambitious goal than full-blown peace.
They may attempt to confine fighting to thinly populated areas.
For the past three months, Nato has reserved the right to establish 'total
exclusion zones' - where heavy weapons would be subject to air strikes - in
the UN-designated safe areas of Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla and Bihac.
This would mean extending a principle that has already been applied in
Sarajevo and the enclave of Gorazde.
Nato could also establish an exclusion zone in the bitterly disputed area
round the town of Brcko, a key point in the corridor that links the Bosnia
Serbs with their kinsmen in Serbia. But that move would require a new
resolution of the UN Security Council.
In a third scenario, the UN may decide to pull its troops out of Bosnia and
it might then require help from Nato, including air cover, to carry out the
withdrawal.
All three scenarios were discussed at weekend talks between Admiral Leighton
Smith, Nato's commander in southern Europe, and the two top UN officials in
former Yugoslavia: Mr Yasushi Akashi of Japan and France's General Bertrand
Lapresle.
In the past, high-level discussions between Nato and the UN about Bosnia
have been abrasive affairs. But alliance officials insisted the two
institutions were now working in much better harmony.

The four east European states making the most progress with their economic
reforms should be invited to future European Union summits, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl told Hungary's visiting prime minister, Mr Gyula Horn,
yesterday. Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia should attend at
least one summit a year, he said, citing President Boris Yeltsin's recent
attendance at the Group of Seven summit in Naples as an example of how this
could be done.
'It is incredibly important that the (four countries) receive a message
which has some meaning for the population,' Mr Kohl told journalists.
'I know that the opinion of my (EU) partners differs but that does not
affect the fact that I think it is right.' However, a government official
said there was no timetable for such a measure. The matter would be given
more attention after the four new members of the EU - Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway - had completed the accession process next January.
Germany assumed the EU's rotating presidency on July 1, and Mr Kohl said he
would use the opportunity to work for a closer partnership with eastern
Europe. The chancellor also said he 'passionately' supported Hungarian
membership of the Union.
Mr Horn, on his first official visit after being confirmed as premier last
Friday, called on German industry to step up its investments in his country,
particularly with regard to the privatisation of banks and the development
of infrastructure.
Hungary received the most German investment of any east European state last
year - some DM600m (Pounds 248m).

FT  19 JUL 94 / Hurd strives to mend EU rift: Move to end UK's diplomatic
isolation; Support for common policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday launched a campaign to end
Britain's recent diplomatic isolation in Europe and persuade its partners
that the UK views the European Union as more than a free trade area.
In remarks aimed at breaking the stranglehold of the Conservative party's
Euro-sceptics on UK policy toward Europe, Mr Hurd pledged British support
for a stronger common foreign and security policy, including an offer to
pool sensitive political intelligence reports in Brussels.
He told EU foreign ministers in Brussels: 'The European Union cannot be
simply a free trade area or even a single market. We need to develop a
system for constructing our foreign policy better internally, and projecting
it better externally.'
Mr Hurd's intervention appeared aimed in part at easing tensions with France
and Germany over Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier
backed by Bonn and Paris for the European Commission presidency.
But it was also an effort to recoup lost ground after the row over Britain's
unsuccessful campaign to maintain its power to block EU legislation once the
Union expands, as planned, from 12 to 16 members.
'We need to talk less exclusively about British interests and more about
Europe's interests,' said a senior UK official.
Mr Hurd suggested that the EU's newly established relationship with Ukraine
could serve as a trial run for a more co-ordinated foreign policy approach
among the Twelve, starting with foreign ministers sharing intelligence and
analysis.
There was a need for a 'strategy' for relations with central and eastern
Europe combining expanded trade and closer security ties leading to the
ultimate goal of EU membership.
Ministers moved in this direction yesterday with the signing of free trade
agreements with the Baltic states. They also welcomed a new European
Commission policy paper which aims to help the East Europeans prepare for EU
membership by integrating their laws and trade prac-tices with those of the
Union.
A Commission official said harmonisation of competition law, trade practices
and other laws would, in effect, expand the single European market
eastwards.
This would create a new market of about 450m people, including the EU,
Baltic states, Slovenia, and the six countries which have concluded
association agreements with the Union - Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
The Commission paper also suggests that both west and eastern Europe must
make radical reforms to lay the groundwork for membership. It says former
communist countries should cut capacity in smokestack industries, modernise
banking and promote small businesses.
Similarly, EU members need to brace themselves for changes in the hugely
expensive system of farm price supports under the Common Agricultural Policy
and the regional aid budget.
The UK is pressing this agenda, but is conscious that opening the question
of CAP reform prematurely could trigger a confrontation among EU member
states.
Meanwhile, British officials believe that it might be possible to invite the
east Europeans to join meetings of EU foreign ministers or interior
ministers with the power to speak but not vote.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Retail sales recover despite tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An apparent rebound in retail sales last month coupled with a smaller than
expected government budget deficit in June have provided further evidence
that Britain remains on course for steady economic growth in spite of
April's tax increases.
In a report released today, the Confederation of British Industry said
retailers in June reported the strongest annual rate of sales volume growth
this year. They expect a similar rise in July.
Official figures, released yesterday, showed that the government's budget
deficit, or public sector borrowing requirement, was lower than expected at
Pounds 2.86bn in June.
According to economists, the drop in the PSBR from Pounds 4.3bn in May and
Pounds 3.95bn in June 1993 reflected accelerating economic growth as well as
gains from increased taxes imposed in both the 1993 Budgets. The growth rate
is suspected to be trimming unemployment and welfare costs as well as
increasing value added and income tax revenues.
The CBI said its survey of 502 companies in the retail, wholesale and motor
trades found sales volumes in the year to June rose at their strongest rate
since October 1988. The growth in the wholesale sector was especially
strong, led by demand for industrial materials.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel, reported
a 'significant improvement' in the retailers' own assessment of their
business, although stocks remained higher than expected demand.
Mail order companies reported the strongest sales volume increase among
retailers while large multiple chains reported 'significant growth'. Small
chains, however, reported only a slight rise while, on balance, traders with
single outlets experienced a slight fall in sales.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Nationwide sales staff ordered to face retraining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, yesterday barred its
1,300 authorised financial services staff from giving financial advice to
customers until they complete a re-training programme.
The ban will affect staff at about two-thirds of the society's 1,000
outlets, including its 300 estate agency branches.
Nationwide plans to launch its own life insurance and unit trust
subsidiaries next year, but currently acts as an agent for Guardian
Financial Services, part of Guardian Royal Exchange.
The move follows a routine inspection visit by Lautro, the life insurance
industry's regulator, to Guardian Financial Services and its agents.
On the day the Personal Investment Authority - the new watchdog to protect
the private investor - became operational, the announcement was a reminder
that Lautro has been growing in effectiveness. Lautro will be wound up next
year.
Nationwide said the Lautro visit had revealed shortcomings in its
supervision of financial services staff, and it was taking the opportunity
to enhance training more generally.
Mr Brian Davis, chief executive designate, said Nationwide's action had been
taken voluntarily, and was a sign of its commitment to high standards of
service.
In March, Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, suspended its
entire life and pensions sales force for a month after Lautro identified
breakdowns in management controls.
The 650 or so Nationwide staff dedicated exclusively to financial services
products will undertake an intensive training programme, and the first
groups to go through this process will be able to offer advice again from
early August.
Plans for the remaining authorised staff, such as branch managers who do not
deal solely with financial services, have not yet been finalised, but it is
possible the numbers who are authorised will be reduced. One of Lautro's
concerns was the relatively low number of supervisors or senior financial
consultants - 56 - for the size of the sales force.
Mr Davis said he did not believe Nationwide had misled its customers, but
anyone concerned should contact the society.
Guardian sales agents will cover for the Nationwide sales force in some
areas. The insurer itself said Nationwide accounted for about 30 per cent of
its new business last year.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Bank looks at Malaysia link to missing gold coins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered is investigating the disappearance of Dollars 10,000
(Pounds 6,400) of gold coins, allegedly given by its Mocatta bullion
division to a Malaysian minister as a 'trade sample'.
The disappearance of the coins has emerged as part of a wide-ranging probe
by the London-based international bank into allegations that Mocatta
executives may have paid commissions to officials in the Philippines and
Malaysia to obtain business.
'The investigation into what happened to the gold is still going on,'
commented a banker. 'There may be a perfectly innocent explanation, though
it all looks very odd.'
The disclosure of the disappearance of the coins comes at an embarrassing
time for the British government, which had been hoping that Malaysia might
soon announce a lifting of its ban on UK participation in Malaysian
government contracts.
That ban was put in place because of the Malaysian government's fury with
the British press over the Pergau Dam alleged arms-for-aid deal and
allegations of bribes paid to Malaysian politicians.
The Bank of England has been kept closely informed of Standard Chartered's
investigation and is understood to be concerned about its implications for
diplomatic relations between the UK and Malaysia.
The Malaysian High Commissioner in London, Mr Abu Kamaradin, yesterday met
Standard Chartered's chief executive, Mr Malcolm Williamson, to discuss the
bank's probe.
Last night Mr Kamaradin had no comment to make on the allegations.
Standard Chartered has also uncovered evidence that payments may have been
made to officials at the Philippines central bank in order to win business.
The bank said yesterday that it had uncovered 'a small number of unusual
transactions' involving the Far Eastern operations of its Mocatta
subsidiary, as part of its attempt to improve controls in the group. More
recently, it has uncovered 'discrepancies in expense claims'.
It said that reasons given for the expenses 'included gifts to individuals
in certain countries to facilitate business, a practice contrary to bank
rules and procedures'.
The bank has not proved that the specific gifts were passed on to the
alleged recipients or that the expenses were genuinely incurred, but the
investigation is continuing.
The sums involved in the expenses claims run to tens of thousands of pounds,
according to a banker.
Two senior Mocatta executives have been dismissed by the bank. One, who was
based in Hong Kong, left the group in January. The other, based in London,
went more recently.
Bankers said yesterday that the Standard Chartered disclosures would make
life more difficult for many western banks operating in the Asia-Pacific
region, which as a matter of course make payments to local officials in
order to obtain business.

FT  19 JUL 94 / World News in Brief: Hutu named as Rwanda president in move
for unity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tutsi rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front named a Hutu, Pasteur Bizimungu,
as president of what they say will be a broad-based government of national
unity, in an apparent attempt to reassure Rwanda's Hutu majority that they
have nothing to fear under the new regime.
The RPF is due to install a new government in the capital Kigali today as
the remnants of the old Hutu government and army joined the mass Hutu exodus
into Zaire.

FT  19 JUL 94 / Hymn for Mao hypes TV sets to China's masses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Chinese Communist party hymn written in honour of Chairman Mao Zedong has
been reborn as an advertising jingle glorifying a television set.
The song, rendered reverently throughout China after the Cultural
Revolution, begins: 'The sun is reddest, Chairman Mao is dearest.' But, in a
national television campaign, this has become: 'The sun is reddest, Long
Rainbow is newest.'
The shock to Chinese ears of recycling the revolutionary in the name of
commerce can hardly be imagined.
Mr Wang Xiren, a navy propaganda writer who penned the original lyrics soon
after Mao's death in 1976, said yesterday he would protest at the
commercialisation of his song. He wants the advertisement banned.
'The song revealed the people's love and reverence for Chairman Mao,' he
said. 'This distortion is irresponsible. It shows disrespect to the broad
masses.'
Mr Wang's song is famous among Chinese youth as well as those old enough to
remember life under Mao. Three years ago, it was featured on a new cassette
of Mao music, played on modern western instruments with the addition of a
funky beat.
Television viewers, nevertheless, are now wondering who would dare tamper
with the once sacred words under a regime which still officially venerates
Mao, and how they could get the jingle past the television censors.
The answer to both questions is hardly surprising in the emerging business
culture of modern China: the People's Liberation Army, which has embraced
the profit motive while retaining the political clout to cope with the
censors.
Long Rainbow is owned by the PLA's commercial arm, Norinco, and the factory,
at Mianyang city in Sichuan province, is a converted military radar plant
and uses Japanese technology under licence.
Ironically, the Long Rainbow plant came into existence because of one of
Chairman Mao's follies. In the late 1950s, he ordered that industries be
relocated to the interior from areas vulnerable to attack during a war that
never happened. The move left factories remote from markets and suppliers.
China is trying to revive many of these isolated inland enterprises by
upgrading their technology and turning military equipment factories to
civilian uses, including the production of consumer electronics.
Long Rainbow is one of the more successful examples of this policy.

FT  19 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Mexicans trim new
issues to match tough conditions
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 29th July 1994) appended to this article.
Four Mexican companies have overcome difficult market conditions and placed
equity offerings worth USDollars 450m on international markets in the past
two weeks, bringing to 20 the number of Mexican companies listed on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The companies were forced to lower the number of shares offered and the
selling prices. Brokers involved in the offerings say that concern about
Mexican political stability and falling capital flows to emerging markets in
general made their job difficult.
'The new issue environment is difficult in general and quite difficult for
Mexican companies right now. You have to be very selective about how you go
at investors and try to sell to those who know particular industries,' says
Mr Justin Mansen, co-ordinator of the offering of paper maker Grupo
Industrial Durango for the US brokerage house Morgan Stanley. Durango was
forced to lower its issue price by 14 per cent to raise Dollars 123m. An
additional Dollars 150m was raised through a 7-year, 12 per cent Yankee bond
issue, the first private Mexican company to use the market this year.
The other companies with successful equity offerings, mid-sized bank
Banpais, real estate developer Grupo Sidek, and industrial conglomerate
Grupo DESC, suffered price reductions of 21 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per
cent respectively. DESC also reduced the share offering by 44 per cent,
while Sidek cut the number by 34 per cent.
Banpais, which needed the new capital to pay off expensive short-term debt,
related to its recent purchase of insurance company Asemex from the Mexican
government, was hit particularly hard as it was forced to borrow again to
meet payment obligations.
Grupo Elektra, the home furnishings chain, which had substantial obligations
related to its participation in the purchase of the privatised television
network Television Azteca, was forced to cancel its planned equity offering
when executives judged that potential investors were valuing the company too
low.
Mr Kenneth Pryor Jones, the Sidek finance director, shrugged off the price
reduction, saying the new capital raised was not as important as the New
York listing itself. 'When we securitise Dollars 200m in receivables this
summer, just the fact that we are listed will enable us to offer those notes
50 basis points lower,' he said.
CORRECTION
The FT last week in the international edition reported that Banpais, the
Mexican bank, took out a loan to pay back debt arising from the acquisition
of Asemex, an insurance company, after an equity offering had not raised the
amount planned. That loan was in fact taken out before the equity offering,
and was not directly related to the Asemex purchase.

FT  19 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's
Viewpoint): UK's overheated fields yield a crop of problems - Early ripening
is reducing harvests and hitting the quality of autumn-sown barley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th July 1994) appended to this article.
For those farmers with a tendency towards hay fever and asthma the high
pollen count was not the only frustration to result from the recent
heatwave. The long hot days also brought forward the grain harvest with some
crops of autumn-sown barley having ripeness forced upon them rather than
acquiring it gently in the dull conditions we usually seem to get in July.
It is not so much the earliness itself that frustrates - in many ways it is
a good thing to get some of the demanding harvest work out of the way. It is
the fact that because of premature ripening most of the crops so far
gathered are of mediocre quality and weight and therefore of low value.
Admittedly the number of samples submitted to merchants is relatively low at
this stage and come from the light, sandy land that is most susceptible to
this kind of problem. But reports suggest that grain size is generally small
 -'like needles' one merchant said the other day as he admitted that from
one exceptionally poor lorry load he had had to remove 38 per cent of
screenings, the small grains that fall through a screen designed to remove
non-viable material.
Clearly this also implies low yields; few of the fields so far combined have
apparently produced above 2.5 tonnes an acre (6.25 tonnes a hectare).
Production at this level is unlikely to leave a profit, even on farms with
the lowest costs. Those of us with rather heavier, more moisture-retentive
land, can only hope that our crops, when they are ready for cutting in a few
days, will produce better results. But it would be unrealistic to suppose
that the early fields had not set at least an approximate pattern for the
rest.
There are two main types of barley, grown for distinctly different markets.
One is for animal feed and here the farmers objective is to produce the
maximum yield and a high protein or nitrogen content. Such barley attracts a
low price but can be profitable provided production per acre is high enough.
The variety is chosen accordingly.
The second type is for malting into beer, for which specific varieties have
also been developed. Here the objective is for a much lower nitrogen content
and since this implies smaller applications of fertiliser it normally means
accepting a lighter yield. The price paid to the farmer should, in theory
and usually in practice, compensate him for the lower yield.
Ever-increasing emphasis on the need for better marketing of farm
commodities together with the urge to add value, persuaded rather more
farmers than usual to plant malting barley last autumn. Many took advantage
of merchants offers to sell it forward on contract at a fixed premium above
the price of feed barley. One estimate suggests that up 40 per cent of the
malting barley grown for harvesting this year has been sold in this way.
Last year the figure was between 25 and 30 per cent.
There are this year, however, two potential difficulties arising from this
otherwise healthy move. The first is that because of the weather-related
problems with quality, referred to above, a substantial proportion of the
barley sold on contract may be of too low a quality to qualify for the full
premium prices written into the contracts. Premiums over feed barley are
usually between Pounds 20 and Pounds 30 a tonne, depending on variety, but
for that the merchants specify a range of quality standards. They are
entitled to cut the price or even reject the grain if those standards are
not achieved.
The second problem is that the price of feed barley, at Pounds 95 to Pounds
98 a tonne, is Pounds 10 to Pounds 13 per tonne higher at present than was
expected when those contracts were agreed. Given that malting contracts are
based on feed prices the merchants will have little choice but to pay the
extra and to pass it on to the breweries. Cynical malting barley growers, as
they deliver their crops over the next few weeks, will be watching very
carefully to ensure any deductions for lack of quality are genuine and do
not reflect the buoyancy of the feed market.
The rise in the feed barley price and indeed for forward wheat sales (for
the wheat harvest will not begin in earnest for another month) can be
attributed to two main factors. Planting conditions across northern Europe
last Autumn were appallingly wet and the early spring was not much better.
It had long been anticipated that yields would be down this harvest and the
probability of this has stimulated the price.
In addition the weakness of sterling against other European Union currencies
has triggered two small devaluations of the green pound since the beginning
of July. These have resulted in compensatory increases in UK guaranteed
prices amounting to about 3 per cent. And although open market prices for
grain are well above support levels where they apply it all helps to create
a firm tone in the market.
Currency movements within the EU have been mainly favourable to UK arable
farmers for the past two years, but they can, of course, go the other way.
In order to 'lock in' an apparently attractive currency position a few large
farmers have taken out currency options against forward changes in values.
In most changes, so far, these have turned out to be expensive and in the
event unnecessary insurance against events that have not happened.
Nevertheless the big banks continue to offer such services and the Morgan
Grenfell subsidiary, Record Treasury Management, now offers a hedging
facility for EU green rates.
A few major players in the food industry may well use them, but, unlike
their American cousins, few UK farmers are ready for the culture change such
deals involve. As this year appears to have proved to them, once again, the
weather is the final arbiter.
CORRECTION
Record Treasury Management is an independent company and not a subsidiary of
Morgan Grenfell, as stated on this page yesterday. The two companies are
co-operating in a joint venture to offer facilities for hedging the European
Community 'green' rates at which guaranteed farm prices are translated into
national currencies.

Correction (published 20th July 1994) appended to this article.
Linotype-Hell, the German printing machinery manufacturer, said its net loss
in the first six months narrowed to less than a quarter of the DM57m
(Dollars 35.6m) loss a year earlier, AFX reports from Eschborn.
The group said the result was in line with its aim of breaking even in the
full year. Sales in the six months were on target while new orders exceeded
expectations.
Linotype-Hell said more precise data on the company's first-half performance
would be published in August. The next six months should see further
improvement, the group said.
The planned break-even in 1994 would be achieved on a 'slight sales growth
compared with last year', the company added.
The restructuring, initiated in 1993, was largely responsible for the
narrower net loss in the first six months. In this period, Linotype-Hell's
US operations saw the strongest improvement in earnings to post a net profit
after a 'significant loss' a year earlier, the company said.
The company reported a 1993 net loss of DM153.4m after a net profit of
DM32.1m in 1992.
CORRECTION
Linotype-Hell, the German printing machinery manufacturer, reduced its net
loss in the first six months of the year to less than a quarter of the DM57m
(Dollars 35.6m) loss in the previous corresponding period. This was
incorrectly reported in a headline in yesterday's FT.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Kuchma invites IMF head to talks in Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian president-elect, has invited Mr Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to come to
Ukraine to negotiate an economic restructuring package 'in the very near
future'.
His decision to open talks with the IMF even before his inaugaration
tomorrow suggests that Mr Kuchma, who benefited from pro-Russian and
pro-communist sentiment in last week's election, intends to pursue a
different agenda now that he is in office.
'I hope that in the nearest future Mr Camdessus will come here,' Mr Kuchma
said at the weekend. 'He promised me that he would come. He said if there
are concrete proposals for reforms he will come to Kiev.'
Mr Kuchma was swept to power in the election by Russian-speakers in eastern
Ukraine and Crimea who were won over by his calls for closer links with
Russia. Now safely elected, Mr Kuchma is softening his pro-Russian rhetoric.
He said he favoured 'a Euro-Asian common market', but not a return to the
rouble from its present currency, the coupon. As for political union, Mr
Kuchma said that the Commonwealth of Independent States was sufficient,
indicating that there would be no transfer of power from Kiev to Moscow.
Instead, Mr Kuchma's initial overtures have been toward the west - he met
the US ambassador the day after the election - and his early statements have
been pro-reform. He is eager to revive stalled negotiations with the IMF,
and claims to be committed to the austere policies the IMF could demand.
The surprisingly pro-western orientation of Mr Kuchma, who was once director
of the factory which built the Soviet Union's most powerful nuclear
missiles, extends to nuclear disarmament.
'I will stick to the agreement signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin and Clinton,' Mr
Kuchma said of the tripartite deal made in January in which Ukraine pledged
to give up all the nuclear weapons on its territory.
Mr Kuchma said the Dollars 350m (Pounds 230.2m) Ukraine was granted by the
US to help finance dismantling the missiles is insufficient. 'This is an
ecological problem and the west, including Europe, should help us.'
Western aid officials say that if the Kuchma administration rapidly pulls
together a reform programme, Ukraine could reach an agreement with the IMF
for an economic restructuring loan of Dollars 700m as early as the end of
August.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Haute couture comes back into fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It might be seen as a poignant symbol of the prospects for haute couture,
the most exclusive - and expensive - form of Paris fashion, that this week's
couture collections opened last night with a show by Gianni Versace, a
designer who is not French but Italian.
An interloping Italian, however, is only one of the problems confronting the
French couture houses, which have been fighting for survival in the early
1990s in the face of economic recession and the anachronistic structure of
the haute couture system.
The market had been in decline since the 1960s until a brief renaissance in
the mid-1980s, with turnover peaking at FFr320m (Dollars 60m) in 1988 and
1989, according to the Chambre Syndicale. But the decline then resumed, with
sales falling to around FFr290m in each of 1991, 1992 and 1993.
Haute couture, once the most creative area of French fashion, had
deteriorated into a source of publicity for the scents and sunglasses from
which the fashion houses make most of their money.
Yet couture now seems to be staging a revival after years of decline.
'There's definitely been an improvement,' says Christian Lacroix, one of
France's most famous couturiers. 'Our spring collection sold very well at
the January shows. The increase in sales hasn't been enormous, but business
is better.'
Mr Lacroix is not alone in having noted such an improvement. Denise Dubois,
an official at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, the industry
body, reckons that most of the couture houses reported increased sales after
this spring's collections. Some of the avant garde designers who show in
Paris - John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood and Koji Tatsuno - have introduced
their own versions of couture outside the Chambre Syndicale system.
Meanwhile the official couturiers are attracting new customers again.

MONDAY
Middle East peace talks
Jordan and Israel hold their first peace talks in the region since the
Middle East peace process was launched in 1991. The talks will focus on
borders, security, water, energy and the environment and will pave the way
for the first public summit between King Hussein of Jordan and Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister, in Washington on July 25.
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators also reconvene in Cairo to begin the
'early empowerment' talks which will lead to an extension of Palestinian
authority over civil administration in the West Bank beyond Jericho.
Bosnian peace plan: The Bosnian Serb assembly in Pale, the Serb stronghold,
and the Moslem-Croat parliament in Sarajevo are to meet today, the eve of
the deadline set by the international community, to reject or endorse the
plan to divide Bosnia along ethnic lines.
European agricultural ministers resume battle today over farm prices and
milk quotas for the coming 12 months. They will also discuss a proposal from
Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, to tighten restrictions on
British exports of beef carcases from herds which have been free of the
disease for six years rather than the current two because of the threat of
bovine spongiform encephalitis, or 'mad cow' disease.
Japan's Diet begins an extraordinary session (to July 22). Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama makes his inaugural policy speech, followed by questions
from the ruling and opposition parties.
Gyula Horn, Hungary's prime minister, makes a one-day visit to Bonn, his
first after being elected last Friday. Germany is Hungary's most important
trading partner in Europe and Horn will be hoping for more substantial
commitments about future membership of the European Union.
Rolling settlement: The London Stock Exchange introduces rolling share
settlement, ending the 173-year old system of account periods. From today,
deals will have to be settled within 10 days, with first settlement day
August 1. The plan is then to move to 5-day settlement early in 1995 - or as
soon as feasible. The prospect of same-day settlement hovers at the turn of
the century.
Investor protector: The Personal Investment Authority, the UK's new watchdog
to protect the private investor, becomes operational. Intended to improve
the regulation of retail financial services, it has been the subject of much
controversy and only grudging acceptance by many in the sector - Standard
Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, last week signed up to the PIA
in spite of earlier opposition.

TUESDAY
OECD employment outlook
The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
group of leading industrialised countries, publishes its annual Employment
Outlook. It is expected to elaborate on several of the themes spelt out in
the recent OECD Jobs Study. Both reports underscore the necessity for OECD
societies to enhance their ability to adapt to structural change to achieve
the twin goals of higher employment and good jobs.
EU Commission presidency:
The recently-elected European Parliament, holding its first plenary session
in Strasbourg, is expected to vote this week on the appointment of the
president of the European Union Commission. Last Friday, the council of
ministers chose Jacques Santer (above), the prime minister of Luxembourg,
for the post. He is to address the parliament on Thursday, and the vote will
follow.
The inauguration of Ukraine's new president Mr Leonid Kuchma takes place
today. Mr Kuchma seems to have decided that market reforms are the only
solution to Ukraine's economic problems, but how far he is prepared to go
will not begin to unfold until the new government is assembled.
Saleroom: Books and memorabilia from the Moscow flat of the late Kim Philby,
the 'third' man among the Communist spies at the heart of British
Intelligence, come up for sale at Sotheby's in London. There are typescripts
of his memoirs and talks he prepared for training KGB agents, as well as
photographs and trophies given to him by the Soviet government. Also
included are books he inherited from another defecting spy, Guy Burgess.
Santa Clauses from all over the world descend the chimneys of Copenhagen to
convene for their annual congress (to July 21).
FT Surveys: Japan and Monaco.

WEDNESDAY
Five years of house arrest
Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese pro- democracy leader ends her fifth year
under house arrest and begins her sixth. The anniversary is likely to be
marked by human rights activists around the world, especially in
neighbouring Thailand, where many Burmese exiles live and where south-east
Asian foreign ministers gather at the weekend for their annual meeting.
Burma's military junta, however, shows little sign of being prepared to
release Ms Suu Kyi. Her National League for Democracy convincingly won an
election in 1990 - although she was already detained - but the armed forces,
in power since 1962, ignored the results.
Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, sets foot for the first time
publicly on Jordanian soil, joining Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, and Abdul-Salam al-Majali, Jordan's prime minister, to symbolise
recently renewed momentum in Israeli-Jordanian peace talks. The meeting, two
days after the start of detailed negotiations, is set to take place in the
Jordanian desert north of Aqaba.
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa visits Britain for celebrations to
mark his country's re-admission to the Commonwealth.
Moon landing: The world remembers the first moonwalk 25 years ago. Coming
soon is the 25th anniversary of the first game of golf on the moon.
German resistance: A series of nationwide ceremonies will take place to mark
the failed bomb plot against Adolf Hitler in 1944. Many are angry that the
occasion, usually the cue for much soul-searching, has been hijacked by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl who will make a speech in Berlin, and has been trying
to blot out the role played by left-wingers and communists who resisted
Hitler alongside the better-known aristocrats.
Some 5,000 people were arrested and many were executed after the bomb blew
Hitler's conference room and trousers to bits but failed to kill the Fuhrer.
UK economy: June's retail sales data will give further evidence of
consumers' ability to absorb April's tax increases. So far, the effect has
been milder than many feared, and the Treasury forecasts consumer spending
will be up 3.1 per cent this year. Nevertheless, retail sales were static in
May and analysts expect the annual growth figure to fall from May's 3.9 per
cent to 2.9 per cent in June.

THURSDAY
UK Labour party leadership
Britain's Labour party announces the result of a contest to succeed the late
John Smith as leader. Tony Blair, the young and modernising home affairs
spokesman, is expected to win, but there is a close contest for the deputy
leadership between two more traditional socialists: Margaret Beckett, the
interim leader, and employment spokesman John Prescott.
Commons recess: Britain's lower parliamentary chamber, the House of Commons,
rises for its summer recess, returning on October 17.
A US State Department conference takes place today to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Bretton Woods financial conference and the institutions
it set up (the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank of
Reconstruction and Development).
Tonight, a new London evening newspaper launches today. About 100,000 copies
of the paper will be distributed free to central London commuters on
weekdays and will be the first competition to the Evening Standard since the
closure of the Evening News in 1987. Mr Geoff Steggals, chief executive of
Tonight, said the aim was to provide a bright, cheerful read.
FT Survey: Albania.
Cricket: First Cornhill Test, Lord's: England v South Africa (to July 25).

FRIDAY
Asean ministers meet
Foreign ministers of the six members of the Association of South East Asian
Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Thailand - hold their 27th annual meeting in Bangkok (to July 23). Also
there as observers and guests will be Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma.
The ministerial meeting is followed on July 25 by the first Asean regional
forum, which includes the US, China and Russia.
No place in the sun: German members of parliament, who like every upstanding
German take their holidays very seriously, are fuming about having to drag
themselves back to Bonn for a special session of the Bundestag.
Parliament has been recalled to throw its weight behind the constitutional
court decision last week which, for the first time since the second world
war, allows German soldiers to take part in United Nations' operations
outside the Nato area. The extra sitting will cost about DM150,000 (Dollars
92,000) and grumpy deputies say the vote could just as well take place in
September.
UK economy: The first estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product is
released today. Analysts are expecting quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.8 per
cent, which, combined with first quarter growth of 0.7 per cent, will put
the economy ahead of target for the Treasury's full-year forecast of 2.75
per cent. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Angela Bleasdale. Fax: (+44) (0)71

Weekend
Japan and S Korea consult
Japan's prime minister Tomiichi Murayama is to travel to Seoul on Sunday to
hold discussions with South Korean President Kim Young-sam on the situation
in North Korea, following the death of President Kim Il-sung.
Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party has backed the idea of closer
relations with North Korea, however Mr Murayama has promised to support the
United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang if it refuses to allow
international nuclear inspections.
Ukraine: Parliamentary by-elections take place today in more than 100
constituencies which failed to elect members in last April's elections.
There are 450 members to be elected and therefore a change in the
parliament's character, which is currently dominated by leftist hardliners,
is possible.
Athletics: The Goodwill Games begin in Russia's second city, St Petersburg,
on Saturday and will continue until August 7.
Polo: England's smart set converge on Windsor for International Polo Day. At
half-time, spectators are invited to step on to the field to tread in the
divots of turf kicked up by the ponies' hooves.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (11): Voters' crucial yardstick -
Housing expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Slovo, former ANC guerrilla chief and chairman of the South African
Communist Party, holds what is arguably the toughest job in South Africa: he
has to implement the African National Congress election promise to build at
least 1m low-cost houses in five years.
Apart from setting this ambitious target, assisted by a R12.5bn state
subsidy, the party also vowed to 'transform and upgrade' the 411 migrant
workers' hostels which house 1m residents, and bring electricity to at least
2.5m homes by the year 2000.
A government white paper setting out ways to meet these targets is due to be
published in the next few weeks. Meanwhile Mr Slovo is listening and taking
stock - and setting out some of the tenets that will shape policy.
The housing backlog cannot be left to the market, argues the minister:
'Private sector representatives are unanimous that the market requires the
assistance and intervention, direct and indirect, of the state.'
Deliberate neglect of black urban housing - apartheid's architects treated
black South Africans as only temporary residents in white cities - created a
backlog of between 1.5m and 2m homes. Even if government sought only to keep
up with the annual demand caused by population growth, it would face a
formidable task: about 240,000 new homes each year need to be built.
In the Pretoria-Witswatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) province alone, 1m people
need decent housing. Some 200,000 people have in recent years established
squatter settlements, driven to the region in search of work or to escape
from the drought of the early 1990s, and freed from apartheid laws
restricting movement.
The migration to the cities looks set to rise. A recent study prepared by
the Central Witswatersrand Metropolitan Chamber estimates that the
population of the PWV will rise to 16m by 2010, an 80 per cent increase from
the 1990 figure. A study by the country's National Housing Forum, a
broad-based independent association of interest groups established in August
1991, doubted whether the construction industry can cope with the target.
The number of registered building companies had dropped from 14,300 in 1988
to about 7,000 as a result of the recession. Skills are in short supply and
plant and equipment is ageing, the study points out.
In an interview last month, Mr Slovo made clear that he was opposed to what
are called 'site and service' schemes, which allow people to build their own
homes on plots provided with running water and water-borne sewerage.
Mr Slovo argues that government must provide a secure, weatherproof
structure, otherwise such schemes soon become little better than the slums
they are designed to replace.
Many housing experts disagree. Given the resources available, the size of
the backlog, and the annual demand stemming from population growth, there is
no alternative to serviced sites, they say.
Some of Mr Slovo's concerns are borne out by a 200-page report on the
largest low-cost housing project in South Africa's history. Known as the
Capital Subsidy Scheme (CSS), it was launched in March 1991 by the
state-financed Independent Development Trust, established a year earlier to
manage and disburse a R2,000m fund 'to enhance the standard of living of
disadvantaged communities'. The R750m scheme offered 113,000 subsidies of
R7,500 in 103 projects around South Africa.
Eligibility was limited to households earning less than R1,000 a month, and
giving registered ownership of a serviced site. These would be provided with
water and waterborne sanitation, access by graded road to each site, and
paved bus routes. On completion, the project will have provided facilities
for between 5 and 10 per cent of the low income population needing housing.
The assessment needs to be put in the context of the troubled times. Housing
was in the political arena, with efforts to tackle the problem set back by
political violence, rent boycotts and tensions created by the economic
recession and rising unemployment.
Despite these difficulties, the evaluation describes the CSS as having been
'largely successful'. In the two years since its inception, some 300,000
people have been accommodated on 57,000 plots, at a cost of R440m of the
allocated R775m.
But as the assessment goes into more detail, it becomes clear that for all
its achievements, there are serious problems which current housing strategy
has to take into account.
'There is a high risk of the subsidy being lost in the collapse of roads,
toilet structures and pipes due to inadequate mechanisms being instituted
for maintenance', it warns.
'The scenario could develop where there are taps but no water; blocked
storm-water drains; impassable, eroded roads; toilets but no sewer systems;
piles of refuse etc.'
'This eventuality', the report continues, 'is already raising its head in a
number of projects. As the situation worsens, it will become increasingly
difficult to resolve, with financially restrained local authorities unable
to respond, and communities becoming more and more unwilling to pay for
services that they only experience as non-functional'.
The report also warns that 'the level of expectation appears to have
increased since the CSS started in 1991. The current expectation is that
housing schemes for the poor need to make subsidy provision for a serviced
site and a two-roomed house at least.'
The government can go a long way towards meeting these expectations, says Mr
Slovo, with a programme in which government subsidies will be accompanied by
private sector participation. A forthcoming white paper will propose:
Provision of a maximum grant of R12,500 for those earning less than R1,500 a
month.
Mortgage indemnity insurance scheme, with the capital provided by government
and foreign aid, and the scheme maintained by users' premiums. Banks will be
insured against non-payment of loans or if they are unable to repossess
homes because of violence or political conditions.
Consumer protection: measures to prevent speculation, and ensuring quality
control.
A national housing bank which will 'cheapen housing capital by acting as a
wholesale bank', says Mr Slovo.
Provision of state-owned land for low-cost housing.
Given these schemes and the co-operation of the private sector, Mr Slovo
believes that 50,000 houses can be erected this year, rising to 125,000 in
1995, 175,000 in the following year and 225,000 in 1997.
How close Mr Slovo's ministry comes to reaching these targets will be one of
the yardsticks by which black South Africa will judge the ANC at the next
election.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (15): A delayed new start - Profile,
KwaZulu Natal province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has become almost a cliche to refer to South Africa's remarkably peaceful
transition to democracy as a 'miracle', writes Patti Waldmeir. Such
hyperbole may not be appropriate for most of what happened but it is
difficult to find a less emotive term to describe events in the province of
KwaZulu Natal.
'Amazingly, the population in Natal just forgot about tension and violence
on all the days of the election,' says Mr Jacob Zuma, African National
Congress leader in the province. His party lost the election to the rival
Inkatha Freedom Party - and conceded that loss despite widespread
allegations of Inkatha electoral fraud. 'The people gave leadership to the
leaders on that day: they showed us how much they wanted peace.'
Since that day, KwaZulu Natal's politicians have largely failed to respond
to that demand. The provincial legislature has met only once, to swear in
its members, and has been prevented from sitting since by a dispute over the
choice of a provincial capital.
Bickering over the capital, and over the allocation of portfolios in the
coalition 'government of provincial unity' required by the constitution, has
prevented the new government from tackling any of the daunting problems of a
province with nearly a quarter of South Africa's population and some of its
worst poverty.
While other provinces have forged ahead with plans for implementing the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, KwaZulu Natal has projected an
image of political conflict which jars with the overwhelming national
emphasis on unity.
Dr Frank Mdladlose, the premier, is from Inkatha which has six of the 10
cabinet seats and 41 of 80 seats in the legislature. He angrily denies that
his party is blocking progress. But Inkatha insiders say that Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the party leader who is minister of home affairs in
the national government, has forced Dr Mdladlose to take a rigid line on
both capital and cabinet which has provoked conflict.
Slowly, though, things seem to be coming right. The cabinet recently agreed
that the capital will be chosen by referendum, and that the cabinet will
alternate between the old capital of Pietermaritzburg and the former capital
of the KwaZulu homeland, Ulundi - an IFP stronghold  - until its result is
known.
'It's better to delay than to break down totally,' says Mr Zuma, drawing a
parallel with national negotiations which took four years to complete but
appear likely to yield a durable peace. Natal did not enjoy this long period
of consensus-building; its people fought each other until the very day of
the elections. More than 10,000 people were killed in the province in
political violence in the past decade.
'Everything must be given time. If you rush people, they take emotional
decisions,' he concludes. 'We know their power; they know our power. We have
to treat each other with respect. In the end, we have a responsibility to
govern Natal, not to fight about the province.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (36): Fresh markets opening - The
tourist industry
</HEADLINE>

The Umngazi River Bungalow Hotel nestles sleepily in its Indian Ocean cove,
where rollers break on the crescent-shaped white beach, deserted but for a
lone fisherman and two dogs, gambolling in the adjoining lagoon.
Anywhere else in the world it would be the retreat of the rich, a private
playground in an unspoilt environment. It's within easy reach from
Johannesburg - a 60-minute flight east to Umtata, and then an hour's drive
through the green hills of what used to be the Transkei homeland.
On the cove's grassy slopes are scattered 42 bungalows. A tennis court and
swimming pool are in easy reach, while alongside the jetty on the river
which feeds the lagoon, a motorboat stands ready for fishing or
bird-spotting expeditions.
The hotel is not a retreat for the well-off. Dinner, bed and breakfast costs
R125 a night - just over Pounds 20 - but the resort has only a handful of
guests.* It is as if Umngazi is still cocooned and isolated from the outside
world by the country's apartheid past.
In the grim period after the mid-1980s, when Mr PW Botha, prime minister,
defied the world and angry black teenagers took to the streets, Umngazi and
hundreds of other resorts suffered the consequences. South Africa seemed to
have put up the shutters against political reform, and the outside world
shunned it: barely 250,000 tourists came to the country in 1988. But with
the political transition and the inauguration of a stable government of
national unity, Umngazi awaits discovery by visitors to the new South
Africa.
Many of those travellers who already knew what this spectacular country has
to offer are looking back with something akin to guilty nostalgia to a time
when a berth in the luxurious Blue Train could be obtained at short notice,
or a room at the Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town with a view of Table
Mountain - provided it wasn't the school holidays.
Those days are well passed, for a vigorous promotion campaign is getting
under way.
'Explore South Africa 95 Year' will be its theme, exploiting events such as
the World Rugby Cup, the Comrades Marathon in Natal, the Million Dollar Golf
Classic at Sun City and the Grahamstown festival
'The aim is to to achieve R9.5bn in foreign exchange earnings by 1996, based
on 1m overseas visitor arrivals and 3.7m arrivals from Africa', says the
South African Tourism Board's marketing plan.
It may seem an ambitious target, but when the world discovers what South
Africa has to offer it will beat a path to beaches, game parks, mountains
and lakes served by an excellent transport and communications
infrastructure, and offering lodges and hotels that range from budget class
to the luxurious.
Since the lifting of sanctions, direct air links with Australia and the US
have been re-established, existing airlines have increased their services,
and more than 20 new airlines are serving South Africa.
Tourist sector officials acknowledge that coping with a million
holidaymakers a year will strain the country's existing hotel capacity. But
the sector is already preparing for a boom that will encourage hotels to
upgrade their facilities and, above all, create jobs.
And while the 1m target is four times the annual number of holidaymakers who
came during the political traumas of the mid-1980s, Satour points to last
years' figures as evidence that it is within reach.
In 1993, the country earned about R6bn from 618,000 overseas tourists - 10.5
per cent up on 1992 - making the sector the fourth-largest foreign exchange
earner after manufactured goods, gold and mining, and employing
approximately 430,000 workers.
Notwithstanding this increase, the potential has barely been tapped, say
Satour officials. South Africa has less than a 1 per cent share of the
international market and tourism accounts for only 2 per cent of South
Africa's gross national product, compared to the world average of 6.1 per
cent.
There is scope for growth even in traditional strongholds. The UK is by far
South Africa's largest overseas market, accounting for about 23 per cent of
visitors - excluding those from Africa - and Germany is the second-largest
source.
But thanks to the new political environment and the number of new airlines
serving Johannesburg, Satour can now exploit lucrative markets hitherto out
of reach, such as India and Japan, and Scandinavia.
But it is Africa itself that is expected to provide the most dramatic
results, from a mere 200,000 arrivals in 1991 to a targeted 3.7m in 1996.
Good news for the South African economy, but not happy reading for those who
now have to share the country's scenic beauty with millions of newcomers.
So don't delay: visit South Africa while the hotels are relatively cheap and
underbooked, the beaches are not crowded, tourists are not fleeced, and
Umngazi River Bungalows are not taken over by the package tour business.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (37): Symbol of liberation - The new
flag is here to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock and disapproval when South Africa's new flag was first displayed
was palpable and widespread.
'An exotic tea towel' and 'Dayglo Y-fronts' were two of the more charitable
comments about the patterned, six-colour emblem that was unveiled at the end
of last year.
Such was the attachment of whites to their old 'oranje blanje blou', and
most blacks to the African National Congress's black, green and gold
colours, that the new banner seemed to be representative of continued
tension in a still divided society rather than any common ground.
By the time the poll was over, however, the flag had been taken up by black
and white alike as the symbol of liberation, a tangible demonstration of
commitment to the new South Africa. After an emotional flag-raising ceremony
on the first night of the elections, the country awoke to find the
multi-hued banner flying proudly over city halls, police stations and
government buildings throughout the land.
And when, at President Mandela's inauguration, flag-patterned T-shirts and
banners littered the lawns of the union buildings and the air force
thundered overhead trailing its colours, the apotheosis was complete. The
new flag, originally regarded as a temporary compromise until a final one
could be agreed upon, is undoubtedly here to stay.
It has been a curious phenomenon, both for the speed with which it happened
and the genuine feelings which it appears to evoke.
While the debate over the national anthem was solved by allowing both the
stirring Afrikaans 'Die Stem' and the hauntingly beautiful liberation anthem
'Nkosi Sikel' Afrika,' no similar deal was possible over the flag issue.
Following the failure of a nationwide competition to come up with an
acceptable alternative, the matter was handed over to a private agency which
produced the current design and immediately came under fire for its
ridiculous result.
Now, however, it is difficult to find anyone with an unkind word to say
about the emblem, and most people are rushing to buy their own. Flagpoles
are sprouting in both white suburbia and black townships, flag bumper
stickers are becoming ubiquitous, the emblem features on new airmail stamps
and the Springbok rugby team has had it embroidered on their shorts.
Even the corporate sector, not in the past known for its displays of
enthusiastic patriotism, have been striving to outdo each other in the size
and number of flags at their disposal. One big company outside Johannesburg
can be seen flying no fewer than 10 of the new banners above its office
buildings and executives have been known to fight over little designer flag
pins for their jacket lapels.
In short, the flag has become the symbol of the euphoria that has gripped
the country for the past two months following the remarkably successful
transition to democracy, and it seems destined to remain the touchstone of a
new-found patriotism. As a result, in addition to the traditional goods and
trinkets hawked on South Africa's streets, any shopper is now just as likely
to be offered a selection of flag key-rings, coffee cups, table-cloths and,
yes, even tea-towels. But they're tea-towels that can be used with pride.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (33): Missions abroad have doubled -
Foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If South African newspaper headlines are taken at face value, President
Nelson Mandela is the diplomatic equivalent of Superman.
Barely a week has gone by since the new government took office without what
is presented as yet another presidential foreign policy initiative, exciting
unrealistic expectations.
Mr Mandela is, it seems, single-handedly reforming the Organisation of
African Unity, in which newly-admitted South Africa is 'destined to play a
leading role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution', according to local
reports. He is much in demand. Over the past few weeks Mr Mandela has been
described as 'brokering' peace efforts in Rwanda and Angola, and
contemplating imposing democracy on troubled Lesotho.
Thanks to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation, he will attend the
next gathering of Francophone states, while the French leader's championing
of South Africa placed the country 'firmly on the agenda' at last week's
Group of Seven leading industrial nations' meeting in Naples.
Meanwhile South Africa has rejoined the Commonwealth and looks forward to
playing an active role in the Non-Aligned Movement.
New ties have also been forged with Japan. Tokyo's aid package, said to be
worth R4bn, will, says Mr Mandela, help to 'kick-start' the country's
reconstruction and development plan. But closer examination of the package
suggests it may be worth less than the initial estimates suggest.
If all this is not enough, President Mandela appeared on video at President
Bill Clinton's White House conference on Africa last month to lend his
weight to calls for a Marshall Plan for the continent, the name given to the
US-led programme to rebuild Europe after the second world war. Included in
Mr Mandela's speech was an appeal for radical measures to ease Africa's
external debt burden.
While these initiatives - real, imagined or exaggerated - take place, one
arm of foreign policy seems to be operating with its past efficiency: the
state-owned arms manufacturer, Armscor.
With sanctions lifted, and its activities given the endorsement of Mr Joe
Modise, defence minister, officials are now lifting at least a corner of the
veil of secrecy. The defence industry provides 70,000 jobs and foreign
exchange, say government officials, who add defensively: 'If we didn't sell
weapons, someone else would.'
To be fair to Mr Mandela, he and his senior advisers have tried to play down
expectations. On the one hand, Mr Mandela's integrity and moral authority
makes him the acceptable voice of Africa on behalf of its many causes. At
the same time, he makes clear that that he has no easy answers to offer.
Advisers also point out that an effective diplomatic role is not made easier
by the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the throes of
reorganisation.
South African missions abroad have doubled since the transition to
respectability began, while new entrants to the diplomatic service have to
be trained, and suitable ambassadors found to replace many of the
pre-election incumbents.
Meanwhile the overstretched service is still getting to grips with issues in
which it has had little or no experience. These range from getting to know
the OAU to the implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
deal, or reconciling relations with countries with whom ties were initially
forged by the African National Congress, or the former government.
Thus, the new South Africa has to weigh its relationship with Taiwan, one of
its biggest trading partners, against recently-established official links
with the People's Republic of China. The latter's trading potential is
bigger, and its position as permanent member of the UN Security Council will
have to be taken into account by Pretoria should South Africa have
aspirations for a council seat as Africa's representative.
Nominally in charge of this demanding portfolio is Mr Alfred Nzo, the
foreign minister. His surprising appointment is put down to years of loyal
service to the ANC. It may also be explained by the fact that policy will be
shaped by Mr Mandela himself, and his senior deputy president, Mr Thabo
Mbeki.
As the initial euphoria and excitement dies down, South Africa's foreign
policy is likely to become more cautious.
Mr Aziz Pahad, the deputy foreign minister, acknowledges the dangers of
taking on too much. But expectations are nevertheless high. In an interview
with the Financial Times he echoes the explanation he gave to the
Johannesburg Sunday Times: 'We have captured the moral high ground in
nonracialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader
in this area.'
First of all, however, South Africa has to consolidate its success and build
a stable, flourishing, democracy: 'If we don't sink, they (Africa's donors
and creditors) see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region
doesn't sink, they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of
other parts of Africa.'
Mr Pahad hopes that foreign investors do not ignore South Africa's
neighbours: 'If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development,
illegal immigrants will come to South Africa and, given that our borders are
so big, we will not be able to prevent it.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (34): Credit rating sought - Foreign
borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more dramatic signals of the normalisation of South Africa's
international economic relations has been the country's decision to seek an
international credit rating.
After an intense competition among international merchant banks for the
right to represent the country, the new government in May appointed Goldman
Sachs as its agent to secure a grading from the leading agencies, who are
expected to announce their assessment later this year.
Although South Africa has long borrowed money on European markets without a
rating, it wants access to the American market, hence the the new move.
Following the successful agreement with international banks on a repayment
schedule for outstanding debt that had been caught in the 1985 standstill,
and given its new-found political stability, the country feels the time is
ripe to make formal entry into global capital markets.
Depending on the success of the present initiative, a similar move into the
Japanese market may follow early next year.
Although political and economic uncertainty has long forced South Africa to
pay a fairly hefty premium on offshore borrowing, government authorities are
confident of achieving an investment grade rating of at least BBB.
'I would actually prefer a lower rating that we can improve upon, rather
than a higher one which might be downgraded,' notes Mr Chris Stals, South
African Reserve Bank governor.
Even with the rating, however, initial borrowing is likely to be limited.
The new budget makes allowance for about Dollars 500m, but Mr Derek Keys,
finance minister, says that figure may well be increased, depending both on
the final rating achieved and the comparative strength of international
markets at the time of borrowing.
The outcome of the government's initiative will also have a bearing on South
African companies seeking to raise money offshore.
Assurer Liberty Life recently announced plans for a Dollars 360m-Dollars
500m rights issue, and electricity utility Eskom and the Development Bank of
South Africa are both likely to float issues some time later this year.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (35): Net benefit may prove marginal
 -Foreign aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few international aid causes are more popular than South Africa's appeal for
assistance in redressing the legacy of apartheid. Raising funds, however,
may prove to be easier than putting them to efficient use, and if aid is
seen as a substitute for investment the net benefit may prove marginal.
If pledges are taken at their face value, South Africa can expect up to
R10bn over the next five years, from a variety of bilateral and multilateral
donors.
Leading the field is Japan, which earlier this month unveiled what it called
its largest aid package to a single country - Dollars 1.3bn over two years.
Mr Katsumi Sezaki, Japan's ambassador to South Africa, said that almost all
the aid was untied, bar a Dollars 100m export-import credit facility aimed
at promoting trade between the two countries. But a further Dollars 400m
worth of export-import bank loans were untied, he said.
Of the balance, Dollars 250m would be in the form of soft loans - seven
years' grace and a 25-year repayment period at 3 per cent interest. A
further Dollars 500m in the package represented the amount of private
investment and commercial credits the Japanese government was prepared to
guarantee.
Next on the list is the US which has offered R2bn over three years, while a
host of other bilateral donors have chipped in including Australia (R700m
over three years), the European Union is offering over R400m; the UK will
provide R560m over three years.
Meanwhile the African Development Bank says it can release between R720m and
R1,200m of project-linked finance over five years.
Past experience in Africa has shown that aid has mixed results and even
allowing for South Africa's considerable pool of skills, handling resources
on this scale will not be easy. The amount on offer, however, may not be as
much as it seems. As is so often the case, assessing what may be termed the
'real money' - that is assistance that is readily available and which can be
rapidly disbursed - is not straightforward.
Although trade cover and investment guarantees can be put to good use,
including them in the category of 'aid' can give a misleading impression of
what is available for conventional aid projects - health, housing,
education, and so on.
Development packages almost invariably include aid tied to purchases from
the donor country, which can prove expensive. A recent study by a British
development charity calculated that the resulting lack of competition can
add anything from 10 to 15 per cent to the price of the items ordered from
the donor country.
Another way of boosting bilateral aid figures in press releases is to
include the contributions made by western governments to multilateral
lending institutions, United Nations agencies, or money that would be
channeled through European Union aid schemes.
A further device used by some donors is to include estimates of the benefits
for South African exporters from introducing favourable tariff changes made
in the wake of President Mandela's inauguration.
Given the competition between donors as to who will appear the most generous
 -which in turn may influence the South African government when it comes to
allocating contracts for state-backed or funded projects - the donors
themselves are often reluctant to make clear the precise benefits and terms
of their offers.
In short, the arithmetic of aid is complex and South Africa, unused to being
a recipient, may sometimes be too inclined to take promises at face value.
Significantly, the World Bank, potentially South Africa's largest
multilateral donor, is reluctant to put a figure to planned lending,
although some officials have suggested a figure of about Dollars 1bn a year
in the initial phase.
Mr Isaac Sam, the Bank's resident representative in South Africa, says that
foreign aid is 'rather crucial' in South Africa's development. What is more,
fund raising 'has to be done fairly rapidly' in order to take advantage of
the goodwill South Africa presently enjoys.
But Mr Sam cautions that aid alone cannot deliver the economic growth that
the country needs. While the Bank plans to provide substantial aid, foreign
and domestic investment are the keys to post-apartheid growth: 'The real
resources for South Africa are in the international capital market, not
donors', says Mr Sam.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (32): Generous Gatt 'window' -
Exporters are finding new markets open for trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African exporters are a little overwhelmed by their new-found
international respectability. After years of developing expertise in such
arcane skills as transhipping and re-labelling to try and counteract
sanctions imposed as a result of apartheid, companies find that many
countries are now rolling out the red carpet, and new markets from Asia to
eastern Europe to Latin America - long out of bounds - are now open for
trade.
As part of this new order, the South African government is starting to
formalise its trading relationships. At the top of the list comes
readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. South Africa's
formal submission to the Uruguay Round was accepted late last year and a
fundamental restructuring of its tariff structure will shortly get under way
to bring the country more in line with international norms.
The adjustments required by Gatt will involve pain for some highly protected
industries but, by securing classification as an 'economy in transition',
South Africa has managed to get a generous eight-year window for leading
employment-oriented industries, such as textiles and motor vehicles, to
adjust to the new arrangement. The deal also allows some leeway in the
reorganisation of South Africa's contentious, and widely abused, General
Export Incentive Scheme.
Meanwhile, new trade agreements are giving further impetus to trade growth.
President Clinton gave South Africa GSP status in May, allowing preferential
access to the US market for a wide range of goods, and the European Union
has announced its intention to do the same by the end of the year. A more
formal, separate trade treaty with the European Union is under discussion,
as is the possibility of some kind of associate member status with the Lome
aid group.
Also on the agenda are a set of new regional trade arrangements. At the
World Economic Forum meeting last month, President Mandela and other
southern African leaders signalled their intention to work towards a
regional free trade agreement. As a first step towards this goal, in August
South Africa will join the South African Development Community, a grouping
of 10 southern African states originally formed to try and reduce dependence
on South Africa.
In the shorter term, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has
already signalled his intention to restructure the South African Customs
Union, which South Africa shares with Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland and in which it currently pays out some R5.6bn of a customs and
excise revenue pool of R16.3bn to its partners. It is also seeking to renew
a bilateral trading arrangement with Zimbabwe.
Reflecting all this activity, exports have been soaring, and in 1993
totalled R78.3bn as the country ran a current account surplus of R5.9bn  -
although this year's surplus is likely to be lower due to a higher import
bill. But despite this success, the majority of exports are still primary
products and while the proportion of manufactured goods has been increasing
there is still a lot of room for improvement.
A survey of exporters by the South African Foreign Trade Organisation
estimates that South Africa's manufacturing industry is at a 15 per cent
cost disadvantage to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
countries, with its only comparative advantage in electricity. In addition,
the report notes that after years of focus on the domestic market, local
manufacturers have a 'tendency to blame external factors' for failures, and
many fail to take export promotion and planning seriously.
'South African manufacturers still lack an export culture,' acknowledges one
senior trade official. 'Until that changes, growth will be disappointing.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (31): On the touch-line - Foreign
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More talk than action sums up South Africa's recent record of foreign
investment. Most of the action has come in the past 18 months with a surge
of portfolio investment and a large number of franchise and other non-equity
deals.
A recent independent survey concludes: 'Most companies are adopting a
wait-and-see attitude', avoiding manufacturing and keeping their investments
relatively small.
Many foreign companies have established a low-profile presence in the
country in anticipation of an improved business climate from 1995 onwards.
The main action has been on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In the 15
months to March 1994, net inward investment on the JSE totalled R8.9bn,
almost two-thirds in gilts and the balance in equities. This compares with
substantial net foreign selling, especially of equities in the 1990-1992
period.
The same survey, which warns that it may not have tracked down all post-1990
foreign investment, lists 17 first-time new investors, including Vodafone of
the UK and Alcatel of France in telecommunications, Daewoo of South Korea in
household goods, Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland in
publishing and Digital Equipment of the US in computers.
Another seven are listed as returning companies - those that divested in the
1980s for political reasons. This list includes leading players such as IBM,
Procter &amp; Gamble and AB Electrolux of Sweden.
Another important participant who stayed behind, BMW, has brought in R100m
in new capital to expand its Rosslyn vehicle-assembly plant.
There has been a good deal more activity in the field of indirect investment
 -distribution, franchise and licensing deals. This list is dominated by the
returnees - Apple, Honeywell and Novell in computers; Volvo and Peugeot in
cars, and Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Warburgs in banking. Significantly,
the largest single category, of some 36 companies, is made up of those
intending to invest or reinvest. Here, too, the list reads like a Who's Who
of global business: Ford, Motorola, Heinz, Philip Morris, Wang, AT&amp;T,
Ericsson, NEC, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
The conventional wisdom is that this cautious trend, with its emphasis on
indirect investments with minimal equity involvement, such as franchising,
will continue for another 18 months to two years. The broking community is
bullish about portfolio investment prospects, especially once the financial
rand is abolished. But direct investment is seen, in the words of Mr
O'Reilly, chief executive of Heinz, as a 'postponable event'.
How postponable was outlined at last month's World Economic Forum meeting by
Mr Frank Savage of Alliance Capital Management International. Mr Savage put
up a 10-point wish list of conditions that foreign investors want to see in
South Africa: financial rand abolition, the removal of exchange controls,
removal of limitations on foreign ownership, no capital gains taxes,
non-inflationary budgets, lower tariffs, reform of the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange, anti-trust legislation, black economic empowerment and
consolidation of the government of national unity.
Almost all of these are on the new government's agenda - the one exception
being the probability of some form of capital transfer tax. But it will take
years to translate an agenda into action.
While the foreigners sit on the touch-line, domestic investment has started
to recover. In March, Nedbank's Economic Unit, relying on public
announcements, estimated new and continuing capital projects worth almost
R100bn (Dollars 27bn at present exchange rates), over the next six years.
This estimate includes an adjustment of 10 per cent a year for inflation.
Community and social projects (R35bn) make up the largest single chunk,
followed by energy and water projects (R21bn) and manufacturing (R13 bn).
In the past, South Africa's investment record has fallen short on two
counts. Even when it was investing more than comparable middle-income
economies such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico - averaging 26 per cent of gross
domestic product in the early 1970s - output and employment growth did not
respond proportionately, because of growing capital intensity.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the problem was less the efficiency of investment
than the steep decline in volume. By last year investment was down to 15.2
per cent of GDP, touching bottom in mid-year, since when there has been some
recovery.
To grow at 5 per cent a year, the economy needs to invest more than 25 per
cent annually - implying a shift of more than 7 per cent of GDP from
consumption to savings. Part of this shift can be funded from offshore, with
foreign capital, but achieving the domestic transfer of resources while
simultaneously satisfying expectations will be a formidable task.

wary - The stock exchange is undergoing important changes

Few people were happier with the outcome of South Africa's elections than
the country's stockbroking community. While market players may be used to
life on a roller coaster, investing in South African financial markets in
the run-up to April's poll at times seemed more akin to bungee jumping.
In rapid succession, the market rose, fell, and rose again, almost entirely
focusing on political sentiment rather than economic fundamentals.
To make matters worse, the renewed volatility came after an excellent year
for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In 1993, it seemed that little could go
wrong for the market as the overall index increased 50.1 per cent and net
foreign purchases reached R2.8bn in the year to February 1994 after years of
disinvestment.
Highlighting the return to favour of the South African market in the
international arena was the creation of several investment funds targeting
South African equities, bringing hundreds of millions of dollars into the
market.
But in March and April, responding to fears of civil war, foreigners beat a
mass retreat, becoming net sellers once more. The result was soaring gilt
yields, a sinking stock market and a plummeting currency. The combination,
which shifted almost daily, was wearing. 'It was like being in a ring with
Mike Tyson every day,' reminisces one not very nostalgic broker.
Following the successful and remarkably peaceful elections, however, local
investors have returned to the market to pre-empt the expected flood of new
international fund money. After South Africa was included in the
International Finance Corporation's global index with a hefty 13 per cent
weighting, local brokers are expecting some leading international investors
to adjust their emerging market share-weighting accordingly, with the
potential windfall for the Johannesburg exchange running into billions.
So far, however, despite the return of fund managers and investment analysts
to Johannesburg's biggest hotels, little new money has been forthcoming.
Part of the problem stems from a general disenchantment in emerging markets
after several top players got burnt in countries such as Mexico, Poland and
Turkey, but most of it depends on South Africa itself.
Despite a conservative budget and numerous statements by President Mandela
and his economic team professing their adherence to free market discipline
and macroeconomic stability, many investors seem to want to see how
successfully the encouraging rhetoric is put into practice before taking the
plunge. International investors also cite some continuing structural flaws
with the market. Mr Frank Savage, chairman of Alliance Capital management,
one of the big southern Africa fund managers, singles out the presence of
big conglomerates without a proper anti-trust legislative framework and the
low tradeability of shares, as among the most important problems. Although
liquidity on the JSE improved to 7.14 per cent in 1993 from 4.76 per cent in
1992, it still remains far below other comparable markests.
Under pressure from foreigners and local banking groups who have long railed
against the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's restrictive operations, the
exchange has recently announced a plan for restructuring to improve both
efficiency and accountability. In addition to proposals related to
affirmative action and the encouragement of black share ownership, the
report recommends the revision of existing capital requirements and suggests
that non-residents be allowed to act as brokers and that local firms can
sell up to 30 per cent of their equity to institutional investors.
Foreign firms have been quick to respond, setting up partnerships with local
brokers even before the recommendations have been endorsed and legislated.
In the past year, Robert Fleming, Smith NewCourt and SG Warburg have all
made domestic alliances in the South African market, and more are expected
to follow.
To many, however, the proposals do not go far enough and critics are
pressing for an end to the maintenance of single capacity trading, urging
full corporate membership, and pushing for a move to screen trading from the
current system of open outcry. But despite threats from disgruntled bankers
to open a rival exchange, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange seems unlikely to
budge further at the moment.
'If exchange control goes, then we would obviously have to reappraise the
situation, but under current circumstances we feel that an evolutionary
approach is best for the stock market,' notes Mr Roy Anderson, stock
exchange president.
Nonetheless, it is clear that the stock exchange, like other South African
institutions, is undergoing important changes in the new environment and
will continue to restructure further over the next few years. 'One way or
another I think we're going to have move to a fully deregulated market in
the not-too-distant future,' predicts one leading fund manager.
