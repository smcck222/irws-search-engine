FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (29): Success stories needed - The
black business community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Blacks will never make good entrepreneurs - they don't have the head for
it,' was the indiscreet comment made at a corporate lunch in Johannesburg
recently. Surprisingly, however, the speaker was not a recalcitrant white
executive disparaging the new order, but a youngish black executive.
The comment highlights the big problem facing the government and corporate
sector in trying to nurture a credible black business community.
For years in South Africa, black business was something of an oxymoron: as
blacks were not allowed to own property or conduct business in the cities,
independent economic activity was limited to activities such as shebeens or
spaza stores - the speakeasies and corner stores that litter the country's
black townships.
At the same time, denied access to education, training or finance, few were
given the wherewithal to try and compete in the rough and tumble world of
business.
The result has been a lingering lack of faith about black capabilities in
the business world - a problem that has been highlighted by the difficulty
of trying to encourage blacks to buy shares in black-run companies. 'There
is still a basic lack of trust in black skills and that will only wear off
in time,' notes Mr Thami Mazwai, editor of Enterprise, a black business
magazine.
Part of the problem is a continued lack of leading black success stories.
Although most big companies have also appointed some black faces to their
boards, few hold executive positions. And while the past year has seen a
flurry of takeovers by black businessmen of leading companies - including
two life assurers, a merchant bank, and The Sowetan, the country's biggest
daily paper - the deals are largely engineered by white conglomerates, and
the companies often retain white managers.
But however unsatisfactory such a situation might be, many regard it as the
only viable route to economic power. 'In the short and medium term, blacks
will succeed in business only through linkages with whites,' notes Dr Nthato
Motlana, President Nelson Mandela's personal doctor and a key figure in many
of the empowerment transactions. 'Total control is unrealistic at this
stage.'
One move that might start to shift the balance of power, however, has been
the announcement by Anglo American, the country's largest corporation, that
it intends to split up subsidiary mining house Johannesburg Consolidated
Investments into three parts and sell off two of them, one incorporating the
group's gold mines and the other its leading industrial shareholdings, to
blacks.
But despite the high expectations raised by the plan, Mr Julian Ogilvie
Thompson, Anglo chairman, warns that its final execution could take years.
'We mustn't let media hype create a situation where we make a deal that is
structurally and financially unsound,' he notes, observing that the
completion of the planned moves requires alterations to existing legislation
on corporate restructuring and working out some highly complicated
shareholder arrangements.
Given these problems, black business has begun to increasingly look to the
new government for help in creating a suitable environment for business
development. 'We can use the same method as the Afrikaners, utilising the
state to help nurture business,' says Mr Archie Nkonyeni, president of the
National African Chambers of Commerce, the country's largest black business
federation.
Accepting the importance of black enterprise, government is likely to help
steer state business to black companies where possible, or insist that white
companies use black sub-contractors when filling tenders. Last year African
National Congress pressure managed to get black businessmen a stake in the
country's new cellular phone operators and companies such as Thebe
Investments, a private company with close ANC links, are expected to benefit
from deals with the new government.
Also high on the government agenda is the encouragement of black
entrepreneurs and the growth of small and mid-sized black businesses that
can build up black capital and create jobs. The state-run Small Business
Development Corporation has shifted its focus to black applicants and the
government is trying to put pressure on banks to help finance more black
business schemes in other sectors.
Another promising route to empowerment is through franchising and joint
ventures with foreign companies which can supply both skills and financing.
International giants such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi have both recently decided
to return to South Africa with the stated aim of helping black business.
But despite the flurry of initiatives, the sobering fact remains that blacks
still control only a very small, if rapidly growing, proportion of South
African business. In a community robbed of skills and capital by decades of
apartheid, economic victory is likely to take more than a generation to
achieve. And while a black elite is already reaping the benefits of change,
the masses will have to wait a little longer.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (28): More commercial role - The
future of state-run enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty years ago, South Africa's most contentious political issue was the
'poor white' problem - how to cope with hundreds of thousands of
poverty-stricken, rural Afrikaners seeking work in the cities.
The answer came in the form of parastatals: big, state-run companies which
provided huge numbers of new jobs and useful sources of patronage for the
Afrikaner elite.
Now, with the country's attention focused on finding employment
opportunities for the vast, unskilled black labour pool, attention has once
again centered on these giant companies. But despite the pre-election
aspirations of some of the more statist among African National Congress
advisers, the economic climate is now vastly different from the early days
of Afrikaner rule.
Iscor, the state iron and steel company, was privatised in 1989 and is now
the most actively traded stock on the Johannesburg market. Similarly, Sasol,
the giant oil-from-coal company, is also privately run and has begun to
shift its focus to the manufacture of petrochemicals and other derivative
products. Both are now among the country's leading exporters of
semi-manufactured products.
Over the past few years, moreover, with an eye to possible further
privatisations, the remaining state corporations have been shifted to a
'commercial' basis, and are run as self-financing, independent public
companies, with an appointed board of directors. In recognition of this
shift, the new government has chosen to emphasise the strategic importance
of existing state industries and their potential as bases of local
technology and manufactured exports, rather than their possible role as job
providers for the masses.
'The public enterprises have a special role to play in the process of
rebuilding and revitalising the economy' observes Ms Stella Sigcau, minister
of public enterprises.
Although some state-run companies, such as the Mossgas oil terminal off
South Africa's southern coast, are struggling, others have dramatically
improved productivity in the past few years.
Transnet, which runs the country's railways, airline, ports and harbours was
for years best known as a home for unskilled, white workers who could be
guaranteed lifetime employment on the railways. 'I don't even want to talk
about how bad our hiring ratio used to be,' acknowledges Mr Anton Moolman,
managing director, noting that the company is now committed to a
comprehensive affirmative action programme.
However, while the demographics may have improved, overall employment in the
company has been falling steadily as it has sought to improve productivity
and cut costs. In 1993, more than 15,000 employees were redeployed and
27,000 took voluntary severance packages. 'Our prices are now competitive
globally,' Mr Moolman says. 'We stand to benefit greatly from the economic
recovery.'
Given the prominence of electrification goals in the government's
reconstruction and development programme, Eskom, the giant electricity
utility, has a particularly important role to play. Last year, the utility
electrified 200,000 new homes. In 1994 it hopes to raise the total to
250,000, all financed internally.
Both of these companies, moreover, are now intent on expanding their
operations abroad, especially in Africa. Transnet has already got operations
under way in Libya and east Africa, while Eskom envisions the establishment
of a vast regional electricity grid that can make use of the hydroelectric
resources of the Congo and Zambesi basins.
Mr John Maree, Eskom's chairman, wants to use South Africa's low-cost
electricity as a key incentive to increase foreign investment. 'With the
second-cheapest electricity in the world, we are able to create an
Electricity Valley in South Africa - similar to California's Silicon Valley
 -that will attract high energy consumption industries to the region,' he
says.
Perhaps most striking of all has been the ANC-led government's new affection
for the country's arms industry, now split into two companies, Denel, which
does most of the manufacturing, and Armscor, which concentrates on
procurement and maintenance. They have been applauded by the new
administration as representing a 'very important technological base without
which numerous job opportunities would be lost.'
Given this emphasis on commercial activity, moreover, the thorny question of
privatisation has forced its way back onto the agenda. Although President
Mandela recently deprecated the notion as just another means of maintaining
white economic clout, the government seems to be leaving the door open for a
change of heart. It has publicly declared that it will 'look with interest'
at ways in which privatisation might empower the black community, while Mr
Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, has said that he is in favour of
selling 'unproductive assets' in state hands.
Whatever the future of that debate, however, it seems highly unlikely that
the government will seek to decommercialise, let alone renationalise, the
privatised companies. In the unexpectedly sober new South Africa, job
creation and patronage in the parastatals will be taking second place to
efficiency and sustainable growth.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (25): Five challenges ahead - The
banks want a level playing field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few industries are better placed to cope with the challenges of
post-apartheid economics than the financial services sector.
'We are in the top 1 per cent in world banking in terms of systems,
instruments and performance' says Mr Barry Swart, First National Bank's
chief executive.
Services generally, and financial services in particular, form one sector
where South Africa has an international competitive advantage, although this
does not mean that it will escape the pressures of global competition,
already manifested in the arrival of several international commercial and
investment banks.
This is something of a sore point on two counts. The new arrivals, and the
return of banks that divested in the 1980s, are unlikely to improve services
and enhance competition in the bottom half of the market, where arguably the
country is underbanked and where millions of consumers and thousands of
small-scale enterprises offer new opportunities and challenges.
Instead, groups such as Citibank. Morgan Guaranty and Standard Chartered are
setting up representative offices targeting high-profile businesses,
focusing on trade finance, raising offshore loans and corporate finance
services in the realm of cross-border mergers and alliances.
While accepting the inevitability of such new competition, South African
banks want the government to insist on a level playing field, forcing the
newcomers to put capital on the table and open up branches - 'just as we had
to do in the UK', says one banker.
No one expects the foreign banks to risk the enormous capital needed to open
retail networks in South Africa. 'There is no way,' says one, 'that Barclays
or Standard Chartered will return to retail banking. The entry barriers are
just too high and returns on assets of 1 per cent unattractive.'
It's a similar story in the investment field, where South African brokers
have set up joint ventures with international merchant banks. S G Warburg
has taken a 50 per cent stake in the Ivor Jones Roy broking house in a deal
which is bound to impact on the investment banking business and aspirations
of South African banks.
Predictably, the foreigners are eyeing the high margin operations which,
politicians and industrialists say, are not the top priorities.
The banks see themselves up against five main challenges:
At the top of their list is the need to retain and strengthen their image as
world-class players. This means adherence to Basle capital ratios; greater
transparency, which ANC politicians are demanding; closer central bank
supervision; and deregulation of the markets.
Capital requirements have been raised significantly to satisfy Basle
standards - from next year, banks will have to meet the 8 per cent
risk-based capital adequacy requirement. All the leading groups are already
there.
The second is coping with the new international competition. Dr Conrad
Strauss, chairman of Standard Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic), says South
African banks must become larger, pointing out that, ranked by assets, 240
banks around the world are bigger than the largest South African bank.
On 1993 numbers, the top four banks accounted for nearly 80 per cent of
total bank assets. Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa) ranked first,
with a 28 per cent market share, followed by followed by Standard Bank (20
per cent), First National (17.5 per cent) and Nedcor with 13.5 per cent.
The third, and politically most pressing, is relevance - the need to ensure
that the banks are meeting the demands of the new South Africa in terms of
providing services for the small man and the small enterprise.
In a capital-scarce economy, it is not surprising that some politicians
should see the banks as a source of low-cost funding for social projects,
while simultaneously advocating directed credit to ensure that people and
businesses without collateral can get access to bank loans.
ANC politicians are calling for 'transparent' reporting by banks, requiring
them to report their loan portfolios by race and gender, giving reasons why
loan requests are rejected.
The banks have long been conscious of the opportunities available in the
fast-growing mass consumer market. Automatic telling machines, smart cards
and debit cards are being used to provide quick, efficient and low-cost
services to the millions of users seeking basic banking services.
Standard Bank is opening a new division, E-Bank, which is a network of
terminal-based branches catering for people wishing to deposit and withdraw
cash.
More challenging is the need to fund home purchasing and black business. The
Nedcor group, through its 1989 purchase of the Perm, bought a large black
customer base. Its experience with black home-buyers, who have good
repayment records, will stand it in good stead as the mass consumption
market expands. It stands to benefit too from donor funds, such as the
Dollars 15m package from USAID, to be channelled to low-income households.
In 1991, it established NedEnterprise which makes loans of between R50,000
and R1m to small and medium-scale businesses. Some 55 per cent to 60 per
cent of its lending is to black, asian and coloured-owned enterprise, with
about 60 per cent going to franchise-holders.
NedEnterprise offers three types of loans - traditional overdrafts for
working capital, instalment finance for asset purchasing and three- to
five-year term loans.
Bad debt ratios are low, especially in the franchise business where they are
below 5 per cent. It is not as high risk an operation as might be
anticipated because two organisations, the Small Business Development
Corporation and USAID provide guarantees for many loans, while franchising
is a low-risk operation anyway.
The fourth challenge is that of servicing corporate clients offshore.
Stanbic earned 2.5 per cent of its R844m net income in Europe, while a
further 4.8 per cent came from its acquisition of the former ANZ Grindlays
African network.
First National Bank has opened operations in the UK and Hong Kong, while
Nedcor has struck strategic alliances in Africa with leading European banks
 -BNP of France, Dresdner of Germany and Banque Bruxelles Lambert of
Belgium. It recently opened an office in Beijing and reopened in New York.
Increasingly, the banks see southern Africa as the logical extension of
their domestic market, with Stanbic, FNB and Nedcor all expanding their
regional business in the past two years.
High on the challenge list, too, is affirmative action. This is going to be
a difficult, controversial area. Experience elsewhere in Africa highlights
the dangers of falling standards of service and increasing losses through
fraud.
The sheer sophistication and technological superiority of the South African
banks means that they should manage to minimise this threat, but investment
in training and an element of affirmative action in promotion policies will
have to be a core part of future manpower strategies.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (26): Reserves fear delays abolition
 -The financial rand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one thing that South African businessmen detest above all
others, it is the financial rand (finrand) - the investment currency for
foreigners. At last month's World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town,
speaker after speaker reiterated the same demand to the country's financial
authorities: the country's exchange controls and its confusing two-tier
currency - widely seen as an impediment to foreign investment - must be
scrapped as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, however, while everyone might agree that the cumbersome
restrictions should be eradicated, there is no similar consensus on when
such a move should be made - although there is continuing speculation in the
market about a possible target date before the end of the year.
Nonetheless, both Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, and Mr Chris Stals,
Reserve Bank governor, are adamant that the financial rand is not going to
disappear any time soon. 'People need to stop speculating and talk about the
issue constructively,' stresses Mr Stals.
The main reason for the hesitation is the parlous state of the country's
foreign reserves which have taken a real hammering over the past 18 months:
1993 saw record net capital outflow of R10.3bn and the first part of this
year saw a similar haemorrhage, with a probable net loss of some R3.5bn.
Although the outflow has since stabilised, there has still been little sign
of capital inflows, and reserves currently amount to only just over a month
of imports.
Also, decades of exchange controls have created intense pressure among local
institutions and individuals to invest abroad. In the short term, the
country would almost certainly face massive capital exports following any
scrapping of the present system. Combined with the fact that a very large
pool of speculative finrands, about R4.5bn is currently in the banking
system waiting to be pulled out if the currencies merge, this is a cause for
severe anxiety among Reserve Bank officials.
'We need to be aware of the possible consequences (of abolishing the
finrand),' Mr Stals says, asserting that whatever the long-term rewards, in
the short term massive capital outflows will almost certainly lead to a
sharp depreciation in the currency and a very steep rise in interest rates.
'The shock therapy would be a big shock,' he asserts 'I don't think South
Africa is ready for such a major restructuring.'
Given these problems, Mr Stals and Mr Keys emphasise that three primary
conditions have to be met before the financial rand can be scrapped:
First, South Africa has to build up reserves that amount to at least three
months' cover, preferably more;
Second, the discount between the commercial and financial rand, presently
about 23 per cent, must narrow to 10 per cent or lower; and
Third, the finrand pool presently in the banking system must be cut to about
R1bn.
It seems that exchange liberalisation is more than a year away at least. And
even when reform does take place, it is likely to be done in stages so as to
try and limit any downside. But despite this, businessmen continue to argue
loudly that the system's demise should come sooner rather than later on the
grounds that the government will likely benefit from the element of surprise
while being applauded for showing confidence in the strength of the economy.
'We took a hell of a political risk with the transition,' observes a senior
banker. 'I think we should grit our teeth and take a similar leap of faith
with the finrand.'
So far, however, that is one jump that the government seems unwilling to
make.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (27): Finrand history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African exchange controls have been in place for decades, writes Mark
Suzman.
The financial rand was first introduced after the Sharpeville riots of 1961
to staunch massive capital outflows.
Although it was briefly scrapped in 1983, renewed political unrest forced
the finrand's reintroduction in 1985 following then President PW Botha's
notorious Rubicon speech and the subsequent run on the currency.
Financial rands comprise a pool of rands that can only be used by
foreign investors, and
trade at a significant discount to the commercial rand, the currency used
for all ordinary current account transactions.
Finrands are created when a non-resident sells an asset to a South African.
The payment is made in rand and deposited at a local bank. It can only be
used again by another non-resident in exchange for foreign currency.
In addition to acting as a penalty against capital withdrawal, the finrand
also serves as an investment incentive for new foreign investment because
all yields are remitted in commercial rands,
giving a greatly augmented return, thus helping maintain foreign reserves
and prevent capital flight.
While it does limit the outflow of capital, however, the finrand also
imposes serious costs on the economy. Most obviously, by creating severe
distortions in the currency market, it encourages asset-stripping and
'round-tripping' by companies to enjoy the benefits of the discount between
the two currencies.
Because the finrand is relatively thinly traded, moreover, speculation in
times of political uncertainty can lead to wild gyrations in its value.
And although the currency is designed to attract foreign investors, its
volatility is a strong deterrent, as capital gains can be eaten away by
currency losses.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (24): Economy's steam engine trundles
on - The past 12 months has seemed to signal an upturn in the mining
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One market analyst muses: 'Like it or not, mining is still the steam engine
of the South African economy.' Such a view is amply borne out by statistics:
although the industry's contribution to overall output has been declining
over the past decade, mining still accounts for about 10 per cent of gross
domestic product, and is responsible for more than 60 per cent of South
Africa's export earnings.
The past 12 months has seemed to signal an upturn in the industry after
several years in the doldrums. The commodity cycle is improving steadily and
the continued depreciation of the rand has helped boost revenues even
further. Gold is recovering from the disaster years of the late 80s and
early 90s, coal and diamonds have both picked up from the bottom of their
price cycles and the same is true for a wide range of other minerals.
But while the commercial position may be looking brighter, there are renewed
problems for the industry on the political front. Although the battle over
nationalisation appears to have been won by the mining houses, there has
been considerable debate in African National Congress quarters over the
possibility of the state taking control of the country's mineral rights,
which in South Africa, unlike many other countries, are privately owned.
The idea, aggressively promoted by Mr Paul Jourdan, an ANC adviser on
mining, is premised on the argument that such a move would allow the
government to raise new revenue from increased taxes, leases and royalties,
while freeing up new deposits for exploitation by small, black-run mining
operations. In addition, by allowing the possible entry of foreign mining
companies that have long sought a foothold in the South African market, Mr
Jourdan argues, the plan should promote competition and efficiency as well.
But as Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of the country's largest mining
conglomerate, Anglo American, points out, in South Africa any moves made in
this direction would 'not be from a standing start.' Local companies have
already spent a great deal of time and money investigating the viability of
mineral deposits. To alter arbitrarily the system, he argues, would be
expensive, unfair and unproductive. So far, despite its pre-election
rhetoric, the new government has not taken any action, and the appointment
of Mr Pik Botha, former foreign minister, as minister of mineral and energy
affairs has helped reassure mining houses that little of substance is likely
to change.
But the debate is the subject of continued discussions between ANC advisers,
the government and the mines. One senior mining executive notes: 'Our talks
have had a tone of constructive collaboration, and we are continuing the
dialogue.' He predicts that the outcome will probably be a compromise, with
mines selling or leasing some of their less valuable claims to new users.
Another potential danger area is on the labour front. The industry's
recovery is still very fragile and predicated on continued cost containment.
But after years of accepting below-inflation wage increases, mineworkers are
becoming increasingly restive. Hoping for support from a sympathetic
government and demanding a share of the benefits accruing from higher
mineral prices, the current round of wage negotiations, due to be completed
this month, is going far less smoothly than in previous years.
Many leading companies are pushing for productivity bonuses or profit-share
schemes that will allow them to embark on much-delayed capital expenditure,
but workers are insisting on increased base pay and wild-cat strikes and
go-slows have already depressed output for the year. Lingering apartheid
legacies, such as the continued lack of proper housing for black
mineworkers, are also causing tension.
'Its going to be much tougher this time round,' notes one official involved
in the pay talks. 'The unions are being less accommodating than during the
recession.'
In the longer term, too, other problems are looming. While South Africa
still has vast mineral deposits, it is a very mature mining environment and
new capital investment has slowed dramatically over the past 10 years. Of
the developments which have gone ahead, while the R1.7bn Moab extension to
Anglo's Vaal Reefs is on track, Gengold's Oryx development and JCI's Joel
expansion have both underperformed, as has the struggling Northam Platinum
mine, all of which serves as a discouragement for further new initiatives.
As a result, freed from the restrictions of the apartheid years, companies
are increasingly focusing their attention on more attractive prospects
abroad, particularly in the underexploited African environment. Already,
South African mining companies are aggressively investigating new mineral
deposits from Mali to Botswana and further development is expected over the
next few years.
'Ten years ago, 80 per cent of our exploration was in South Africa and 20
per cent outside; today the situation is reversed.' notes Mr Gary Maude,
managing director of Gengold.
In the global context, too, new initiatives are under way. Anglo last year
shifted most of its international assets to offshore associate Minorco as a
prelude to further expansion, while Gencor has been negotiating to purchase
Shell's international mineral arm, Billiton.
This is not to say that the South African mining industry will be neglected,
and some new mines will continue to be developed, but big capital spending
within the country is increasingly likely to shift away from mining projects
towards beneficiation of minerals for export.
The three biggest capital projects presently in progress, the R5.8bn Alusaf
aluminium refinery extension, the R3.5bn Columbus stainless steel expansion
and the R1.4bn Namakwa Sands project, are all examples of such value-added
mineral initiatives that should bear fruit in the future. In the meantime,
however, the steam engine will keep puffing away.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (23): Two taxing conditions -
Manufacturing industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In the new South Africa, manufacturing industry must fulfil two taxing
conditions. Growth must be both export-led and labour-intensive. Marrying
these two goals is not going to be easy.
South Africa is not a low-cost country - more a high-wage, low productivity
one - and its competitive advantage stems primarily from the combination of
a rich resource base and highly capital-intensive, value-adding activities.
The numbers tell their own story; in 1990, base metals, chemicals and metal
products accounted for 58 per cent of manufactured exports, while almost
three quarters were classified as 'resource-based'.
In part, as trade theory predicts, this reflects South Africa's resource
endowment, but two policy elements - forward cover for exports and tax
incentives for 'beneficiation' industries, adding value to minerals, also
contributed. Since the 1920s, industrial growth has been driven by import
substitution behind high tariff and protective walls. In the past decade,
however, the emphasis has changed as domestic recession pushed more and more
companies into the export market.
Despite sanctions, exports of manufactures grew 10 per cent a year between
1984 and 1990 - nearly three times faster than in the 1970s. Indeed, since
1972, exports have grown twice as fast as production - 6 per cent as against
2.6 per cent for output.
Five industrial sectors - foods, industrial chemicals, steel, non-ferrous
metals and metal products - make up almost two thirds of total manufactured
exports but in recent years non-traditional exports - furniture, jewellery,
rubber and plastics, and cars - have expanded strongly as business was
forced to seek market opportunities abroad. On the face of it, this ought to
make cheerful reading for Pretoria's policymakers. Industrial exports that
performed so impressively under sanctions should surely do far better now,
not just because sanctions have gone, but also because supplyside reforms to
enhance productivity and competitiveness are in train.
These reforms take two main forms. First, political transition and the
thrust of the RDP which, between them, should both improve substantially the
industrial relations environment, while boosting productivity, on the
strength of increased spending on education and training.
The second is the pronounced and continuing shift in trade policy,
underlined by tariff reform and the commitment to more export-friendly
strategies.
South Africa's extremely complex and skewed tariff system is being reformed
as part of the country's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade submission
under the Uruguay round. From next January, tariffs will be lowered and
rationalised over a five-year period, with longer phase-in periods and
higher protection for 'sensitive' industries, most notably clothing and
textiles and vehicle assembly.
Although South African manufacturing has not been over-protected - according
to the World Bank the average tariff is about average for a developing
country, although very high by first world standards - the dispersion,
complexity and instability of the system have undermined economic
efficiency.
The net effect has been a heavy bias against exports, two- thirds of which
stems from the higher input prices that industry must pay for manufactured
inputs. The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) estimates that
manufacturing costs are 15 per cent above the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development average, mainly because South African companies
pay a quarter more for their inputs than their first-world competitors, but
also because both the cost of capital and labour costs, adjusted for
productivity, are higher.
From next January, this will start to change. The number of tariff rates
will be reduced from more than 100 to just six, ranging from 0 per cent to
30 per cent, lowering the average tariff to 15per cent. The frequent
discretionary changes in the system that have been the norm, will no longer
be possible.
The World Bank says that the General Export Incentive Scheme which, until
the 1994 budget, provided tax-free financial subsidies to exporters,
provided a subsidy of nearly 17 per cent of the value of export.
The subsidy, costing some R2bn annually, applies to most exports, increasing
with the degree of value added. The Bank warns that manufacturing industry's
recent impressive export growth is unlikely to be maintained, when it is
phased out, probably by the end of 1997.
Crucial to the export drive will be a new system of incentives - by way of
exemptions and duty-drawbacks - improved mechanisms for providing pre- and
post-shipment export finance, and linking training and research and
development assistance to export-oriented companies. The underlying strategy
is a reversal of past performance, shifting from a situation in which export
sales are a residual after satisfying the home market, to one in which
domestic market sales play second fiddle to exports. How tariff reform and
export incentives will play out in terms of their impact on manufacturing
will only become clear towards the end of the decade. The Industrial
Development Corporation, using a macroeconomic model borrowed from the
Australians, has calculated that Gatt submission will have a positive
impact, albeit only a minor one. Its model, criticised on technical grounds
by some private sector economists, estimates that tariff reform will
increase gross domestic product by only 0.7 per cent - a one-off impact -
while lowering inflation 1 per cent, raising employment 1 per cent, exports
1.2 per cent, and imports 2.5 per cent.
The magnitude of these calculations suggests that the impact of Gatt on the
South African economy is being oversold. This, however, ignores the
qualitative implications in terms of transforming an inward-looking into an
outward-oriented manufacturing sector, with significant gains in terms of
technology, skills and productivity.
Nor do such macro calculations capture the impact of restructuring. Two
sensitive industries - cars and clothing and textiles - face a potentially
traumatic transitional phase during which some companies will have to close,
jobs will be lost and significant government financial support will be
needed, for retraining and possibly for redundancy benefits.
The motor industry, with seven assemblers, faces far-reaching structural
change. The number of models produced will shrink, exports will loom larger
as protection phases down over the next seven or eight years to 45 per cent
from 110 per cent at present, and - in all probability - two or even three
of the existing manufacturers will close or merge with a local competitor.
Just what this will mean for employment is unclear at this stage, but there
is an influential lobby in business, with some support from the World Bank,
for further exchange rate depreciation. This would make exporting more
profitable, generating investment and jobs, while giving import substitution
industries at least a temporary respite in coming to terms with enhanced
competition from abroad.
Greater outward orientation of the economy from 1995 might be an engine of
growth, according to the World Bank, though not, it warns of (direct)
employment generation. A Bank research paper comes down in favour of a
three-pronged approach - fostering growth in a small number of selected
subsectors, which sounds suspiciously like picking winners, usually frowned
upon in Bank orthodoxy; linking support to export performance; and
supporting employment generation. Crucial to employment growth is a shift
away from the capital-intensive self-sufficiency, counter-sanctions,
investments of the 1970s and 1980s, to smaller-scale, export-oriented,
job-intensive investment. A potential snag is the ANC's opposition to
Asian-style low-wage, sweat-shop industrialisation. The new government is
looking for the best of both worlds - labour-intensity but at wage levels
above those found in competitive economies.
Naively, in a world in which employment growth has been decoupled from
output expansion, the World Bank's best scenario for South Africa assumes a
return to capital-labour relationships that existed 25 years ago. Only the
optimists believe that this will happen. A more likely outcome is greater
job creation in manufacturing, especially the small scale sector, though at
nothing like the rate necessary to defuse the unemployment crisis.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (20): Price of success - Trade unions
are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's South Africa is a country of many parallel revolutions: virtually
every institution of state or society is undergoing dramatic change, not
least the trade union movement.
The union movement, itself an important catalyst of political change during
the bad times of apartheid, is today paying the price for its success. The
African National Congress, which arguably could not have achieved power
without union help, has poached the best and brightest unionists for the
government of national unity.
Mr Jay Naidoo, formerly general secretary of the most powerful union
federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), has one of
the most important jobs in the new government: he is minister without
portfolio in the President's office, charged with overseeing the
Reconstruction and Development Programme. Fellow unionist Mr Alec Erwin is
deputy minister of finance, Mr Sydney Mufamadi, a former Cosatu official,
has the powerful post of minister of safety and security (police), and other
unionists serve as influential advisers to ministers or MPs.
Overall, Cosatu has lost some 100 of its leaders in recent months, not only
to high offices of state, but to the private sector and academia. The result
is a crisis of leadership, which could have important implications for
labour relations and economic development in the months and years to come.
Strong leaders will be required to ensure that South Africa's powerful
unions contribute to the process of making the public and private sectors
more competitive and productive, rather than fighting change.
With 3.5m members, or 26 per cent of the economically active population, the
unions are a leading force in society. Cosatu has 1.3m members.
Cosatu's outgoing leaders laid a firm basis for co-operative change before
leaving the movement, through their participation in various tripartite
negotiating forums bringing together business, unions and government for the
first time.
They brought imagination, pragmatism and clear strategic thinking to bear on
the problems of industrial restructuring and socio-economic development, and
key thinkers such as Mr Ebrahim Patel of the South African Clothing and
Textile Workers Union will continue to do so.
But the unions' clout within such corporatist structures will inevitably
diminish - at least until a new crop of articulate and forceful unionists
can emerge to take the place of those lost. And perhaps more importantly,
the leaders' ability to deliver the co-operation of the union rank and file
may also be jeopardised; already mine employers report discipline problems
at the mines, the direct result of union loss of authority.
Government officials believe strong union leadership is essential to South
Africa's economic recovery. Tariff reform, prompted by the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, will cause upheaval in sectors such as textiles, the
motor industry and electronics. Across-the-board wage restraint is viewed as
necessary for the success of the Reconstruction and Development Programme,
and to rebuild confidence in the economy before measures such as removing
exchange controls can be taken. Weak leaders cannot hope to deliver union
acceptance of these and other unpopular measures.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, says the question of wage restraint has not
yet been 'battened down.'
'I think a compact as such is not on the cards, but I think a tacit,
never-expressed understanding is possible,' he said. His successor, Mr Chris
Liebenberg, will be equally keen to secure such an understanding. Government
seems to be proposing that Cosatu temper wage demands in exchange for large
private-sector programmes to train and upgrade workers and government action
to improve what unionists call the 'social wage' - improved social services
which reduce the cost pressure of education, health care and transport on
workers' pay.
Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu's new general secretary, seems tacitly to accept this
arrangement, although he rules out any unilateral union offer of wage
moderation. 'You don't call for wage restraint in a situation where there is
no social programme to take the strain off people's salaries. Anyone
speaking about wage restraint would first have to tell us what has changed
in terms of the distances that have to be travelled from Soweto to
Johannesburg, and in terms of the living standards of our people.'
But even if Cosatu leaders accept such a 'never-expressed understanding',
will their members agree? In many sectors, real wages have fallen over the
past four years of recession, and with the economy recovering and Cosatu's
political allies in power for the first time, the trend may be towards
greater union militancy, rather than moderation.
Cosatu officials predict a fairly turbulent year, not necessarily over
wages, but issues such as racism in the workplace and greater involvement of
workers in corporate decision-making. Some 1.2m man-days have already been
lost to strikes in the first half of this year; double the figure for the
corresponding period last year. Affirmative action could also prove a
flashpoint, although Cosatu opposes the imposition of legislated quotas,
arguing that this simply fosters tokenism.
Cosatu argues that business must pay to train both black and white workers
for more senior positions - with more and more whites joining
Cosatu-affiliated unions, the federation cannot afford to ignore their needs
 -and union leaders will push this demand forcefully in months to come.
In the longer term, says Mr Ebrahim Patel, writing in a recent issue of the
Johannesburg Weekly Mail newspaper: 'Unions will tend to reflect the
impatience of the community and the urgency of social transformation.'
That, in the end, will be what government fears most: a union movement which
mobilises popular frustration over the necessarily slow implementation of
the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Labour relations will never be
the same again.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (22): Bubbling with enthusiasm - The
business mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent announcement that Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, intends to
resign in October has put a bit of a dent in the unadulterated optimism that
most businessmen had been professing after April's elections, writes Mark
Suzman. But there is still an overwhelming sense of relief within the South
African private sector that the transition proved so successful.
More important, there is a widespread conviction that, given the new
political dispensation, South African business may be in a position to
revisit the glory days of the 1960s.
'It really is a miracle,' says Mr Richard Laubscher, chief executive of
banking group Nedcor. 'There's no other word to describe it.' Indeed, the
South African corporate sector has been positively bubbling over with
enthusiasm since the success of elections, and the South African Chamber of
Business confidence index has been rising steadily month by month.
This is not to say that traditionally hard-nosed businessmen are overlooking
the big problems they continue to confront - including overpriced labour,
outdated machinery and a severe shortage of skills - but there is an
overwhelming sense of relief that the difficulties now being faced are of a
conventional economic nature and not those of sanctions, disinvestment and
the threat of civil war.
'We've been through the business equivalent of the ten biblical plagues,'
observes Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries, one of the
country's largest industrial corporations, 'These problems are paradise
compared to what we've been through.'
As a result, it is hard work finding someone willing to point to any
downsides to business life in the new South Africa. Part of this is just
reaction to the dismal economic and political climate of the past decade.
'If you'd told me ten years ago we were expecting 2.5 to 3 per cent growth I
would have been depressed. Now I'm ecstatic,' admits one executive.
Similarly, while the recent budget's projected deficit of 6.4 per cent and
its mild investment incentives would have drawn jeers amid the prosperity of
the 1960s and 1970s, today it is applauded as a blueprint for growth.
But while the economic numbers may turn up some negatives, there are also
some fairly hefty positives. The economy has returned to growth after a
four-year recession; exports are at record highs; and inflation is at a
21-year low. In addition, retailers report rising sales and, most
importantly, fixed investment is rising after years of decline.
Add to this the return - in small numbers - of many leading multinationals
which departed during the apartheid years and, more importantly, the opening
of markets from Africa to the Middle East to eastern Europe, that were out
of bounds for decades, and the resultant feeling is that the only way from
here is up.
No doubt tensions will surface. There are also worries that Mr Christo
Liebenberg, the new finance minister, will prove less capable of standing up
to demands for fresh government spending than his capable predecessor.
But despite all this, the underlying fact is that confidence is at its
highest level in years. And while it would take a miracle for South Africa
to transform itself into what one businessman wistfully describes as 'an
African lion that can take on the Asian tigers,' miracles are something the
country can claim to have some experience with.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (21): Voluntary steps preferred -
Plans to promote blacks through affirmative action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress has set out to transform South Africa: nothing
less will do. Changing the racial composition of management, the
professions, the universities - all the institutions of power - will be
central to that transformation.
South Africans no longer debate the moral arguments in favour of affirmative
action - or the utilitarian arguments against it. They treat it as
inevitable. Apartheid prevented the entry of blacks to the managerial and
entrepreneurial classes; now this must be reversed, lest apartheid's legacy
destroy the spirit of racial goodwill which was such a welcome byproduct of
April's elections.
The scale of the task is enormous: within the civil service, most power lies
in white male Afrikaner hands. Although many ministers are now black, most
senior civil servants remain white. Before the elections, fewer than 1 per
cent of top positions were held by black Africans, and only a handful of
senior black appointments have been made since then.
Blacks still have only a token presence on the boards of leading quoted
companies, and top management is mostly white. Although a recent survey
showed that the number of senior black managers had doubled in the past two
years, the figure had risen from 1.9 per cent to only 3.9 per cent.
Changing the balance radically will be difficult because apartheid has
deprived Africans of the education and experience they need to cope at
senior levels. Few blacks are qualified to run government departments or big
corporations. The large pool of bureaucrats from black homelands provides
few technically competent individuals - and far too many who rely on
nepotism and corruption to survive.
Public corporations such as South African Airways and the electricity
utility, Eskom, have made big strides toward righting the racial balance.
But the civil service has lagged behind.
Mr Zola Skweyiya, public service minister, pledges a vigorous affirmative
action policy. He points out that although white civil servants had their
jobs guaranteed under the constitution - none can be sacked except with full
pensions - they can be moved from their current posts to make way for black
candidates.
No one will lose but the taxpayer. For the only conceivable way in which
whites can be retained and blacks advanced at the same time will be by
adding to the already bloated civil service payroll.
Private sector business, too, has read the writing on the wall, judging it
better to take pre-emptive action now rather than risk legislation in
future. A recent survey conducted by the Johannesburg company FSA-Contact
showed that three quarters of companies had affirmative action programmes in
place, up from just over half last year.
The ANC has said it prefers voluntary affirmative action to legislated
change, but has made clear that legislation will be used if companies prove
recalcitrant. Some ANC officials have suggested tax incentives to companies
who train workers to further affirmative action. Others focus on punitive
levies to penalise those slow to change.
But both the ANC and its allies in the trade unions agree that racial
quotas, legislated or voluntary, are unwise. Mr Ebrahim Patel, economist for
the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu), says that
'workplace democratisation' - bringing workers into decision-making
structures - is one way of getting around the shortage problem while still
empowering blacks in the workplace.
Mr Sam Shilowa, general secretary of Cosatu, the largest union federation,
is keen to insist that affirmative action is not intended to penalise
whites.
'If affirmative action is seen as taking white jobs it can be detrimental,
it can cause strikes,' says Mr Nelson Ndisa, president of the South African
Railways and Harbours Workers Union (SARHWU), the SAA union. Mr Ewan
Abrahamse, a union official, says: 'In the end, we'll bear the brunt of the
racial tension in the workplace. If we cannot have a better understanding
between whites and blacks, the country will be ruined.'
He might have been quoting from a recent African National Congress policy
paper: 'If well handled, affirmative action will help bind the nation
together and produce benefits for everyone. If badly managed, it will simply
re-distribute resentment, damage the economy and destroy social peace.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (19): From force to service -
Developments in the police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety and security, wears a plastic watch
with the hammer and sickle of the Italian Communist party, accepts his tea
from an obsequious white Afrikaans civil servant and defends 'his' policemen
 -and women - against the charge that they are all apartheid's criminals.
Such incongruities have become the normal stuff of life in the new South
Africa. White civil servants have new black bosses whom they treat with the
same studied servility as their Afrikaans predecessors. White police
generals, who defended the apartheid state with such vigour, are rushing to
ingratiate themselves with new political masters. And Sydney Mufamadi, 35,
finds himself in the uncomfortable position of having to find nice things to
say about the most hated institution in South African society: the South
African police.
It is a tribute to the extraordinary qualities of the soft-spoken and
articulate Mr Mufamadi that he does not seem to find this difficult. He is
one of South Africa's most adroit conciliators, a true peacemaker in the
mould of his mentor, Nelson Mandela. And best of all, he is a pragmatist who
knows that violence can never end so long as police are seen as most of the
problem, and not part of the solution.
'My police men and women' - Mr Mufamadi never omits this awkward but
politically correct reference to gender - 'in the past they were expected to
enforce laws which were not based on human rights. Perhaps the fact that
they were vicious can mean that they were potentially good policemen and
women.'
In other words, their job was repression and they were good at it. 'Now we
need to ensure that they enforce humane laws' - and hope that they are
equally good at fulfilling that task.
Ironically, Mr Mufamadi believes that a 'truth commission', aimed at
revealing apartheid abuses, could actually enhance the legitimacy of the
police by proving that '99 per cent of these people are not that bad.'
'Precisely because it is generally understood that the police are up to
something sinister, whether or not it can be proved, the truth commission' -
which South Africa's former rulers fear could turn into a witch hunt - 'can
address this problem by promoting the legitimacy and integrity of the
police. Those involved in unlawful activities cannot be more than 2 per cent
of the entire force.'
But if Mr Mufamadi, and provincial police ministers such as Ms Jessie Duarte
in the Johannesburg region, are trying hard to re-establish trust in the
police, they are simultaneously trying to change the force from within.
'You have a police force, not a police service. It's run on completely
militaristic lines. You don't have people saying 'Our job is to protect
human life; to protect people and communities.' They see their role as
protecting privilege. But it's not enough to protect (the man) who has nine
cars and not protect the poor,' says Mr Mufamadi.
'There is a particular culture of policing and that is the culture you want
to change,' he concludes, adding with a note close to despair: 'But how do
you inculcate in the whole South African society a human rights culture?'
Changing the command structure of the new South African Police Service
(SAPS) will be crucial. 'The Pretoria officer corps must reflect the fact
that there are not just white male Afrikaans speakers in the police,' he
says. 'The police leadership must be restructured to reflect South African
reality.'
But, as one of Mr Mufamadi's officials says, taking on the police is a
mammoth task. 'It's a state within a state - they even have their own
holiday resorts]'
And it is not clear that South Africa's former rulers are willing to come
completely clean on the subject of the security services. 'Officially there
is just a police force - but then you discover there is even officially a
force engaged in gun running] It's like an onion; we're getting one peel
after another. We may never get the whole thing,' says the official.
In the meantime, police forces in the 10 former homelands are in chaos,
making illegal promotions and looting government property. 'Policing in some
of these areas has virtually collapsed,' says a senior police official.
So if violence has abated, the credit goes primarily to the people, not to
the police. Mr Jacob Zuma, African National Congress leader in KwaZulu
Natal, reflects on the drop in violence in the province: 'Amazingly, the
population of Natal just forgot about tension and violence on all the days
of the election. The people gave leadership to the leaders on that day: they
showed us how much they wanted peace.'
Sydney Mufamadi was listening to their message; his job now is to deliver.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (17): Haunting test even for Solomon
/ A look at land reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress, is
probably not overstating the problem in this line from a recent speech on
land reform: 'Unless we settle the land question, we do not have a country.
If we handle it badly, we tear South Africa to pieces. If we manage it well,
we create the foundations of a truly united nation.'
Deputy President FW de Klerk recently highlighted land reform as one of the
issues which could destroy the government of national unity and anyone with
even a passing acquaintance with the issue must recognise that resolving
competing interests, meeting basic needs and defusing anger over land will
require not only the wisdom of Solomon, but quite a lot of his wealth as
well.
Apartheid's worst injustices were concentrated in this area. Since 1960, an
estimated 3.5m people have been forcibly removed from their homes under
various programmes designed to rid white South Africa of blacks. Some 1.2m
black farmers have been left with only 17m hectares of often sub-standard
land - 13 per cent of the country's total - while 55,000 whites, employing a
further 1.1m blacks as labourers, farm 102m hectares.
Millions more are simply in need of land for settlement, whether urban or
rural. In the former homelands, 83 per cent of black households are
estimated to fall below the poverty line, largely the result of land
shortage. It is a massive problem.
'If you don't have a land reform programme with some significant effect, it
comes back repeatedly to haunt you. People's grievances don't just vanish,'
says Mr Derek Hanekom, the newly-appointed minister of land affairs, from
the African National Congress. He points out that land reform is central to
the Reconstruction and Development Programme which calls for 30 per cent of
South Africa's land to be redistributed over five years beginning next year.
Mr Hanekom estimates the cost at R2bn a year - although only R92m is
allocated for land reform in the present year's budget, which provides only
a total of R2.5bn for all the RDP programmes. He outlines the government's
goals as:
Restitution: a Commission on Restitution of Land Rights and a Land Claims
Court will be set up to deal with the claims of forced removals victims.
Under the new constitution, people dispossessed of land after 1913 - the
year when systematic racial dispossession began in earnest - can claim
restitution from the state.
Original land may be returned to them or, where this is not feasible,
alternative state-owned land or other compensation will be provided. But
under the bill of rights, the interests of existing as well as original
landowners must be respected. The constitution bars expropriation except for
'public purposes', and requires that 'just and equitable' compensation be
paid, taking into account factors such as market value, use of the property
and value of investments in it. Mr Hanekom says that only state-owned land
and land acquired through the market will be used for this purpose, or for:
Redistribution: millions of black South Africans - not just those with
historical grievances - lack adequate land for settlement. Their plight has
been highlighted by cases of squatters invading privately-owned land near
Johannesburg, an invasion which the government condemned.
But, as the World Bank points out in a recent policy document on land
reform: 'It is essential that an expeditious, transparent and thorough land
restoration and redistribution process be implemented as a means of
discouraging the landless from resorting to land invasions.'
As Mr Geoff Budlender, a land lawyer, puts it: 'Land occupation is the only
functioning land claims process in South Africa today.' Until land reform
begins in earnest, the threat of invasion will grow.
Rural restructuring: 'Restitution entails more than just the acquisition of
lost land,' says Mr Hanekom. 'Good planning, the resettlement of people, the
provision of infrastructure and services, economic support programmes,
sustainable development and, very importantly, community institution
building are essential elements of the programme.'
Legal and market reforms: tenure rights will be strengthened, and state
financial institutions restructured to improve poor people's access to
finance. 'We want to remove the impediments, and ensure that those people
who are in a position to take advantage of market opportunities are
encouraged as much as possible,' Mr Hanekom told the Johannesburg newspaper
Business Day recently.
Mr Hanekom does not mention reform of agricultural markets - the ministry of
agriculture is the responsibility of the opposition National Party - but the
government's programme includes measures to stimulate competition in
agricultural markets and reduce barriers to entry, as an essential adjunct
to land reform.
Many questions remain unanswered. How will the beneficiaries be chosen:
according to need, or the ability to farm land productively? How will
nepotism and corruption be avoided? Where will the money come from? Can the
state move quickly enough to stave off the threat of invasion? One fact is
clear, however: the present highly unequal pattern of land ownership cannot
continue. Other countries with a similar pattern have seen neglect lead to
civil disorder and violence. South Africa cannot afford to do the same.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (18): Critical stage completed - The
defence forces integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its own way, the announcement at the end of last month was almost as
momentous as the installation of President Nelson Mandela.
Mr Siphiwe Nyanda, former chief of staff of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the
African National Congress's guerrilla army, was appointed Acting Chief of
Staff of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).
Mr Nyanda, 44, was one of nine MK officers given senior positions in the
integrated SANDF in a statement issued by Mr Joe Modise - himself a former
MK commander and now minister of defence.
Confirmed in their positions were the present chiefs of the army, air force
and navy: Lt Gen J H Pretorious, Lt Gen J Kriel, and Vice-Admiral R C
Simpson. In a restrained comment that must have concealed many emotions, Gen
Georg Meiring, commander of the SANDF, declared himself 'quite happy'.
The announcement marked the end of a critical stage of one of the most
remarkable revolutions of the twentieth century.
The South African armed forces were not defeated and their MK adversaries
never managed to launch an effective guerrilla war. But the soldiers of both
sides had to find an accommodation that would underpin the civilian leaders'
political settlement.
The essentials of the accommodation provide for the SANDF to swell to about
120,000 over the next year, allowing for the entry of MK cadres, soldiers of
former homeland armies, and a much smaller number of guerrillas from the
Azanian People's Liberation Army, military wing of the Pan Africanist
Congress.
Over the next three years this force will continue a process of
'restructuring and integration', during which it will be trimmed back to the
pre-integration strength of the armed forces - about 91,000.
These bare facts do not do justice to the complex behind-the-scenes
negotiations that have run parallel to the public political bargaining. But
in a chapter from a book to be published later this year by Johannesburg's
Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Mark Shaw, a researcher at the centre,
provides a detailed account.*
The essence of Mr Shaw's thesis is that the former South African Defence
Force (SADF) made their own assessment of the political and military options
open to them, and 'chose. . . not to prevent change.'
'Contrary to expectations of many observers, the SADF did not seek to derail
or prevent the transition; rather it sought to secure its place within it',
writes Mr Shaw.
'This willingness to live with majority government and military integration
was made far easier by the knowledge that its power, and the technical
competence of its senior officers, ensured that it would remain a force
which the new civilian authorities would have to respect, whatever formal
arrangements were signed', he continues.
Equally illuminating comments are made about MK, whose operational strength
numbered about 10,000 in the mid-1980s. It never had an overt political
agenda of its own, aside from the basic objective of ending white rule, says
Mr Shaw. This made it easier for it to revise its strategy after Nelson
Mandela's release in 1990, he writes. From 1991 onwards, its training
changed from guerrilla skills to conventional military skills, 'designed
specifically to prepare individuals for incorporation into a new national
defence force'.
Some 8,000-10,000 MK soldiers are believed to have been trained for this
purpose, bringing the estimated number of troops available for integration
to about 14,000-16,000.
'If estimates of MK guerrilla strength are accurate, it trained more people
for the national army than for its guerrilla war. While this still left it
vastly outnumbered by the SADF, it made it less likely that military
'integration' would amount to the MK being absorbed by the SADF', Mr Shaw
writes.
According to Mr Shaw, the South African cabinet decided in 1990 to try and
leave the SADF untouched: 'It alone would control the military until it was
reasonably certain of the outcome of the transition,' and ANC efforts to the
contrary were 'stonewalled' until early 1993.
The compromise reached on the thorny issue of control was the agreement to
form a National Peace Keeping Force (NPKF).
Although it was to prove a failure, the exercise nevertheless served a
valuable purpose.
Originally intended as force of 10,000 men, it initially comprised some
4,500 drawn from the SADF, the police force, MK and homelands forces from
Transkei, Ciskei and Venda.
Poorly trained and badly led, it was discredited on its first operational
deployment in the East Rand, where violence actually increased after the
force was deployed. Two days later it was withdrawn and later it was
disbanded.
The experience increased the legitimacy of the SADF, welcomed back
enthusiastically to the East Rand. But, says Mr Shaw, the NKPF prevented a
negotiation deadlock on joint control of the armed forces and showed that
more time was needed for integration, while the legitimacy it afforded the
SADF was to be transferred to the new SANDF.
The months and years ahead, warns Mr Shaw, will be marked by internal
battles over senior appointments and affirmative action. The call by the
former SADF for 'a technologically advanced military force' will also be a
sensitive issue, for it has political implications.
A high technical capacity, Mr Shaw suggests, could help extend white
officers' hold on military power.
He also warns that 'tensions will inevitably develop between the old
military leaders and the new political ones, with the ex-homeland officers
split between them.'
But the analysis ends on a cautiously optimistic note: 'Restraint and
political skill on both sides could however yet ensure a united military,
constrained by civil authority, in a society in which this once hardly
seemed likely'.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (14): Biggest splash so far / Profile
of P W V province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the legislature of the PWV province - the industrial hub of South Africa,
rather inelegantly named for its three main centres, Pretoria, the
Witwatersrand and Vereeniging - the spirit of provincial unity is so strong
that National Party members shout 'Amandla', the black power salute, and the
African National Congress shouts 'hoor, hoor', the traditional Afrikaans
interjection - just to show willing, writes Patti Waldmeir.
It is an impressive display, led by Mr Tokyo Sexwale, the premier - a man
who proved his conciliatory credentials last year when he pleaded for racial
tolerance in the aftermath of the assassination of Chris Hani, the ANC
guerrilla leader killed by a right-wing white assassin.
True to form as South Africa's most powerful province, the PWV and its
leaders have made the biggest splash so far on the provincial scene.
Hardly a day passes but Mr Sexwale, or Miss Jessie Duarte, his diminutive
police minister, visit a black township to urge residents to co-operate with
police, or drop in on a migrant workers' hostel to try to foster peace.
Mr Sexwale's performance as premier will be judged largely by how well he
implements the reconstruction and development programme. And here, conflicts
are already looming.
In his inaugural speech to the new legislature, Mr Sexwale promised to build
150,000 houses in the province over the next year - compared with only
30,000 homes built throughout South Africa last year.
He is understood to have plans for a grand R4bn house-building project
involving massive private and public sector finance. The plan has already
caused friction with Mr Joe Slovo, national housing minister, but Mr Slovo
appears to have been powerless to prevent it.
Mr Sexwale's youthful and inexperienced cabinet - which includes a finance
minister who is regional general secretary of the South African Communist
party and other noted radicals - certainly does not lack energy.
Only time will tell whether it lacks the circumspection necessary to avoid
grand and costly development failures.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (16): National party redoubt /
Profile of Western Cape province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cape Town, the European settlers' first landfall nearly 350 years ago, now
finds itself the last redoubt of white political control following the
victory of Mr FW de Klerk's National party in the Western Cape, the only one
of South Africa's nine new regions which it secured in the April elections,
writes Gordon Cramb.
Representatives of President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress
dominate the national parliament, which sits in Cape Town. But when the
regional cabinet meets at the other end of a leafy avenue, its four ANC
members are outnumbered by the six from the white-run National party, which
won the Western Cape because it convinced 'coloured' (mixed-race) voters
that it could better protect their interests.
The parties are linked at each level in a government of national unity. But
many Capetonians fear that their city, 1,000 miles from the ANC's
Johannesburg power-base, will become marginalised in the new South Africa -
missing out on reconstruction spending and losing its key institutions.
There is pressure within the ANC for parliament to be relocated to a site
near Johannesburg. Mr David Bridgman, director of Wesgro, an economic
development organisation funded by the private sector and local
municipalities, argues that this is not 'the sort of signal to the local or
international populace to be sending out' and says the R1.5bn estimated cost
of the move would provide housing for a quarter of a million people.
Greater Cape Town has a population of some 3m, with hundreds each day
arriving from rural areas to seek work. But the city and its surrounding
region have few industries which can absorb unskilled labour. The Western
Cape - bereft of metals and minerals - has as its main productive sectors
agriculture (and the majority of South African wines), a textiles and
garment industry, and tourism.
'For every 10 tourists you have a job,' says Mr Kobus Meiring, the region's
finance minister who was administrator of the old, larger Cape Province in
the dying years of apartheid. He describes the ANC's reconstruction and
development programme as 'a summary of what I have been trying to do in the
last five years' and he diverges in no respect from his ANC counterparts
when he enumerates housing, employment and health as the biggest challenges.
Mr Meiring admits being worried about a possible northward drift of
decision-making but argues that constitutional provisions, as well as the
government of national unity operative at central and regional level, should
protect the Western Cape from discrimination in allocating funds.
The region can trade not only on its breathtaking scenery but on an
underemployed port and airport and a relatively well-educated workforce. Oil
multinationals and insurance companies are among companies headquartered in
Cape Town in spite of the distance of the city from refineries or stock
exchange.
According to Mr Bridgman, potential foreign investors are exploring 'one or
two R1bn-plus projects'. If the National Party-led administration differed
to any extent from its ANC-headed equivalents elsewhere, it would 'focus a
little more on production as opposed to redistribution,' he suggests,
adding: 'We need the other side, too.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (13): Federalism arrives by the back
door - The struggle for power in South Africa's new provincial regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's political landscape is shifting by the day, but nowhere is
the movement more rapid than in the country's nine new provinces.
Provincial premiers are clamouring for power, and in some cases exercising
powers to which they have no right under the constitution. Turf battles are
under way to determine who controls the Reconstruction and Development
Programme: the provinces or the centre. And the fight over funding the
provinces has not even begun.
Despite the best efforts of African National Congress and National Party
constitutional negotiators, it looks as though federalism has arrived in
South Africa - albeit by the back door. And, ironically, it is not the
'dissident' provinces of KwaZulu Natal and Western Cape - ruled respectively
by the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party - but the provinces
controlled by the majority party, the African National Congress, who are
posing the greatest challenge to the centre.
'We knew the provinces were going to cause problems and the provinces that
were going to cause the most problems were the ANC provinces,' says Mr Zola
Skweyiya, minister of the public service and administration and the man
charged with devolving powers to the new provincial administrations under
the 1993 constitution.
'The tension between the provinces and centre will cut across the political
divide,' says Mr Thozamile Botha, head of the Commission on Provincial
Government, established to determine the extent of powers granted to
provinces under the existing constitution, and under the new constitution
due to be negotiated over the next two years in the newly elected
constituent assembly.
'The main confrontation in the constituent assembly is not going to be
between the ANC-NP-IFP but between the (ANC-led) national government and
regional premiers of the ANC,' says Mr Skweyiya.
The centrepiece of the battle will inevitably be the Reconstruction and
Development Programme; ultimately, provincial governments will stand or fall
according to how well they deliver on the RDP's promises.
But their power to do so is circumscribed: central government sets norms and
standards for RDP programmes which could, in some cases, impede delivery at
provincial level.
For example, Mr Joe Slovo, national housing minister, has made clear that he
opposes using RDP funds for so-called 'site and service' schemes: programmes
which provide basic services to squatter communities and allow them to
construct their own shelter from whatever materials are available.
Housing experts agree that, however morally distasteful such schemes, they
provide the only realistic solution to South Africa's massive housing
backlog. Provinces which are forced to build formal housing with their RDP
allocation from central government will end up satisfying only a fraction of
their constituents - and this will have inevitable electoral consequences.
Tensions will inevitably arise over central government's constitutional
right to impose uniform norms and standards throughout the country, and over
the centre's right to allocate funding to provinces, on the basis of a
formula yet to be agreed by a Financial and Fiscal Commission established
under the constitution. Provinces have only very limited powers to raise
revenues of their own.
'The key question is finance,' says Mr Skweyiya. 'What power do you really
have if you have to account to central government for what you want to do
and persuade them to finance it?'
The answer to that question is as yet far from clear: the political battle
over the powers of provinces has only just begun. Their powers are outlined
in the national constitution, subject to a vaguely worded over-ride clause
which would allow central government to intervene in most areas if it
wished. But before being allocated such powers, they must prove they are
capable of exercising them.
'All these provinces are saying: 'We want all our powers now.' But the
reality is that there is not an administration in all these provinces yet,
there is just an elected government,' says Mr Botha. In extreme cases such
as the Northern Cape, a new province created at the elections, no
administration yet exists.
Questions of long-term importance remain unresolved. Who will set the
curriculum of provincial schools? Who will decide how teachers are paid? Who
will set university entrance qualifications?
These are political, not constitutional questions although ultimately, if
they cannot be resolved by political negotiation, the final arbiter will be
the Constitutional Court. And the political battle between provinces and the
centre has only just been joined.
Ironically, as ANC provincial leaders admit privately, they will be
strengthened in their cause by the elements of federalism introduced into
the constitution by their chief rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party -
provisions which they fought bitterly at the time.
It truly is a new South Africa.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (12): Calmer waters of national
consensus - The Reconstruction and Development Programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After starting out as a highly contentious political manifesto - the arena
for angry ideological and economic debate during the election campaign - the
ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) has sailed into the
calmer waters of national consensus.
Ideology is much less of an issue, certainly insofar as social upliftment is
concerned. Just about everyone - government ministries, parastatals, private
enterprise, non-governmental organisations, and the donor community - is
jostling to climb aboard the RDP bandwagon. Such broad-based enthusiasm for
a programme which many decried only a few months ago, is itself a triumph
for the new administration, but especially for the ANC.
Mr Jay Naidoo, the cabinet minister with overall responsibility for the RDP,
says: 'The remarkable thing about political transition is that we have a
programme that united us, even before we started our first cabinet meeting.'
This has meant that the focus of the debate has shifted from sterile
argument over what it will cost - R39bn at the low end to R79bn at the top -
to much more pragmatic issues such as priorities, linkages between the many
different players who will be called to participate, sequencing and, above
all, delivery systems, and how they should be funded.
The RDP has two broad thrusts - social upliftment and economic development.
There are five key, inter-linked programmes: meeting basic needs; developing
human resources; building the economy; democratising the state and society;
and implementing the programme itself.
Meeting basic needs encompasses far-reaching land reform - an unreachable
target of redistributing 30 per cent of agricultural land within five years;
raising the number of houses constructed annually from 50,000 in 1992 to
300,000 by the end of the five-year programme in 1999; providing clean
drinking water for the 12m people without access to it at present, and
adequate sanitation for 21m people; supplying electricity to 19,000 black
schools (86 per cent of the total) and some 4,000 clinics presently without
electricity as well two thirds of the country's homes; redressing the
imbalance in access to telephone lines - one line for 100 black people
compared with 60 lines for 100 whites; and social safety nets for the
vulnerable.
According to the RDP, millions of blacks do not have access to such
services. The RDP calls for the creation of a national health system focused
on primary health care.
The plan includes phasing in a 10-year compulsory education system; limiting
class sizes to no more than 40 by the end of the decade; the launch of adult
education programme and the revamping of tertiary education. The underlying
goals are widely accepted but this is not so for the third element of the
programme - building the economy. Here the ANC's belief in interventionism
comes through along with some unrealistic targets - for example, the
creation of 300,000-500,000 non-farm jobs each year.
There is a pledge to 'reverse privatisation programmes that are contrary to
the public interest'; a promise to introduce 'strict anti-trust legislation'
while creating a more competitive business environment; and a commitment to
'de-racialise business ownership'. The section on industrial relations
promises free collective bargaining, payment of a living wage and
affirmative action.
As is invariably the case when a radical administration takes office, the
more controversial elements of the programme have been de-emphasised and
watered down. Indeed, this happened well before the elections, when some of
the more ideological, interventionist elements relating to the mining and
financial services sectors were amended in the face of sharp criticism from
the private sector.
This process has continued as ministers new to government tackle a steep
learning curve. For example, ministerial opposition to site-and-service
housing schemes is ebbing away as the new incumbents face up to hard
reality.
The new administration will soon have to start prioritising. One attempt to
quantify the amounts needed to 'remove social back-logs' within five years
puts the extension of social services at the head of the list with 26 per
cent of the total cost of R39bn, followed by education and training with
21.5 per cent and housing with 18 per cent.
In the new government's first budget, covering the nine months to March
1995, R2.5bn is earmarked for the RDP. This will be funded from savings from
departmental votes - what Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister with overriding
responsibility for the RDP, calls 'turning the ship of state around to meet
new priorities'. He promises 'a major kick-off of the programme' within the
first 100 days - by mid-August.
The government is preparing a policy document to convert a political
manifesto into a development plan. This will include a macroeconomic
framework, or model, that ties the programme to anticipated future economic
growth.
In the budget, Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, 'pencilled in' total RDP
spending of R37.5bn over five years, all of it to be financed from
departmental savings. Assuming inflation of 9 per cent a year, this will
mean that real recurrent government spending, excluding interest payments,
will have to be cut by about 2 per cent a year. This looks to be
unattainable, especially given the capital spending bias of the RDP, which
in turn will create demands for higher departmental votes. Building more
schools and hospitals implies more teachers, doctors and nurses.
Government spending on the RDP will be leveraged by aid inflows, by
parastatal funding of electrification and telecommunications, by private
sector financing of housing, by user-cost systems and by the sell-off of
government assets such as the oil stockpile and forest land. On one
calculation, R9bn could be raised from such asset sales. The Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development believes South Africa could
receive upwards of Dollars 1bn a year in aid flows, the greater portion of
which would be for RDP-type programmes.
Co-ordination between central government, provincial administrations and
parastatals, not to mention donors, is bound to be a problem - conceivably
posing a greater challenge than financing. There is a number of well-run
non-government organisations in South Africa with the infrastructure and
capacity to deliver the goods at relatively low cost. What is in doubt is
the willingness of some in government to make maximum use of such NGOs.
Senior officials also question the bureaucracy's capacity to spend
efficiently the amounts likely to be available from 1995 onwards.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (10): A widely respected banker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, to step down in October for
personal reasons caused panic in the financial markets when it was announced
this month, but his chosen successor, Mr Christo Liebenberg is likely to
prove a capable replacement, writes Mark Suzman.
Mr Liebenberg, who is presently acting as Mr Keys's understudy before the
incumbent leaves, fits all the requirements for finance minister. He is a
widely respected banker with strong private sector credentials, a sound
understanding of the economy, and a tough, conservative attitude to fiscal
discipline.
'He's a journeyman executive. He's capable and will work hard at the job.'
observes one banker. 'A very good back-room man,' notes another businessman
who has worked with him. 'He understands the issues, works through them
carefully and delivers the goods.'
Mr Liebenberg, a career banker, started work in the mail room of a Nedbank
branch and slowly worked his way up the ranks. En route, he picked up
managerial qualifications from the Institute of Bankers, Dale Carnegie,
Insead and Harvard, and built up a solid reputation as a dedicated and
hardworking executive.
In 1989 he became Nedbank's managing director and in 1990 he was appointed
chief executive of Nedcor, South Africa's fourth-largest banking and
financial services group, a post from which he retired in February of this
year after a solid stint at the helm. He has no previous government
experience and will be expected to bring business acumen rather than
political skills to the post.
Although affable and good humoured, Mr Liebenberg is seen as both less
charismatic and less cerebral than the ebullient Mr Keys and he will find it
more difficult to win people over to his point of view. One probable result
of his appointment will be a change in the balance of power in the
government's economic policy team.
Whereas Mr Keys was unquestionably the dominant figure in the troika
composed of him, Mr Jay Naidoo, and Mr Alec Erwin, the new arrangement will
likely be more of a gathering of equals. Mr Liebenberg's lower international
profile will also allow the other two to increase their exposure within the
global financial community.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (9): Discipline 'vital to strategy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Alec Erwin was sent by God. Jay Naidoo, I embrace him.' Mr Derek Keys, the
outgoing finance minister, has been overheard to utter such praises about
the two men - ironically, both former socialists - who have been his
lieutenants, writes Patti Waldmeir.
Now that troika is breaking up, with Mr Keys ceding his place to Mr Christo
Liebenberg, a respected banker. Mr Liebenberg is untested as finance
minister; but Mr Erwin and Mr Naidoo, reconstruction and development
minister, have already done much to prove their credentials as fiscal
moderates.
Indeed, to hear Mr Erwin, deputy minister of finance, defend the need for
discipline - with a fervour and passion which few orthodox economists could
equal - is to believe that his conversion is genuine.
'You simply cannot meet people's basic needs if you generate rampant
inflation. It would be totally counterproductive to our goals if we let
inflation rise,' he says with earnestness and conviction.
'Our commitment to fiscal discipline isn't just there because it looks
good,' he told his first press briefing after entering public office.
'Fiscal discipline is fundamental to the strategy.'
He reiterated the same message less than 24 hours after the announcement
that Mr Keys would resign, obviously eager to reassure investors that South
Africa's commitment to fiscal discipline would not depart with the minister.
Even so, time will test that commitment sorely. And the loss of Mr Keys  -
who worked with Mr Erwin and Mr Naidoo for the past two years to develop an
agreed economic vision based on discipline - could prove a serious blow.
The new troika will lack the rapport built up by the previous team during
tough months of negotiations in the national economic forum, the
business-labour-government body which brought corporatism to South Africa.
And Mr Liebenberg will wield far less political clout than the wily and
shrewd Mr Keys.
But Mr Erwin is clearly keen to make things work. Once a doctrinaire
socialist - he comes from Cosatu, the black union federation - he has made
his peace with capitalism.
Mr Keys was surely right: Mr Erwin was an inspired choice.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (8): Figure of flawless orthodoxy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the bad old days before the government of national unity, Mr Jay Naidoo
had an unfortunate habit of looking like Satan, sounding like Marx and
acting like Mephistopheles, writes Patti Waldmeir.
But those days are long gone now, and his image has been transformed.
With his well-cut suits and carefully tailored vocabulary, the new-look Mr
Naidoo - formerly head of the largest union federation, Cosatu, and now
minister charged with implementing the Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP) - is a figure of flawless economic orthodoxy. The firebrand
trade unionist and militant socialist of the past has become a persuasive
advocate of fiscal and financial discipline.
With just a hint of American twang in his accent, he might be a missionary
from the World Bank, pushing its gospel of structural adjustment - except
for one crucial difference, which he highlights forcefully: Mr Naidoo
believes he has society on his side.
Mr Naidoo, who turns 40 this year, describes South Africa's own brand of
structural adjustment, the RDP, as a 'shared partnership between government
and civil society', a vision which unites all the parties in the coalition
cabinet.
But his commitment to the RDP, which is fervent, goes well beyond the simple
intention to spend money. 'Overriding everything in this country is going to
be the fact that this is how much money we have, these are the constraints,'
he says.
He constantly insists that it is not an 'add-on' programme: 'The RDP is. . .
about how to reorganise government expenditure to meet new priorities. We
are turning the ship of state around to those new priorities. . . but we
must do so while ensuring that we maintain stability.'
Hard choices lie ahead, he says, and conflict is probably inevitable. 'But I
spent my whole professional life mediating conflict,' Mr Naidoo points out,
referring to his role as Cosatu general secretary during 1985 to 1993: the
toughest years of union-management antagonism. Those years honed his
rhetorical and political skills to the point where he earned the grudging
respect of business; they also taught him pragmatism.
Nothing could have prepared him better for the difficult years to come.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (7): Love-in that may not last -
Corporatism has been embraced with relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After generations of often bitter confrontational economic management, with
government, labour and big business at each other's throats, it is hardly
surprising that South Africans should have embraced the corporate state with
a mixture of enthusiasm and relief.
Even the sceptics concede that the smooth transition owes much to the forum
system where different stakeholders - in the economy, in housing, health and
education - sat around the table in an effort to sink their differences and
work out compromises.
All three sides of the 'golden triangle' - government, business and the
unions - are keen to build on such past successes as the National Economic
Forum, responsible among other things for securing consensus in the
difficult and complex negotiations over last year's General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade submission for the Uruguay round.
All sides were conscious of what was at stake in the decision to lower
tariffs radically over the next five years - markets, exports, jobs and
industrial peace. But the system worked, setting what many see as a model
for the future.
Those with memories of failed experiments in corporatism - the UK in the
1960s and 1970s - have their reservations. The concept is riven with
internal contradictions. Take, for example, the contradiction between the
ANC's commitment to anti-trust legislation and a more active competition
policy, and tax measures in the last two budgets designed to encourage
businesses to reinvest. Threats to clip the wings of big organisations
conflict with measures encouraging them to reinvest.
A second, more serious, potential weakness is the economic management crunch
that is bound to come during the five-year life of the national unity
government. The ANC has a mandate to restructure the economy. In this
process one - or both - of the other two sides of the triangle is going to
get hurt.
Sooner, rather than later, too, ministerial impatience with government by
forum and consensus will develop. The government's commitment to implement -
not just announce - important social programmes during its first 100 days in
office, is vulnerable to delay as the number of participants proliferates.
Above all, there is a question mark over the ANC's willingness to share
power, not just with defeated political opponents but with the unelected
representatives of what many on the left see as the old enemy, big business.
For the present the love-in between business and government looks rock
solid, but the third side of the triangle seems to be increasingly suspect.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, agrees that there is little prospect of a
compact with labour, but hopes for a tacit, unspoken deal that would link
wages with productivity. Employers are less sanguine, noting the tendency
for wage settlements to average out at two or three percentage points above
the inflation rate.
In early July, negotiators in the mining industry were a full 10 points
apart, with employers determined to keep the 1994 wage round in single
figures while the unions were demanding 18 per cent.
Management worries that now the top echelon of union leaders has moved off
into politics and government, there is a very real danger that - even if
wage agreements are reached - the unions will lack the capacity and
credibility to sell the deal to their members.
Some 1.2m working days were lost to strike action in the first half of 1994
 -the country's worst industrial relations performance for seven years.
While this was partly attributable to pre-election disruption, it also
reflects wage disputes which, according to industrial consultants, Andrew
Levy and Associates, accounted for one third of the stoppages. The danger
here must be that labour, which played a crucial role in bringing down
apartheid, will push hard for an immediate, substantial, liberation
dividend. Ministers and employers believe this will not happen, arguing that
labour leaders are more preoccupied with job security than wage levels, but
the current trend of above-inflation pay awards will put this thesis to the
test.
Government has a similar, if less acute, problem in terms of ensuring that
what is agreed at central government level is translated into action by
provincial administrations and parastatals. This too, is an inherent
weakness of corporatism - the difficulty of ensuring that all the main
players stick to their agreements. Some larger employers, for example,
accuse their smaller colleagues of conceding unnecessarily high wage claims.
Missing from the golden triangle - if central bank independence is to be a
reality - is one of the key actors. As many in business voice their
impatience over the Reserve Bank's caution on exchange control
liberalisation and abolition of the financial rand, while anxieties surface
over inflationary wage claims and job generation, the role of the central
bank becomes increasingly crucial to the success of corporatism.
In many countries, corporatism has foundered on this issue - the refusal of
the monetary authorities to accommodate wage inflation, to lower interest
rates - to boost output and employment - and the need for tight monetary
policy to counter fiscal weakness. In the new South Africa, that too will
become a crunch issue.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (5): East Asian 'miracle' is needed -
Economic policy must deliver stable growth and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No matter how one crunches the numbers, it is obvious that the fate of the
new South Africa lies in the hands of foreign investors, bankers and fund
managers.
This is little more than a statement of the obvious in an increasingly
integrated global economy, but also a result of a capital outflow of some
Dollars 25bn since the mid-1980s. Reversing this capital outflow is the top
priority, since foreign capital is likely to make all the difference between
sluggish growth of 2.5-3 per cent annually and expansion of at least 5 per
cent a year.
Recognition of this unpalatable reality has bred a new consensus within the
African National Congress to accept the inevitable trade-off between fiscal
and monetary discipline on one hand and social upliftment spending
programmes on the other.
That consensus remains firm, despite the unwelcome news that Mr Derek Keys,
finance minister, has decided to resign, from October. He leaves behind an
overtly pro-business, supplyside budget that will do little for populist
expectations in the short term; and an economic team which gives every sign
of carrying on his policies without him.
At the same time, the foreign capital issue is splitting the country into
two camps, with many in the business establishment urging the new
administration to lift at least some exchange controls and abolish the
financial rand.
'With a sound conservative budget behind us, commodity prices improving and
massive world support and sympathy, there will never be a better time for
dropping the finrand,' says one banker who also warned: 'The climate for
exchange control liberalisation is not going to get any better'.
'The cute money' he adds, 'is waiting for the second shoe to drop, for the
inevitable decline in the commercial rand, before taking the plunge.' The
danger is that this could turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy as
foreign investors watch and wait for exchange controls to be loosened.
Having achieved the seemingly impossible on the political front, President
Mandela's new government now needs an economic miracle. South Africa must
become the first non-Asian country to replicate the East Asian miracle of
growth with equity.
The numbers in this year's United Nations Human Development Report
underscore the challenge. South Africa, with a gross domestic product of
Dollars 120bn and one of the world's 25 biggest economies, ranks 93 in terms
of human development, and sixtieth in terms of income a head. The UN says
that if white South Africa were treated as a separate country, it would rank
24th in the world, just below Spain, while if the same were done for black
South Africa, it would rank 123rd, just above Congo and behind Lesotho,
Zimbabwe and Vietnam.
The sheer unsustainability of such comparisons, now that the black majority
is in the driving seat, highlights the formidable nature of the economic
challenge. It is not just a matter of jerking the economy back on to the
relatively high growth path of the 1950s and 60s - 5 per cent annually -
which will be difficult enough, but of restructuring it to ensure
substantially greater participation for those marginalised for the past 300
years.
East Asian experience shows this can be done although whether South Africa
is ready for the sacrifices this will involve is another matter.
With the commodity cycle having passed its trough, the global economy on the
mend and South Africa's investment climate looking better than at any time
for at least 40 years, the economy is poised for a period of sustained
growth.
Even so, few economists believe that growth of more than 2.5-3.5 per cent is
on the cards for the next two years, while for the rest of the century, a
battery of constraints - the cumulative legacies of apartheid, the balance
of payments, unsustainable levels of domestic debt, the shortage of skills
and the need to restructure manufacturing - will keep expansion below 5 per
cent annually.
At issue is the new government's capacity to impose restructuring while
simultaneously delivering on the social front. In the first post-apartheid
budget last month, Mr Keys set a near-perfect example. Given the constraints
on fiscal expansion - a budget deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP at a time when
the country is teetering on the edge of a domestic debt trap - the minister
focused on reallocating public spending rather than raising taxes to fund
social upliftment programmes. He managed to find R2.5bn (Dollars 700m) in
savings from normal departmental votes to finance the ANC's Reconstruction
and Development Programme (RDP), while leaving unscathed those earning less
than R50,000 (Dollars 14,000) annually.
The RDP is the instrument designed to redress the ills of apartheid - the
yawning chasm between white and black living standards. The government has
'pencilled in' RDP spending of R37.5bn over the next five years on health,
education, housing and land. The plan is that government's contribution will
be leveraged by private sector contributions, especially in housing, by the
parastatals - high-density township electrification and telecommunications -
and by foreign donors.
The Keys rubric - avidly shared by others in the government's economic team
 -is that spending overruns on normal departmental votes will erode the 'pot
of money' available for such social programmes.
While initial market response to the budget was favourable, it was not long
before second-thoughts surfaced. Some of this had more to do with global
developments than the budget, but in the words of one government adviser:
'The markets don't trust us . . . Because there is no track record, we have
a credibility problem.'
But while the confidence factor is certainly critical at this stage, there
is more to it than that. Almost everyone wants to see exchange controls and
the financial rand abolished, but while many in the business community
believe this can - indeed must - be done soon, ministers and their advisers
are much more cautious.
The central bank governor Dr Chris Stals, has set three conditions for
financial rand abolition: that the discount on the investment currency falls
below 10 per cent; a substantial reduction in financial rand balances,
estimated at R4.5bn, held with the banks; and, most important of all, a
build-up in the country's foreign reserves, which in May had fallen to
R7.2bn, some five weeks import cover.
These three conditions are unlikely to be satisfied this year and possibly
not until mid-1995, or even beyond. However, the critics warn that an overly
cautious administration will always find reasons to delay. Their argument
stands and falls on the assumption that the end of the financial rand would
spark huge capital inflows, without which the economy will remain stuck in
the slow lane.
Government economists, question whether now is the time for a 'leap over the
cliff' that could end in tears with interest rates of 30-40 per cent, the
commercial rand down a further 20 per cent and the government's credibility
in tatters.
Countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe have all shown that exchange
control liberalisation can result in exchange rate appreciation and a rapid
increase in reserves. But Mr Keys believes South Africa is different, with
wealthy individuals, cash-rich corporates and institutional investors just
waiting for the opportunity to invest offshore. Officials point out that
South Africa is not as under-borrowed as often suggested, noting that while
foreign debt is only a modest 14 per cent of GDP, if foreign holdings of
equities, and fixed interest securities, are added in, the ratio doubles.
Dr Stals questions whether South Africa is ready for 'the burden of
convertibility' - the impact that premature exchange control abolition might
have on the exchange rate, inflation, wages and interest rates.
It is ironic that the private sector, so insistent that now is the time for
'an economic leap of faith like the constitutional agreement', is more
pessimistic about the economic fundamentals - inflation, growth and the new
administration's capacity to impose fiscal discipline, than the government.
Private sector economists believe not just that the trough of the
inflationary cycle has passed but that inflation, which touched a 21-year
low of 7.1 per cent in April, edging fractionally higher to 7.2 per cent in
May, could be back in double-digit figures before the end of 1995. There are
real reservations, too, about the fiscal strategy. The 1994 budget is a
stop-gap affair; the really tough decisions will come next March when the
new minister
will have to act on the advice of the recently-appointed Tax Commission, on
such issues as zero-rated valued added tax for basic foods, equal tax
treatment for women and inflation-adjustment taxation to minimise fiscal
drag. All are very worthy causes in their own right, but each one comes with
a price tag at a time when the RDP is certain to bulk large on the spending
side of the ledger.
All of this suggests that the markets will have to live with the uncertainty
surrounding the future of the financial rand for least another nine months.
In the meantime, after a poor first six months, the economy is picking up,
but with growth of little more than 5-5.5 per cent over the next 18 months,
unemployment is set to worsen while living standards stagnate.
'It all comes back to track records,' says an industrialist. 'If the
government gets the next budget as right as this one, and exchange controls
go early next year, we could be on our way. . .'
President Mandela's problem is that he doesn't have a year or two in which
to await meaningful results. Its not that expectations are excessive but
that the new administration must deliver soon in the fields of township
electrification, housing, more school places and improved social services,
but also on the key issue of jobs.
The World Bank estimates that half the country's black workforce is without
formal sector employment. Optimistic as ever, the Bank believes that given
appropriate policies, including wage restraint and fiscal discipline, this
ratio could halve within 10 years.
If President Mandela can deliver jobs on this scale, he will indeed have
performed a remarkable double-whammy - an economic as well as a political
miracle. But in the 1990s world of jobless growth this has the ring of
mission impossible.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (3): Accommodating participants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interview with FW de Klerk, deputy president:
Question: How well is the government of national unity working?
Answer: It got off to a good start. All the participants are going out of
their way to be accommodating. I have identified a number of issues where. .
. one might experience problems: the question of a truth commission; how
should we deal with the past; the question of affirmative action; the whole
land issue is going to be a very emotional and sensitive one for years to
come.
But the whole question of economic policy has basically been breached: it is
clear that economic and financial policies will be based on principles which
can ensure economic growth, which will build investor confidence, which will
continue to maintain inflation at acceptable levels, so in that I find proof
that we can and will also reach accommodation with regard to other important
issues.
Has South Africa ended up with a federal constitution, through the back
door?
I've always said this is essentially a federal constitution. What is
happening now is just proof of that.
What is the role of the National Party?
One of fully participating in the government, putting aside our differences.
. . I'm not saying that on specific issues it will not become necessary for
us to say we have to consider our position on this very important issue as a
party, but so far it hasn't been necessary. So the ministers and I would be
playing the normal role that you play irrespective of which party forms the
government. . .
But the NP intends also to be an effective opposition. Obviously, one will
be inhibited by the fact that one is also participating. It is for this
reason that policy frameworks are important. Because once you have agreed on
policy frameworks, the political debate, aimed at the next election, is to
say 'Our policy is better. We had to make a compromise, yes, but vote for us
next time and you'll get a better policy.'
Will you still need a government of national unity after the five years
entrenched in the constitution?
I personally think that five years might be too short. Even if the concept
of power sharing were to be weakened in a final constitution, because I
don't think it will disappear, I believe it is quite probable that South
Africa will move to the situation of so many European countries, where on
the basis of proportional representation you will have coalitions because of
the election results and because no single party gets more than 50 per cent
of the vote.

Interview with Thabo Mbeki, deputy president
Question: Is there a commitment in society to fundamental change?
Answer: One of the things that happened over the past few years, unplanned I
think, was because of the length of time that it took from the first
official public negotiations to elections, some consensus was built about
some things so everybody fell within the same framework.
Everybody wants to get rid of apartheid and the consequences of apartheid:
there are certain things that are so glaringly bad that there is nobody in
the country, whether different parties or different strata of society or
whatever who are going to differ about certain basic things. . . but the
issue of the transformation of the civil service, for example, is not by any
means going to be very easy. There are people who've been in the civil
service for a very long time, they know a particular kind of civil service
with a particular manner of operating, and you want to change that. I'm sure
there is going to be a very big struggle about that.
I think theres going to be a very big struggle to change patterns of
ownership, management control of the direction of the economy. We might all
of us appear to be saying the same thing now, a more equitable distribution
of wealth and all of that. But in substance how do you get there?
Do you believe there should be legislation to ensure that the corporate
sector participates in the reconstruction and development programme?
I think you need both moral and political pressure and perhaps in certain
instances legislation. It will need to be a mix of measures, it will not be
one thing that you do. You might have to pass legislation with regard to
some matters, and with regard to other matters you might introduce an
incentive system.
Do you see power-sharing being entrenched in a final constitution?
I think once you have moved some distance with regard to addressing the
outstandingly glaring iniquities of the apartheid system and that's gone and
society looks a little better, it's not so divided. . . this must result in
people beginning to focus on what might be ideological, political,
philosophical differences among themselves. You might have alternative
strategies for growth, for all sorts of things.
The parties which could unite against apartheid and maintain that unity when
dealing with the consequences of apartheid, once you have gone beyond a
certain threshold people in the same party find that they have different
ideas. . . and you get a new political alignment. I think that is
inevitable.

Three men will shape the destiny of South Africa: President Nelson Mandela
and Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and FW de Klerk / They talk to Patti

the many difficult challenges which lie ahead

Question: Why should Financial Times readers invest in South Africa?
Answer: South Africa is potentially a rich country. . . with developed
infrastructure, modern ports, a sophisticated banking system, a
telecommunications system. It can be a powerhouse for the southern African
region.
Investors in this country are likely to derive maximum benefit, far more
than investing in other areas. South Africa is far more advanced than any of
our neighbouring states and therefore to invest in this country you will be
helping to raise the living standards of not only the people in South
Africa, but in the southern African region.
Why invest in South and southern Africa rather than East Asia?
We have taken precautions to ensure that investors have a maximum return for
their investments. Nationalisation was a fundamental part of ANC policy. But
in order to attract investments it was clear to us that we had to make a
very significant shift; if we did not, we would not get investments. There
will be no expropriation of foreign investments. Investors will be free to
repatriate dividends and if an investor sells his business, he will be able
to export those proceeds. We believe in keeping our tax rate low so as to
attract foreign investment. That's a decided advantage. . .
What are the prospects for a social contract in South Africa?
I don't know if I would call it a social contract. But there is an agreement
between labour, capital and the government. The harmony that exists between
ourselves in the ANC and big business is striking. The support we have had
from business, had it not been for that support. . . we probably would not
have had such a landslide victory.
Are you surprised at the degree of powers claimed by provincial premiers?
Our own people are demanding some form of federalism. Whereas it was the
Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Buthelezi, the National Party of Mr de Klerk
that was demanding it. Now it is our own people demanding independence from
the central government. We are happy about that. All that we're concerned
about is that there should be free movement of goods, services, capital and
labour.
Why did you decide on a government of national unity, and will it continue
after the five years set out in the constitution?
There is a long history here, starting from our experiences in prison. The
moment we arrived at Robben Island, there was debate amongst Afrikaner
warders, some saying let's treat these people harshly so they must respect
white supremacy, others saying. . . we must treat them in such a way that
when they win it should not be a government of retribution. We adopted a
policy of talking to the warders and persuading them to treat us as human
beings.
And that is a lesson that one of our strongest weapons is dialogue. It has
been a very powerful weapon. Our people accepted this, because throughout
the history of the ANC, the idea of nation-building, of a non-racial
society, has been uppermost. And we have now implemented that through a
government of national unity. So far as continuing this government after
five years, we have an open mind; we're very flexible.
Could you articulate your vision of the RDP?
Well, it wants to address the basic needs of the masses of the people: to
ensure that our people lead a better life, to ensure that everybody has a
job; that everybody lives in a decent house; that there is free, quality
education; that there is electricity in every home; clean, healthy, running
water; that there are sporting and recreation centres; that there are paved
roads in our areas.
But the RDP also addresses the question of nation-building. (Through the
RDP) we are appealing to whites. Remain in our country, don't take away your
skills. The RDP is intended not only to address the basic needs of the
majority, it is actually to set the minority free, free from fear of
retribution. It is a programme to transform the whole South African society.
A Truth Commission in a country where the previous government still holds
power is unusual. Do you worry such a commission might, as deputy president
De Klerk has warned, prove divisive?
The ANC has twice the combined strength of the IFP and the National Party,
so if we wanted to we could just run the government, but we are not doing
that. We are committed to making the government of national unity something
which has got a substantive content. As far as the Truth Commission is
concerned, we have made it clear that we have no intention of retribution.
We are doing this in order to heal the wounds of the past. People must know
what crimes were committed and that we have forgiven those crimes.
Is the spirit of national unity strong enough to survive these pressures?
Recently I went to the most powerful congregation of the Dutch Reformed
Church in Pretoria. There was a time where if you went to the DRC, you would
need a whole police force to protect you from being attacked. They needed a
police force to protect me from the love of the people. You would think I
was in Soweto. Everybody wanted to touch me. And the whole idea of national
unity has attracted a positive response from all segments of the population.
Aren't you in danger of not satisfying your (black) constituency at the end
of your first year?
This is a process. The people are justified in having these exaggerated
expectations when they see whites enjoying rights and opportunities that are
denied them. From inside the country, forces are being mobilised to enable
us to start this programme.
I can assure you, as we said during the elections, that we promise no
miracles. We want you to understand that it is going to take time for us to
mobilise the resources. . . But what is important is that a few days after a
new cabinet was set up, the process of trying to address problems started,
and I can tell you that the co-operation in the GNU is impressive.
Don't you underestimate the role of the front-line states in ending
apartheid?
That, actually, I don't agree with. The people - men, women and children -
inside South Africa who came out into the streets, called strikes;
stayaways, who were shot and killed by the racist South African Police; they
are the people who kept the fires burning, and eventually brought down
tyrants.
When do you think the NP finally realised that it was majority rule or
nothing?
You can't put a date and say on the particular day they realised; gradually,
they came to accept that majority rule was unavoidable. But you must
understand that it takes a long time for concepts to be accepted because
even now, without in any way being discourteous to the NP, they still think
that they are in the majority because they would like us to consult them on
everything we do.
But de Klerk is a man who means well and when we point out to him: 'Look,
don't go too far, we are the majority party,' he accepts that.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (1): A powerful spirit of unity -
South Africa's politicians must still show they can deliver their promises,
but with a charismatic leader at the helm their luck may hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been one of the most extraordinary political transformations of the
twentieth century: South Africans have defied the logic of their past, and
broken all the rules of social theory, to forge a powerful spirit of unity
from a shattered nation.
Nearly three months after the national catharsis which liberated black and
white alike - the April 27 all-race elections - they remain dazed, proud,
happy and surprised. They can hardly believe their luck.
That new-found confidence is fragile, and news of the resignation of Mr
Derek Keys, finance minister, the man who taught South Africa to believe in
itself - has deflated the national mood. But even the departure of Mr Keys
(he will step down from October) could not seriously undermine the politics
of common purpose which has united South Africa. Having wrought a miracle,
against all the odds, South Africans are eager now to go on to even greater
feats of political magic.
In a land of profound faith, and belief in one or many deities, South
Africans very often adopt the vocabulary of the miraculous to explain what
has happened. A right-wing Afrikaner says President Nelson Mandela, who has
driven the process of unification with such wisdom and vision, is 'a gift
from God.' He suggests that Mr Mandela is like the crooked stick in the
Bible: God can do much good with him, though he be flawed.
Even the least sentimental political analysts speak of luck and magic.
Columnist Simon Barber, writing in the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day,
says South Africans 'passed through the looking glass' at the moment of Mr
Mandela's inauguration. 'In that instant, their country became the mirror
image of its former self. No longer a pariah but, in a world of Bosnias,
Somalias and Rwandas, a beacon.'
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress, puts
it even more simply: 'The gods smiled on the ANC' - not because the ANC won
power, but precisely because it did not win too much power too soon.
'The four years we spent in negotiations helped to let a lot of ideas mature
in our own heads and hearts, to accept sitting down with De Klerk in a
government of national unity. . .' he explains. 'We were a little bit giddy.
. . and I think we could have made mistakes. So, with hindsight, we played
out a grand strategy but maybe some aspects of it we stumbled upon and found
our way through the dark.'
What they stumbled towards, during those four years of endless talk and
bestial violence, was the shared vision of a new South Africa which emerged
so powerfully in the wake of the remarkably peaceful elections. Hardly
anyone dissents from that vision: certainly not South Africa's former
rulers, the National Party, who so far seem to define their interests
identically with those of the ANC. And not even the normally fractious
Inkatha Freedom Party, full participant in the coalition government of
national unity, or the white right Freedom Front, which has remained outside
the cabinet but taken seats in all other constitutional structures.
That vision has taken shape in the Reconstruction and Development Programme,
a grand blueprint to transform South African society, to re-invent
government and re-define patterns of ownership, influence and power. Says
one businessman who fully supports the programme: 'The RDP has replaced
apartheid as a grand social project. People talk about it as a kind of holy
thing, beyond debate - at least in its goals.'
Those goals go well beyond mere socio-economic development: building 1m new
houses, electrifying 2.5m homes, redistributing 30 per cent of the land,
bringing clean water, education and health to South Africa's poor. The
broader goal is to re-invent South Africa in its entirety: a brave new
non-racial world must be created where the main institutions of society -
the civil service, the security forces, the business community, the
universities, the media, the stock exchange, the banks - are no longer
dominated by whites.
The culture of government must change: the feudal arrogance of the National
Party past, which bred obsequiousness in civil servants and sapped the
general population's will to resist, must not be repeated. Mr Bobby Godsell,
political analyst and industrial relations director for the giant Anglo
American Corporation, says South Africa's new rulers must 'behave
differently' and break the cycle of the past. A senior ANC minister argues
that government must keep its integrity - even more than keeping its
promises.
The transformation has barely begun. Mr Ramaphosa says: 'Though we have
achieved power at a formal level, we still do not have our hands on the
levers of power throughout government structures.' Ministers speak of
paralysis in government as politicians fight to master the civil service
machine and, more importantly, as they tussle with newly-elected provincial
premiers who have shown a remarkable degree of independence.
Ultimately, the success of the RDP will depend on the creation of a more
efficient and responsive civil service, and provincial governments which can
effectively deliver development. But ministers point out that not only has
the RDP given South Africans a shared vision; it has provoked a shared sense
of risk, across the political spectrum within the multi-party government of
national unity, and beyond.
'All of us have to deliver the goods,' says Mr Jay Naidoo, minister charged
with overseeing the RDP. 'It's not going to help the National Party if
Hernus Kriel (NP premier) fails to deliver the goods in the Western Cape, or
if Frank Mdladlose (Inkatha premier) fails to deliver the goods in KwaZulu
Natal. 'If the RDP does not succeed, the NP is as much responsible as the
ANC,' he concludes.
A senior National Party minister concurs: 'Unless we develop the country, we
all fail.
'The need for development is so overwhelming that it overrides party
political differences,' he says, arguing that such differences are a luxury
which South Africa can ill afford.
Deputy President FW de Klerk, the leader of the National Party, has outlined
a strategy of what might be called 'constructive opposition' but is
constrained by his presence in the coalition government from too vigorous
dissent.
In practice, true opposition is likely to come not from the National Party,
or even from the less cosily entrenched Inkatha Freedom Party, but from
within the ANC itself - from the provincial premiers, who have scented power
and will fight the ANC-led central government for more of it; and from Mr
Ramaphosa, who has remained outside the cabinet to build his own
constituency within the party itself.
He has defined his role as 'keeper of the soul of the ANC' - watchdog over
the implementation of the RDP, and check on the governing party's natural
tendency to assume the arrogance of power.
For although the temptation may be for the government of national unity to
act as if it rules a one-party state, South African society is likely to
prove too plural - and the political system too balanced - to allow that in
the end.
Ironically, despite constitutional guarantees of overriding power to central
government, political realities - not least of them the lust for power of
provincial premiers from the ANC - seem to be bringing federalism to South
Africa through the back door.
Provincial premiers are flouting the authority of central government and
exercising even those powers which the constitution denies them. And the
centre seems to think it imprudent to resist.
However bitterly the principle of federalism was resisted by the ANC - and
often by the National Party - at multi-party negotiations, everyone now
agrees that tension between the centre and the provinces is a healthy sign
of emerging democracy.
Only time will tell whether dissent will be so welcome once South Africa
emerges from its current honeymoon to face the sad reality that economic
growth may simply be insufficient to support the RDP's goals; that foreign
investment may be slow to materialise; and that political power may not be
enough to shift the burden of underdevelopment.
Economic realities may yet defeat the politicians in their desire to do
good. But for the moment, they still believe in miracles. And with Nelson
Mandela at the helm - surely one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth
century - maybe, just maybe, their luck will hold.

Monday: The UK Treasury's mid-year forecast of the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement was perceived as quite conservative, so analysts will be
watching today's figures for June's deficit to see if the government is
likely to undershoot its Pounds 36bn forecast for 1994-95. June's PSBR is
expected to be Pounds 3.7bn.
Wednesday: While M0 growth has been racing away beyond its monitoring range,
growth in M4, the government's broadest measure of the money supply, has
been subdued. Figures published today are expected to show the trend
continuing, with annual growth edging up to 5.5 per cent in June, from 5.3
per cent in May. The more erratic sterling M4 lending figure is ex-
pected to show net new lending of Pounds 1.3bn in June.
Thursday: The UK's trade balance has been improving slightly in recent
months and the non-European Union trade deficit in June, released today, is
expected to have dropped to Pounds 700m in June, from Pounds 767m in May.
Also published today: the British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic
survey, which is expected to reflect businesses' concern about rising costs.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Important role for currency in share rally -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency factors have now turned very positive for the UK equities, and are
playing an important role in the market recovery, according to analysts at
several securities houses known to have the ear of continental European fund
managers.
Earnings ratios on UK stocks are now the lowest of any major market, points
out SG Warburg, which puts 'sustainable' p/e ratios in the UK market at
15.15 times, compared with 16.78 in Germany and 16.21 in France. The
investment bank says that London also offers the best relative cheapness to
its mid-cycle p/e - the ratio generated if the net sales margin returns to
its average of the last cycle.
The dollar's rally has enabled investors to turn their attention back to the
fundamental attractions of economic recovery in Europe. But it is the
relative weakness of sterling against the D-Mark that has triggered the
sudden recovery in UK share prices.
The current DM/Pounds rate, now down to the lows of last year when the UK
currency was still in the final throes of its exit from the ERM, offers
overseas funds entry to UK equities on favourable terms.
Many European investors are believed to have exited the UK market at around
FT-SE 3,500 at the beginning of this year, taking their timing from the
DM/Pounds rate rather than market judgment. The fall in the rate since then
gives overseas buyers of UK stocks an effective discount of some 300 Footsie
points over the average UK fund manager, according to Strauss Turnbull.
From the view of market prospects, the weighting in favour of overseas
investment activity is all the stronger because, according to most London
houses, UK institutions are close to fully invested and the prolonged period
of anxiety over the dollar and the bond markets has left market-makers with
flat trading books.
Hence the powerful squeeze on prices at present, with shares responding very
strongly to the sudden recovery in stock index futures which are now
routinely at a substantial premium to the underling cash market, in sharp
contrast to the discounts to which unwary traders had become accustomed.
The most healthy signal from the marketplace has been the revival in retail,
or genuine customer business in equities. The total of around Pounds 6.8bn
for the past five trading sessions is the best the market has seen since the
skids went under the bond markets.
The bid for Wm Low from Tesco is seen as a welcome indication of the weight
of corporate activity likely to surface as companies with highly-rated paper
move in on bid targets. Such activity is associated with a return of
investment confidence in the stock market.

FRANKFURT
A quiet week is in prospect on the corporate front and few analysts expect
any change on interest rates when the Bundesbank Council meets on Thursday
for its mid-year monetary target review.
Colonia's annual meeting on Friday is expected, says UBS, to confirm the
positive underlying trends that have been developing in the German insurance
market so far this year.
Berliner Bank, which earlier this year merged with two others to form
Germany's sixth biggest bank, holds its annual shareholders meeting on
Friday.
MILAN
Preliminary details of the government's budget plans put some life back into
the market late last week but investors will have to wait until after a
cabinet meeting on Thursday for more information.
The market took the government's economic plans in its stride but it will
start the August account today looking decidedly fragile after events on
Friday, when Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, clashed with
magistrates over plans to limit their powers of arrest in corruption cases.
Cartiere Burgo, the paper and packaging group, launches its rights issue
today to raise L230bn. Shares in the group fell by 4 per cent on July 5 in
immediate response to the announcement and by Friday they had fallen by
another 3.9 per cent.
BCI will talking to shareholders this week about plans to raise a total of
nearly L2,400bn in a two-stage share and warrant issue in the autumn.
James Capel said the way the issue was being priced, at L3,000 a share - a
discount of more than 40 per cent to the price at the time of the
announcement in May - meant that even after the price fall over the past six
weeks, it would still be at a discount of more than 30 per cent.
ZURICH
The market was still reacting on Friday to last week's disappointing
half-year sales figures from Roche and the somewhat better news from Sandoz.
This week, the focus switches from the pharmaceuticals to the
widely-recommended Nestle, which provides first indications on Friday of its
performance in the first half of the year.
Analysts are expecting slightly negative or flat sales, with the strength of
the dollar depressing the result by 4 to 7 per cent and outweighing
improvements in volumes and prices.
JOHANNESBURG
Having largely settled down following the turmoil resulting from the
unexpected change in South Africa's finance minister two weeks ago, the
Johannesburg SE will focus in earnest this week on the latest quarterly
results from the gold mining companies, writes Mark Suzman.
Gold Fields of South Africa, which reported last Monday, was slightly down
on the previous quarter, due largely to the effect of the South African
elections and sporadic 'stayaways'.
Analysts expect that Gengold and Anglo American, which release their results
on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, will also have been affected.
A lot of attention will be focused on the degree to which both companies
have managed to unwind their outstanding forward contracts to take advantage
of the higher spot price.
Their assessment of the current round of wage negotiations, which is
reported to be running into some difficulties, will also be carefully
studied.
Also under scrutiny will be Gencor, Gengold's parent company, which is
expected to announce on Tuesday the completion of its long-standing
negotiations to take control of Billiton, the mineral arm of Royal Dutch
Shell.
There has been some concern that Gencor's probable purchase price of around
Dollars 1bn will be seen by the market as excessive for the assets received.
However, the current turnround in the commodity cycle is seen to have
improved the group's longer-term prospects.
TOKYO
The strength of the yen will continue to be the focal point among investors,
as fears of US inflationary pressures still prevail among currency traders,
writes Emiko Terazono.
The strong yen has prompted profit-taking among overseas investors, who have
been the underlying force behind the recent strength of the Nikkei.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange last week said that foreign investors were net
sellers of Japanese shares during July 4 to July 8, for the third
consecutive week.
Meanwhile, brokers may actively buy up shares ahead of an expected
allocation of public funds to the stock market this week.
Also, reports that the Japanese post office plans to release Y1,000bn from
its life assurance assets to fund managers during the week, has heightened
expectations of a rise in the liquidity of the stock market.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Seoul may delay ceiling rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is that Seoul's general index this year is likely to exceed
its all-time record high in spite of nuclear tensions and the recent death
of the North Korean President Kim Young-sam, writes John Burton in Seoul.
However, the bad news is that the rise in share prices may persuade the
Seoul government, worried about an overheated market, to delay a proposed
increase of the 10 per cent ceiling on foreign shareholdings, which has been
largely filled.
Most analysts forecast that the market will break its record high of 1,007,
set in April 1989, within the next few months and approach the 1,100 level
by the year end.
The market's strength has been helped by a robust economy and the prospect
of increased corporate earnings - GNP is expected to grow by 8 per cent
following strong exports caused by the weakness of the Korean won against
the Japanese yen, and a consequent increase in facility investments to meet
the increased global demand for Korean cars, ships and semiconductors. The
only economic worry is inflation, which could reach 6 per cent by the end of
the year.
But foreign investors are hampered in enjoying the full benefits due to the
10 per cent cap on foreign shareholdings in listed companies. The government
is reluctant to raise the foreign ceiling immediately because it fears that
the inflow of capital from abroad could stoke inflationary pressure. Instead
it has promised to raise the investment limit by an unspecified amount by
the end of 1995. The finance ministry also suggested last month that it
would accelerate the schedule by raising the ceiling in gradual stages to 15
per cent by mid-1995.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Investors likely to focus on results season
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last week, when the stock market reacted mainly to bond price
movements, the dollar, and inflation news, investors are now likely to
concentrate on the second-quarter results season, which enters its second
week today.
Few corporate earnings will be as eagerly awaited as IBM's, due Thursday.
Its results have long been regarded as a highlight of the season, even if
its fortunes have waned in recent years, and its stock overtaken by Merck's
as the bellwether of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
IBM's shares have been under pressure, dropping 12 per cent in the past
month due to growing uncertainty about what earnings will look like.
Pessimists fear it will not come close to matching the 6 per cent sales
growth of the first quarter, a view backed by a recent meeting between the
company and analysts in which IBM suggested some sales forecasts were overly
bullish. There is also some doubt that IBM has been able to make the sort of
costs savings analysts regard as essential to its long-term recovery.
Consequently, Wall Street earnings forecasts vary from 50 cents to 80 cents
a share, although most are at the high end of that range. But even if the
figures are disappointing, the stock may not suffer a major sell-off, as the
recent fall can be seen as a discounting of bad news. If the numbers are
good, then a rally may be in order.
It is unlikely the rest of the market will take its cue from IBM. The days
when 'Big Blue' led the market up - and down - are long since over. Other
big companies will be producing results this week, and among the most
keenly-watched will be the big money-centre banks, starting with Chase
Manhattan today.
Citicorp, the largest US bank, will report tomorrow, and the consensus among
analysts, according to the First Call service, is for earnings of Dollars
1.22 a share, up from 82 cents a year ago. Trading profits are expected to
bounce back from a difficult first quarter, when turmoil in worldwide bond
markets hit Citicorp's bottom line.
Investors this week are also likely to keep an aye on the Humphrey-Hawkins
Testimony, the semi-annual appearance of the Federal Reserve chairman before
Congress due to start on Wednesday.
Everyone will be keen to hear what, if anything, Fed chairman Mr Alan
Greenspan has to say about the role of monetary policy in influencing the
valuation of the still-weak dollar.
Analysts expect Mr Greenspan to remain silent on the dollar. They say he is
more likely to repeat the warning he gave Congress a year ago - that further
interest rates increases might be needed to ensure the economy does not add
too much fuel to the inflationary fires.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Istanbul strives to regulate its recovery
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tuncay Artun, the new chairman of the Istanbul stock exchange, is putting
a brave face on Turkey's troubles. 'During strife and plagues, our
weaknesses are always exposed,' he says in a colourful phrase, in keeping
with the splendid view from his office overlooking the Bosporus.
With interest rates edging down, and the lira appreciating there are some
who believe that the market may already be through the worst. But the
signals are mixed.
Last week, Isbankasi, the semi-autonomous state bank, applied to the Capital
Markets Board to have its A-type equity fund converted back to a general
mutual fund. The move was greeted with consternation, for if Turkey's second
largest bank, an institution perceived as close to the government, is seen
to be reducing its equity exposure, what choice has the investor but to
follow suit and shift funds into fixed interest instruments?
Caution remains the byword. The Istanbul roller coaster has been extremely
bumpy: in 1993 the index outperformed almost every other emerging market,
according to the IFC, the World Bank's private sector lending arm, but so
far this year the collapse of the lira has wiped about 50 per cent off share
prices in dollar terms.
Mr Artun likes to joke that he was 'part of the package', a reference to the
austerity measures unveiled by the government on April 5. Certainly, since
his appointment, the index has recovered ground, gaining 9.3 per cent in
dollar terms since April 14, and 36 per cent since June 14.
But the market is still driven more by short-term liquidity considerations
than fundamentals. And with the government at one time selling paper at 400
per cent compounded annually, the crowding out effect on equities has been
considerable.
In one area, Mr Artun seems to be making progress. Last week he announced
new trading rules, extending the settlement period and doubling daily
trading hours. By next April, all share trading is to be transferred to
real-time, a move which is expected to boost volumes. On the regulatory
side, moves are under way to change the rules applying to the A-type funds.
This is intended to encourage banks and other issuers to bring extra
liquidity to the market rather than shuffling equity portfolios and dumping
shares of less desirable participants.
The recent currency turbulence has not been without casualties: 12 of the
112 brokerage houses are suspended and others are under scrutiny.
The authorities have reacted by tightening the rules to prevent the use of
repurchase agreements which are not backed by stock. A draft circular has
also been prepared to curb the use of short selling, and stock borrowing and
lending or margin trading - a problem which Mr Artun describes
diplomatically as 'not illegal, but unregulated'.
Attention is now focused on the results season due at the end of this month.
Operating profits may be badly hit with the sharp contraction in economic
activity. However, companies with strong cash flow, which have been able to
take advantage of high interest rates to boost financial earnings, should
fare better.
Much of the recent buying has been by foreigners, taking advantage of the
currency correction to accumulate stock before a market re-evaluation. Mr
Tom Chadwick of London brokers Smith New Court says there have been 'plenty
of good trading opportunities over the summer'. He warns that there may
still be some problems in implementing the austerity programme, but believes
a recovery in 1996 has not yet been discounted.
Ms Radhika Ajmera, who runs the Pounds 40m Turkey Trust, is more cautious.
She feels that the market needs some adjustment downwards after heavy buying
by retail investors which has pushed the index up. Buying has been
particularly heavy in stocks such as Eregli iron and steel (Erdemir), which
the government is hoping to privatise.
Foreign investors would appear to be the main beneficiaries of the change in
the settlement system. Because of time differences, under the old system
brokers frequently found that the market closed before their foreign
exchange funding requirements were known. With high overnight interest
rates, this could be costly if trades failed to settle.
There are still some reservations. For example, at the end of the new
afternoon session, Turkey's foreign exchange markets are all closed. 'As a
foreign currency investor you don't want to carry a Turkish lira position
overnight,' says Kaya Didman of Barings Securities.
Officials are also worried that extending trading hours may encourage
greater share volatility and more margin trading. The daily limit on share
movements, for example, is automatically increased to 20 per cent  - which
represents a 40 per cent potential price swing within a settlement period.
One exchange official estimated that as much as 40 per cent of current
volume was due to margin trading.
The reforms will help. But over the longer term, Istanbul's prospects will
depend on the government's own finances. For only if the government can curb
its spending can the market enjoy a sustained recovery.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Issuers put deals on hold as turmoil takes
its toll - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing number of international equity offerings are being postponed,
cancelled, or cut in size, as the turmoil in the world's financial markets
this year takes its toll.
The heavy flow of new issues in the first half of the year, despite the poor
performance of underlying stock markets, has created severe indigestion in
the new issues market.
According to Euromoney, international syndicated equity offerings launched
in the first half of 1994 totalled Dollars 31bn. But while the flow of new
issues continued unabated, despite underlying market weakness, the demand
for paper has ebbed steadily.
The recent poor performance of high-visibility deals such as Italy's Ina has
sapped investor confidence, to the point where even issues priced at a
discount are not necessarily attracting buyers.
In the last week, Italian savings bank Cariplo's L1,650bn offering was
indefinitely postponed and South African insurance company Liberty Life
scaled back the size of its Dollars 360m to Dollars 500m global convertible
bond to Dollars 300m. Even then, the Liberty Life bonds have performed
poorly, ending the week at 98 bid, after being priced at 100.
Smaller deals are also suffering. Ayala Land of the Philippines last week
pulled its planned Dollars 100m offering of convertible bonds via Morgan
Stanley. It was the company's second attempt to tap the market, having
previously failed to bring an offering of global depositary receipts (GDRs).
'There are a lot of deals trying to sap up a limited amount of money, and
investors are being very choosy,' said one banker. 'It's not
market-specific; deals are being affected across all the markets.'
In part, however, the problem is a seasonal one. Although last year, the
market remained active throughout the summer, August is traditionally a
quite month for new issues. This year, many battered investors are saying
that they will not be buying new paper at least until September.
In the last few weeks, investment bankers have been spending a lot of time
on the phone to corporate treasurers, explaining why deals they have been
mandated to arrange should be put on hold.
For some companies, which may have already made investment decisions based
on expectations of the fresh funds, there is a stark choice between
postponing their offerings and selling shares at a heavily discounted price.
Some underwriters have been criticised for promising more than they can
deliver, in order to win mandates. But underwriters say companies are
usually understanding when they are told not to bring new issues, as the
fear of a failed issue usually overrides the need for financing.
The exceptions are the sizeable number of European governments which need to
raise funds through privatisations to finance deficits.
The adverse market conditions have already been exacerbated by governments
no longer operating an unofficial queueing system, whereby they time their
large privatisations to avoid a surplus of deals at any one time.
For cash-rich investors, there may be some bargains around. For example,
India's Dr Reddys Laboratories priced an offering of global depositary
receipts via Baring at a 29.3 per cent discount to Friday's close.
But even apparently cheap pricing does not necessarily attract buyers: the
deal still had to be reduced from Dollars 50m to Dollars 40m.
'The only thing you can say (to companies) is let's look at it again after
the summer,' said one investment banker. 'The stock markets are showing
signs of turning around, and when the secondary market comes back, the
primary market usually follows.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRATEGY
The performance of emerging markets over the first half of 1994 has been
mixed with only the sub-Saharan region showing an improvement in local
currency terms, according to research by Kleiman International, the US-based
independent consultants.
Among the more mainstream markets, India saw a half year rise of 13 per cent
in dollar terms, in spite of higher inflation and lower economic growth
prospects.
But in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia falls ranged between 21 and 25 per
cent.
In North Africa, Egypt advanced by 63 per cent in local currency terms
helped by a pick-up in the country's privatisation programme, while Tunisia
improved by 35 per cent.
FUND LAUNCH
A Russian equity fund is to be launched in September by Regent Fund
Management, the Hong Kong-based group.
The White Tiger Investment Company will aim for a size of Dollars 20m in the
first 18 months, investing in traded companies on the Moscow and St
Petersburg stock exchanges, with up to 20 per cent going to the Far Eastern
region centred on Vladivostok.
JORDAN
Until now, 1994 has not been a good year for the Amman financial market,
writes James Whittington in Amman.
Investors have been jittery over progress in the Middle East peace talks and
the market has so far been stuck in a downward slide.
Last week the index fell to a year's low of 142.81 which represents an 8 per
cent drop from the beginning of the year.
Local analysts believe that this poor performance is set to change as
Jordanian and Israeli negotiators meet in the region today to push forward
their peace talks amid real signs of progress.
They say the market has reached the bottom of its decline and an upward
trend is now likely, although it will still remain highly sensitive to any
disruptions in the peace talks.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Greenspan testimony to guide dollar -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar will stay the focus of attention this week, with markets focusing
on the Humphrey Hawkins testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, on
Wednesday.
While the US currency remains gripped by bearish sentiment, it did benefit
last week from the firmer tone of US bond markets. If Mr Greenspan can
convince markets that the Fed is on top of the battle against inflation,
this could support the bond market rally, and hence the dollar.
Although good inflation figures and a modest rise in retail rates mean
policy moves will probably wait until the next FOMC meeting on August 16,
there is a possibility of a pre-emptive strike ahead of Mr Greenspan's
testimony.
The Fed chairman is reputed to prefer to explain what has already been done,
rather than what lies ahead.
The Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday will also be in the spotlight.
The June M3 growth figure will be released earlier in the week, and with the
market expecting it to fall to 12 per cent - some forecasts suggest closer
to 10 per cent - from 13.7 per cent, the way may be open for the Bundesbank
to cut official interest rates. Lower rates could help the dollar.
A raft of statistical releases in the UK could also support sterling. The
distributive trades survey on Tuesday, retail sales data on Wednesday and
second quarter GDP estimates on Friday should confirm a picture of a
stronger growth trend, with inflation remaining at a low ebb.
Subject to the dollar not turning sharply lower again - this would
inevitably drag sterling with it - the economic data could support a move
into UK assets, evidenced by the firmer tone of UK shares and bonds at the
end of last week.
In Europe markets will be watching the tussle between Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the Italian prime minister, and the anti-corruption magistrates which last
week threatened to drive the lira below L1,000 against the D-Mark.

The gilts market enters this week in a more cheery mood than for some time.
Even after a setback on Friday afternoon, the benchmark 6 3/4 per cent 2004
issue ended the week yielding 8.19 per cent, against 8.47 per cent a week
earlier.
Good economic news had spurred the market, with figures on both average
earnings and retail prices showing little signs of the feared inflationary
pick-up.
This week sees the publication of several economic statistics which may give
a clue as to whether the rally can be sustained. June retail sales numbers
on Wednesday and a second-quarter gross domestic product estimate on Friday
may show that the economy is still growing strongly. If the market takes
such figures in its stride, this may show that investors are prepared to
accept the story of a robust economy without inflation.
The Bank's announcement on Friday that its next auction would be of
conventional stock maturing between 2007 and 2011 indicated that the
market's appetite for floating-rate stock and short-dated issues was
limited, according to Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi
International (Europe). The Bank had to fund at the longer end, in spite of
its dislike of the high yields prevailing. Full details of the issue will be
revealed tomorrow.

FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Signs of a return to fundamentals -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A more optimistic mood seems to have settled on the European government bond
markets in recent weeks. Yields on German bonds have fallen back by almost
0.5 percentage points from their peak of 7.3 per cent in June. Last week
alone, UK government bond prices rose by almost 3 per cent, despite a slight
setback on Friday.
Investors may have at last begun to realise that, judging by the economic
fundamentals, bonds are cheap and current bond yields attractive. Inflation
in Europe remains subdued, even in the UK, which is furthest down the road
to economic recovery.
'The fundamentals are at last beginning to exert themselves,' says Mr Nigel
Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi. 'At some stage the rally may
run into profit-taking, but reality does at last seem to be settling in.'
'This rally feels different,' says Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland
Global Markets. 'There is money coming in from the US and people are talking
in a different way than they did after earlier rises.'
For the first time in many months, there is talk of hedge funds coming back
into European markets, particularly the UK and Germany. It was these
highly-leveraged pools of speculative capital which abandoned bonds so
spectacularly at the beginning of the year and helped trigger the bear
market.
Institutional investors, it seems, sidelined for so long by uncertainty and
market volatility, are also being tempted back into bonds by high yields.
It is not surprising that the strongest performers in recent weeks - Italy,
Spain and the UK - are those markets that were hit the hardest by the
general bond price decline, for it is in these markets that the need for
correction is greatest.
Also in investors' minds may be the thought that the rise in long-term
interest rates caused by the increase in bond yields may slow the pace of
economic recovery, forcing a further downward revision to growth and
inflation forecasts and providing another spur to bonds.
Similarly, the recent strength of the D-Mark against the dollar implies a
tightening of monetary policy, further reinforcing the low inflation outlook
in Germany and in Europe generally. Many foreign investors have also been
attracted into Europe by the gains offered by holding bonds denominated in
currencies that are rising.
There was also obvious relief in bond markets when the US Federal Reserve
did not raise short-term interest rates in an attempt to support the ailing
dollar at its meeting on July 6 and following the G7 summit in Naples.
Another, simpler explanation of this month's rise may be that many
institutional investors sold loss-making bonds ahead of the end of the
second quarter, when they traditionally publish their financial reports, and
with that hurdle passed, they have returned to the market.
However, despite the recent gains, most activity is still confined to the
futures market and trading in the cash market remains thin, a sign that
confidence has still not fully recovered.
Furthermore, the economic fundamentals are not radically different from what
they were in the first part of this year, when forecasts of future inflation
were already very low. As a result, many commentators think this rally will
be short-lived.
'We cannot rule out the possibility that the rally will continue for a few
days yet, but in fact nothing has changed,' says Mr George Magnus,
international economist at SG Warburg.
'The Fed will still raise interest rates, the psychological impact of what
has been happening to currencies has gone now, and the problem of issuance
remains,' he says.
The rise in real yields has been blamed on the large supply of new bonds
issued by governments to fund their huge budget deficits.
Mr Magnus estimates that the G7 leading industrialised countries will issue
Dollars 102bn of gross government debt in the next four weeks. 'All we are
seeing is a technical bear market squeeze upwards,' he says.
As has been the case throughout this bear market, opinion is divided.
There may be a real test of market sentiment this week when the Bundesbank
comes to the market with an auction of 10-year bunds, after cancelling its
last two auctions due to lack of demand, and the Bank of England announces
details of its auction of conventional gilts, the first time it has dared to
tap the longer end of the yield curve for some time.

FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Small shadow over Pakistan offering -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan has just begun a new fiscal year, with the government of Ms Benazir
Bhutto, the prime minister, set to continue its efforts to improve the
country's macro-economic performance and the quality of its foreign exchange
reserves.
A policy of tight fiscal management has put much-needed brakes on excessive
government bank borrowing. The budgetary deficit has been reduced to less
than 6 per cent of GDP, down from almost 8 per cent, last year. Meanwhile,
official foreign exchange reserves have risen to over Dollars 2.1bn, through
a variety of short to medium-term borrowings. A year after last summer's
political and economic crisis, the country has recovered from its all-time
low reserves of below Dollars 300m.
The recovery of reserves has been helped by a three-year Dollars 1.36bn IMF
loan agreed earlier this year. Next year, it is planned to cut the budget
deficit to between 4 and 4.5 per cent of GDP, and to lower inflation from 10
to 7 per cent.
On the back of the past year's performance, the country is preparing to
float its first Eurobond offering of Dollars 200m within the next three to
four months, to convert some of its short-term borrowings into medium-term
liabilities. Many analysts look upon the offer as central to the efforts of
the government and the private sector to raise more funds on the
Euromarkets.
Recent rises in US interest rates followed by selling pressures on
international bond markets have cast at least a partial shadow over the
future of the offering but senior officials argue that it's impossible for
any country to synchronise its domestic conditions with international
circumstances.
'When you go to the Eurobond market, particularly when you are a new
entrant, you should enter from the point of view of what is the best timing
for you domestically, because internationally we do not have any control,'
said Mr Mohammad Yaqub, governor of the central bank - the State Bank of
Pakistan.
According to Mr Yaqub, the country's recent performance in economic
management, recovery of foreign exchange reserves and a perception from the
international community that it's moving in the right direction strengthen
its case. Other officials want to relieve growing budgetary pressures which
have continuously forced the country to seek large capital inflows to narrow
its current account balance of payments deficit.
Almost one-third of the annual budget goes towards servicing the Dollars
23bn official foreign debt and almost Rs900bn (Dollars 29.5bn ) in public
sector debt owed to local banks. Officials including Mr Yaqub are convinced
that a successful launch of the bond issue would help the country convert
some of its foreign exchange reserves, in the form of short-term borrowings,
into medium-term liabilities and provide the added cushion needed to further
improve macro-economic performance.
'Going to the Euromarket is of prime importance to Pakistan, not only for
the government but also for Pakistani companies,' says Mr Nasir Bukhari,
chief executive of Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, a brokerage house.
This year, Dewan Salman Fibre Company, a leading Pakistani group, for the
first time floated bonds worth Dollars 45m while at least another two are
preparing similar ventures.
Many businessmen complain about high domestic interest rates, running up to
19 per cent, and a credit squeeze on local banks, which have made it hard to
raise capital locally.
However, analysts like Mr Bukhari warn against the possibility of a weak
investor response, especially after recent events on the bond markets. He
wants the government to consider trimming the size of the offer and making
adequate arrangements for after-market support.
The success of the offer also depends on the government's ability to carry
on its economic policies in the coming year, which could be a difficult
task. This year's cotton crop has suffered badly, lowering the total output
to less than 8m bales from a target of 12m. Cotton is among the most
important factors affecting the economy, as it generates almost 60 per cent
of exports, directly or indirectly.
Some business leaders have also complained of a widening recession, which
they say has been caused by tight controls on government spending. As a
result, local industry has suffered from falling sales since the beginning
of the year.
In spite of such concerns, the government claims it is determined to stay on
course. However, for the past two years national growth figures have fallen
behind target due to the cotton losses, and predicting the future remains a
difficult task.

<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's policy-making council meets on Thursday, the last time
before the German central bank's summer recess. As is traditional, the
meeting is the occasion for the Bundesbank's mid-year review of the
development of M3 money supply - this year is especially important in view
of ballooning growth in M3 since late 1993.
A dilemma for the Bundesbank has been how to justify cutting interest rates
while tolerating monetary growth at more than double the 4 to 6 per cent
target range. The Bundesbank is likely to modify the target range on
Thursday, but there is little consensus among economists about how this may
be achieved.
Traders will be less interested in the technicalities than concrete signs
that the Bundesbank will be able to resume interest rate cuts in the autumn
without further damage to its credibility.
In this context a 'good' figure for June M3, likely to be released on
Thursday, would provide evidence that money growth is subsiding. Anything
under 12 per cent would be considered 'good' as it would mean a decline from
May's 13.4 per cent annualised, seasonally adjusted rate.
There is a chance that the Bundesbank will cut the discount rate on
Thursday, but this is highly unlikely.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of over-supply are expected to weigh on Japanese government bond
prices. In spite of underlying concern over fiscal expansion funded by
government bonds, corporate borrowers continue to tap into the straight bond
market for funds.
This week, Tokyo Electric Power, the leading electric utility, is expected
to launch a Y150bn domestic straight bond with a maturity of 20 years.
Meanwhile, the increase in foreign borrowers on the samurai market is also
causing anxiety among market participants. The Greek government last week
issued Y110bn in samurai bonds, and Greek Telecom is planning to offer its
first samurai issue next month.
Without a clear indication of the state of economic recovery, traders expect
the bond market to move within a narrow range this week. While the rise in
consumer spending, due to the hot summer weather, and income tax cuts and
supply worries continue to undermine confidence, the strong yen, the steady
buying of bonds by Japanese institutional investors and expectations of a
weak recovery are supporting the bond market.
Life and non-life insurance companies in June were net buyers of bonds for
the third consecutive month, and traders expect further buying by the
institutions if yields rise back to 4.5 per cent.

A year ago, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned Congress
in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that interest rates were probably too low,
and that it was likely the Fed would have to tighten monetary policy to
prevent inflationary pressures from building up.
On Wednesday, Mr Greenspan returns for another Humphrey-Hawkins session and
some analysts believe he may issue a similar warning about interest rates.
Although the Fed has raised interest rates four times in the past year, the
strength of the US economy continues to surprise observers, including those
at the central bank.
Consequently, trading on the bond market today and tomorrow should be
cautious, with most dealers and investors likely to stay on the sidelines
until Mr Greenspan heads for Capitol Hill.
Wednesday will be particularly tricky for the market, with two Treasury
auctions of two-year and five-year notes also scheduled. If they go poorly,
it will bode ill for the auctions of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds due
later in the refunding round.
If Mr Greenspan suggests on Wednesday that further rate rises are in the
pipeline, the ground earned last week could be quickly given up, sending the
30-year yield - currently at 7.5 per cent - back above 7.7 per cent again.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Markets: Aluminium plan under review - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium industry will be hoping that niggling doubts about Russia's
commitment to its output cutting programme can be removed at an
international meeting in Canberra, Australia, on Wednesday and Thursday.
Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union, Norway, Russia and the US
will be reviewing progress with the scheme they agreed in January to reduce
output by between 1.5m and 2m tonnes for two years so as to bring the market
back into balance after a period of soaring stocks.
Prices have risen strongly since then and stocks have begun to fall, but
there are worries that those very facts may weaken the resolve of some
companies to see the plan through.
Russia, in particular, is giving cause for concern as it is believed to be
well behind schedule with the second tranche of its promised cuts.
Further concern has been caused by the news that Russia is not sending to
this week's meeting the same senior negotiators who represented it at
earlier talks. It has been suggested that one is not coming because he has
been promoted. Other delegates will be hoping that is all there is to it.
There is some disappointment that big producers outside the group, like
those in Brazil, Venezuela and the Gulf states, have not emulated the cuts
and that it has not proved possible to induct them into the group because of
anti-trust worries.
Progress with the cuts is being monitored by the International Primary
Aluminium Institute, which is releasing June output figures for its members
on Wednesday.
Also on Wednesday, the US Department of Agriculture will be issuing its
latest agricultural outlook report, and in Denver the US Cattlemen's
Association will begin its three-day, mid-year conference.
On Tuesday the privatisation committee of Minero Peru, the state mining and
metals concern, is scheduled to announce the successful bidders for three
big gold concessions.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Markets: Elections set the tone - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next three months, political considerations will set the tone in
some of the biggest investment markets in the Americas. Leave aside, for the
moment, President Clinton's little local difficulties with healthcare reform
and mid-term elections: voters to the north and south will make their own
procession to the polls to make decisions with the potential for large
effects on markets.
It starts with presidential elections next month in Mexico, a country
stricken by political uncertainty for much of this year. It then shifts to
Canada at the end of September, the likely date for a regional vote which
once again raises the spectre of Quebec devolution.
It moves to Brazil in October, for the voters' verdict on the
administration's latest economic stabilisation plan.
To varying degrees, investors in each of these countries have demanded a
risk premium to maintain their involvement. And in each market, foreign
investors, normally a substantial part of the investment scene, have been
notable by their absence.
In Mexico and Canada, at least, a return of overseas capital seems likely
later this year.
The political risk premium implicit in Mexico and Brazil is probably
clearest in the valuation bases of their stock markets relative to other
Latin markets.
Half-way through this year, Mr Geoffrey Dennis at Bear Stearns estimated
that Mexican shares were on a multiple of 13.5 times this year's earnings,
with Brazil at 12.3 times. For 1995, this falls to 10.8 times projected
earnings for Mexico and 10.4 times for Brazil, about a point less that the
regional average.
For the Latin stock markets as a whole these sort of multiples make for a
better investment case than at the peak levels reached by the end of
January.
From there share prices fell on average by a third, courtesy of Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and then failed to sustain a
rebound in June, again echoing the pattern of US markets. Unless the US bond
market goes into another spasm this autumn, the stage seems set for a more
stable second half.
Mexico could soon be due for a respite from the political uncertainty which
has followed the Chiapas uprising and Colosio assasination.
The August 21 election will no doubt be a messy affair with perhaps the loss
by the ruling PRI party of its two-thirds majority in Congress. But the PRI
is expected to maintain its hold on the administration.
If the foreign capital flowing into Mexico picks up after the election, it
could help to bring its own reward. Renewed investment would take the
pressure off the peso, allowing interest rates to ease back and bolstering
economic growth, which in turn will support share prices.
The outcome of Brazil's autumn presidential elections seem far more open to
doubt, implying greater volatility in Brazilian financial markets over the
coming months. 'Volatile' and 'Brazil' are words which fit neatly together.
Shares soared 60 per cent early this year, fell almost as much, and then
rebounded further than most other Latin markets.
The latest Brazilian currency, the real, was introduced only on July 1, with
a commitment by the administration to put a sizeable chunk of the country's
foreign currency reserves to defending its parity with the dollar.
It is a giant game of poker. Will this anti-inflationary message produce the
desired effect? Or will the markets call the government's bluff?
The autumn election, the first round of which is on October 3, could hang on
the result. Holding the country's hyper-inflation in check would do wonders
for the political credibility of Mr Fernando Cardoso, the finance minister,
as consumers experienced the novelty of stable shop prices, well, stable
relative to past experience, at least.
Recent opinion poll advances by Mr Cardoso, from a very weak position, have
already put some zest in share prices. Whatever doubts hang over the
long-term picture, there seems plenty of room for a short-term rebound later
this year.
Mr Dennis predicts a return of the stock market index to 3,100 by the end of
the year, while Ms Tamzin Hobday at Barings is estimating a more modest
bounce to 2,900.
9% real yield?
Canada's own political uncertainty has contributed to a remarkable turn of
events in its financial markets. The possibility of a real yield of nearly 9
per cent on ten-year government bonds
The intimate connection between the future of Quebec and the country's
massive budget deficit explain this seemingly bizarre position.
The debt levels are the immediate cause of the market's concern. Taken
together, federal and state debts amount to more than 100 per cent of the
country's GDP. Higher interest rates have made the situation worse, adding
to financing costs and pushing the debt level higher.
Concern about Quebec has set a match to the concern. If the seperatists gain
power in September, they have promised a referendum on devolution within a
year. Who, then, would be liable for the federal debt?
This is not the first time the Quebec Question has led to a foreign investor
strike and thrown the Canadian markets into a tizzy. The reality, though,
may be less alarmist. Opinion polls suggest that a referendum would not
bring support for a free-standing Quebec. And even if it did, the Parti
Quebecois has expressed its willingness to take on a share of the federal
debt.
The realisation that there has been an over-reaction in the financial
markets has already driven a recovery in the bond market in the past
fortnight. The spread between ten-year US and Canadian bonds, which shot up
to more than 220 basis points towards the end of June, has since dropped
back to about 160. The steady flow of Canadian dollar eurobonds over the
past week testifies to the renewed interest of foreign investors.
With headline inflation at zero, though (and underlying inflation not much
over 1 per cent,) the real yield still looks remarkable. Assuming the
government does not reverse course and inflate its way out of its debt hole,
there are likely to be buying opportunities ahead.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Markets: Gas from greenhouses - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour standards, discussed here two weeks ago, are not the only contentious
issue foisted on the World Trade Organisation by pressure from industrial
countries, principally the US. The greening of trade is already on the
agenda, following the ministerial meeting in April.
The introduction of environmentalism into the trading system is a serious
worry: trade measures, however convenient, are never the first-best
instrument for achieving environmental objectives; the environmental cause
is exposed to capture by protectionist interests; and an escalation of trade
disputes in this area could undermine the multilateral trading system.
As explained by Daniel Esty of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, in an admirably balanced book, the environmentalist agenda for
trade is based on four concerns: that trade liberalisation causes economic
growth, which harms the environment; that countries with lax environmental
standards enjoy an unfair competitive advantage; that trade rules may
undermine, or override, domestic environmental regulations; and that GATT
limits the use of trade restrictions as a form of leverage upon the
recalcitrant. *
Where the production of goods - such as clean air - or of bads  - such as
species extinction - carries no price, growth may be harmful. Yet this has
little to do with trade as such. Economic growth is also often good for the
environment. The most important cause of deforestation is felling for
firewood, which occurs when people cannot afford commercial energy.
Similarly, the quality of water and urban air improves as countries become
richer. To the extent that higher incomes are environmentally damaging, the
advanced industrial countries pose the main problem. The chart shows that US
residents emit 16 times more carbon dioxide (the leading cause of the
greenhouse effect) per person than their counterparts in low-income
countries.
It is also wrong to assume that trade liberalisation damages the
environment. By pricing energy well below world prices, the rate at which
China emits carbon dioxide per unit of gross domestic product is 16 times
higher than Japan's. Kym Anderson, the Australian international economist,
points out that, in the case of agriculture, 'countries with relatively low
producer prices, such as Argentina, Australia and Thailand use less than one
twentieth the amounts of chemical fertiliser per cropped hectare that high
price countries such as Switzerland use.' **
Equally misplaced is worry about eco-dumping. There is no difference between
the competitive implications of divergent environmental standards and the
consequences of other legitimate policy differences between countries.
Drawing on a study of seven advanced economies, Piritta Sorsa of the World
Bank also argues that the industries that spent most on pollution control
maintained their international competitiveness between 1970 and 1990. ***
Since rich countries have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive
process industries, this is unsurprising.
Optimal environmental regulations depend on resources, geography, wealth and
tastes, all of which diverge among countries. Moreover, a country as a whole
cannot be put at a competitive disadvantage, only specific industries.
Environmentalists presumably wish to see these polluting domestic industries
shrink. They also argue that opposition to higher standards, induced by fear
of foreign competition, is a political obstacle to the domestic regulations
they desire. Why must Mexico adopt standards it does not want, merely to
make it easier for environmentalists to obtain the acquiescence of US
industrialists?
The argument that trade rules and trade liberalisation may undermine
domestic environmental regulations is almost equally misplaced. Where an
international objective, such as preservation of the ozone layer, is
desired, the best course is global agreement. It is also questionable
whether countries should be allowed to restrict imports merely because they
are produced in ways deemed unacceptable. It is difficult to think of a way
to contain the cross-border assertion of divergent priorities. Dolphins are
valued in the US. How would the US feel if India were to argue for respect
for cows?
GATT does restrict use of trade restrictions as a lever. Where there is no
international environmental overspill, the issue is dumping. Where there is
such overspill, it is whether trade policy is the best instrument to bring
about change. It will not work with big and powerful countries. Trade
restrictions also impose costs on those who use them and risk cycles of
retaliation. The right policy must be compensation. At present, for example,
countries with forests are exporting the service of carbon dioxide
reduction. Because they are not recompensed, there is inadequate incentive
to continue.
Rich countries are telling people in poor countries to stop cutting down the
trees that absorb carbon dioxide they emit; to protect animals they think
valuable; and to stop production they condemn as polluting. People living in
greenhouses should stop emitting hypocritical gas.

FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Full branch in Beirut for ING
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Internationale Nederlanden Bank (ING), based in Amsterdam, has won
authorisation from Lebanon's central bank to establish a full branch in
Beirut - the first such approval granted in 25 years and a sign of Lebanon's
desire to revive the country's lost role as a banking and financial centre.
ING promises to be only the first of several new international arrivals in
Beirut, with a number of French and British groups also pursuing licences to
open either representative offices or branches in Lebanon.
Mr Riad Salame, the central bank governor, described the decision to accord
authorisation to ING as a 'major change in our policy'.
Foreign banks were previously told they must buy a local institution to
participate fully in the domestic market. But in a drive to attract new
foreign institutions, the central bank is now permitting banks to open a
branch in the country, provided they meet a capital requirement of Dollars
5m and re-invest 30 per cent of locally-collected deposits domestically.
Foreign newcomers will be restricted to a single branch, but otherwise will
have no conditions on their operations.
ING's authorisation is the first granted since well before Lebanon's
crippling 17-year civil war and was made despite strong opposition from its
50 domestic commercial banks, which believe they should be given time to
recover from the war's ravages before new entrants are allowed into the
local market.
ING Bank will join 15 or so foreign banks long established in Beirut,
including Citibank, American Express Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank.
A spokesman for ING in Amsterdam said he expected the branch to begin
operations within a couple of months. It will become ING's sole Middle East
branch and would concentrate on international payment transfers, corporate
banking and trade finance, the spokesman said.
Lebanon's central bank this week also authorised UBAF, the London-based
group owned by Arab and French banks, to set up a representative office in
Beirut.
In addition, Banque Paribas, the French merchant bank, has submitted a
request to open a branch of its London-based Paribas Capital Markets unit in
Beirut, which the bank says will seek a seat on Lebanon's renascent stock
market.
This is presently limited to trading in Treasury bills and shares of
Solidere, the property development company created to rebuild central Beirut
 -itself part of the government's ambitious plan to regenerate Lebanon as a
financial centre.
Robert Fleming, the British investment bank, is also applying for a licence
to open a Beirut representative office.
The bank says it is looking to establish a regional base in Lebanon
eventually to serve also Jordan and Syria, but with a more immediate eye on
the development of Lebanon's stock market, the creation of local mutual
funds and corporate finance.
Robert Fleming says that it hopes a Beirut operation would complement its
10-year-old branch in Bahrain, which the bank says is the sole British
merchant banking branch in the Gulf.

FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hyundai plans Won600bn
investment in steel plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, is planning to enter the steel
sector with the construction of a plant by 1997.
The project, however, is being opposed by the government, which fears it
would cause a glut in steel supplies and threaten the profitability of
state-owned Pohang Iron &amp; Steel, the country's dominant steel producer and
the world's most profitable steel company.
Hyundai Pipe said it planned to invest Won600bn (Dollars 743m) in a steel
plant to produce 1.3m tonnes of cold-rolled coils annually for Hyundai car,
shipbuilding and transport equipment subsidiaries.
Production of the plant, which will be built in either Ulsan or Pusan in
south-eastern Korea, will be later expanded to 2.3m tonnes.
Hyundai plans to purchase production facilities from Japan or Germany, with
plant construction to begin in 1996.
The government believes the announcement is only the first stage of a bigger
Hyundai project to build facilities that could produce 10m tonnes of steel,
resulting in an oversupply.
The ministry of trade, industry and energy says Korea will suffer a steel
demand shortfall of 1.5m tonnes by the year 2001, which could easily be
covered by imports.
But Hyundai says the government has underestimated domestic demand for
steel. It predicts that the growth of the manufacturing and chemical
industries and increased use of steel for the construction of buildings and
bridges will increase steel demand. Any excess steel supplies could be sold
to China, it adds.
The government may try to block Hyundai's steel project by denying a land
acquisition licence for the steel plant and barring the import of steel
production facilities. It may also rule against Hyundai on environmental
grounds. Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate, has acquired control of
Korea Fertilizer, the state-controlled fertiliser and specialty chemicals
company, in one of the country's biggest privatisation sales.
Samsung bid Won230bn, almost twice the expected auction price, to increase
its stake in Korea Fertilizer to 67 per cent from 32.4 per cent by acquiring
the shareholding of state-owned Korea Development Bank.
Samsung retained a minority stake in the company after being forced to give
up management control of Korea Fertilizer to the then military government in
1967. Korea Fertilizer reported net profits of Won5bn on sales of Won211.6bn
last year.
Samsung said it hoped to increase the company's turnover to Won1,200bn by
2000 by expanding its specialty chemicals business through a Won1,000bn
investment programme.

<TEXT>
Bayerische Landesbank, the Munich-based regional bank, is paying Ft5.8bn
(Dollars 56m) for a stake in Kulkereskedelmi Bank, Hungary's fourth largest
bank.
BLB is taking a 25 per cent stake with the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development taking a further 17 per cent.
The Munich bank is the first western bank after the Dutch ING to take part
in a significant east European bank privatisation. ING took a stake in Bank
Slaski in Poland but most international banks prefer stand-alone branches in
the former communist bloc.
The acquisition of a Hungarian bank accords with BLB's drive to expand in
central Europe. In the past two months, it has emerged that BLB is forming a
joint-venture building society in the Czech Republic, taking a stake in a
savings bank in Bolzano in northern Italy and exploring an investment in
Austria's troubled GiroCredit.
JP Morgan, the US investment bank, acted as adviser to the Hungarian
government and Kulkereskedelmi Bank.

<TEXT>
The combined net profits of South Korea's 24 commercial banks rose by 16.4
per cent to Won533bn (Dollars 660m) during the first half of 1994, according
to the Office of Bank Supervision.
The advance in profits was mainly due to the sale of securities, but a 123
per cent increase in bad loan provisions to Won1,483.5bn limited the rise.
Cho Hung Bank reported the largest net profits, with an increase of 150 per
cent to Won120.9bn.
Korea First Bank, which has recorded the biggest bank profits for the past
three years, had net earnings of Won82bn, a rise of only 1.4 per cent.
The Bank of Seoul had the sharpest rise in earnings, to Won24.7bn from
Won600m, following the sale of its securities subsidiary.
Commercial Bank of Korea, which also sold its securities operations,
recorded a 59.6 per cent earnings increase to Won15.8bn.
Hanil Bank reported a 8.3 per cent increase in net profits to Won69.3bn, and
Korea Exchange Bank achieved a 64.3 advance in earnings to Won68.2bn.
Among the smaller national banks, Shinhan, which has the banking industry's
largest profit margins, reported a 28.7 per cent growth in net profits to
Won70.4bn.
Donghwa Bank suffered a 71 per cent downturn in net profits to Won2.9bn,
while earnings for Boram Bank also showed a decline, by 21.3 per cent to
Won8.5bn.
Dongnam Bank reported a loss of Won94bn, and Daedong Bank had a deficit of
Won58bn.

concern

<TEXT>
Fewer than half of the companies listed on China's nascent stock exchanges
are said to have presented acceptable annual reports for 1993, with some
submitting inaccurate accounts to regulators, Reuter reports from Beijing.
A spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission said only 75 of
169 reports received from listed companies met the commission's standards.
Even though the deadline for submitting 1993 accounts was June 30 this year,
14 companies still have not done so and risk punishment, China's official
Xinhua news agency reported.
The commission warned that companies submitting false accounts could be
suspended from doing business.
Many foreign investors eager to take part in China's economic boom by buying
into listed companies are worried about lax accounting standards that make
it difficult to evaluate properly an enterprise's profitability.
The commission's report on the companies' annual accounts appeared to bear
out the worries. Some of the companies failed to account for funds raised
through their public offering, Xinhua said.
'Some public companies' reports lacked important information such as the
operation of their capital,' the China Daily newspaper said in a weekend
report.
Some reports gave no explanation of big gaps between their profit forecast
and actual business performance.
'A limited number of companies gave inaccurate statements in their reports,'
the newspaper said. 'Some changed their profit forecasts, while others gave
deceitful financial indices.'
Boards of directors of companies with suspect reports must provide answers

The 14 companies who failed to present reports at all must make public
self-criticisms, and may be punished further if they still do not submit

FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canadian wheat pool to go public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the biggest of Canada's prairie farm
co-operatives, is to convert to a listed public company.
The Pool, with 1993 revenues of CDollars 1.62bn (USDollars 1.18bn), plans a
share offering early next year and will be listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.
Its 60,000 members will initially convert their equity into shares, some of
which may be offered to the public. However, farmer-members will continue to
control the pool by being the sole holders of class A voting shares. No
single shareholder will be allowed to own more than 10 per cent of class B
non-voting shares.
The Pool was formed in 1924 to handle Saskatchewan's grain crop. But about
40 per cent of last year's CDollars 28.5m profit came from non-grain
businesses. The Pool's recent diversifications have included natural
cosmetics (with a sizeable export market in Japan), pie fillings and a
food-preserving process.
The move to go public has been a controversial one. Critics have noted that
the Pool was formed to make farmers more independent of commercial grain
companies.
But members have recently been swayed by arguments that the Pool needs to
strengthen its resources to respond to far-reaching structural changes in
North American agribusiness. For example, the North American free trade
agreement and the Uruguay Round are expected to open the Canadian grain
market to competitors.
Almost half the Pool's members are over 55 years old and are expected to
withdraw their equity as they retire over the next 10 to 15 years.

FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons sells subsidiary to managers for
Pounds 4.56m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopkinsons, the industrial abrasives and engineering group which in April
reported a 69 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, has sold its
England-Worthside drinks equipment subsidiary in a Pounds 4.56m management
buy-out.
The purchasers are Mr Trevor Hicks and Mr Tony Clarkson, managing and sales
directors of England-Worthside, operating as Closerate, a company in which
they together have a majority interest.
The consideration is payable in cash. Closerate will also assume
responsibility for any bank overdrafts of England-Worthside. Inter-company
indebtedness of Pounds 432,000 will be repaid on completion.
The buy-out is backed by 3i, the investment capital group. The managers have
raised Pounds 6m for the buy-out and to meet on-going funding requirements.
England-Worthside makes hand pull beer pumps and distributes drinks
dispensing equipment. It produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 858,000 in
1993, on turnover of Pounds 5.17m.
The disposal is being made to allow Hopkinsons to concentrate on its
abrasives, engineering, plastic injection moulding and drainage businesses.

FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Competition may hit Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the main rival to British Telecommunications, is being 'squeezed
from all sides' and is set for only modest growth in the next few years,
according to a broker's survey of 100 large business users.
The survey, by James Capel, finds that after six years of rapid growth at
the expense of BT in the large corporate sector, Mercury has now reached a
plateau in terms of the spending intentions of companies.
The 100 companies, representing about 10 per cent of the large corporate
market by value, are at the heart of Mercury's existing bus iness.
Their average telecoms spending is projected at more than Pounds 3m this
year, with Mercury expected to take a 22 per cent share, far ahead of the 13
per cent it is estimated to have of the total UK telecoms market.
The companies surveyed were strongly attracted to new telecoms operators
such as Worldcom, MFS and Sprint, licensed since the abolition of the
BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, which are focusing on the large business sector.
A year ago, only 14 per cent of the companies used telecoms carriers other
than BT and Mercury. This year 28 per cent do so, with a further 18 per cent
claiming to be very or quite likely to use another carrier.
Nearly 80 per cent of the companies claimed to be Mercury users, Mercury's
highest rate to date, with another 10 per likely to subscribe.
But four in five existing users said they used Mercury mainly for cost
savings, against only 10 per cent naming quality, suggesting that its market
is highly vulnerable to competition.
'Competition is squeezing Mercury from all sides', said Mr Martin Mabbutt,
telecoms analyst at James Capel. 'The growth of new operators in the
business sectors is eroding margins in its areas of historic strength.'
He added: 'Over the next few years the company seems set to pay the price
for a low level of penetration of the residential market.'
In spite of rapid progress in the past year, Mercury has only about 1m
residential customers, against BT's 20m.
A large proportion of these users are connected through local cable
operators, many of whom are prepared to switch their long-distance traffic
to other carriers if they can get a better price.
Mercury has responded with initiatives to improve its network quality and
its access to residential customers.
A Pounds 200m upgrading of its national network is under way, and it is
experimenting with radio technology as a means of by-passing BT and cable
operators at the local level.
However, some analysts see other recent moves as evidence of its
predicament.
It is engaged in an acrimonious battle with Oftel, the industry regulator,
to secure a more favourable regulatory regime.
It also began negotiations with AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, for an
alliance, but drew back at a late stage.

FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BET settles pay-off for director at Pounds
450,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Mackenzie, who on Friday left his post as finance director of BET, is
to receive a pay-off of about Pounds 450,000, according to sources in the
business services group.
The settlement, which is substantially higher than earlier reports, could
anger institutional investors who are beginning to take a tough stance on
large pay-outs to directors.
Insiders say the size of the pay-off was due mainly to the three-year
rolling service contract which Mr Mackenzie signed in November 1991. It
guaranteed him three years' notice from BET.
Mr Mackenzie's basic annual pay was increased to Pounds 222,000 this year,
theoretically entitling him to a Pounds 666,000 pay-off. However, he appears
to have settled for a package equivalent to two years' basic salary. BET
says it will disclose the exact amount in next year's annual report.
The development follows BET's decision to appoint Mr Keith Payne, who joined
the main board last year as director of strategic planning, to the post of
director of finance, planning and development.
Mr Mackenzie said on Friday that his resignation was 'mutually agreed' with
BET. He wanted 'to explore other opportunities' but would be staying on as a
consultant to BET until December.
Last month Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive, in an attempt
to reduce pay-outs to directors, announced a policy of voting against the
re-election of directors with rolling contracts longer than two years.
Two BET directors have three-year rolling service contracts - Mr John Clark,
chief executive, and Mr John Allan, marketing director, who earns a basic
salary of Pounds 178,500. Mr Payne has a two-year rolling contract and basic
salary of Pounds 184,000.
Mr Clark's basic salary is Pounds 396,000. He also has the potential to earn
a bonus of up to Pounds 237,600 through a management incentive plan.

FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Difficulties of buy-outs at recs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity companies would make suitable candidates for leveraged
buy-outs, though there would be political and regulatory risks, according to
analysts at Hoare Govett, writes David Lascelles.
In a report on the prospects for LBOs at the privatised electricity
companies, the analysts say they enjoy monopoly profits on their
distribution businesses and strong cash flow, which would support buy-outs.
The expiry of the government's golden shares next March will also aid
increased corporate activity by the recs.
But they also question whether investment banks would be willing to arrange
an LBO for a regulated utility which was heavily dependent upon regulatory
decisions, and might become prone to political decisions as the next
election approaches.
In addition, the recs' shareholding in the National Grid Company would have
to be unscrambled before any LBOs could take place.
The analysts conclude: 'Despite their strong financial attractions, we
question whether recs will become the subject of LBOs.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Italian trust launch postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carnegie International, the securities firm, has postponed the launch of the
Italian Renaissance Investment Trust, despite raising more than the minimum
fund size of Pounds 20m.
The trust, to be managed by Fondigest, the Italian mutual fund manager,
would have been the UK's first single-country investment trust specialising
in Italy.
Carnegie said that the placing had raised Pounds 25m. The offer had been
capped at Pounds 100m, but it was realistically expecting to raise between
Pounds 35m and Pounds 50m in all.
It cited 'adverse market conditions' as the main reason for postponing the
launch. But the trust's directors 'were especially concerned that the
initial price at which the new shares would trade would not fairly reflect
the prospects for Italian medium and smaller sized companies', in which the
trust was to have specialised.
Records were set earlier this year for the amount of money raised by new
investment trust issues, but markets have been more nervous since the first
rise in US interest rates in February. The average discount to net asset
value hit its narrowest point in January, but has since widened.
In May, Murray Johnstone, the UK fund management company, postponed the
launch of a UK smaller company investment trust because of doubts over the
level of investor demand.
However, Schroder's new Japanese investment trust was oversubscribed earlier
this month.
Carnegie said that 'provided that interest in investment trust new issues
recovers' the trust would be launched in the autumn.

FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Profits of more than Pounds 1bn seen for
Lloyd's in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London can expect to make comfortable profits in 1993 and for the
next three years and investors should buy shares in a number of the listed
Lloyd's investment trusts formed last year, a securities firm argues.
Mr Nick Bunker, analyst with Hoare Govett UK Investment Research, predicts
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.02bn in 1993. However, the figure will be
reduced by additional provisions for past losses, stemming mainly from US
asbestosis and pollution related claims.
Mr Bunker expects 'headline' pre-tax profits to decline thereafter, to
Pounds 810m in 1994, Pounds 739m in 1995 and Pounds 155m in 1996, thanks to
a number of factors including the Los Angeles earthquake in January this
year, losses from which are expected to cost Lloyd's Dollars 700m (Pounds
460m).
In addition, losses from shipping and aviation are expected to rise, while
premium rate competition will intensify.
The forecasts, the first medium term assessment of the market's prospects,
were calculated on the basis of eight computer models.
The research stresses 'these forecasts have been struck conservatively, on
the basis of assumptions which are set out explicitly and in full'. In
particular Hoare Govett does not expect any upturn in rates for US casualty
business.
The relatively upbeat forecast follows five years of record breaking losses.
Most recently Lloyd's announced a deficit of Pounds 2.1bn for the 1991
underwriting year, bringing its total losses since 1988 to more than Pounds
7bn.
Losses are also expected for the 1992 underwriting year, when results are
reported next year.
Hoare Govett says that in some sectors of the market, notably in marine
business, returns will be very high by historic standards, and that
therefore, 'signs of rate reductions in some areas this year should not be
surprising or necessarily worrying'.
The forecasts assume that Lloyd's can finance the creation of NewCo, the
reinsurance company into which it aims to transfer all liabilities stemming
from 1986 and earlier.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong-based Far East Consortium International is set to gain a
control of Beverley Group, the engineering concern previously known as
Petrocon, in a deal that will give it a stake of more than 70 per cent in
Beverley.
FEC is to sell its Vicco Development subsidiary to Beverley for about Pounds
9m to be satisfied by the issue of new shares. The Takeover Panel has waived
the requirement for FEC to make a full offer
Vicco's principle asset is a 51 per cent holding in Guangzhou Pegasus, a
company based in China which is engaged in the design, manufacture and
marketing of boilers for the Chinese market.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman of Beverley, acknowledged that FEC was to gain
control of the company but said its present management would remain in
place. 'This gives us an enormous opportunity for entry into the Chinese
market.'
News of the takeover came as the group's report and accounts for the year to
December 1993 were qualified by itsauditors before being posted to
shareholders at the weekend.
Solomon Hare, the auditors, said the group had been 'unable to provide
confirmation that it will have sufficient facilities to cover future working
capital'. However, Mr Robinson said, the deal with FEC would 'sort that
out'.
Beverley last month reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.67m.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Comapany News (This Week): Superstar Tagamet will be a hard
act to follow - Smithkline Beecham/Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's biggest drugs groups report this week. Tomorrow, SmithKline
Beecham announces results to June 30. Analysts expect pre-tax profits for
the second quarter at between Pounds 272m and Pounds 282m (against Pounds
257m before exceptionals).
Most attention will be given to the plight of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug
which was formerly the group's biggest product and whose US patents expired
on May 17. Analysts will be looking for any comments about the speed of
Tagamet's decline. The progress of newer products, such as Paxil, an
anti-depressant, will also be scrutinised.
Questions will also be asked of Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive, about the
problems at the clinical laboratories businesses in the US, which have
traditionally been profitable, but have run into difficulties with the more
cost-conscious healthcare environment.
On Thursday, Wellcome reports four- month figures to June 30. The company is
changing its year end from August to December. Analysts will therefore focus
on underlying sales growth.
Last year, such growth was disappointing, including sales of Zovirax,
Wellcome's biggest product. The slowdown in Japan should have ended after
the withdrawal of a Japanese competitor, and the destocking that affected
sales in the US should have worked its way out. Expectations for Zovirax are
for a 10 per cent rise.
Analysts also expect the sales decline in Retrovir, the HIV and Aids
treatment, to start bottoming out. The effects of the Concord trial, which
questioned the drug's effectiveness in HIV-positive patients without
symptoms, should be wearing off. There should be some compensating growth
among symptomatic patients and in combination therapies with other products.

<TEXT>
International banks and commodity exchanges have launched a concerted effort
to persuade big petroleum producing countries to use futures contracts and
forward sales of oil to hedge against sharp falls in oil revenues.
A number of separate approaches are being made to producers, with members of
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries at the top of the target
list.
The International Petroleum Exchange in London says it has been encouraged
by recent contacts with Opec members. Mr Peter Wildblood, chief executive,
says 'producing countries want to understand better how the market can be
used.'
Although no Opec member has so far committed itself to a hedging programme,
Mr Wildblood believes it will only be a matter of time before one does.
The IPE is stressing to producers that use of the futures' markets can give
them better control over their national budgets in a period of oil price
volatility.
It cites the example of Mexico, a non-Opec exporter which initiated a
hedging programme in 1990-91. It cost about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) to
implement but saved the country about Dollars 800m when world oil prices
fell.
Many Opec members have had to make sharp budget cuts over the past 18
months, as prices fell from around Dollars 20 a barrel at the start of 1993
to a low of about Dollars 13 last February.
They have since rallied to around Dollars 18 a barrel, but cumulative Opec
revenues in May, for example, were still more than Dollars 10.5bn, or 19 per
cent lower than cumulative reviews a year earlier, according to the
International Petroleum Finance Company in Washington.
Mr Wildblood concedes that officials in some Opec states still view futures
markets as centres of speculation and 'the work of the devil'. But he
counters that 80 per cent of the IPE volume is accounted for by oil
companies and other industry-related institutions. 'There is very little
speculative interest.'
Another scheme which is being promoted in Opec capitals is based on the
present sale for cash of oil for future delivery.
Mr Ibrahim Kamel, an Egyptian banker and politician who heads the
Jersey-based Petroleum Securities Corporation, said forward sales would be
packaged as a negotiable security known as a petroleum delivery certificate
that would carry a fixed return. He said the cash raised by such sales, in
the range of Dollars 500m to Dollars 2bn, would fund energy infrastructure
projects in the selling country. Another national petroleum company would
act as a delivery guarantor.
Investment bank Morgan Grenfell and Nomura, the Japanese securities house,
are understood to be considering participating in the programme.
Those advocating Opec's use of futures markets or forward sales claim they
would have little impact on long-term prices.
Officials at Opec's headquarters in Vienna confirm that they are making a
detailed study of the oil futures' markets. But they say the exercise is to
evaluate the impact of the futures markets on real prices, and not to
prepare Opec producers for using them.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Directors quit Standard after bribe inquiry

Two directors of Standard Chartered's bullion arm, Mocatta, one in London
and one in Hong Kong, resigned after taking responsibility for the
corruption to hit the bank, it emerged yesterday.
This followed an investigation into bribes paid by Mocatta employees in
exchange for business from junior civil servants at the central banks of
both the Philippines and Malaysia.
It is a further embarrassment for Standard Chartered, which has built up a
reputation for being accident prone. It recently announced the resignation
of the managing director of its Hong Kong stockbroking arm, which was found
guilty of illegal share support schemes.
Standard Chartered said the bribes took place last year, and appropriate
action had been taken. A spokesman said: 'We have properly reported our
investigation to regulatory authorities, wherever appropriate.'
This included Standard Chartered's primary regulator, the Bank of England,
Hong Kong's Monetary Authority, and also Bank Negara, Malaysia's central
bank, and the authorities in Manila.
A Standard Chartered official said these authorities appeared satisfied with
the bank's investigation into the bribery allegations, and it was understood
that no further action was likely. The Bank of England launches
investigations only where there is a serious and immediate risk to
depositors. 'We regard the matter as closed,' the official said.
The revelations come at a sensitive time for Anglo-Malaysian relations,
which were rocked by more allegations that Wimpey offered bribes to senior
Malaysian politicians, in exchange for contracts. A ban on handing out
Malaysian government contracts to UK companies still stands.
The Malaysian link is also sensitive for Standard Chartered, since it has a
substantial presence there, with 35 bank branches. Its south-east Asian
operations (excluding Hong Kong), which are primarily focused on Singapore
and Malaysia, made profits before bad debt provisions, of Pounds 166m last
year. It has three offices in the Philippines.
It is understood that the sums involved at Mocatta were relatively small.
'No one is living an extravagant lifestyle as a result,' a Standard
Chartered executive said, indicating that the bribes involved a few thousand
pounds.
He added that the offering of small bribes was regarded as normal business
practice in Malaysia and the Philippines. However, Standard Chartered had
ensured that this attitude should not apply to its own operations.

FT  18 JUL 94 / A struggle to stay on track: Alcatel's chairman is
optimistic in spite of a legal investigation and difficult European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By JOHN RIDDING and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are critical times for Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom,
who has built his telecoms, transport and engineering group into one of
France's largest industrial concerns.
Earlier this month, the Alcatel chief was placed under investigation
concerning allegations of fraud relating to payments for work at his Paris
properties. Before that, Mr Suard found himself in the unfamiliar position
of issuing a profits warning. In January, he forecast that Alcatel's net
profits would shrink by between 10 and 20 per cent this year, the first
decline since 1987 when the company's rapid expansion was launched with the
acquisition of the European telecoms equipment operations of ITT of the US.
The purchase of Fiat's telecoms operations, aggressive exports, and a joint
venture with GEC of the UK, which manufactures the high-speed Train a Grande
Vitesse, have since fuelled the company's growth.
Has Alcatel been derailed by this year's events?
Sitting in the company's smart Paris headquarters, Mr Suard is unruffled. 'I
feel calm and confident,' he says, referring to the investigation. As for
business: '1994 is a difficult year . . . but I am more optimistic than I
was in January,' he says, citing the success of the group's technical
programmes and the economic recovery in some of its markets. Most industry
analysts concur, predicting a return to profits growth in 1995.
Mr Suard is aggrieved by the legal wrangles, which included more than 12
hours of interrogation on July 4, before the announcement of a formal
investigation. 'I feel the events are a profound injustice,' he says, firmly
denying allegations that he underpaid company suppliers for building work
worth about FFr440,000 (Pounds 52,900) at his former Paris residence. He
says that the FFr300,000 worth of security work done at his home, also under
investigation, was approved by Alcatel's board following express
instructions from the government to tighten security after the 1986
assassination of Mr Georges Besse, then head of Renault.
Mr Suard claims there have been irregularities in the conduct of his
investigation. 'Some portions of the file under the control of the
investigating judge appeared in the press on Wednesday (July 6), which is
very improper and against the law.' A stock exchange inquiry, demanded by Mr
Suard, is examining the way that news of his detention was released. Shares
fell by 8.3 per cent after his detention was revealed, although the losses
have since been recouped.
The Alcatel chairman says that the investigation has not unduly disrupted
his management. More serious, he believes, is the impact of the affair on
the image of the group as it battles for overseas contracts.
This is of particular concern as the company struggles to adjust to a fall
in earnings and a deterioration in some markets - particularly for
telecommunications equipment, its largest sector.
'Alcatel, like other telecoms equipment groups, is confronted by the fact
that traditional digital switching systems and transmission markets have
shrunk in absolute terms and more in margin terms,' says Mr Evan Miller,
European telecoms analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Alcatel has not been a laggard in new markets, either in terms of geography
or technology. According to Dataquest, it vies with Nokia and Motorola for
second place in the European infrastructure market for new mobile phone
networks built to the international GSM standard. Alcatel established itself
in China, the world's fastest-growing telecoms market, before many of its
competitors, and this year expects to sell China 7m lines of switching
equipment - more than for the whole of Europe.
The company has also made notable acquisitions in Europe and the US. Three
years ago it acquired the transmission division of Rockwell of the US, and
claims now to be the second-largest supplier of telecoms cables in the US.
The groups's undersea cables division has been boosted by last year's
acquisition of STC, the UK-based submarines cables division of Northern
Telecom of Canada.
'We are maintaining our research and development effort to be competitive in
tomorrow's products,' says Mr Francois de Laarge de Meux, chief operating
officer. He cites the companies leading-edge technology in land and
submarine fibre-optic cables, in SDH - the next generation of line
transmission technology - and in broadband telecoms switches. The big
pay-off, claims Mr Suard, will come with the development of multimedia
networks and fibre-optic superhighways. 'We have been preparing for several
years, for example in the areas of broadband transmission. It is at the
centre of our strategy.'
However, weaknesses are also evident, even in leading-edge markets. In the
cellular infrastructure market, Alcatel is not only behind Ericsson, the
Swedish supplier, but is regarded by many analysts and operators as inferior
to Nokia, the fast-growing Finnish company, in terms of products and
customer-responsiveness.
In its traditional switching and transmission markets, its prime weaknesses
have been in Italy, Spain and, in particular, Germany. Mr Jozef Cornu,
Alcatel's technical director, accepts that the German operations will suffer
a loss in 1994, although he believes a return to profit can be achieved in
1995.
'There has been a radical change in the German market,' says Mr Cornu.
Demand has contracted, with investment in eastern Germany no longer
offsetting the downturn in the western regions. Another aspect of the
malaise, says Mr Cornu, is a policy shift by Deutsche Telekom, the German
state telecoms operator, in the direction of international specifications
and tenders for its supplies, leading to increased competition and reduced
prices.
Alcatel has responded with a series of restructuring efforts, including the
closure of a plant in Stuttgart. But even if cable demand picks up on the
back of 'superhighways', the more open procurement policies which are
costing Alcatel dearly in Germany can only extend further to the company's
disadvantage. Deutsche Telekom is about to be privatised; France Telecom and
other European operators are bound to follow. In every case, cosy
relationships will break down - and the main losers are likely to be
established suppliers such as Alcatel and Siemens of Germany.
Much rests on Alcatel's ability to build the superhighways and supply the
other artefacts - from advanced switches to mass mobile phones - which will
be integral to 21st century communications.
Can they do it? 'In terms of product lines, they are second to none,' says
Mr Miller of Lehman. 'Their frustration is that it isn't happening yet.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Signs of recovery in trading
revenues - US banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With net interest margins largely unchanged, this week's second-quarter
figures from leading US money centre banks will turn in large part on how
well they have coped with trading in unsettled foreign exchange and fixed
income markets. Trading revenues are generally expected to recover from the
poor first quarter, but lag average 1993 quarterly income by some 25 per
cent.
The greatest year-on-year earnings advances are likely to come from banks
that have continued to recover from past credit problems. Most analysts
forecast earnings per share for Citicorp at around Dollars 1.22 (up from 82
cents) and BankAmerica at Dollars 1.31 (Dollars 1.19) - the latter an
indication that the Californian economy has finally begun a recovery from
its three-and-a-half-year recession.
Regional banks, meanwhile, should see stronger earnings growth as a group
despite higher US interest rates.
If rising interest rates have an effect, it is likely to be on the earnings
of banks that have used interest rate swaps to boost their margins in the
past. Foremost of these is BancOne, which in recent periods has boasted a
net interest margin of more than 6 per cent but is expected to see this fall
fast (in part due to falling margins on credit cards). BancOne's
second-quarter earnings per share are expected to be level with the previous
quarter and a year before, at 81 cents.

The paper, packaging and office supplies group is expected to report a

Although first-half profits were down, analysts forecast the full-year
pre-tax figure will have risen from Pounds 27.1m to between Pounds 33m and
Pounds 35m, helped by improving demand and price increases. But earnings per
share will show little change, reflecting the Pounds 90m issue last year to

FT  18 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Cost-cutting may give oil majors
an edge - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the US majors report second-quarter figures (Amoco and Texaco are
expected at the end of this week, with Exxon and Chevron shortly after), it
will be against a markedly different backdrop from three months before. Oil
prices have jumped, though perhaps too late in the period to have a great
effect, gas prices have slid, and refining margins have tumbled.
What earnings gains emerge will largely come from cost-cutting. Paul Ting,
an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, forecasts earnings per share declines
particularly at Exxon (69 cents compared with 87 cents in the previous
quarter), Texaco (60 cents, down from 69 cents) and Chevron (falling to 50
cents from 65 cents, due to poor refining margins in the US). Better news,
he says, will come from cost-cutting or restructuring at Amoco (up from 74
cents in the first quarter of the year, to 79 cents) and Mobil (at Dollars
1.25 a share, a little weaker than the Dollars 1.31 of the first period).

FT  18 JUL 94 / Asthma epidemic sparks government inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to launch an inquiry into last month's unprecedented
outbreak of asthma attacks, it said yesterday.
Department of Health officials will this week begin writing to all health
authorities in England requesting information on patients who suffered acute
asthma attacks on June 24 following violent thunderstorms.
The move follows reports by hospitals, particularly in London and the
south-east, of large numbers of people attending accident and emergency
units in the 12-hour period after the storms.
More than 3m people in the UK have asthma, including one in every seven
children, and 2,000 die from it each year.
Hospitals expect on average to treat between two and eight asthma-attack
victims a day. However, following the thunderstorms several reported that up
to 100 people had come in for treatment.
Experts believe these victims could represent just a small percentage of the
number affected.
Dr Martyn Partridge, chief medical adviser to the National Asthma Campaign
and consultant at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, where more than 50 people
sought treatment, said yesterday: 'The numbers of people who actually came
in for treatment is just the tip of the iceberg. Normal asthma sufferers
probably just stayed at home and waited to see their doctor.'
Air pollution caused by car exhausts is thought to be at least partly
responsible for the epidemic and the DoH said it would be asking health
authorities for their views on the causes.
'The letter will ask for a wide-ranging amount of information,' it said
yesterday. 'Officials will want an idea of the level of people who
experienced problems, their symptoms, and any noticeable clusters of areas
worst affected.'
The inquiry may later include Scotland and Wales.
The DoH was unable to confirm whether this was the first time such an
inquiry had been carried out into asthma attacks. It said similar
information was requested earlier this year after public concern over
Streptococcus A, the so-called 'killer bug'.
Several other official inquiries are being undertaken into the impact of the
environment on public health. A consultation paper published earlier this
year by the departments of environment and transport suggested proposals for
limiting pollution, including allowing local authorities to reduce vehicle
access in certain areas.
There is no evidence to suggest that the asthma epidemic continued after
June 24 although experts say there is a long-term upward trend in the number
of asthma sufferers.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Two Palestinians shot dead in Gaza rioting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE, Jerusalem correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement came under severe strain yesterday
after at least two Palestinians died when Palestinian and Israeli police
exchanged fire as rioting erupted in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli troops shot dead the Palestinians and wounded more than 70 at the
main Gaza-Israel checkpoint, after thousands of workers waiting to cross
into Israel rioted, burnt 40 Israeli buses, set fire to a petrol station and
hurled stones. The clashes were the bloodiest since Mr Yassir Arafat,
Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, returned to Gaza this month.
Israeli and Palestinian witnesses said Palestinian police and Israeli
security forces exchanged fire for the first time since Palestinian
self-rule was implemented in Gaza-Jericho. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli
border policeman were seriously wounded and at least 15 others hurt.
Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip and Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, Israeli army chief,
blamed Palestinian police for failing to prevent the riots and for causing
some of the casualties.
However, Mr Arafat said the Israeli shootings were a violation of the peace
accord and called for the immediate deployment of international observers in
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
It remained unclear last night how the riots started. Palestinians said
Israeli checkpoint forces delayed for several hours thousands of migrant
workers trying to make the dawn crossing into Israel. Israel said a
Palestinian seized an Arab policeman's gun and fired towards the checkpoint,
and that Israeli forces fired back in self-defence.
The incident has cast a shadow over recent optimism about the success of the
peace agreement. Under the accord, Palestinian police are responsible for
maintaining law and order over Palestinians in the self-rule areas. Although
the rioting may have been provoked by Israeli delays at the checkpoint, the
Palestinian police appeared confused and unable to control the mob.
Many of the guerrillas-turned-police have had only rudimentary training in
crowd control and feel uneasy about putting down Palestinian violence
directed against Israel. More seriously, any evidence that Palestinian
police deliberately fired their weapons at Israeli security forces would
provoke a fierce backlash in Israel against the accord.
Israel stopped short yesterday of accusing the police of deliberately firing
against Israelis, but Mr Oded Ben-Ami, the prime minister's spokesman,
blamed the Palestinian police for most of the casualties and said they had
opened fire in every direction, including at Israeli troops.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Shipbuilding nations avert trade dispute over subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading shipbuilding nations agreed yesterday to scrap subsidies to their
shipyards in a landmark deal for the industry, averting a potentially
serious trade dispute.
France, however, opposed the deal, reached after a week of negotiations at
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. Its
rejection indicates a rift with its European Union partners, represented in
the talks by the European Commission, which are unlikely to be swayed by the
French stance.
The agreement, between the US, the EU, Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway
and Sweden, follows five years of talks and was concluded in the early hours
of yesterday. It will end direct and indirect subsidies to shipyards in
these countries and includes an anti-dumping code, drawn up in response to
concerns about Japanese and Korean pricing.
Officials said failure to conclude an agreement could have provoked a
subsidy war between the bigger shipbuilding nations and triggered US
retaliation against ships built in subsidised foreign yards.
'Given the huge increase in capacity in Korea and the rise of producers like
China and Ukraine, European countries might have been forced to provide
increased aid to their yards, prompting a subsidy and price war,' said one
official involved in the negotiations. 'It was clear as well that the US was
considering unilateral action if a deal wasn't reached.'
The agreement must be ratified by all participants and is due to take effect
at the beginning of 1996. But it faces opposition from France, which sought
to suspend the talks at the weekend, and which is concerned about jobs at
its remaining shipyards, notably Saint-Lazare and Le Havre.
France, on its own, would be unable to stop a qualified majority vote on the
deal in the European Council of ministers and appears isolated in its
opposition.
Yesterday's agreement followed the resolution of several protracted
disputes. These included European concerns about the Jones Act, which
restricts US coastal trade to vessels built in US yards. Under the terms of
the agreement, the Jones Act will remain in place, but there will be a cap
placed on the tonnages it covers and counter-measures will be available in
the case of misuse.
The agreement, which also overhauls dispute settlement procedures and
equalises export credit arrangements for ship exports, covers about 75 per
cent of the world's shipbuilding capacity. Officials involved in the
negotiations said efforts would be made to extend it to smaller and emerging
shipbuilding nations.
Subsidies to shipbuilders have been reduced over recent years, but have
remained the principal source of dispute in the industry.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With a statutory solvency standard around the corner, pension funds are
asking whether their assets are a fair match for their liabilities. Under
the detailed rules being drafted by the actuarial profession, liabilities
relating to younger members will continue to be matched with equities. Older
liabilities will be measured against - and therefore best matched by -
gilts. But given the reluctance of fund managers to lend the government more
than is absolutely necessary, the search is on for alternatives.
Options contracts which guarantee funds the better of equity or gilt market
returns are one possibility. Such contracts would match older liabilities
for the purposes of solvency but leave open the prospect of equity-style
returns. Yet even though derivatives markets are expanding, there is not
nearly enough liquidity to allow all funds to cover themselves in this way.
Investment banks also charge high premiums for such protection.
Assets which share some of the characteristics of equities and bonds could
also attract interest. With their income linked to retail prices, for
example, utility shares in theory bear some resemblance to index-linked
bonds. But though utility shares tend to track gilts over short periods, the
similarities are unlikely to be sufficient to impress the actuaries. Apart
for the regulatory risks, many utilities are trying hard to look more like
equities by diversifying away from their regulated businesses. Most funds
will find that the solvency regime leaves no palatable alternative to buying
additional gilts.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium-producing countries meeting in Australia this week could be
forgiven for feeling satisfied with their efforts to return the market to
balance. Since production cuts were agreed at the end of January, the
aluminium price has risen by about 25 per cent. It has regained the level
prevailing in 1991 before imports from the former Soviet Union caused
meltdown. Within the last month stocks held on the London Metals Exchange
have finally started to fall.
With 2.5m tonnes of metal still held in LME warehouses, though, the
equilibrium looks fragile. Most producers are probably operating at a profit
and will not want to see the metal price driven substantially higher.
Another spike upwards could discourage industrial users from using aluminium
in place of other, less volatile, metals. But without the prospect of
further appreciation, investors who bought aluminium for capital gains will
have little incentive to hold on. There must be the danger of liquidations
and a sharp price correction until the stock overhang has been reduced.
Since there seems little hope of bringing Middle Eastern and Latin American
countries on side, progress in reducing stocks depends on the determination
of western and Russian producers to stick to cuts already announced. Even
though demand in the US and Europe has picked up faster than expected in
January, consumption within Russia is still falling. Holding production down
now that the price has recovered will require great discipline.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Renault
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French and foreign bankers will receive letters this morning inviting them
to bid to advise the government on its 80 per cent stake in Renault. They
will be smacking their lips. Whoever wins the adviser's mandate will parade
it like a trophy. Though the government is not yet committed to an early
privatisation of the car maker, a sale looks increasingly likely. Assurances
Generales de France was originally slated as the next privatisation
candidate. But international investors have recently been so stuffed with
new insurance issues that they probably have little appetite for another one
just now. Investors would welcome Renault, which is in the midst of a
cyclical upswing, as a variation in their diet. If France does decide on an
early privatisation, the timetable will be tight. Given trade union
opposition, waiting until 1995 would not be advisable. With presidential
elections next May, a Renault privatisation in 1995 could get caught in
political cross-fire. A flotation at the end of this year looks a better
bet.
A quick sale would help Renault draw a line under its unhappy alliance with
Volvo, which floundered in part because of concern over the continuing
involvement of the French state. A flotation would be a good opportunity for
the Swedish motor group to exchange most of its 20 per cent stake in Renault
for the French company's 45 per cent stake in Volvo Trucks. Renault will
still need a partner to share the cost of developing future car models. One
of the lessons of the Volvo saga is that this too may be easier once it is
privatised.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Ne'er the rose without the thorn: Blair as leader would
revive the UK Labour party, but tensions would remain just below the surface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week Mr Tony Blair will be anointed leader of the Labour party. That
much is certain in the unpredictable world of British politics.
Those on the unreconstructed left who believe the party might rediscover,
even now, its collectivist dreams by choosing Mrs Margaret Beckett or Mr
John Prescott have until Thursday's announcement to cherish their delusions.
Mr Blair's election will change the character of his party - and the
landscape of British politics. Her Majesty's loyal opposition will have a
leader preoccupied with the future, not shackled by the past.
Let's not get carried way. It is no use trying now to predict the outcome of
a general election which might not happen until 1997. Mr John Major has
defied the pundits more than once. The economy looks better by the day. Mr
Blair may be brimming with ideas but the 41-year-old former public schoolboy
lacks experience.
And if no one can doubt the direction in which he intends to take Labour, it
is far less certain how fast he can travel in replacing socialism with
social democracy.
After four election defeats, the party seems to have realised it is time to
grow up. How else could it have come to the conclusion that the
standard-bearer of its so-called modernisers' tendency was the only
realistic choice to succeed Mr John Smith?
But many in its ranks are still reluctant to give up the simplicities of
political childhood. As the candidates have trudged around the country
seeking the support of party and trade union activists, Mr Prescott's call
for a return to full employment has struck an emotive chord. Mrs Beckett has
reasserted the leftwing principles most thought she had buried long ago.
The smart betting at Westminster is that Mr Prescott will displace her as
deputy leader. Either way, the 1m party members and trade union levy payers
expected to participate in the contest will vote with their heads for the
leader and their hearts for the deputy.
Mr Blair has remained publicly neutral. The truth, probably, is that he
would prefer neither candidate.
Mrs Beckett is too much a creature still of the hard left. Mr Prescott is
far more intelligent than he sometimes sounds; and he is loyal. But his
traditionalist bluntness jars with the soothing rhetoric of the modernisers.
Mr Blair is tough. His youthful good looks and the Bambi jibes belie the
inner certainty which distinguishes political leaders from those they lead.
He has the support of the vast majority in the shadow cabinet and of the
party's MPs.
Thanks to the grip on the party machinery established by the then leader, Mr
Neil Kinnock, during the late 1980s, he will command also a large majority
on the National Executive Committee.
He is already planning his own changes to the way the party shapes its
policies. He sees the cumbersome policy commissions driven by the party
headquarters in Walworth Road as introspective and stifling of innovation.
He intends to provide room in the machinery for the more original ideas of
left-leaning think-tanks, such as the Institute for Public Policy Research,
and of free-thinking backbench MPs like Mr Frank Field.
So his deputy's power will be limited to a capacity to make life
occasionally uncomfortable, rather than seriously to obstruct. Mr Gordon
Brown, the modernist shadow chancellor who stood aside to allow Mr Blair a
clear run at the leadership, will have more influence than either candidate.
But first the new leader must define his project.
The campaign has told us more than his critics allow about his ambitions. He
has not provided a blueprint for the party's general election manifesto. Nor
has he answered the persistent questioning of those who insist he should
spell out, at least two years before the election, just who might or might
not pay more in tax if he reaches 10 Downing Street.
Instead Mr Blair has stuck resolutely to elaborating a set of basic
principles. In six speeches since the start of the campaign, he has added a
series of policy signposts rather than specifics to the philosophical
framework.
The approach has irritated those who believe that politics is about detail
rather than direction. It has worried some of Mr Blair's own admirers, who
think he has been more cautious than necessary in sketching out the
modernist agenda. He is unrepentant. He acknowledges the caution but has
told close colleagues there is also careful calculation.
Labour has spent the past decade chasing the Conservatives. The piles of
ideological baggage left behind by repeated accommodations with the
government have not been replaced with any fresh analysis of Labour's
purpose.
During the 1980s, it promised not to renationalise, admitted half-heartedly
there was something to be said for the market economy, stripped its
manifestos of pledges to soak the rich. It then added in a few random
commitments to spend, say, a few billion pounds extra on child benefit and
pensions.
Mr Blair's contention is that Labour needs a coherent prospectus. The
electorate above all wants to know where it is coming from. That means being
comfortable with a set of its own ideas, not combining grudging
accommodations with the Tories with a clutch of pledges drawn from
rose-tinted images of a socialist past.
He regards building enough credibility to win the next election as a
three-stage process. Labour must first redefine its core principles. It
needs then to construct a policy agenda rooted in that intellectual
framework. Finally, it must offer the electorate a series of 'flagship'
policies to illuminate the link between principle and practice.
His aim during the campaign has been to concentrate on the first task while
pencilling in the outlines of the second. The detailed policies can wait
until much closer to the general election.
Hence the constant repetition now of the central Blair message: that
Labour's purpose is to reconnect individual aspiration with the actions of
government. The party must reposition itself as one concerned not to
constrain but to promote individual opportunity by reawakening faith in the
notion of society. In Mr Blair's own phrase: 'The simple case for democratic
socialism rests on the belief that individuals prosper best within a strong,
active society.'
That means Labour cannot any longer be about offering fixed economic
prescriptions or old-style collectivism. Nor can it apply to the rapidly
changing world of the 1990s the ideology of the 1960s or 1970s.
The speeches have carried a series of more particular messages. Labour must
embrace the 'dynamic market economy'. It must forget its old hang-ups about
state ownership and abandon the notion that governments can pick industrial
winners. It must understand that it is impossible to insulate Britain from
the realities of global competition.
In education, the priority should be to raise standards rather than indulge
the political correctness which allows schools to blame social deprivation
for poor performance. Labour must understand the purpose of the welfare
state is not to create dependency but to provide escape routes. The
unemployed have responsibilities as well as rights. The role of the state is
to help them find work through training or childcare provision, not pay them
to be idle. Criminals, meanwhile, should expect to be punished rather than
excused.
In Europe, the British have no choice other than to be positive and
committed about closer European co-operation. The government must maintain
strong and credible defences.
Less controversially for members of his own party, Mr Blair has put constant
emphasis on the role of education and training in promoting both faster
economic growth and individual opportunity. He has promised to close
existing loopholes to make the very rich pay at least some tax. He has
pledged to overhaul and eventually replace the House of Lords and to devolve
political power to Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
The strategy has been derided by the Conservatives. The
Labour-leader-in-waiting has been renamed Tony Blur. Ministers are prepared
to demand answers to a barrage of detailed policy questions the moment his
election is confirmed.
But, overall, the Tory response has betrayed the government's own
uncertainties. The initial instinct has been to attack Mr Blair as another
of Labour's chameleons, willing to twist and trim to win a few more votes
but at heart an unreconstructed socialist. He is said to be a man of
sound-bites not substance, a creature of the sharp-suited media men who
tried to hide Mr Kinnock behind the party's Red Rose image.
But there is private acknowledgement that the easy points which could be
scored off Mr Kinnock's policy U-turns are no longer on offer. Sure, Mr
Blair stood in the 1983 general election on a platform of withdrawal from
the European Community. Sure, there are quotes to be found which reveal he
has not always been quite so modern about nationalisation or trade union
power. And doesn't he even now support the minimum wage?
The problem is that this fresh-faced Oxbridge graduate simply does not look
or sound like a closet Trotskyist. He has never been one.
Nor does Mr Major's government appear confident of where it should position
itself to win back the disillusioned voters of middle England.
The prime minister told his supporters at Westminster earlier this month
that their priority must be to dispel the impression of convergence between
a post-Thatcherite Tory and a Blair-led Labour party. He has not spelt out
how.
Some among his cabinet colleagues believe the government must move further
to the right to give definition to the choice facing the electorate. It must
sustain the Eurosceptic flavour in its approach to Brussels, which saved it
from catastrophe in the European elections last month. Above all, it must
start cutting taxes again well before the election.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, are
among others around the cabinet table who take a different tack. They fear
that vacating the centre ground will hand to Labour the votes of the
discontented skilled and middle classes whose preference will decide the
election.
Others still - Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is the most prominent -
favour a delicate balancing act, promising both to address the new
insecurities of middle England and to deliver another burst of Thatcherite
radicalism.
Mr Blair draws comfort from the confusion. He should not be complacent. He,
too, has to take his party with him.
By and large, it has been receptive, occasionally even enthusiastic. After
15 years of opposition, most in the shadow cabinet don't want to give up
again the chance to climb each night into one of those swish ministerial
cars rather than stand in the taxi queue for King's Cross.
The generation of Labour MPs which entered Parliament in 1992 has changed
the political balance of the party at Westminster. The newcomers,
particularly those who won marginal seats, are well attuned to political
realities. The once vibrant Campaign Group of hard-left MPs discovered last
month that it could not muster even enough votes to nominate its own
candidate for the leadership race.
More importantly, the one-member-one-vote system under which the election is
being conducted, has deprived the trade union leaders of their influence.
The executive of the Transport and General Workers Union made a fool of
itself by backing Mrs Beckett at the outset. Others, more wisely, have kept
their counsel.
But these are early days. Many in the Labour party share the weaknesses of
the reformed alcoholic. How easy it would be to slip back into making just
one or two big new tax and spending pledges; to buy peace with the party's
union paymasters with a promise to sweep away the Tories' employment law; or
to spell out just how Labour would insulate the low-paid from the realities
of the marketplace.
Admirers who have applauded Mr Blair's agenda during the campaign often have
been unwilling to own up to the hard truths that lie behind it. A reformed
welfare state means an end to easy generosity. A modern economic policy
implies an acceptance that there is no pot of gold to be found by putting up
the top rates of income tax. Some time soon, the party will have to own up
also to the fact that the idea of returning schools to the control of Labour
local authorities is not exactly a vote-winner.
The risk has been evident in Mr Blair's own speeches. There has been a
suppressed tension as the prospective leader has sought to balance the
demand for change with reassurance to his party's traditionalists. For all
his rhetorical skills, the joins show.
Too often Labour has discovered too late that its own concept of
modernisation lags well behind the expectations and aspirations of the
electorate.
Mr Blair has done well over the past six weeks. So has his party. He is
right to judge that the voters are more interested in ideas than detail. But
six weeks is a short time in politics. This has been the easy bit. Labour
must now show it can face up to the hard truths. Mr Blair will discover that
leading his party is a great deal tougher than being chosen to lead it.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Reform and a new union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The results of the elections in Ukraine and Belarus, where broadly
pro-Russian politicians were elected to the presidencies of both countries,
pose more sharply than before a choice for Russia: should it seek to
capitalise on the new presidents' preferences for integration of their
economies into Russia? Or continue to treat them as separate countries?
The temptation of the first way is large. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
is continually under fire for destroying the Soviet Union. To bring Ukraine
and Belarus back within the Russian fold would, at a stroke, give half of
the expatriated Russians a 'home' again. It would, in short, be a marvellous
diplomatic coup.
Most Russians believe, in any case, that these countries cannot construct
their own statehoods. Belarus has evidently failed. The politicians who
stood for a (mildly) independent and democratic path for the state gathered
little more than 20 per cent of the votes in the presidential elections: the
front runners were those who offered a variant of national abnegation. In
his first appearance, Mr Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarus president-elect,
went out of his way to stress his country's dependence on - almost
prostration before - Russia.
Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new Ukrainian president, has given significantly
different signals. He revealed, for example, that his first meeting was with
the US ambassador rather than the Russian. He does not wish to introduce a
separate currency, neither will he neuter the central bank, nor welcome back
Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Though he won on a pro-Russian ticket, his role
may be to disappoint his supporters - by making them face up to the hard
fact that, once the Soviet Union has been pulled asunder, it is very hard to
reassemble it without the help of the Communist party, Gosplan and the KGB
Mr Kuchma knows, and Mr Lukashenko will discover, that the arguments against
a tripartite Slav Union are strong - especially for Russia, which would be
landed with two of the largest industrial restructuring problems in the
world, beside its own. Belarus, especially, believes that once back in the
Russian fold it would be taken care of as before: but those days have gone.
No Russian government can afford such a burden. It is conceiv able that
Belarus would assent to become a north-western province of Russia again. But
it would still be subjecting its industries to the colder winds of Russian
reform, which is far in advance of its own. Ukraine will not accept a
similar status. And it would, in any case, have to face the reforms it has
avoided for three years.
There is much that can and should be done on tariffs, customs and payment
arrangements. But these are as much part of the needed market reforms in
each country as the subject of special treaties. A union cannot be viewed as
a substitute for reform, either for Russia, or for the other two. Once that
is realised, much of the enthusiasm for it may also vanish.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's rail dispute is hotting up. The RMT rail union has decided to call
two-day strikes by signal staff in pursuit of higher pay for past
productivity increases. The disruption suffered by the travelling public -
and British Rail's freight customers - will increase. An appropriate
reaction is now needed from Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs
British Rail's track and signalling operations.
One option would be to settle the dispute as quickly as possible. The
disruption is already costing British Rail many times the price of a
settlement. It could also threaten the privatisation of the railways, by
exposing the vulnerability of the train-operating companies to action by
Railtrack staff. A well-run private business would probably settle. It would
then recoup the cost through fierce cost-cutting and change its employment
practices to avoid a repetition.
Railtrack does not have that freedom, however. The government has already
interfered to stop an earlier settlement. It fears that changing its mind
might encourage others to challenge the public sector pay-bill freeze.
An alternative would be to respond to the union escalation in kind. Those
who long for a more macho response recall President Ronald Reagan's approach
to striking air traffic controllers: offer the strikers personal contracts,
sack those who refuse to accept them and train replacements as quickly as
possible. Seductive though that would be, it would close the rail network
for months - especially if other rail staff came out in solidarity with
their signalling colleagues.
The most promising approach is a combination of carrot and stick. Railtrack
needs to do much more to talk directly to its signal staff, and to point out
the damage the strikes are doing to their future. The opening of the Channel
tunnel, with the opportunities it brings to export by rail, is no time to be
reminding customers of the past unreliability of the railways.
The company must also make it absolutely clear what is on the table for each
of its signalling staff - and what it hopes to offer in return for further
productivity improvements. And it could sensibly make a concession to the
relief staff who are the main losers under the current offer. Given the high
turnover of relief staff, it would cost little to allow existing staff to
retain their current pay and apply the new terms to new recruits only.
At the same time, Railtrack should be firm in dealing with attempts to
disrupt the network by tactics such as next week's two-day strike. The
strike will run from noon on Tuesday to noon on Thursday, effectively
disrupting the rail network for three days. Those staff who join it should
lose three days' pay.
There are no quick solutions to strikes such as this. But a combination of
persuasion and firmness is the most likely way to bring it to an early end.
This will be a big week for Unilever. Having been sent reeling by Procter &amp;
Gamble's assault on the quality of its new washing powders, Unilever will
try to wrest the initiative back through a public relations campaign. This
week's presentations - rejecting the claims that its washing powders rot
clothes - could prove critical in determining whether the detergents succeed
across Europe. They could prove just as important in re-establishing the
reputation of Unilever's management, which has been sullied since the row
began.
In quantitative terms, the powder wars are of limited financial importance
to Unilever. The group has sold Pounds 325m of new powder so far. That is
small in relation to group annual profits of well over Pounds 2bn. The chief
concern would be if the mud thrown at Omo Power and Persil Power were to
stick to Unilever's other detergent brands. But there is no evidence of that
to date.
The more worrying aspect is qualitative. Launching consumer products
successfully is the lifeblood of the company. Shareholders understandably
grow uneasy when that starts to go awry. The company's touch has appeared
unsure since the accusations started to fly. The subsequent reformulation of
its powders and the dropping of litigation against P&amp;G have come as further
public relations blows. Shareholders will hope the affair will prove
cathartic. Unilever will certainly need to show it has regained its poise
before P&amp;G launches its own new detergent this autumn. At least the
scorching weather must be doing wonders for Unilever's ice cream sales.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Puzzles over jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Encouraging it may be. Crystal clear it is not. The UK economy last week
breezed through another month's price, wage and employment data, entering
the weekend with the added windfall of an endorsement from the OECD. Little
has changed in the general picture of the recovery which previous months'
figures have revealed. But no change, either, in the murkiness of some of
the details.
The OECD's comments on the UK economy might be by Mr Kenneth Clarke himself.
Overall, the organisation judges the UK to have made 'major strides' in
restructuring its macro-economic policy framework. Barring mishaps, the
authors expect the UK at the end of next year to be exhibiting much the same
mix of above-trend output growth, low inflation and falling unemployment,
'albeit with the latter still above its 'natural rate' '.
The OECD parts company with Mr Clarke when it comes to the longer term: not
least over his ability to deliver the government's ambitious targets for
public spending. But last week's economic data will have given the
organisation few reasons to revise the optimistic shorter-term prognosis.
Producer and consumer prices continue to rise at a restrained pace. For the
third month in a row, the retail price index was up 2.6 per cent year on
year, well within the government's 1-4 per cent target range. The underlying
growth in average earnings was also unchanged, at 3.75 per cent year on
year.
The OECD agrees with the Treasury that gross domestic product will grow by
about 2.75 per cent this year, although the organisation differs in
expecting this to edge higher in 1995. Both seem to think the economy can
grow faster than its historical trend of 2.25 per cent without immediately
endangering the government's inflation targets. This seems plausible after a
long recession.
The labour market also appears to be giving good news. Eighteen months ago,
when the OECD last analysed the UK, few predicted the steady fall in
unemployment which started soon after. But, even though 329,000 fewer are
now claiming the dole, earnings and employment data show little sign of an
upsurge in the labour market. Average weekly hours in manufacturing have now
fallen for two consecutive months, while the number working short-time has
actually increased.
Even more striking, the total number in employment remains 37,000 fewer than
when unemployment started to fall in January 1993. Indeed, the number of men
employed, down 138,000 over the period, has not registered a quarterly
increase since the end of 1989. Why this recovery has proved jobless in this
way is not easily understood, though part of the reason must be that
economic growth has been little faster than the long-term trend. Whatever
the reason, the failure of employment to rise may also deprive the
government of a solid recovery in its popularity.

Romans are as fond of political jokes as anyone; the arrival of the
charismatic Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister prompts the following tale.
Berlusconi dies and goes to hell. But Lucifer quickly finds him impossible
and arranges him a transfer to purgatory. There he creates equal mayhem,
with multiple takeover bids, cross-ownership deals and so on. Eventually,
for the sake of a quiet life, St Peter admits him to Paradise.
Two weeks later, Lucifer rings up to ask how it's going. It's all quiet,
says St Peter.
Oddly quiet, he thinks, and goes to see what Berlusconi is up to. He finds
him closeted with God, whom he overhears saying: 'OK, that's you sorted out.
But me . . . why only vice-president?'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new iciness prevails between Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's
two largest credit institutions.
Oddly enough, the chill is attributable to a heating equipment company
called Buderus, sold off by the ailing Metallgesellschaft group last month.
The two banks co-operated to place shares in Buderus - raising DM1.2bn of
much-needed cash for MG - but Dresdner subsequently played its own wily
game.
Dresdner has now popped up as a 10 per cent shareholder - on its own account
 -in Buderus. It's also helped Bilfinger &amp; Berger - one of Germany's biggest
construction companies - buy a further 15 per cent.
The Bilfinger move is being interpreted as a possible prelude to a
full-scale takeover. In any case, the action seems to have taken both
Buderus and Deutsche Bank by surprise. Deutsche's protestations that the
placing guaranteed Buderus' independence now look, well, somewhat
ill-informed.
An added piquancy is that secret accumulation of big share stakes is shortly
to become illegal: under the terms of the long-awaited Financial Markets
Promotion Act, due to be enacted on August 1, companies will have to
disclose stakes when they reach 5 per cent.
Understandably, Dresdner says it's not broken the law, because the law was
not yet in force. Impeccable logic. But perhaps faulty public relations?

So, God remains a man. At least, that's how the Church of England has
decided to regard the deity.
The church's general synod has pronounced that, despite the onward march of
political correctness, the correct mode of address is 'He'. Texts for the
church's next prayer book will not refer to God as 'Mother' or 'She'.
The synod has thus endorsed a report from its Liturgical Commission, which
argued God should be addressed 'in terms borrowed from our human
understanding of fatherhood and monarchy'.
Still, novelty creeps on apace. The commission also said new forms of
prayers, avoiding gender references, could be introduced. So sometimes God
will be It, after all.

Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence minister, was sniped at last week for some
swingeing armed forces' cuts. So perhaps it's only fair to award him a DCM -
the Distinguished Conservation Medal - for leaving one unit untouched.
Surviving to fight another day is the four-strong Ministry of Defence
Conservation Unit, based in Chessington. Its job is promoting and protecting
the wildlife and ancient monuments inhabiting the vast expanses of MoD land
 -much of which gets crushed by tanks or blasted by bombs.
James Baker, the retired colonel in charge, was delighted but not astonished
to have escaped the axe: 'We have some of the best sites for butterflies,
reptiles and bats in the country . . . we're at the forefront of the
conservation drive.'
Baker argues that artillery craters are good for flowers - the shell-holes
open up the soil - and that bullet holes cause trees to ooze resin, so
attracting lichens.
The latest issue of Sanctuary, the unit's annual magazine, carries articles
on birds inhabiting the weapons-testing area at Foulness; choughs on the
Castlemartin tank firing range in Pembrokeshire; and moths at Porton Down,
site of the MoD's chemical weapons research plant.
A piece on orchids and butterflies at the Arpinge Ranges in Kent says: 'The
MoD has preserved a precious landscape which might long ago have disappeared
if subjected to the commercial pressures of modern farming.'
Presumably flying shrapnel deters the nest-raiders, too.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Apprenticeships not just replacement
for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE NIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We were interested to read your survey on modern apprenticeship schemes
('Apprenticeship scheme sparks scepticism', July 13). I chair the London
Modern Apprenticeship Group and would like to address some of the points
raised.
Modern apprenticeships will give young people who wish to pursue training
through a work-based, rather than an academic-based route, core skills.
However, modern apprenticeships are meant to exist as an alternative to, and
not as a replacement for, educational opportunities.
The article states that there is scepticism over employers' willingness to
support the programme. In north London, we are beginning to work in
partnership with other industry training organisations (ITOs) to develop a
framework for the programme. The fact that there are already strong links
between employers and ITOs means that Training and Enterprise Councils will
be able to communicate with a far larger group of employers than before. It
is these links which will make modern apprenticeships work, and all the
employers I have spoken to are very keen to get involved in the programme.
While the modern apprenticeship scheme will indeed help gain work-based
skills, it is important it is looked at as one part of the programme to
raise the skills base of the population - a programme which includes many
other projects designed to complement each other.

FT  18 JUL 94 / The Monday Interview: Private view of a public motivator -
Lewis Preston, World Bank president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visiting the World Bank at its 19th Street headquarters in Washington DC,
you would never guess that questions are being raised about its long-term
future. You have to negotiate a building site strewn with cranes and
earth-moving equipment. With both the bank and the IMF, its sister
institution across the street, racing to complete lavish extensions to their
already- extensive offices, the area resembles a development zone in
southern China.
The World Bank has been expanding rapidly for years. There are now about
11,000 people on its payroll, compared with 8,000 in 1989 and 7,000 in 1984.
The number of 'higher level' professional staff is now 6,039 (including
1,291 'consultants') - an increase of a third in five years, and more than
50 per cent in a decade. Since 1991, when Mr Lewis Preston took over as
president, the bank's administrative budget has risen 44 per cent to Dollars
1.4bn; staff costs (excluding consultants) have risen 43 per cent to Dollars
876m.
To his credit, Mr Preston has no apparent interest in empire building. He
welcomes the Group of Seven's call in Naples for a review of the role of
international institutions. 'If there is any duplication, overlap or waste,
let's get it out,' he says.
Questioned about the bank's future, he states repeatedly that it must
intervene more selectively and become more cost efficient. It would be
'absolutely wrong' to continue lending to countries that could easily obtain
capital from private sources. 'We shouldn't interfere where the private
sector is prepared to invest,' he says.
Having spent 40 years at JP Morgan, the premier New York bank, Mr Preston
seems untroubled by the notion of transferring bank functions to the private
sector. 'Over time the shift that is called for will occur, should occur and
must occur,' he says. He has an admiration for private enterprise that is
perhaps not entirely shared by senior colleagues who have never experienced
life outside the public sector womb.
Yet although he seems personally convinced that the bank should contract,
this theme does not come across clearly in the bank's 'vision statement', to
be released tomorrow in a 50th anniversary attempt to redefine its goals and
defuse growing criticism. And it is unclear whether he has the stomach for
serious 'downsizing'. At times he gives the impression he is fighting a
losing battle against the bank's permanent bureaucrats.
What is the main difference between running the World Bank and running JP
Morgan? At Morgan, he says, strategic change was readily accomplished. He
simply discussed a plan with four or five colleagues and then implemented
it. He was able to 'incentivise people' and make things happen.
The situation is entirely different in a large public-sector bureaucracy.
'Here it is a matter of building a consensus.'
But surely, since you are president, you can just order the changes you
want? He indicates that life is far more complex. People at the bank, he
says, 'have seen presidents come and go'. They can 'wait you out', he adds.
Since 1989, private flows to developing countries have quadrupled to about
Dollars 120bn, dwarfing the bank's total commitments of about Dollars 20bn.
Didn't this vast increase in private development capital mean the bank had
to contract?
'Absolutely,' he says. He notes that the bank's loans have fallen off
sharply in recent years, partly because countries such as India are awash
with private inflows and no longer need its adjustment loans. He hopes there
will be 'a significant number of graduations in Latin America' - in other
words, countries that become too rich to qualify for World Bank support.
But the bank has to move carefully, he warns, because the recent jump in
private flows might not be sustainable. It was spurred by interest rates in
developed countries that are 'at their lowest level since the second world
war'. And most of the capital is being absorbed by about 20 countries with
the best prospects.
He says there are two reasons why the bank's staff and headquarters'
expenses have risen so rapidly, despite the reduced demand for loans. The
first is the need to meet the historic challenge posed by the transition to
capitalism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He cannot cut back
elsewhere, because 'members were very insistent that we didn't dilute
services to the existing customer base'.
He has also needed to fill gaps in the bank's skills mix. He has created new
vice-presidencies covering areas in which the bank expects to play a larger
role in the future: the environment, private-sector development, and human
resources such as health-care and education.
The bank now employs 200 environmental experts, compared with a handful when
it embarked on the much-criticised Namada dam project in India in the
mid-1980s. Lending for human resource development now accounts for 17 per
cent of all loans, against 5 per cent in the early 1980s.
While favouring a larger role for the private sector in development, he says
some ideas for expanding the International Fi-nance Corporation, the bank's
private-sector arm, are facile. The bank proper cannot transfer resources
directly to the IFC, because they have different owners. In any case, the
IFC has sufficient capital to expand its investments at 12 per cent a year
until 2005; faster growth might be imprudent.
The biggest change facing the bank is a likely increase in its advisory role
in developing countries and a corresponding reduction in its importance as a
financier. With private capital more readily available, the challenge is to
help clients restructure their public sectors, so as to create a climate in
which private business can flourish.
But if the bank becomes an adviser rather than a lender, shouldn't it charge
directly for consultancy services?
Mr Preston likes the idea. 'I think selectively we should try it.' If the
bank charged fees, he muses, it would be able to test the strength of demand
for its services. And it could see how it measured up to private-sector
competitors. 'If Lazard and Warburgs can give it cheaper, and it's better,
there will be an even more rapid diminution in staff,' he says.
But then he frowns, remembering that he is at the World Bank, not JP Morgan:
'But the idea of charging for advice is totally alien around here. They
don't like it,' he admits.
He says his greatest achievement at the bank is 'changing the emphasis from
initiation to implementation'. He is referring to recent attempts to alter
bank culture by judging staff not by the volume of loans they initiate, but
by the performance of the projects they help finance. The emphasis on loan
volume rather than project success is said to reflect the 'production line'
mentality of Robert McNamara, the influential World Bank president in the
1970s - and a former head of the Ford car company.
Mr Preston is also proud of introducing the bank to the mysteries of cost
accounting. Incredible though it may seem, he says, the bank did not have a
means of measuring the costs of different activities. 'How can you be
selective if you don't know what your costs are?' he asks.
Looking back, he admits he may have adopted too low a profile as bank
president. 'It's important now that I respond to our critics,' he says.
Although some parts of Asia are developing enormously quickly, he is
concerned by the 'desperate' plight of sub-Saharan Africa. 'So I don't think
50 years is enough,' he says firmly, referring to strident demands from
leftwing environmentalists for the World Bank's closure.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Personal View: Myths of the British labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the discussion relating to unemployment in the UK places heavy
emphasis on the growth in part-time, temporary, service-sector and female
employment. The popular argument is that 'good' jobs (well paid and full
time) are being replaced by 'bad' jobs (low paid and part time) and that
unskilled men in particular are put at a disadvantage by these trends.
Many observers have argued that men without significant educational
qualifications could in the past secure full-time manual jobs at reasonable
levels of pay, but that the demand for such employment has declined sharply.
Employment growth has come in either professional or managerial occupations,
which demand significant educational qualifications, or in lower-level
service jobs, which demand few skills or qualifications but which are low
paid and often part time. In general, there is a worry that economic
recovery will fail to benefit many disadvantaged groups in the labour
market.
Much of this debate is based on false assumptions. Either the purported
trends are not taking place at all or have been ongoing over the whole
post-second world war period.
Consider the following 10 facts which the data* do establish:
1) Women have been entering the labour force and increasing their share of
employment at a steady rate for more than 40 years. Female labour force
participation rose fastest in the 1960s.
2) Part-time work in the UK has also been on an upward trend for more than
40 years and in the last decade grew more slowly than in the previous three
decades.
3) There is no evidence at all that temporary employment is increasing in
importance.
4) Unemployment rates for men and women were very similar during the 1980s.
Only after 1990 did male unemployment increase sharply relative to female
unemployment. This was due mainly to a sharp fall in male self-employment
during the Major recession.
5) Unemployment among young people and the ethnic minorities is very
sensitive to the cycle: unemployment for these groups rises most sharply in
recessions but falls most sharply in recoveries.
6) The long-term unemployed appeared to benefit at least proportionately
from the Lawson boom in the late 1980s, even taking into account the effects
of programmes like Restart.
7) The relative labour market position of less well-qualified men did not
deteriorate sharply when looking at the whole period 1979-93.
8) The proportion of manual jobs has been declining for four decades, but
the decline for both men and women did pick up in the 1980s.
9) These jobs are being supplanted in importance by generally high-paid,
high-skill, professional and managerial jobs.
10) The proportion of low-paid, low-skill, service-sector jobs is not
increasing.
These last three facts are replicated in the US labour market. The US
economy has not been disproportionately creating low-paid, low-skill,
service-sector jobs; it is high-skill, professional and managerial jobs that
have been generated.
So one explanation for the US having a lower unemployment rate than Britain
in the last 10 years - that the harsh American benefits system forces people
to take the jobs which are mainly being created in establishments like
McDonald's - is not borne out by the evidence.
This suggests the UK welfare state does not need to be dismantled in order
to generate lower unemployment, though the details of how the tax and
benefits system could be improved should continue to be examined to enhance
employment opportunities.
The strong growth of professional and managerial employment puts the focus
on whether the British education system is producing enough qualified
manpower. The answer, at least since the late 1980s, seems to be yes.
Between 1988 and 1993 the enrolment rate for young people into higher
education in Britain doubled from 15 to 31 per cent.
Through the 1990s this ought to ensure that plenty of qualified manpower is
available to meet the needs of the UK labour market.
So why is UK unemployment so high? It is not because of the changing nature
of the jobs on offer, but is the consequence of an absolute shortage of
jobs. The growth in employment has been held back by tight macroeconomic
policy, conditioned by fear of inflation.
Changes in the institutions of pay bargaining, including greater
decentralisation and the abolition of incomes policy in the private sector,
have probably contributed most to the worsening of the inflation constraint
on employment growth.
This, then, is the irony. Labour market deregulation has exacerbated the
free-for-all in pay bargaining and, alongside tight financial policies, this
has left Britain with high levels of unemployment as the price for
containing inflation. The key problem facing the British economy is that of
ensuring that steady growth in aggregate demand and employment is not
brought to a halt by fear of an accelerating spiral of pay and prices.
We should not be diverted from this debate by a focus on trends in the
structure of employment or unemployment which are either not occurring or
have been occurring for decades.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Disabled bill seeks equal, not
special, treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STUART ETHERINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having recently returned from Glasgow, where I stayed in one of the few
hotels in the UK which has facilities for deaf people, I was pleased to read
of Lord Tebbit's comments encouraging hoteliers to improve facilities for
disabled customers ('Tebbit fires salvo for disabled', July 14). For too
long, disabled people have been viewed as 'problems' rather than as valued
customers and a source of revenue. Deaf people have a great deal of loyalty
to those hotels which they know have adapted facilities. A lesser-known
fact, however, is the low cost that such adaptations involve, and how easy
they are to install. In the US, where there is legislation, deaf and hard of
hearing people no longer have to plan their trips around where these
facilities are to be found.
Lord Tebbit expressed concern over the potential costs of the Civil Rights
(Disabled Persons) Bill. Many of the costs in the government's analysis of
the bill are inaccurate, and are based on a five-year implementation
timetable. The bill provides for the timescale to be approved by the
secretary of state and includes both a test of reasonableness and provisions
to exempt businesses where adaptations would create undue hardship.
The essence of the bill is equal treatment not special treatment. What is
needed is full discussion by all sides - business, government, disabled
people and their organisations - to ensure that all the UK's disabled
citizens have access to reasonable accommodation in hotels and elsewhere.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Criticisms ignore key elements of US
growth and trading pattern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WYNNE GODLEY and Mr WILLIAM MILBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Solomon (Letters, July 9) asserts that the improvement in the US
balance of payments between 1986 and 1992 disproves our statement (Personal
View, July 6) that the 'underlying' US trade deficit has been deteriorating,
claiming that we ignore the effect of relative growth rates. But Mr Solomon
is himself ignoring the fact that, between 1986 and 1992, the balance was
improved because US growth was exceptionally slow relative to that in the
rest of the world and because the trade-weighted dollar fell by 37 per cent
between 1985 and 1991. Mr Solomon is thus guilty of the error he attributes
to us.
Our article was based on an analysis of the US balance which treated oil,
agriculture, transfers and property income separately, and adjusted
everything else for relative growth rates and the large fluctuations in the
dollar which occurred in the 1980s. Our conclusions are thus grounded in a
'structural' analysis of just the kind Mr Solomon aspires to.
Mr Avinash Persaud (Letters, July 12) suggests that recent increases in US
exports, particularly to South America and Asia, call our disquieting
conclusions into question. Mr Persaud only concerns himself with exports,
ignoring imports, for which the US has a mighty dynamic potential; total US
imports of goods and services have risen in volume by 30 per cent in the
last three years.
He should be worried (for instance) by the fact that US imports from China
doubled between 1990 and 1993, rising by Dollars 16bn, while exports to
China only rose Dollars 4bn. And imports from Japan are still looking
dynamic, causing an Dollars 18bn deterioration in the (bilateral) trade
balance. Even US success in exporting to Asia as a whole, to which Mr
Persaud attaches such importance, has not been enough to prevent the trade
balance (with Asia) from deteriorating.
Dollar weakness may indeed threaten the 'fragile economic recoveries in
Europe and Japan'. But the conclusion we draw is that, if Europe and Japan
really want sustained recovery, they should do something about it for
themselves, by adopting more expansionary policies. Why should the US
continue to act as an engine for export-led growth in the rest of the world,
at the cost of building up foreign indebtedness on a scale which, if
unchecked, will have extremely damaging consequences, not just for the US
but indirectly for the rest of the world as well?

FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Referendums: principle must be
binding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GABRIEL STEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Leadbeater and Andrew Adonis ('Power to the people', July 15)
argue that established democracies could be rejuvenated by introducing
'voter vetoes' in the form of referendums on legislation. But they then
state that these referendums should be purely advisory. They would then be
meaningless, as the Swedish example shows.
In the 1920s, Sweden voted against prohibition. Severe rationing was
introduced. In 1953, it voted to retain left-side driving. In 1967, Sweden
changed to driving on the right. In 1958, Sweden voted in favour of
voluntary-funded additional pension schemes. Two years later a mandatory
pay-as-you-go system was introduced (which is now, incidentally, breaking
down). In 1980, the alternatives were less than clear, but the result was
definitely a decision to abolish the use of nuclear energy in Sweden by the
year 2005. Result: extremely unlikely to occur.
This year, there is a referendum on joining the European Union. Once again
politicians of all parties have pledged themselves to honour the expressed
will of the people. If the result is a 'no', they are likely once again to
ignore it. The principle of a referendum can be discussed. But if you use
them, the result must be legally binding.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC1's new comedy series All Night Long, set in a bakery, depends for its
laughs very largely upon character, so when you describe the plot it all
sounds rather slight and banal. In today's episode a local villain turns up
and demands a birthday cake for his mother, but Romanian cake expert Vanda
refuses to make a Black Forest gateau for political reasons .. (8.30). In
today's episode of Frank Stubbs the wide boy promoter who combines the
social graces of Arthur Daley with the subtlety of Max Clifford, finds
himself landed with a dull Tory MP as a client, a man whose most notable
moment came when he was a student, and involved women's underwear (9.00
ITV). In Panorama John Penycate investigates the changing role of police
informers. The claim is that instead of just passing on information about
crimes already committed or planned, informers are now being used by the
police to set up crimes which are then 'solved', thus improving the police
success rate (9.30 BBC1). Best of the day will be Episode 2 of The Singing
Detective, repeated in tribute to the late Dennis Potter (10.10 BBC1).

FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: 100 not out, or are they? - The start of the Promenade
concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC allowed itself one or two extravagances at the start of this year's
season of Promenade concerts. Most noticeably, an array of banners high up
in the roof of the Royal Albert Hall proclaims 'Proms 100' just in case
anybody has missed the publicity campaign.
In fact, there is a bit of a problem here, as people planning the
celebrations for the millenium have already found. Should the Proms'
centenary be said to fall this year, which is the 100th season, or next,
which is 100 years since they started (at the Queen's Hall on 10 August
1895)? Doubtless reckoning that a Proms audience is more often than not in a
celebratory mood, the management has decided to have it both ways, in 1994
looking back over 100 years of achievement and in 1995 putting the emphasis
on the future through new music.
The other notable extravagance was the opening concert. Schoenberg's
Gurrelieder, for six soloists, double or treble choir and huge orchestra, is
about as lavish a work as one could choose. Apparently, Henry Wood always
wanted to schedule Gurrelieder at the Proms (I note in passing that the
title 'Henry Wood Promenade Concerts' is gradually being usurped by 'BBC
Proms") but the chance never came his way.
When Gurrelieder was performed a few years ago it was played (very capably)
by a huge youth orchestra, but for this occasion the BBC dug into its
pockets and produced a fully professional performance. Given the importance
of the Proms as a showcase for the BBC's own orchestras, it is timely that
the most important of them - the BBC Symphony Orchestra - should be playing
better now than at any point in the last 20 to 30 years. That is thanks to
Andrew Davis, whose reign as Chief Conductor has seen a consistent
improvement in the sharpness of the orchestra's playing. Even with a score
as massive as Gurrelieder he made sure that every detail told, never
allowing the music to degenerate into an overblown, post-Wagnerian wallow,
as it can. The result had clarity and grandeur, the latter enhanced by the
combined choirs of the BBC Singers, the BBC Symphony and Philharmonia
Choruses.
The soloists were a well-chosen group. Karita Mattila floated beautiful but
rather wordless sounds as the ultra-romantic Tove. Ann Murray and Philip
Langridge brought vivid characterisations to the Wood-Dove and Klaus the
Fool. Unfortunately, I heard little of Neil Breeden's Waldemar, who was on
the wrong side of the conductor from my seat. On an evening so heavy with
history it was fitting that Hans Hotter, the eloquent Speaker, should be
making his Proms debut at the age of 85.
At the second Prom on Saturday history took over. The programme was a
replica of that on 6 September 1900, a three-hour pot-pourri of light pieces
which we would only expect to encounter these days as encores, if at all. If
this is really what the Proms used to be like, they have changed beyond
recognition. Who said we are at risk of over-popularising classical music in
the 1990s? On that score the 1890s won hands down.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: A near perfect operetta - Siren Song
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dave is a sailor - a nice boy, innocent, a bit lonely on shipboard. In a
magazine, he sees a letter: 'Diana, 20, from Southampton, would like to
correspond . . .' He writes to her earnestly and gets a warm reply. Things
proceed swimmingly. Soon they are exchanging gifts and plans for their
future, though unfortunately Diana has a persistent illness - throat? chest?
lungs? - which frustrates their intended meetings.
Time and again, he finds her friendly brother Jonathan waiting at the
quayside instead, full of apologies and bonhomie . . . Here I apologise for
going no further. As produced at London's Almeida Theatre by Ian McDiarmid
with much ingenuity, Siren Song seems a near-perfect little operetta, or
musical comedy, and one doesn't want to know too much beforehand.
The original idea came from a novel by Gordon Honeycombe, and before that (I
believe) from real life. Nick Dear made a libretto of it, wry, dry and
extremely neat. The equally professional Jonathan Dove has set it to easy,
singable music, backed by minimalist figurations but essentially in
neo-Impressionist mode: imagine Ravel's 'Une Barque sur l'ocean' ACT'e'
stretched gently over 80 minutes. The denouement ACT1st'e' might have been
explored in painful depth, but Dove has preferred to leave well enough
alone; our thoughts can fill out the situation.
It is not easy to guess what the future of Siren Song might be. Too long for
a curtain-raiser, but it is a natural curtain-raiser; best to see it now in
this bright staging, and not worry about where it could go next.
Fresh-faced, fresh-voiced Niall Morris makes an ideal Dave (and surely, one
of these days, a West Side Story hero too). Tertia Sefton-Green sings Diana
meltingly, and Omar Ebrahim has a whale of a time with sleek, evasive
Jonathan.
Smaller roles are filled to the same standard; Paul McGrath is the judicious
conductor. This is delightful summer fare, in a single act that seems
shorter than it really is. Last performances tomorrow, Friday and Saturday;
whether before a lateish dinner or after an early one, Siren Song would be
equally tasty as an amuse-gueule or a bonne bouche.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: The decline and fall of elegance - Dress standards at
the Royal Opera House reflect a national malaise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In February 1946, after six years wartime service as a dance-hall, the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, once again had ballet in residence. On that
opening night, our national ballet won its laurels with The Sleeping Beauty.
As an occasion it seemed a public recognition that peace was truly back in
London, despite the bombed buildings, the unrelieved greyness of austerity.
The gloss and brightness of Beauty's design told us that whatever else had
changed - and here was our own ballet rather than some Ballet Russe troupe -
our greatest theatre was alive again.
The first night, redolent of such hopes, was also redolent of moth-balls.
The audience had dug out long dresses, dinner-jackets and tails, from
wartime hibernation. It was a show of faith and social manners that the war
might have eroded, but which still survived. 'Going to the Opera House' was
once more an occasion.
A half-century has changed many things, and not least that attitude towards
Covent Garden. Is it wrong to expect some effort to dress up to an Opera
House visit rather than down? In recent months I have been astonished at the
dimness and sometimes dinginess of the way people outfit themselves for what
must be an expensive night out at opera or ballet. No one today expects
dinner-jackets and long dresses, except for important galas. But should not
men make some attempt at neatness? Are a rumpled top and sagging slacks (the
'Sitting Up All Night in a Train' Look) the best a woman can contrive? I
record with some disbelief that latterly I have seen men in shirt-sleeves,
grubby jeans, trainers; women in tee-shirts, those fearsome leggings which
expose far too much thunderous haunch on all but the slimmest, and boots
that would not disgrace a despatch-rider. And a faux-fur poncho.
Grunge may be a style for the very young - and anything the young wear at
opera or ballet is right, because the important thing is that they should be
there - and Vivienne Westwood may make Hallowe'en outfits and call them
fashion, but going to our grandest theatre should imply some idea of
dressing for an event. Of course people come on from offices and work-place.
Of course they are there to see and not be seen. Yet is there not a
reciprocal exchange between stage and audience, where the public expects
artists to do of their best, and performers are entitled to believe that we
treat their activities with a respect which includes, perish the thought,
the courtesy of neat attire?
There is, implicit in all this, something about Covent Garden as it is
today. In other opera houses, there seems a perceptible audience response to
the look and ethos of the building itself. The public has a special identity
 -in behaviour and appearance - at the Palais Garnier or the Opera Bastille,
at the Mariinsky, or the Met and the State Theatre in New York, or in big
German houses. Opulent or smart-but-relaxed, grand or a bit
bourgeois-stuffy, they match their surroundings. As they always have, if
historical record is anything to go by.
Covent Garden offers little guidance to manners today. The fault is not
entirely of the theatre's making, but is owed to national policies that
believe that great music, great dance, must be paid for through the nose by
the consumer, and that a state owes no duty to its members to make such art
available, approachable, affordable. Hence the ever-present sense nowadays
at Covent Garden that every penny must be squeezed from the audience. Hence
the profusion of bars - the foyer now more like a pub than the entrance to
an opera house - and the omnipresent tables for the cold snack brigade. Is
there another nation in the world that eats and drinks so relentlessly as
the British as an adjunct to watching opera and ballet? There are even
people picnicking on the main stairs, spreading glasses and paper plates
around them. Munch, munch, munch] Sip, sip, sip] Pay, pay, pay]
This is the policy of a theatre which, in trying to be 'approachable' -
witness the egregiously vulgar Opera House magazine that is its latest PR
exercise - has become more like that hell-hole, Terminal 1 at Heathrow, than
a great opera house in a capital city. Small wonder, then, that some of the
audience dress for Heathrow rather than Covent Garden. It is time, as the
proposed Covent Garden closure looms and thoughts of the National Lottery
give arts administrators Golconda dreams, for the Royal Opera House to rid
itself of its dowdy air, and its cafeteria ideals. Its public might well
respond in kind.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Fujitsu lines up trials across a range of
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fujitsu, the computer and telecommunications manufacturer, plans to start
trials of what it claims will be Japan's first comprehensive multimedia
services.
In December, it will launch trial services such as near video-on-demand,
games and karaoke software delivery, local community information services
and telephone, facsimile and PC communications services. It will do so in
co-operation with five Japanese CATV companies in which it owns equity
stakes.
The aim of the trials is to evaluate what kinds of services consumers want,
how much they would be willing to pay for such services and how such
services can be made to become viable businesses, says Fujitsu.
While the company has recently been putting emphasis on its service
businesses, the latest venture takes it into new territory.
Fujitsu, which has one of the most well-defined strategies for multimedia
among Japanese electronics manufacturers, says it hopes to use the trial to
gain experience in the management of urban CATV companies.
The increased involvement in cable TV management and in rolling out
multimedia services through cable TV would also support the hardware
business of the company. Fujitsu is a significant manufacturer of much of
the equipment that goes into providing multimedia services, from central
computers that control the systems, to transmission equipment and PCs, which
could act as the home terminals.
However, if the trials lead to a fully-fledged multimedia service, it could
put Fujitsu in direct competition with NTT, the telecommunications company
which has scheduled its own multimedia trials and which is a major customer
of Fujitsu.
For the trial services, Fujitsu plans to use equipment that already exists
at the studios of the co-operating CATV companies, with additional equipment
introduced as necessary.
The company stresses though that it plans to use the best equipment
available, regardless of manufacturer.
Near video-on-demand will be provided by using several channels with
staggered starting times for programs. These will be shown simultaneously

FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Checking in, and not checking out - Robert Peel, the
head of Britain's second largest hotel chain, tells Katharine Campbell why
he has stuck with it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In what line of business would a suave and successful Old Etonian be
labelled 'a rough diamond' and 'a Gerald Ratner who can count'? The British
hotel business, apparently, where the four star hoteliers speak only to the
five star hoteliers, and the five star hoteliers speak only to God.
Robert Peel, chief executive of Mount Charlotte Investments, has no patience
with such nonsense. Hating 'pretentiousness and bullshit', this
chain-smoking, workaholic iconoclast, who tucks himself away most of the
week in Leeds, and relaxes equally happily at the Savoy and Tramps, is a bit
of a puzzle to his stuffier rivals.
With a portfolio of 112 hotels ranging from the no star to the five star,
Mount Charlotte Thistle is Britain's second largest chain after Forte. Yet
it is hardly a household name, not least because Peel, 47, sees no need to
court publicity. 'You get a fair hearing if no-one knows you.'
Peel is likely to be forced into the news rather more in the next few years.
The group has just embarked on a sweeping modernisation programme,
concentrating on the four star business market; its boss is confident that
finances will improve as Britain emerges from recession. Rumours of a stock
market flotation will consequently never be far away.
An intuitive hotel-keeper who betrays a passion for service while
brandishing a sharp knife in the direction of the most modest outlay, Peel
is an eccentric existing outside both the hotel establishment and the City -
his pukka upbringing notwithstanding.
It was at home that he first learned to love the business. Early childhood
was spent in Egypt, but the family lost its cotton fortune in the aftermath
of Suez and his father returned to London, turning his hand variously to the
restaurant trade, pig farming and antiques.
After Eton, Peel headed for Paris, and a series of menial jobs in grand
hotels. Back in London, his formative apprenticeship was at the Hyde Park
Hotel, acquired in 1968, while he was there, by Trust Houses (which merged
with Forte in 1970).
Passing through the Grosvenor House Hotel as conference and banqueting
manager, and the old Quaglinos restaurant as general manager, Peel was
poised to go to Johannesburg for THF when his elder brother made a
suggestion.
Then at stockbrokers Fielding Newson-Smith, Charles Peel was acting for a
group of institutions acquiring Mount Charlotte Investments from the rubble
of the Slater Walker empire. Originally established to mine gold in
Rhodesia, the company was by 1976 a curious collection of seaside hotels,
pubs and nightclubs in search of a manager. Peel liked the idea, and swapped
his luxury hotels for the 'serious shock' of a headquarters in Leeds and
some months living in a group-owned old people's home.
From there he embarked on just over a decade of helter-skelter expansion,
turning a loss of around Pounds 1m to profits of Pounds 38.8m by 1989. Then
he made what many would claim was his biggest mistake: he bought Thistle
Hotels from Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
The attraction was a branded chain to bolt on to the mish-mash of properties
already accumulated. 'I effectively lost my company because of that deal,'
Peel acknowledges, but reminds me that he was under 'enormous pressure' from
his banks and shareholders to make a move because they thought his gearing
too low.
'With the benefit of hindsight, I bought at the top of the market, yes,' he
says. A year later, however, up to his ears in debt, Peel was forced to sell
out to Brierley Investments for just Pounds 644m; the New Zealanders later
sold on 30 per cent to the Singaporean government.
Did he consider leaving? 'It's the same as if you consider leaving your
family; it's a big decision,' muses Peel, who has never married.
As it happens, he gets on famously with Paul Collins, Brierley's chief
executive, and feels a seat on the main board in Wellington has expanded his
horizons. Reaching for the positive spin on having a boss, he says New
Zealand has proved an important new market, too.
But the Gulf War and deep recession put a severe strain on the relationship.
Even now the group's financial performance is far from impressive. Peel
dismisses recently released 1993 post-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m, on sales
of Pounds 214m, as 'peanuts' compared with what he thinks the group is
capable.
That is why he denies persistent rumours that Mount Charlotte is ripe for
flotation. Collins adds, in cricketing style: 'What we need is runs on the
board. Any price at which we might float now would severely undervalue
future prospects.' It also needs to attend to gearing; even in last year's
favourable rate environment, 88 per cent of trading profits were absorbed in
interest payments.
Financial travails delayed until early last year plans to upgrade many of
the Mount Charlotte properties into Thistles, but by 1996, the aim is to
have almost two thirds of the hotels with that branding.
Even Peel realised he would need to make a bit of noise about this
'repositioning', so he hired the well-regarded Peter Bates, previously at
the Savoy, as his new sales and marketing director. 'He needed more people
who could stand up to him,' remarks one observer. Bates, who arrived last
November, says there are regular slanging matches.
Yet the entrepreuneurial gifts that carried him through the 1980s will not
be enough to take the group much further. With its 14,300 rooms, Mount
Charlotte needs more structured management. Instead, Peel still carries most
of the company around in his head, and, aside from his senior operations
director Norbert Petersen, there have been very few he has really trusted.
He will still get involved in the tiniest detail. 'I like to know this pipe
goes from there to there. I'm annoying like that,' he agrees. He has even
taken to tape-recording staff as they negotiate discounts so that he can
improve their technique.
But there are limits even to his energy, and his extraordinary involvement
has its impractical side. 'He complains that he can't keep up with me. I
tell him, you don't have to keep up,' Bates observes. Peel has, of course,
heard the criticism many times. 'I see margins go with every act of
delegation. If I can do it quicker, I'd rather do it,' he says simply.
One can see he frets about his much-prized cost-controlling abilities being
compromised by building an infrastructure. In his personal life, he 'never
has a clue' what he spends, but at Mount Charlotte he signs every cheque
over Pounds 300, and worries about such things as whether he can catch his
own water on those acres of roofing. Necessary though he knows it is, he
winces when he mentions that the salesforce has doubled from 40 to 80 in the
past six months.
As and when Thistle Hotels plc - as it is likely to be renamed in the next
year or two - comes to the market, investors will look for greater
management depth, and strategic brain. They will ask questions both about
the debt and Peel's unsinkable optimism that business spending will bounce
back more or less to pre-recession levels.
And, while they will applaud the fact that Peel recognises he lacks the
infrastructure to expand into European hotels, they will point out that that
is where his competitors think the growth will come from.
He will not pass comment on last year's rumour that Rocco Forte offered him
the position of chief executive at his former stable. But he would
presumably just hate having to knuckle under in a huge organisation of that
kind. That is why the man who at 30 wanted to run the biggest hotel chain in
the world is not the next Charles Forte.

FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Fiat snaps up Renault's Caperan - Names in the News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat Auto has wooed Loic Caperan, formerly Renault's commercial director for
France, to Turin, where he will become the Italian carmaker's overall
commercial director from January 1, writes Andrew Hill.
This could be a good time to join Fiat Auto; it has just launched the Punto,
to wide acclaim, and has plans to produce 18 new models by 1996. The Fiat
group, after heavy losses in 1993, expects to break even in 1994.
Caperan's decision to leave Renault was announced in May, after nearly 25
years there. He had spent five years as commercial director for France, and
was reported to be frustrated that Renault could not make room for him to
develop within the company. During his career with Renault, he worked in
Germany, Austria and for a time was director-general of Renault UK.
In the highly competitive automotive sector, the move is certainly not as
dramatic as the now notorious job-switch of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
the former General Motors director who joined Volkswagen of Germany.
But analysts have interpreted Caperan's appointment as a further sign of the
internationalisation of Fiat, which has seen its share of the domestic
market decline over the last decade and is seeking to increase its share
abroad.
At Fiat, Caperan, 51, will initially work alongside the current commercial
director, Guglielmo Chiarle, who is to move on within the Fiat group at the
end of the year. Caperan will then take on full responsibility for the Fiat,
Lancia and Alfa Romeo marques around the world.

FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Schacht fulfils his long-term strategy - Names in
the News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision last week by Henry Schacht to hand over the reigns of Cummins
Engine to his long-time friend and colleague James Henderson is just another
example of the vision that has characterised Schacht's 21-year term as ceo,
writes Laurie Morse.
Once described as a 'prairie patrician' because of his Harvard MBA-style of
management at the Indiana company, Schacht opted for long-term solutions as
he battled against foreign competition, loss of domestic market share, and a
hostile takeover bid (from Hanson) during the 1980s.
His strategy, which included a costly investment in engines for mid-size and
smaller trucks and in technology that allowed Cummins engines to exceed US
clean air standards for automotive emissions, resulted in long years of
losses.
However, the long-term investments began to pay off in 1991 and last year
Cummins earned Dollars 177.1m on sales of Dollars 4.25bn. The company has a
much more diversified product base than it had a decade ago, has formed
strategic international alliances, and is profiting from a surge in truck
orders as the US economy recovers. What better time, said Schacht, than to
take care of a most important duty - an orderly leadership transition. 'I
started talking with our board in 1992. We realised that in 1994 both Jim
and I would be 60, and that we needed to avoid a double transition.'
Henderson, who has managed side-by-side as chief operating officer with
Schacht for two decades, will take over as Cummins ceo. He intends to retire
at 65, so has 5 years to put his mark on the company. Schacht intends to
continue in his post as chairman, and Theodore 'Tim' Solso, who is 47, will
become chief operating officer.
In the meantime, Schacht has no plans to slow down. 'I will be pursuing
full-time the strategic alliances we've been building overseas,' he says.

FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Ear to the ground at CS First Boston - Names in the
News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been clear for some time that Allen Wheat was not going to let
himself become another casualty of CS First Boston's notorious in-fighting,
writes Richard Waters. Last year, this newspaper was rash enough to question
whether Wheat had been sidelined in the latest upheaval at the Swiss-owned
investment bank; interpreting the politics inside CS First Boston has always
been like Kremlin-watching in the days of the Soviet empire. Wheat's blunt
response was to point out who makes all the money in the bank.
These days, it looks like Wheat's staying- (and earning-) power are carrying
him closer to the top. In May, he was given a seat on the board of CS
Holdings, the investment bank's ultimate parent. At the same time, John
Hennessy, CS First Boston's chairman, relinquished his board seat.
No one in the securities industry questions Wheat's professional skills. He
was largely responsible for building Bankers Trust's derivatives business
before jumping ship in 1990. Since then, he has created another leading
derivatives firm in CS Financial Products, which is half-owned by CS First
Boston and Credit Suisse, another part of the group. And last year he moved
from London to New York (the new seat of power at the investment bank, which
used to be run as separate US and European fiefdoms) as president and ceo.
Modern-day Kremlin watchers should beware of writing off Hennessy too soon,
though. Last year, he mounted an amazing internal coup to take full control
of CS First Boston. Casualties along the way included Archibald Cox (his
former number two in New York) and Hans-Jorg Rudloff (the bank's former
London head.)
CS First Boston warns against reading anything into the reshuffle of board
seats at the holding company. The presidents of each of the group's
operating companies - rather than the chairmen - are represented on the
board, it points out. So when Hennessy handed over his president's title to
Wheat, it was only natural that the new man get the board seat as well.
Perhaps. But experience shows few things at the bank are ever as simple.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Sikes sees electronic pie in the sky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred Sikes, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, last
week denounced most of the talk about electronic superhighways as hype,
fantasy and crystal ball gazing.
He told a Financial Times multimedia conference in London that, as a result,
many companies were defying the law of gravity 'by having multiples of
earnings before there are any earnings, or even well conceived predictions
of any.'
The former FCC chairman, now president of Hearst New Media and Technology,
said that as far as the eye could see television revenues would continue to
be spread across broadcasting, cable, video and, in some countries,
satellite delivery.
'I am also convinced that, over the long run, today's retailers will capture
the bulk of home-shopping revenues, not the network providers,' Sikes said.
Change would almost certainly be evolutionary and much of television would
remain the same - although gradually much more would be available through
the creation of advanced networks.
Sikes forecast that: 'Advanced networks will increasingly come along with
virtually unlimited capacity, supported by consumers-friendly search tools.
The viewer will be master.'
There could be thousands of new information providers, although some would
never get off the ground and others would remain niche players.
He predicted that the information and programme content equivalents of
companies such as Apple and Microsoft would also develop.
'I can't tell you for sure how advanced networks are going to develop or how
many there will be,' said Sykes, who added he thought there would be more
than one.
'I do know that bandwidth (channel capacity) will be cheap and that the days
of scarcity are over,' he concluded.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Blue-print for IBM in Europe - Hans-Olaf
Henkel outlines his view of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent fortunes of IBM in Europe have ranged from mixed to dire, but
Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of IBM Europe, believes that the liberalisation
of telecoms networks offers a 'tremendous opportunity'.
Henkel was a member of the Bangemann group of industry leaders which
reported to last month's Corfu EU summit on the essential steps to create an
'information society' in Europe. His view of the future is black-and-white.
With open networks architecture and strong telecommunications competition,
Europe will forge ahead. Without them, it will languish. He takes it for
granted that high tech is the key to competitive advantage.
'Information technology will change the way we Europeans work, and fast,' he
says. 'We still have 12 telecoms markets in Europe: they are fragmented
mainly for protectionist reasons - in terms of companies and standards. We
have to change that.'
'Governments have a key role to play, they can put Europe at the head of the
information society or they can make us a follower behind the US.' Pressed
on the precise role of government, Henkel sees it mainly in terms of
liberalising markets and harmonising standards.
Should governments set targets for connecting public sector institutions,
such as schools and hospitals, to the new networks? 'We did not consider
that specifically,' responds Henkel. They would have to be reasonable
targets. The main role of government in this area is to set an example.'
He is an enthusiast for teleworking, and believes it will soon change
working practices radically. 'The EU should use teleworking as the principal
mode for its translation service. Why can't most of them work from home?'
Henkel accepts that there is a 'certain amount of hype' around. 'We have got
to find applications. Video-on-demand will be one of the first, but it is
proceeding slowly.'
He is nonetheless convinced that the future lies in networks, not in disc
technologies such as CD-rom. 'If the telecoms networks were not so costly,
CD-rom would not be attractive. From a global economic standpoint, CD-rom is
an outdated means of transporting data.'
What is IBM doing to hasten the information age? He cites the company's
flagship project to provide 'superhighway' services between Bonn and Berlin,
allowing Berlin to function as Germany's capital while a large proportion of
the country's bureaucrats remain in Bonn.
Other, smaller scale, projects include putting the entire Vatican library
on-line, and an on-line video trial with the University of Geneva. He claims
IBM is leading the industry in the adaptation of ATM technology for the next
generation of hardware.
On standardisation, Henkel's recommendation is for more 'user groups and
consortia to develop market-oriented specifications'.
'Take Internet with its 25m users. Whether you like it or not, it is a
standard. It needs improving in terms of privacy and security - but let's
say it is a de facto standard, and make sure it fulfils the industry's
needs.'
Henkel sees the UK as a model for the EU's telecoms industry. 'On the
Bangemann group we all felt the UK was getting ahead of the rest of the
continent. The first thing is competition which will result in lower rates,
and the competitors will also find the capital for the new infrastructure.'
Who will provide the competitors to established telecoms operators on the
continent? 'It is obvious to me that utility companies are the most natural
competitors in the telecoms market. They already have networks, and the
rights of way needed to lay new ones,' says Henkel.
For IBM, increasing PC penetration in Europe is the key. It estimates that
in the US there are 34 PCs per 100 citizens, in Europe 10 per 100. 'That is
the key business opportunity.'
Whether IBM is best placed to exploit it is, of course, another matter. 'The
whole playing field is being changed. It will be increasingly difficult to
separate IT from telecoms. But we are the pioneers,' Henkel insists.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: NBC financial video network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US network television company, plans to launch a new desktop video
services for the financial community in September. It will do so through its
business television division, CNBC.
The new services will use normal terrestrial TV to deliver to personal
computers news stories that might affect the financial markets.
The new services, NBC Desktop Video, will also provide on-demand video
retrieval of items already broadcast, and enable subscribers to send their
own multimedia information to other subscribers on the NBC network.
Trials have already begun in the US before the September launch. The service
will be introduced to Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.
NBC already delivers specialist desktop information to the financial
services industry, with the launch last year of Private Financial Network.
Tom Rogers, president of NBC cable and business development, says that since
the launch of PFN 'the need for live video coverage of market-moving events,
linked with a retrieval component, has become even more important to our
customers in the financial market-place.'
In the UK, Reuters, the news and information group, has recently launched a
service of breaking news to City terminals, although without retrieval
capability so far.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Sorrell's WPP has joined the million dollar Electronic Assess Study
in the US - one of the most significant attempts so far to find out what the
electronic highway is actually going to be used for.
WPP, the world's largest advertising group, whose agencies include Ogilvy &amp;
Mather and J Walter Thompson, is the only marketing communications company
to sponsor the study, which should continue beyond 1994.
'We believe our stock in trade is a deep understanding of the consumer. And
our exclusive access to the findings of the study - exclusive, that is, in
our line of work - ought to further sharpen our focus on consumers,' Sorrell
said last week.
The study, other sponsors of which include US West , Bell South, British
Telecommunications, Fidelity Investments and the US Postal Service, will
look at both supply and demand.
Seventy companies will be asked about the services they would like to supply
down an electronic highway. Researchers will also talk at length with 1,400
households to learn everything they can about what people are likely to
want, and how much they will pay for it. One part of the research will be
specifically about advertising.
Sorrell believes that whatever form the information superhighway takes,
interactive marketing - any back-and-forth communication between a buyer and
a seller - will be in there some-where.
The WPP chief executive believes that, no matter how, or at what speed, the
technology develops, consumers will in the end be sitting in front of
computers, television sets or videophones ordering, receiving and paying for
a wide range of information, entertainment and other services.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Why AVCs should be a low priority for a number
of senior executives - Finance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Pensions are one of the most tax-efficient ways of saving, which is why many
employees who have not made full contributions to their pension scheme are
encouraged to top them up.
The two main ways of doing so are with additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs), which form part of the main company scheme and free-standing AVCs
(FSAVCs), sold independently by life offices and some unit trust groups.
AVCs and FSAVCs are the most tax-efficient method of increasing your company
pension, because they attract full tax relief on contributions. The fund
also enjoys tax-free growth. However, John Shuttleworth, an actuary at
accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that for senior executives earning over
about Pounds 100,000 a year who joined their company scheme before March 17
1987, AVCs should be low on their list of choices.
Their AVCs either buy a taxed pension or allow the executive to take cash
from his AVCs, so avoiding commuting - taking cash from - his company
pension. But either way, the tax-free lump sum is not increased. Directly or
indirectly, the AVCs buy a taxed pension. So the advantages of AVCs for
these executives, are exemption from income and capital gains tax on the
underlying investments and any fall in the executive's marginal rate of tax
in retirement.
However, Shuttleworth says that the risk of tax rates increasing before the
executive comes to take his pension is too high to be worth taking. If
higher-rate tax rises from the present 40 per cent to 60 per cent, the
executive will have received tax relief at 40 per cent but will be taxed on
the pension at 60 per cent.
'In the present low tax environment, it is better to take cash now rather
than to be in a cash deferral plan such as an AVC. For many pre-March 17,
1987 executives, the potential gain relative to other investments in paying
AVCs is low, but the downside can be high. Other investments which do not
carry the risks of a potentially poor return as well as giving greater
accessibility in the case of a need for funds, can give a return as good as
that with AVCs.' These include Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts, Personal
Equity Plans and some National Savings products. Other investment, such as
unit trusts also compare well.
AVCs still remain a potentially good deal for two groups: those below senior
management level who are higher-rate taxpayers but expect to retire as
lower-rate taxpayers. They are receiving tax relief on contributions at 40
per cent but their pension will be taxed at the lower rate (assuming that
any future increase in basic rate tax is below 40 per cent).
Most employees who joined their company scheme after March 16, 1987 should
also benefit, says Shuttleworth, since as a rule of thumb, about a quarter
of each AVC emerges as tax-free cash, on which there is a genuine tax saving
of up to 40 per cent.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: At the Louvre - Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one thing Paris probably does not need it is another cafe: but
there is always room for somewhere special such as Cafe Marly, the new
brasserie in the heart of the Louvre Museum.
Cafe Marly is the brainchild of Gilbert Costes, whose Philippe
Starck-designed Cafe Costes in Les Halles was one of the hottest places in
Paris during the mid-1980s but has since deteriorated into a tourist trap.
His new venture boasts one of the best locations in the city: buried in the
Richelieu wing, the part of the Louvre that once housed the French finance
ministry but reopened last autumn as a spectacular new extension to the
museum.
Through a window looking into Cour Marly, the diners in the Marly restaurant
have a stunning view of the sculpture liberated from the royal palace
gardens by the 1789 revolutionaries. The Cour Marly is one of the palatial
glazed courtyards created by IM Pei, the Chinese-American architect
responsible for the Louvre renovation scheme.
The brasserie windows overlook Pei's Louvre Pyramid, while the 18th century
interior has been restyled in an uncompromisingly contemporary combination
of black, red and gold.
The best views, however, are from the terrace which looks out over the whole
Cour Napoleon, from the Fritz Langesque tourists lining up by the Pyramid to
the Tuileries Gardens.
As for the menu, the Marly offers the standard, if unspectacular fare dished
up at other fashionable Paris brasseries, such as Cafe de Flore or Brasserie
Lipp on Boulevard Saint-Germain the other side of the Seine.
The price of the food is surprisingly reasonable with lunch for two totting
up to around FFr400 (Dollars 76).
But drinks on the terrace are as absurdly expensive as anywhere else in
Paris - even if the Marly is, of course, the only place to throw in a bird's
eye view of the Pyramid for free.
Cafe Marly, Cour Napoleon, 75001 Paris. Tel: (331) 4926 0660

FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Top cars to hire for that special occasion -
Driving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those special hire car occasions in the UK, you have to admit that a
Ford Escort will not really do. Weddings, birthdays, self-indulgent weeks
off - these demand something a little more demonstrative than the average
small family hatchback that is meat and drink to the usual car hire firm.
Having said that, of course, Hertz are running a special offer of a Ford
Escort cabriolet - not a car to be sneezed at in these summer months - for
Pounds 99 per day, inclusive. You must, however, be at least 30; and the
offer closes at the end of September. To be frank, it's a start, but only a
start - especially when you consider the alternatives.
Wykehams of South Kensington, for instance, will hire you something
altogether more adventurous: a Morgan Plus 4, for only Pounds 496.87 per
week, insurance not included. And if this true Brit fails to excite you,
they also do Alfa Romeo Spyders at the same price.
At the other end of the scale, Alan Day Car Rental, based in Swiss Cattage,
will let you have an awesome Mercedes S300 for a mere Pounds 1280 per week
(plus Pounds 19 per day insurance supplement), or the even more desirable
SL280 sports model for Pounds 1575 per week. And for the determinedly
eccentric, a Land Rover Defender TDi can be borrowed from 4x4 Motors of
Bromsgrove, for only Pounds 320 per week, if you absolutely must drive up a
corrie or negotiate a peat bog.
If you have a full motorcycle licence, of course, then the place to go is
Scootabout, on the Albert Embankment. Its list of rentable motorcycles is
too long to explore in detail but, if you need to look like Mickey Rourke
for a few days and have no regular machine, they can hire you anything from
a Kawasaki GT550 for Pounds 150 per week, up to a Kawasaki GIR 1000 (with
appropriately mind-blowing performance) for only Pounds 280 per week.
If the truth be told, however, the doyen of exotic car hire must be Modena
Car Rentals of Birmingham. Its list of rentables includes everything from a
BMW 7-series, to a Ferrari Testarossa and a Bentley Turbo. In between lie
such startling pieces of machinery as a TVR Griffith, a Honda NSX and a
Porsche 911 Carrera.
The prices naturally reflect the rarity of these vehicles, and while the
cheapest weekly rate is Pounds 50 (for a Mitsubishi Shogun, of all things),
the top rate (for the Testarossa) is Pounds 3783.50, inclusive.
Like all the other car hire firms, of course, Modena will quote you a daily
rate, but at just under Pounds 600 for the Testarossa, this may be something
of a false economy. Given that it costs considerably more for a day than a
Morgan for an entire week, you can see that the Testarossa is not to be
undertaken lightly. If, on the other hand, it gives your bank manager a
seizure when he catches you in it, it can only be money well spent.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Wherever I lay my hat - Style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem with men's hats, is that it's hard to wear them without seeming
ironical. Hats, like bow-ties and mustard-coloured waistcoats, aren't so
much clothes as items from the dressing-up cupboard; things which make a
self-referential statement, rather than just keep the sun off your head.
Which is probably why the classic Panama and the baseball cap are the two
most popular hats around at present: you can just about get away with one or
the other, without having to explain your motives.
As is usually the case with hats, Lock's of St. James has some of the nicest
items. Its broad-brimmed planter's Panama costs Pounds 67: this is both
functional and stylish and a change from the traditional folding Panama with
its ridge (or optimo) crown and narrower brim.
Christy's of London also make a very decent selection of Panamas and Panama
variations, many of which are can be found at Selfridges and Austin Reed, at
prices between Pounds 30 and Pounds 60.
But what if you want to break free from the masses and make that big
statement? What if you want to look larger than life? Well, back at Austin
Reed, there is a very fetching Burma Bush hat (made by Austin Reed itself),
in muddy olive felt and with a kind of fisherman's fly feather tucked into
the band. It looks indestructible and it costs Pounds 79.
Even better, perhaps, is the RM Williams Australian Outback clothing store,
a little way up Regent's Street from Austin Reed. It has a terrific range of
tough-guy, outdoors headgear, including the Pastoralist (which looks a bit
like Lester Young's pork pie hat, but is none the worse for that) and the
splendid Cattleman, which is built on an heroic scale and should outlast its
owner. Both cost Pounds 65.
Or, back at Lock's, there is something for the truly self-dramatising: a
vast white sunshade job, wide-brimmed and with a coral-coloured band, made
by Borsalino of Italy. Admittedly, it has more than a whiff of Cosa Nostra
about it, but it is a beautiful object - and the fact that Lock's is
prepared to stock it is a guarantee of its quality. Sheer extravagance, for
Pounds 97.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Paperback writers - Reading Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J D F JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So you're off on holiday this week and you haven't had a moment to think
about the paperbacks you'll need for the beach. And, truth to tell, for most
of the year you don't have much time for fiction.
Nothing too ambitious, then. No, not Tolstoy again this year, and you'll
resist the present craze for George Eliot after the success of Middlemarch
on TV. Nor can you face the new young Tolstoy of India, Vikram Seth, whose A
Suitable Boy at 1,474 pages would fill at least a fortnight (Phoenix Pounds
8.99).
Something more like fun? One solution would be John le Carre's The Night
Manager (Coronet Pounds 5.99), the spy-master's latest novel and very good
indeed with its globe-trotting tale of the hotelier who sets out to track
down 'the worst man in the world', an international arms-dealing tycoon
straight out of the pages of this newspaper. If you are a Wilbur Smith fan,
in company with countless millions, think twice before you grab the latest
River God (Pan Pounds 5.99) - not because it's no good, but because it is a
total departure from his usual territory of African bush and sundowners.
This is Ancient Egypt, fun and games among the Pharoahs. The switch may not
be as surprising as it sounds when you remember that Rider Haggard was an
Egyptologist in his spare time.
The last-but-one Barbara Vine is also at the airport - Asta's Book (Penguin
Pounds 4.99). Vine is of course another name for Ruth Rendell, and is a
leisurely saga based on a Scandinavian woman's diary throughout the century.
It is rather slow and fairly long, which may not matter by the pool.
Last year's Booker Prize winner, Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha, is now out in
paperback (Minerva Pounds 5.99). A small boy in Dublin, wonderfully done -
but it won't last you more than a couple of days.
So try Bill Clinton's favourite, Walter Mosley. The President is right on
this one: Mosley is a splendid addition to the American private eye
tradition established for all time by Raymond Chandler. Mosley's hero is
Easy Rawlins, an amateur black gumshoe returned from the Second War to the
Los Angeles ghetto. So far there have been three books: Devil in a Blue
Dress, A Red Death and White Butterfly (available from Serpent's Tail, Pan
or both) Utterly distinctive; well worth trying.
And if you've finished them all by Tuesday week? You could move back into
serious literature - Picador have brought out as paperback batch of the
modern 'Westerns' of Cormac McCarthy, who scored in this country with All
The Pretty Horses. But don't confuse him with Zane Grey - the comparison in
this case would be with William Faulkner.
Does that sound a bit alarming? Then all praise to Penguin which has just
issued The Adventures of Dickson McCunn by John Buchan (Pounds 8.99), a
sequence 70-years-old and so much less known than the ubiquitous adventures
of Richard Hannay. Here are the Gorbals Die-Hards born again, with their
patron, the retired and romantic Glaswegian grocer: Huntingtower, Castle Gay
and The House of the Four Winds in one volume. Pure bliss] The perfect
escape from the office, and from 1994.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Every little beat of your heart - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If employees are exposed to asbestos, noise pollution or bad office
conditions at work, companies are expected to take responsibility for
resulting health problems. But even if a company removes all risks from the
workplace that is no guarantee it will suddenly have a healthy staff.
As far back as 1990, National Power, of the UK, decided to launch 'Get
Healthy Stay Fit', a voluntary health screening programme for its employees.
It is one of several companies, including Marks and Spencer, Zeneca and
Cable &amp; Wireless, that provide voluntary testing for health risks. Such
programmes are designed not only to identify specific health problems ,but
to alert employees to future risks as a result of practices such as smoking,
drinking alcohol and eating certain kinds of foods.
At National Power, the management and the occupational health department
decided a screening programme could provide potential financial benefits to
the group. They hoped to reduce the incidence of premature retirement or
long-term absence from work, and boost company morale by projecting a
'caring company' philosophy.
The programme is open to all employees, who are seen by occupational health
nurses based at each company site. Before a screening appointment, an
employee is sent an extensive lifestyle questionnaire.
At the appointment, nurses review the questionnaire and offer advice on how
an individual might improve his or her health habits.
During the check-up the nurses analyse 14 biochemical indices pinpointing
the likes of cholesterol and glucose levels and bone disorders. They also
test the patient's vision, lungs , hearing and blood pressure.
If the employee agrees, the results are sent to the patient's GP. Nurses are
advised to send any employees who test positive for diabetes, high blood
pressure or visual defects to their GPs for immediate consultation. But not
every abnormality detected will be referred to the GP.
'We are trying to make a judgment as to whether someone is sick or not,'
says Dr John McCaul, chief medical officer at National Power. 'We do not
want to pass people willy-nilly on to the GP if they are healthy.'
Each year McCaul compiles the results of all screenings completed within the
company and distributes the statistics to executives and site managers. No
employee can be identified in the statistics.
But the effectiveness of a screening programme - the actual improvement in
the health of the employees - is difficult to measure, because employees who
volunteer for screening may be health conscious and considering lifestyle
changes anyway, while those who stay away may have the most severe problems.
'If you are going to try to get people to improve their lifestyle, you are
probably going to have do something more than just send out a general
invitation for people to come in and find out about their health,' says Dr
Anne Cockcroft, director of occupational health at the Royal Free Hospital.
'In order to provide screening programmes in the best possible way we need
to think about how we target them.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Sport: Pavarotti in the ballpark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So the two glamour teams finally got it together, serenaded by the three
heavenly voices. This was as it should be. This was the perfect conjunction
 -the one, perhaps, that was dreamed of on the day, more than four years
ago, when a prophetic soul at the BBC decided that nothing less than Luciano
Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma was good enough for the World Cup.
How ridiculous it seemed, at the beginning of Italia '90, that such a voice
should be swelling our emotions to such a pitch in preparation for a
qualifying match between Ireland and Egypt. What was the BBC playing at? Had
it never heard of INXS? Who was this rogue romantic, this complicated
personality who knew about football yet knew about opera, and who believed
that Puccini could provide an anthem for the terraces?
Whoever they were, they took a bold and beautiful decision. They may have
only taken it because the World Cup was being held in Italy. Whatever the
reason, the decision expressed a belief that football could be something
majestic and, unlikely as that then seemed, football became something
majestic: it lived up to its signature tune. By the end of Italia '90,
Nessun Dorma was no longer inappropriate. It was the only accompaniment
possible.
Even when the football let the music down - as it did, inevitably, and never
more so than in the nasty little final between Germany and Argentina - that
did not matter. The soft, liquid sensations aroused by the music had
massaged and oiled the uptight emotions of the football fan, and reminded
him of the greater gratifications that the game can give. Such as those that
I felt on the evening before England played in the World Cup semi-final,
when I sat in a pub and felt an unspoken kinship with every person there; if
the sound of Nessun Dorma had filled the bar I think we might all have
dissolved together in tears.
The music revealed an image of the game beyond the narrow, banal thing that
English football so often is. This image had been forgotten during the dour,
violent years of Heysel and Hillsborough, and was lost again during the
tense, farcical years of Graham Taylor. Now, however, it can be found far
more easily, because it has been identified forever with the sound of a
heavenly voice.
But the opera factor did not merely reveal an image of football. It helped
to change its image. If, in the summer of 1990, Gary Lineker and Paul
Gascoigne brought the game to a wider audience, so too did Pavarotti and
Puccini: they took football into the world beyond itself, a place where it
had not been for some time.
So many people then thought of football as something that could never be
important to them, only to people as unlike them as possible - obsessives,
hooligans, sickos, men. But the fact that this music, something which was
part of their world, could be proudly heralding the way into the world of
football, helped to sanction their emotional engagement with the World Cup.
Who is to say that they would have wept with Paul Gascoigne if Pavarotti had
not already cleared a path through their tear ducts?
These people have not all stayed with football, but however brief their love
affair with the game, it has had its effect. Who, just over four years ago,
would have imagined that intellectuals would want to deconstruct the image
of a daft, over-hyped Geordie? Or that guests at upmarket dinner parties
would desribe the eruption of Ian Wright onto a football pitch with the
verve that they had previously used to conjure the image of MacBeth upon an
RSC stage? Or that bright young women would be proclaiming their passion for
Ryan Giggs across the pages of quality newspapers?
This didn't all happen because Pavarotti sang. But the moment, sometime
during Italia '90, when Nessun Dorma ceased to sound out of place and began
to sound magnificently right, was, I believe, the moment that it all became
possible.
And yet, for all that, the image of football as something splendid, stylish
and emotionally unifying remains a dream. The dream took on life in 1966, it
came to half-life in 1990, and last season Manchester United gave it some
life again; but still the English seem never quite to believe in it. For all
their love of the game, they seem to think of football as a source of
perverse, not pure, pleasure.
They are passionately defensive about it, but in truth they have a low
opinion of it, low expectations from it. Is that why England don't play like
Italy or Brazil?
In those countries, nobody would think it remarkable that clever types,
smart types, female types, have decided to fall in love with football. The
only thing that would surprise them was that such people had not done so
earlier; for in Italy and Brazil, everybody loves football, and this is
because they see their game differently.
The English dream of football is their reality. It makes no difference how
badly their teams play; nothing can make the game anything less than
naturally majestic. The faces of the Italian and Brazilian fans reflect the
fact that football is part of the whole of their lives. Compared with the
strained, inhibited expression of the English fan, they look full of
emotion, free with it, just as they would be if they were hearing Nessun
Dorma. And they do hear it, every time they see a football passed around the
pitch: the two glamour teams and the three heavenly voices inhabit the same
world.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Architecture: Let's start blowing things up - Colin Amery
backs John Gummer's move on the man-made environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Gummer, the UK environment secretary, last week launched a debate on
how Britain's man-made environment can be improved. His speech to the Royal
Institute of Chartered Surveyors was accompanied by a discussion document,
in which he promised to demolish his own department's hideous three-towered,
1960s concrete office building in Marsham Street in Westminster.
Is this the outward and physical sign of an inner conversion away from the
horrors of modernism to the values of civilised architecture? Is Mr Gummer a
latter day Pugin? We know he has converted to catholicism, but is he also
poised to be as passionate and polemical as Pugin in the pursuit of quality?
It is worth looking hard at the document because it bears the marks of the
minister's own hand and, if that same hand succeeds in demolishing the 1960s
horrors of Marsham Street, we have to take the minister seriously.
In his preface to the consultation document he rightly says that
architecture is the only art form that is inescapable. He also points out
that it is not architecture alone that shapes our world but other important
factors like air quality, noise, roads, open spaces, street furniture, trees
and walls. But it is architecture and design that creates many of the visual
boundaries of our world and there is a responsibility on all who build to
improve the quality of that world.
There is a strong moral tone in much of what is written in this document and
it has a note of the new political correctness about it. The key words are
'quality' and 'sustainability' - both of them subjective and both of them
hard to define and achieve.
The miracle is to see any minister using these words at all, and Mr Gummer
uses them with the pleasurable anticipation. He always reminds me of 'The
Water Babies'. His philosophy is, 'do as you would be done by'. This
minister eats the beef to prove there is no such thing as mad cow disease.
This minister will demolish his own offices to encourage others to do the
same.
There are key points in this document which are hard to resist. The idea of
sustainable mixed development is not just jargon - it does make sense to
provide for local needs locally and to encourage a sense of local community
by putting houses near jobs and making use of new technology to encourage
home working and less time wasting travelling.
The recent rail strikes in the UK have only helped to encourage people to
find ways of working at home and have obviously had no effect on
communication by fax or modem. It is no longer necessary to move people
about so much, nor to build giant offices full of commuters.
Mr Gummer is keen on revitalising town centres, although I notice he says
nothing about excessive rents or the swingeing business rate. Small shops
simply cannot afford to be in town centres - even in areas of central London
there are hundreds of empty of shops. 'Nurturing vitality' is a much more
subtle and complex process than Mr Gummer seems to realise. Why does his
document appear to encourage more suburban development by its admission that
it is hard to raise the quality of inner-city housing to the level of
comfort of the suburbs? Planning, lack of traffic control, high rating and
conservation rules still make it too difficult to build enough good
inner-city houses.
New urban villages - a charming idea - have a long way to go before they are
much more than a pipe dream. In fact, there are plenty of older urban
villages in existence already - they need the help and support of government
improvement grants. If this government under Margaret Thatcher had not
fallen in love with the illusion of London Docklands, London's
infrastructure would not have suffered such a terrible decline and money
would have been available to help communities in all the inner cities.
The new urban regeneration agency, known as English Partnerships, has been
given a responsibility to promote high standards of development and diminish
the bureaucracy of planning. But does it really have any teeth?
The object of the document is to encourage discussion about good design and
it is an opportunity for FT readers to take part in the debate. Send for a
copy of, 'Quality in Town and Country' from the Department of the
Environment, Room C13/10a, 2, Marsham Street, London, SW1P 3EB, and complete
the response form. Filling in the form and suggesting ideas for the minister
to think about is this year's holiday task. You have until September 30 to
reply.
As a brief guide to help both responders and Mr Gummer, why not add a few
suggestions to his demolition list. Why stop at the Department of the
Environment? The tin sheds that litter the edges of almost every town to
promote the worst aspects of DIY should all go. In the capital, that parody
of an art gallery, the Hayward Gallery on the South Bank, should be blown up
as should the Hilton Hotel, the Knightsbridge Barracks, the Home Office in
Queen Anne's Gate and all other hotels and excrescences on the skyline that
ruin the Royal Parks. They should all be selectively exploded. A
particularly offensive example is the Royal Garden Hotel that blights the
entrance to Kensington Palace. Most of Victoria Street should go and I
suppose there is no hope of abandoning that pointless erection Canary Wharf
and letting it become a picturesque ruin? As part of my own initiative to
encourage quality in town and country, I am shortly setting up a school of
creative vandalism - Mr Gummer is my first pupil.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Both sides of car hire in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geneva's Cointrin airport is truly international. A small escalator tucked
on the left just before Swiss passport control can whisk you to the
airport's little-known French side.
The canny business executive can take advantage of this by hiring a car on
the French side for far less than in Switzerland. But, as in all things,
there are problems.
The theory is simple. Last month, Hertz's Europe on Wheels was offering
prices of Pounds 196 for an eight-day hire of a Peugeot 106 on the French
side, compared with Pounds 247 for a vehicle of the same class in
Switzerland.
Renting in France does take a little effort. You have to pass through Swiss
immigration, pick up your luggage, nip back past passport control, take the
escalator, walk past the French authorities and then down to the car hire
desks. Instructions are provided on how to take the short road corridor to
France and then back into Switzerland. The whole process takes about 20
minutes.
One irritant is that Hertz's French cars do not have Swiss motorway tax
disks. I recently got lost on the French side of the border and ended up on
a Swiss motorway. I was then promptly forced by a humourless bureaucrat to
acquire a SFr30 (Pounds 14.60) disk in order to drive less than 15km. The
fact the disk lasted a year was little compensation, given the car would be
handed back to Hertz 20 minutes later.
Travellers need to check the rates on each side of the airport from month to
month. The latest figures offered by Hertz on its Europe on Wheels scheme is
Pounds 192 for France and Pounds 210 in Switzerland. But this excludes the
Swiss 8 per cent airport tax.

<TEXT>
The Basle Hilton, which has just been renovated, has designed seven of its
214 rooms to meet the special needs of allergy sufferers, the tall, the
blind, the deaf, the elderly and other handicapped people, writes Ian Rodger
in Zurich.
This laudable effort is not believed to be related to the fact that the
hotel is frequently used by central bankers attending meetings of the Bank
for International Settlements next door.
In the four rooms for allergy sufferers, parquet floors replace rugs,
special
varnishes have been used, and non-allergenic wallpapers, wallpaper pastes
and bedding have been chosen. Additional air filters minimise dust.
For the blind, there are braille newspapers and menus. For those with weak
sight or hearing, an under-pillow vibrator serves as an alarm clock. The
tall can find extra long beds (2.3m) and high desks.
These services come at no premium to the double-room rates of SFr270 to
SFr390 (Pounds 130 to Pounds 188) a night, and the hotel undertakes to give
SFr5 to charity for each night the rooms are occupied by a handicapped
person.

Gone are the heady days of ultra-cheap fares on Australian domestic flights,
writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Efforts to 'deregulate' the nation's airline industry and encourage
competition from new carriers have proved largely abortive, and the market
has returned to a duopoly, with Ansett and Qantas (now incorporating
Australian Airlines) as the two nationwide carriers. Average fares edged up
by 6.5 per cent in the year to March, and now stand about 25 per cent below
the pre-deregulation levels of 1990.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Business Travel: City for explorers - Peter Wise offers tips
on getting around and staying in Lisbon - and the etiquette of doing deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese, with self-deprecating humour, like to describe Lisbon as a
city of the developing world, rather than a European capital. The country's
historical involvement with Africa, Asia and the Arab world is evident in
the city's architecture, culture and cuisine - but on a technical level, it
functions almost on a par with the most modern of its European counterparts.
Doing business in Lisbon is rarely arduous and the hospitality of the
Portuguese usually makes it a pleasure. The city from where discoverers such
as Vasco de Gama and Fernao de Magalhaes (Magellan) set out in the 15th and
16th centuries enjoys being discovered by newcomers.
Lisbon will be welcoming more and more foreign businessmen over the next few
years, as the host to Expo '98 and the promoter of important infrastructure
projects, including new road and rail crossings over the Tagus river.
Visitors will discover that taxis are the best way to travel. They are
cheap, reliable and plentiful in the city centre. Except at rush hours,
nowhere is much more than 20 minutes away. Unless you are travelling to the
country's interior, it is not worth hiring a car (but if you do, it is often
cheaper to book outside Portugal).
There are good reasons for hailing a cab. First, it is virtually impossible
to park in Lisbon. Second, public transport is crowded and uncertain. The
yellow trams are fun but slow. Third, driving in Lisbon can be frightening.
Portugal has the highest road-accident rate in Europe. US soldiers at a Nato
base on one of the most dangerous roads out of Lisbon have had T-shirts
printed saying 'I survived the Marginal'.
The few sharks among Lisbon taxi drivers wait around the airport. The most
frequent trick is to clear the meter when you reach your destination and ask
for a higher fare. There is a 50 per cent surcharge for heavy luggage, but
it should be registered on the meter. Tolls are not shown, and are charged
double to cover the driver's return.
Company headquarters, banks, financial markets and government departments
are scattered around Lisbon. But most are within easy reach of the main
hotels.
The Tivoli, Ritz, Meridien and Sheraton offer the best five-star
accommodation. However, businessmen are increasingly staying at new three-
and four-stars hotels. The Sol Lisboa, Amazonia and Dom Rodrigo Lisboa,
which offers self-catering apartments for longer stays, provide good service
and ample space.
Most Portuguese businessmen speak English and French. A single foreign
visitor is enough for a meeting of 20 Portuguese executives to be held
entirely in English. A few words of Portuguese from a foreigner are taken as
a compliment, but not expected. It is not advisable to try out your Spanish.
The Portuguese do understand it, but pride themselves on the individuality
of their own language.
Punctuality is prized in Portugal, but rarely practised. As a foreigner,
however, you are expected to be on time.
The Portuguese are not overly formal. But the Anglo-Saxon habit of quickly
adopting first names can affront some sensibilities. Women wear skirts; men
wear suits or jackets and ties.
Lunch is a vital part of doing business. It begins at 1pm or 1.30pm and
lasts a minimum of 90 minutes, more often two hours. The city is teeming
with good restaurants, but a few are especially favoured for business
meetings. They include the Veranda at the Hotel Ritz, Gambrinus, Hotel da
Lapa, Casa da Comida and Chester. The latter attests to the penchant of
Lisbon businessmen for traditional British styles, from oak-panelled rooms
to tweed jackets. The Portuguese do not take a siesta and dinner starts no
later than 9pm.
Breakfast is a non-event, and it is unwise to organise business meetings
around it.
The most frequent business journey out of Lisbon is to the northern city of
Oporto. The aircraft is faster and more reliable than the train. Portugalia,
a small private airline, tends to be more efficient on this route than the
national carrier, TAP-Air Portugal.
On a free day, visit the romantic palaces of Sintra or the rolling plains of
the Alentejo.
Lisbon is this year's European Capital of Culture, making it a fertile city
for night life. The medieval Bairro Alto is a lively district of Fado music
houses, boxing clubs, boutiques, bars, restaurants, discotheques and
bordellos. Over the past three years, the clubs along the Avenida 24 de
Julho, beside the Tagus, have become the most fashionable. The action goes
on until dawn. No one has yet worked out when the young professionals who
dance the night away there actually sleep.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: Cultural revolution in Whitehall - Following
last week's White Paper, Peter Norman looks at the Treasury's plans for
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, feels rather like a
harassed home-owner who started some necessary repairs and has found more
and more problems that need solving.
What began in early 1992 with an internal enquiry into the style, workload
and external image of Whitehall's pivotal ministry has burgeoned into a
drive for management reform and a crusade to change the Treasury's culture
in readiness for the 21st century.
Reform is in part externally generated. The Treasury, which oversees the
government's economic and budgetary policy, is having to adapt to
decentralisation and delegation among its 'client' ministries in Whitehall.
Even before last week's White Paper for restructuring the Civil Service, the
creation of more autonomous bodies such as next step agencies, and the
questioning of traditional civil service activities were forcing the
Treasury to change its ways.
More subconsciously, the Treasury is trying to put five difficult years
behind it.
It has been blamed for policy failures such as the early 1990s recession and
Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992
and accused of failing to understand the needs of British business.
It has problems of sagging morale. Earlier this year, an attitude survey of
its 1,400 staff revealed deep unhappiness. While senior officials complained
of long hours when these were spent on unnecessary work, staff lower down
feared for their jobs in the event of contracting out activities to the
private sector and market testing.
Add to all this, the launch of the fundamental review of the Treasury's
spending and running costs - announced in the November 1993 Budget - and the
scene is set for a large-scale, internal shake up.
Change at the Treasury 'is like starting work on part of your house where
you can see it needs a significant effort, and finding that is just the
beginning,' Sir Terry says. 'You start wanting a new kitchen, and you
suddenly discover you need new wiring. Change becomes more difficult because
the scale of it increases.'
Sir Terry likens the Treasury's functions to those of a head office in a
company. Spending decisions, for example, are decentralised in other
departments, leaving the Treasury to hold the ring and ensure that policy is
coherent.
But if management practices change elsewhere in the system, then the role of
head office also has to change.
The emphasis in other ministries on setting objectives against which the
management of agencies can be judged is difficult to reconcile with a
detailed 'command and control' style of management of public-sector
activities by the Treasury. In the present review, Sir Terry says the
Treasury 'is looking quite fundamentally at the sort of jobs we do and
asking 'Should we be doing them?''.
He wants to place more emphasis on setting the agenda and getting the
framework for policy right so that the department is less involved with
detail and second guessing others.
Because of the breadth and depth of the department's self examination, the
Treasury has adopted a gradualist approach to change. It is not following
the example of the Bank of England, which recently started and completed its
biggest management restructuring since 1980 in just six months, at the cost
of some bruised feelings in Threadneedle Street.
But change is under way in the form of management delayering and pushing
down responsibility to lower levels. Late last year, the Treasury
effectively took out a layer of top management immediately below permanent
secretary level.
Its top mandarins are now known as directors. They have greater
responsibility for their budgets than before and their duties are more
clearly defined in their job titles. This is partly to emphasise the very
different tasks carried out inside the Treasury and to create clearer
entities in the department in the belief that this also can help push
responsibility downwards.
Further detailed work on the organisation of directorates and the allocation
of resources inside the Treasury is being carried out as part of the
fundamental review. This task has been handed to Jeremy Heywood, a young
high-flyer and formerly principal private secretary to chancellors Kenneth
Clarke and Norman Lamont.
However, change at the Treasury is not just about organisation charts.
Inspired partly by the attitudes survey and his own experiences since
entering the Treasury in 1980 when he came to fill the post of chief
economic adviser from the London Business School, Sir Terry also wants to
change the Treasury's culture.
'I'd always been slightly worried about the general relations that the
Treasury had with the outside world,' he says. On becoming permanent
secretary in 1991, he gained a greater insight into the nature of the
Treasury's relationships with other parts of Whitehall.
'People who were really quite quiet would write the most strident letters
backwards and forwards to each other,' he recalls. 'When I'd say, let's have
something more polite that makes the point, they would often turn round and
say 'fine'. They weren't always happy writing strident letters either. That
was just the way it was.
'That's what culture is. It is where people inherit styles and ways of doing
things and it often turns out that each individual in the process is not
really very happy with it.
'That is when a change of culture is needed. What we are doing now is trying
to bring about a lot of the changes that people themselves actually want to
make, but which have not been properly articulated.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: TECs - the perfect after-dinner topic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Did you know that last week was the TECs' annual conference? Do you know
what TEC stands for? Can you name two British figures who are important in
training? Can you say anything cogent about the training debate at all? Do
you care?
Good for you if you can confidently answer yes to all of the above. I do not
usually advertise my ignorance, especially on a subject that we are told is
the key to the country's competitiveness/to all our tomorrows etc etc. But I
have done some soundings and found that my blind spot on training is shared
by a large number of otherwise well-informed people. At the first mention of
TECs (Training and Enterprise Councils), NVQs or IIP, we go blank. And by
the time the conversation swings round to CENs, let alone EBS, or FCWG, we
have unplugged ourselves altogether.
If this crucial subject is not treated as a yawn, it is regarded as a laugh.
My husband recently gave an after-dinner speech to a group of personnel
managers in the City. He started with the usual jokes, which met polite
laughter; moving along rapidly to the serious part of the speech he
mentioned TECs. This brought the house down.
The poor old TECs have been valiantly trying to raise their image. They have
retained Des Wilson, the most fanatical campaigner of them all, and a team
of highly paid PR people at Burson-Marsteller. But so far, the only big
publicity they have had was a television programme alleging that some TEC
money had been handed out to dodgy trainers.
The problem is partly one of presentation. The general talk about training
is full of platitude and hyperbole. Take David Hunt's sentimental speech
last week about how training matters because it is the future of his
13-year-old daughter. (I have a hunch that his daughter will be OK whatever
the TECs are up to in the year 2000.) Everyone knows that training is vital,
to go on saying that is not interesting. But once you get to the meat of the
discussion, it quickly becomes technical and complex. The subject is dry,
incremental and full of initials: a crashing bore to all but the faithful.
And the faithful themselves don't help. There is a missionary zeal about
them: a chance encounter with a training expert full of talk of
'competences' and I start feeling like the wedding guest in Rime of the
Ancient Mariner.
Maybe none of this matters. It couldn't be less important whether the
chattering classes are preoccupied with training. What matters is that
someone is getting on with doing it. And the news from last week's
conference that 12 per cent of the British workforce is involved in
Investors in People sounds encouraging. I still don't really know what IIP
is, but so long as the companies involved are enthusiastic that is what
counts.
Returning to the subject of speeches that do not go quite according to plan,
a management consultant friend recently addressed a group of senior managers
on the subject of partnership sourcing. He felt he had acquitted himself
with credit and was therefore a little put out to get a letter a couple of
days later informing him that his audience had rated him seven out of 10 on
content and five out of 10 on presentation.
This is performance measurement run riot. The craze for appraising and
grading employees on every aspect of their jobs is bad enough, but the idea
of ranking guest speakers is dotty. Maybe the conference organisers feel it
is necessary in order for them to know who to ask back next time. But why on
earth would the speaker want to hear the verdict, especially one expressed
in a meaningless number? Next time I have a dinner party I shall ask my
guests to grade their fellow eaters, and give marks for the food, too. And
then we'll all know in a handy modular way what others think of our small
talk and of our cooking.
The traditional macho manager will be extinct by the year 2001. He will be
replaced by a natural team leader who is loved and respected by colleagues.
He - or just as likely she - will be a class communicator, responsive to
change, a whiz at strategic planning, good at coaching and delegating - a
true hero or heroine.
I can't help feeling there is some wishful thinking in this picture, as
presented in today's survey from the Institute of Management. The number of
women managers is, if anything, falling and it is hard to believe that an
explosion of numbers is on the way. Moreover, the changes being forced on
managers are just as likely to turn them into nervous wrecks as into rounded
collegiate players. So far, restructuring has meant executives taking more
load on themselves, going through the nasty business of firing others and
worrying about their own jobs at the same time.
The IM survey thinks management training will shape the brave new boss. But
as I read about the MCI, about transferability/accreditation of skills, I
find my mind going regrettably blank . . .

Now, as one of the top three women in the Treasury, Perkins is a walking

having recently moved to head of defence policy and materiel.
Her story is rare in an institution still largely dominated by sober,
workaholic men. But if Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, is to
be believed, it could become more common. For after decades of being
perceived as a bastion of male mandarins, the Treasury has embarked, as part
of a wider management shake-up, on an initiative to promote a new
'women-friendly' image.
The programme has already challenged some hallowed traditions. In an attempt
to change the workaholic culture, the Treasury's 'sin list' that used to
name officials who had failed to meet deadlines is fading from view; at
another, the Treasury has joined the government's pro-women 'Opportunity
2000' programme and has drawn up targets to monitor the gender balance at
different levels of the organisation.
But the changes are also raising a broader question relevant outside the
Treasury's walls - namely how far can an institution use a wider management
shake-up to further the cause of the women in its ranks?
The starting point of the Treasury's initiative is embarrassment over its
own statistics. Women currently make up 43 per cent of the Treasury staff.
But they hold only 9 per cent of the top 124 jobs. And though this
percentage is growing, it remains far lower than the proportion of women
entering the 'feeder' ranks below.
Quite why women should be so under-represented is a matter of some dispute.
As officials point out, the proportion is not dramatically worse than in
most other civil service departments. Indeed, many believe that the real
problem lies in the outside world and the low proportion of female students
who study economics.
Moira Wallace, a senior official in the general expenditure policy group,
says: 'One problem is getting women to apply - people do tend to assume you
need a degree in economics to work here which is not true.'
But those women who have arrived - often from other civil service
departments - admit the institution itself is also to blame. There is little
sexual harassment or overt prejudice, they say - with the offices largely
staffed by earnest men, the atmosphere has none of the aggressive banter
that marks some City banks. But this British reserve conceals more subtle
factors that have left some women uneasy.
One practical problem has been the workaholic culture which can penalise
women with child-care commitments.
Another factor is the sheer atmosphere of a building dominated by long,
gloomy corridors. Carol Scott, a personnel assistant, for example, arrived
from an open plan office in the Department of Trade and Industry - and
suffered a distinct culture shock. The Treasury, she found, was a world of
closed office doors where 'no one ever said hello to anyone'.
But although these gripes are widespread, finding a consensus about how to
tackle them has not been easy. Although a women's network was set up last
year, it initially provoked some unease. As one woman admits: 'Women are not
keen to be seen sticking out their necks here.'
After the network held a series of discussions with Sir Terry, the
initiative generated more enthusiasm. Nevertheless most women remain adamant
that it should not carry any 'women only' tag and that 'positive
discrimination' in the form of, say, a quota system for office jobs should
be avoided.
'We are not wanting to focus just on women's issues - this affects both men
and women,' says Caroline Slocock, head of Treasury personnel policy. 'In
the past men thought you had to work all hours to prove your commitment. Now
that is being challenged. Families are not just about women but men too.'
In practice, this means that targets for flexible working practices are to
be introduced across the building. A new, friendlier office culture is to be
promoted in special 'awareness' courses - although not compulsory they have
been attended by 75 per cent of the male and female staff so far.
And to ensure that the men do not feel excluded, they have been invited to
selected meetings of the women's network - to discuss, among other things,
the issue of 'image'.
The acid test of these low-key tactics will be whether they actually result
in any more female mandarins. But so far, at least, they appear to have
defused any backlash.
Mutterings persist about a few middle management 'dinosaurs'. Senior - male
 -managers say publicly they are enthusiastic. But rank and file male
officials appear to have responded in true Treasury style - with a polite,
albeit cautious, nod.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: Desert island manager - Sir John Harvey-Jones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and
now a leading management consultant, is undaunted by the prospect of life on
a desert island. His years in the Royal Navy as a submariner and latterly as
a solo yachtsman have taught him how to cope with being alone.
What would you need to run your business life?
I would need a computer with a modem to collect E-mail. I would sign on to
the Internet and that would give me access to virtually any area of debate I
wanted to get into.
I came to computers fairly late in life. One of my great regrets is that I
never learned to type properly; I am still a two finger man. I could do a
lot of business by phone but I really prefer to meet face to face. All my
work is about persuading people. For that you need direct contact to be able
to read someone's body language.
Would you miss the hub-bub of an office?
I am quite good at being on my own. I an interested in nature, particularly
birds. We have a Noah's Ark of animals at my home.
From being at sea I get an almost sensual pleasure at changes in the
seasons. But I am not introspective. I need to reach out to relate to
others.
Would you become a beach bum?
I am pretty self disciplined. I would not just fall into apathy under a palm
tree. For many years I have woken at between 5.30am and 6.00am.
I would continue to do that, although I can sleep at anytime, for anytime.
So I can lie down for 20 winks and be out for hours unless someone wakes me.
How would you keep fit?
My life has been dedicated to being unhealthy. The business of cleaning and
tidying up would be enough to keep me in trim. The one characteristic which
successful people have in common is that they are robust, physically and
mentally.
You could have one book and one film.
The book would be Loom of Language by Frederick Bodmer about philology. The
film would be a CD-Rom guide to the National Gallery in London.
You can have one type of food.
Vegetarian curry with rice. I am very nearly a vegetarian and always eat
vegetarian curry when we are in India.
One person could accompany you. Who?
It would have to be my wife. We have been married for 47 years, but one cost
of the kind of life I lead is that we have not spent as much time together
as we would like. There are still so many ranges of experience we have not
explored.
What would be the frustration of being stranded?
Not being able to contribute to the debate about business in Britain. It is
old fashioned I know but I was brought up to believe that duty was very
important, that you should contribute something to your country and that if
you did not you were not much of a person.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Market opens to rolling settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share trading under the new 10-day rolling settlement system starts today,
the result of a year of effort by the Stock Exchange and its member firms.
Much of the public focus has been on private-client stockbrokers whose
customers are chary of the new system, but the Stock Exchange itself has
undergone frenetic activity to adapt its Talisman settlement system.
According to the Stock Exchange its efforts have paid off. Every Talisman
participant has given assurances that its own system is fully prepared to
cope with rolling settlement.
But until the exchange completes one 10-day settlement period the efficiency
of the system will remain untested.
Under rolling settlement share bargains settle - that is, shares must be
delivered or paid for - 10 business days after each bargain is struck. That
may not sound onerous to an investor in the US, for whom a five-day gap is
the norm, but the London Stock Exchange has traditionally operated two and
three-week settlement periods.
The new system means that stockbrokers, institutions and marketmakers will
have to deliver cash or securities every single business day instead of on
one day at the end of 24 settlement periods each year.
Talisman is the Stock Exchange's internal settlements system, first built in
1977. Market participants broadly give the system high marks for durability
and efficiency in spite of the surge in share turnover since then.
Mr Bernie Till, who runs the system, said: 'Talisman was originally built as
a rolling settlements system.' The alterations from the trading account
system to rolling settlement require the reversal of changes put in place
more than 15 years ago.
To indicate the size of the Stock Exchange's task, Mr Till pointed out that:
Thirty six of the 58 exchange mainframe computer systems and four personal
computer-based systems had to be modified.
Participants - stockbrokers, marketmakers, the registrars who keep records
of share ownership, and institutional investors - had to modify their own
systems to accommodate changes to Settlement Network Interface Specification
(SNIS) records. These are pathways through which the exchange communicates
electronically with participants. Talisman handles more than 200 input and
output SNIS records.
Member firms had the greatest number of changes, modifying 36 SNIS records,
while registrars were required to modify five.
Meanwhile, the exchange said, it spared no effort in informing investors,
both professionals and private individuals, about how life would change for
them.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Investors may lose corporate perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the new rolling settlements system private investors in dozens of
British companies risk losing their corporate perks - which range from the
sublime to the ridiculous and include discounts on air travel, beer, dry
cleaning and jewellery.
According to Mr Justin Urquhart Stewart, marketing director at Barclays
Stockbrokers, the threat arises because many companies refuse to extend the
perks to shareholders who use so-called nominee accounts to hold their
shares. Under the new rolling settlements system private investors will find
trading far easier if they place their shares with a nominee company of
their stockbroker, which will ensure that shares and payments are delivered
on time.
Mr Urquhart Stewart said his firm, which has more than 100,000 clients in
nominee accounts, is peeved about the matter. It has prepared a list of
companies which will not extend perks to nominee account shareholders.
Alexanders Holdings, owners of a string of Ford dealerships, gives holders
of 2,000 or more shares a 2 per cent discount plus negotiated cash discount
on motor vehicles. Bellway, the housebuilder, gives those who hold 1,000
shares for a year a discount of Pounds 600 per Pounds 25,000 off the price
of a new home.
Holders of at least 100 shares in Bentalls, the department store chain, are
entitled to up to Pounds 25 in discount vouchers for use at its outlets.
British Airways gives investors with 200 or more shares discount vouchers on
flights.
Discounted beer and wine are available to investors in Greene King and Sons,
Allied-Lyons, Eldridge Pope, Merrydown and Whitbread.
More esoteric perks are available from Sketchley, allowing investors to take
advantage of a 25 per cent discount on dry cleaning, World of Leather, which
gives its shareholders a 10 per cent discount on furniture, and Specialeyes,
which gives a 10 per cent discount to shareholders who arrange to buy two
pairs of spectacles.
London International Group, the condom maker, offers what it delicately
describes as 'a small box of the company's products' to all those attending
the annual meeting.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Pressure for Tecs in London to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is seeking to trigger mergers among the nine training and
enterprise councils in London, some of which are among the worst performers
in the network of the 82 employer-led organisations according to government
criteria.
Tecs are responsible for delivering the government's main training
programmes in England and Wales.
Chairmen of the London Tecs have been told by Miss Ann Widdecombe, the
employment minister, to review their structures, including making proposals
for mergers. Proposals could include slimming the existing network to four
or five, with a central strategic body, or even one London Tec.
Tecs in London have been striving to work together more closely, but
achievements on programmes such as Business Links, the umbrella bodies for
business advice, have been modest. A few Tecs have even held informal talks
over mergers. Miss Widdecombe is understood not to approve of this because
of its ad hoc nature.
Mr David Hill, chairman of Aztec, a south London Tec, and the capital's
representative on the Tec national council, said: 'The government has asked
me as the regional Tec chairman for London to review, with other London
chairmen, the structure of the nine Tecs.'
It is understood that some London Tec chairmen, who will discuss the matter
at a meeting tomorrow, do not share the minister's interest in structure.
They would prefer any review to look strategically at London's needs and
then consider what structure was most applicable.
Ms Cay Stratton, of the charity Business in the Community, said: 'The
important thing is not to start talking about boundaries but what are the
pan-London and strategic issues.'
Tec difficulties in London are a result of several factors. These include
the complexity of the London labour market, which employs 16 per cent of the
UK workforce, and a historic underfinancing of government-funded training
schemes in the capital.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Spending cuts urged on DSS housing benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Treasury officials are continuing to put pressure on the Department of
Social Security to introduce cuts in spending on housing benefit and
mortgage interest relief in an effort to contain the department's Pounds
85bn budget.
Amid signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, plans a tough public
spending round this autumn, DSS officials are being asked to consider plans
under which the amount of money spent on support for low-income groups is
further reduced.
In recent weeks DSS officials have been keen to underline that they
introduced a number of measures to reduce their overall budget last year,
and that they hope to stay out of the Treasury spotlight in the forthcoming
public expenditure survey.
They have pointed out that the department introduced the abolition of
statutory sick pay subsidy for large employers and a reform of invalidity
benefit in this session of parliament.
Next year the department will introduce a substantial amount of cost-cutting
legislation in parliament, including a pensions bill and the replacement of
unemployment benefit with a Jobseeker's Allowance.
Several rightwing Tory MPs believe, however, that the chancellor will have
to introduce new cuts in social security spending if he is to reduce the
overall amount of public spending - mainly because the DSS continues to have
by far the largest budget of any Whitehall department.
Last year the department took steps to limit the amount of mortgage relief
offered to people on Income Support, lowering the ceiling for mortgages on
which such payments could be made from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 125,000.
DSS officials are being asked to give 'active consideration' to the
possibility of abolishing this benefit, a move that would save the exchequer
Pounds 1.2bn a year.
The department is also looking at ways to reduce the Pounds 8.8bn spent on
housing benefit, which goes to 4.5m people living in rented or local
authority accommodation.
People on very low incomes can theoretically have all their rent paid for in
housing benefit. Ministers are concerned that this pushes up the price of
private rented accommodation and discourages recipients from looking for
cheaper housing.
A DSS official said yesterday that discussions were taking place on
reductions in housing benefit and mortgage interest relief, but that it was
too early to indicate the direction that policy was taking.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Philby's belongings to be auctioned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British master spy Kim Philby, who betrayed western intelligence to the
Kremlin for 30 years, narrowly missed exposure as a committed communist,
documents to be auctioned on Tuesday show.
Books, papers and personal belongings of Philby, who died in 1988 in Moscow
aged 76, are expected to fetch up to Pounds 90,000 for his widow Rufina at a
London auction by Sotheby's.
One of the 128 lots includes Philby's trade union pass from an early trip to
Austria and papers documenting his links with the Viennese Socialist
Society, which would have raised suspicions if they had been discovered by
British intelligence.
Philby, part of a spy ring formed by leftwing Cambridge University
intellectuals in the 1930s, became a double agent working for British
intelligence and supplying military secrets to the former Soviet Union.
Named as 'The Third Man' after suspected traitors Guy Burgess and Donald
MacLean fled to the Soviet Union in 1951, Philby himself fled to Moscow in
1963, when he was on the verge of being exposed.
Sotheby's had second thoughts about the good taste of selling Philby's
homburg hat, his ties, cufflinks and cocktail shaker which are now to be
sold privately, art experts said.
It is offering a collection of about 50 photographs, including one of Philby
and Markus Wolf, the famous head of East German intelligence. His wallet,
containing a press clipping from Izvestia announcing his defection, is also
for sale.
There are many KGB tributes to him, as well as a trophy for his 75th
birthday depicting a globe circled by a Soviet spy satellite with a hammer
and sickle shield behind.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Whitehall consultancy use faces big shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radical reorganisation of the way the government hires consultancies is
recommended in a Whitehall report likely to be published in the next few
days.
The report suggests that the Cabinet Office's efficiency unit should take a
central monitoring role.
The planned shake-up follows the disclosure that the government is spending
more than Pounds 500m a year on outside consultants with little effort to
track spending or assess value for money.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, has accepted advice from Sir
Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, that the unit
should act as a clearing house for departments planning to use
consultancies.
It will be expected to check the reliability of the consultancy and prevent
duplication in departments by co-ordinating information on consultancies
across Whitehall.
Ministers are concerned that little attempt has been made to find out
whether other departments have done similar work with consultancies that
could be used instead.
While the efficiency unit will not be controlling the use of consultancies,
its central monitoring role is expected to give departments less room for
manoeuvre when commissioning consultants.
The report is also sensitive to the fact that departments and agencies can
identify just Pounds 10m in savings a year by bringing in external
consultants to improve civil service management.
It says that departments do not use consultants only to save money. A direct
comparison of the identifiable savings against the amount spent on
commissioning consultants is misleading, it says.
Civil servants are concerned that they could be accused of re-writing the
report following the disclosure that consultancies are yielding so little in
savings.
They say that they have only been fine tuning the study's conclusions and
have not changed any of the figures.
Every government department will be expected to draw up its own action plan
to deal with the problem. These will be expected to improve the tracking of
expenditure on consultancy and its benefits.
Ministers want civil servants to adopt the best practice of the private
sector by working more closely with consultants to maximise benefits.
A senior Whitehall official said the report aimed to 'change the culture and
practice' in the use of consultancies. 'We are currently spending far too
much on far too little' he said. 'Ministers are determined to have some
control on the spiralling cost of consultancies.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / ITN plea for share transfer delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Television News has appealed to the government to postpone an
ownership skake-up at the news organisation following the spate of mergers
among the big ITV companies.
Under broadcasting legislation no single shareholder is allowed to have more
than a 20 per cent stake in ITN, which supplies television news to ITV,
Channel 4 and other broadcasting organisations.
The Carlton Communications takeover of Central Television and the Granada
acquisition of London Weekend Television means that Carlton and Granada each
own 36 per cent of ITN.
The other shareholders are Reuters, the news and information group, with 18
per cent, and Scottish and Anglia, each with 5 per cent.
The Independent Television Commission has written to ITN and its
shareholders reminding them of the 20 per cent rule and saying that it wants
to see the issue resolved this year.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of ITN and of Carlton Communications, has written
to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, asking for the
restructuring to be delayed.
The ITN argument is that changes to ownership should come at the same time
as changes to cross-media ownership rules - something unlikely to happen
before the 1995-96 parliamentary session.
ITN has apparently been spared the most drastic ownership change in the 1990
Broadcasting Act. The act says that by the end of this year a majority of
ITN should be held by non-ITV broadcasters.
There is general acknowledgment that because of the way the act is drafted
the ownership requirement can be met if ITN shares are held by the holding
companies of the ITV investors.
Barring a legal challenge it looks as if the ITV companies, through their
holding companies, will be able to keep control of ITN.

FT  18 JUL 94 / BCCI liquidators secure Dollars 1.8bn from Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
have moved a step further towards partial repayment to creditors by
completing a formal agreement bringing in Dollars 1.8bn from the bank's main
shareholder.
The legal agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi requires approval from
the BCCI creditor's committee and then ratification by courts in the UK,
Cayman Islands and Luxembourg. The creditors committee is expected to meet
this week.
The latest proposal will see Abu Dhabi waiving rights to pursue Dollars
2.2bn of assets, which it says were stolen by the bank, and it will make a
direct contribution of Dollars 1.8bn.
In exchange it will win an agreement that the liquidators will not take any
legal action against Abu Dhabi, while the government has given a similar
assurance to the liquidators.
The legal document was based on heads of agreement between the two parties
last March.
This is the second time that the liquidators have reached this stage. A
previous agreement was blocked in the Luxembourg appeal court last October,
on technical considerations.
The earlier agreement gave only a range of compensation from Dollars 1.2bn
to Dollars 2.2bn, which depends on the realisation of assets.
Creditors were individually committed to signing agreements not to sue the
leading shareholders and there was an agreement that the liquidators and Abu
Dhabi would jointly pursue legal action against third parties, and share any
proceeds. The latest document has removed these agreements.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Fast economic growth predicted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The west and east Midlands, Wales, and the Yorkshire and Humberside area are
likely to show the fastest economic growth in 1994-95, says a study by
Business Strategies, a consultancy. It suggests that they are likely to have
growth of at least 3 per cent, compared with between 2.7 per cent and 2.8
per cent in Britain as a whole.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of UK companies have no plans in place to reduce the amount of
waste they produce, says research commissioned by Biffa Waste Services, the
waste management company.
The research says that waste costs UK industry Pounds 2.6bn a year, yet 44
per cent of the companies surveyed did not keep track of such costs.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Adams attacks peace moves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, yesterday attacked the latest London
and Dublin peace moves and reiterated his party's position on the basis for
a settlement.
Last week the UK government said it was willing to consider amending the
1920 Government of Ireland Act. Mr Adams said: 'Cosmetic or semantic change
in either the . . . act or the Irish constitution will serve only to invite
reaction, without bringing about the new beginning that is so obviously
required.'
He added: 'Sinn Fein has consistently argued that the consent and the
allegiance of unionists is needed to secure a peace settlement.
'However, the unionists cannot have a veto over British policy and the
British government must stop hiding behind the pretence that they do.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Ministers bow to pressure over forests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is tomorrow expected to formally shelve its forestry
privatisation plans after overwhelming opposition from backbench MPs,
environmental groups and the public.
But ministers are due to announce reforms that will force woodland managers
to operate on a more commercial basis when they release details of a review
of the Forestry Commission.
The three ministers responsible for woodlands - Mrs Gillian Shephard,
agriculture minister, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, and Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary - will then publish a consultation document on the
proposed restructuring of the commission.
The ministers are expected to suggest a formal separation between Forest
Enterprise, which is a division of the commission responsible for managing
Britain's 1.1m hectares of woodlands, and the commission itself. This will
leave the commission to handle policy and regulation issues.
Forest Enterprise is expected to have its own board of directors along with
tougher financial targets and a requirement to produce more transparent
accounts.
This compromise move is seen by critics as a possible stepping stone towards
privatisation and as such a way of placating the Treasury, which was keen to
generate cash by selling off the nation's woods.
Conservation and recreational groups still fear that forcing Forest
Enterprise to make a profit could lead it to abandon some of its
environmental commitments.
'It may have to revert to planting wall-to-wall sitka spruce, which we would
see as regrettable,' said Mr Alan Mattingly, director of the Ramblers'
Association. This activity would make more money than the current policy of
diversifying tree species and age ranges, he pointed out.
In spite of the government's partial climbdown, forests are expected to
continue to be sold piecemeal. Forest Enterprise is set to double its sales
of woodlands to 15,000 hectares a year next year. By the end of the century
it will have sold 20 per cent of its estate.
The reforms to the way Forest Enterprise is run come as the division is
beginning to break even. Many slow-maturing plantations were established 30
to 40 years ago and are just coming to a point where they can be harvested
to provide a steady stream of income.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Construction review aims to halt abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals to reduce conflict and improve services in the construction
industry are to be published today in the most far-reaching review of the
sector for 30 years.
The review is expected to recommend the formation of a powerful industry
steering group - led by the environment secretary - to oversee the changes
and assist in the development of improved contract forms and management
practices.
It would include representatives from leading customer organisations as well
as construction employers and professionals.
Led by Sir Michael Latham, a former Conservative MP and ex-director of the
House Builders Confederation, the review is the biggest inquiry into the
industry since the Banwell Report in the 1960s. It has been financed by the
government and the industry.
It aims to cut construction costs and delays by reducing opportunities for
contract abuses and litigation. A customers' forum, representing some of the
industry's biggest clients, is likely to be proposed to provide a focal
point for purchasers and provide advice on how to improve contractual
relationships.
The report is expected to propose improved payment procedures, including
possible legislation to reduce financial strains caused by late payments.
It is considering the establishment of trust funds to hold contract cash to
protect companies when customers or contractors go into receivership.
It is thought to be critical of public-sector tendering practices which
encourage purchasers to accept the lowest prices. These can be loss-making
for contractors which then have to cut costs, damaging quality, or pursue
claims for additional payments to make up their money.
A recent study of 50 road contracts for the Department of Transport showed
that the final bill paid by the department was on average 27 per cent higher
than the original contract price.
Sir Michael is expected to recommend that public-sector purchasers should be
further encouraged to weigh other factors such as quality and reliability
when awarding contracts.
The review, although it falls short of an outright recommendation, is
thought to look sympathetically on contractors' requests for company
registration schemes to combat cowboys. The schemes would be similar to
those operating in continental European countries which are often used to
discourage foreign competitors in home markets.

FT  18 JUL 94 / MoD yet to finalise plan to curb research spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence has admitted that it has no detailed plans of how it
will save the Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m a year from its science research
budget which was promised in last week's defence cuts. Nor is it sure where
the proposed 1,300 job cuts will fall.
In spite of eight months' study under its Front Line First review, the
ministry has yet to work out where to make most of the redundancies or where
the proposed new science agency will be based.
The ministry has acknowledged that both the savings and job cuts figures
given in the package of cuts last Thursday are estimates.
In its report the government proposed to set up a Science and Technology
Agency to replace the multitude of smaller research operations currently
spread around the country. It will cover all of the ministry's non-nuclear
scientific research and will be modelled on the Defence Research Agency,
which was established last year and is based at Farnborough in Hampshire.
Detailed proposals will have to wait until the new agency is established,
which may not be until next April.
The ministry spends Pounds 600m a year and employs about 20,000 people on
research. It also funds about Pounds 1.8bn of development in the private
sector.
The STA will have its own chief executive and budget and will act as a
supplier of services to the MoD.
The STA's main divisions will be the Defence Research Agency with 8,500
staff, a test and evaluation centre employing 2,825, the Chemical and
Biological Defence establishment at Porton Down with 615 people and a small
defence operational analysis centre. A number of smaller groups will be
consolidated into one of these divisions.
The DRA conducts most of the ministry's basic scientific research, while
Porton Down studies chemical and biological warfare. The test and evaluation
centre verifies weapons performance and runs some missile test ranges. The
operational analysis centre evaluates threats and forecasts what weapons
systems might be needed to counter them.
The market-based efficiency improvements which were introduced to the DRA
last year will be extended to the rest of the science divisions, and the
ministry thinks that this will save Pounds 12m a year. All science
operations will have to tender for work from the ministry and will have a
strong incentive to cut overheads and improve efficiency.
More substantial savings will come from changing work at the DRA. The agency
will only work on areas which are likely to provide useful weapons in the
next 20 years. Previously the brief was even more vague, and this narrowing
of focus is due to save Pounds 20m a year. Observer, Page 15

FT  18 JUL 94 / The end of bossy bosses foreseen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The manager who persists in thinking that he or she is the boss will be
extinct by the year 2001, says a report by the Institute of Management.
The study says that to avoid becoming a dinosaur the manager will have to
become a team leader, earning people's respect rather than giving them
orders.
Managers are just as likely to be women, because female attributes such as
teamworking, consensus management, negotiating, the ability to handle
several projects at a time and interpersonal skills will be more appropriate
by the next century.
The report was based on interviews with senior and middle managers. The
authors said that, contrary to some opinions, individuals in the UK had
recognised the need for life-long training.
Nearly 90 per cent of those surveyed believed that there would be an
increased need to acquire new skills between now and 2001. They believed
that to improve their prospects they needed transferable skills.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Leeds bus maker forges link with Mercedes-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optare, the Leeds-based bus maker bought from receivers by its managers and
employees last December, has entered a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz to
make and market large single-decker buses for the UK market.
Under the agreement being announced today Optare will produce 51-seat
aluminium-bodied buses on chassis supplied by Mercedes-Benz, the world's
largest commercial vehicle maker.
The buses are to be sold by both Optare and Mercedes-Benz. The first
deliveries are scheduled for later this year.
Mr Russell Richardson, Optare's managing director who led the buy-out,
indicated that the buses might later be considered for export and that other
collaborative projects with Mercedes-Benz could follow.
The project goes well beyond building a joint product. The two companies
have developed what they describe as a 'complete package' for bus operators,
covering the supply of the bus, hire or leasing arrangements and repair and
maintenance contracts.
Both sides remain free, however to seek other partnerships through which to
exploit other UK bus market opportunities.
Mr Richardson said: 'The contract provides Optare with access to the
significant strength of the Mercedes-Benz financing operation, enabling us
to promote competitive rates and pioneer contract hire and finance leases,
neither of which have been properly exploited in the British bus market.'
Optare, employing 310 people, says that it is profitable and on course for a
Pounds 27m turnover in its first year of independent ownership.
It expects to deliver about 75 of the Mercedes-based buses in the first year
of production, representing about 20 per cent of its output of buses and
coaches.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Hospitals 'could cut drug bill by Pounds 50m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Health Service hospital trusts could save more than Pounds 50m a
year by changing their drug purchasing practices, according to a report
published today.
Hospitals should maximise their use of drugs that have strong competitors
and those widely prescribed by general practitioners, says the report from
the London office of Roland Berger, a German management consultancy. It says
drug discounts average 45 per cent from the list price, but that discounts
of up to 95 per cent are possible for drugs that face heavy competition.
Drugs that will later be prescribed by GPs when the patient leaves hospital
are also offered cheaply. GPs generally prescribe the same drug that a
hospital consultant has chosen. Drug companies offer big discounts on such
drugs to hospitals and boost profit margins by giving lower discounts to
pharmacies which fulfil GP prescriptions, says the report's author Dr Peter
Woods.
NHS hospitals spend about Pounds 600m a year on drugs and influence much of
the rest of the NHS which has a total drugs budget of about Pounds 3bn.
The report adds that there are wide disparities between hospitals in the
discounts they secure. 'The practices being pursued in the regions where the
lowest prices are achieved should be identified and transferred to all the
hospital trusts,' says the report.
The survey of more than 100 of the UK's trust hospital pharmacists finds
that UK manufacturers Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham offer the biggest
discounts.
Babies born after a pregnancy of less than 25 weeks could be banned from
receiving medical treatment because of rising costs, a health authority has
warned.
Doctors at Sheffield's main maternity unit have been told that if demand for
neonatal services continues rising, an 'arbitrary ban' might have to be
introduced because of the costs of treating very premature infants and the
sometimes disappointing results.

FT  18 JUL 94 / PIA kicks off by seeking financial views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An extensive programme of consultation with the financial services industry
is being planned by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to
protect the private investor which becomes operational today.
In the coming months the PIA will ask for views on a range of issues, such
as the registering of all individuals who work in retail financial services,
and training and competence requirements.
Starting work against a background of suspicion and reluctance even among
some of the 3,500-plus organisations which have applied to join, the PIA
believes that relations with those it regulates will have to be an
important, continuing element of its work.
At the same time, it knows it must not become so close to the industry that
it forfeits people's confidence in financial regulation, instead of
reinforcing it.
Some of the issues on which the PIA is planning to consult are inherited
from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and
the existing regulators for the life insurance industry and independent
financial advisers, which the PIA is replacing. Others have arisen from the
wider debate generated by the controversy the PIA has aroused.
The most immediate issues are consultation about how companies and
individuals should disclose on their stationery and advertising that they
come under the new regulator, and the timescale on which this changeover
should take place. A more substantive task is devising and consulting on the
PIA's own training and competence proposals.
The setting up of a register of all individuals working in retail financial
services, one of the recommendations of the cross-party Treasury committee
of MPs, is also to be pursued quickly - with a consultative paper in the
autumn, and the prospect of implementation in the course of next year.
The PIA will consult in the autumn on extensions to the new regime for
giving customers more information about financial products. This regime will
come into effect on January 1, and work is in hand to try to ensure that it
could apply then, not just to life insurance and investment products as
already planned, but also to unit trusts.
Separately, the regulator will seek views on extending the disclosure
requirements to term assurance, policies concerned solely with protection
against particular contingencies and not with investment.
Perhaps the most difficult issue facing the PIA will be the work it takes
over from the SIB in ensuring that compensation is paid to anyone who has
been disadvantaged by following poor advice to take out a personal pension.
Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, said yesterday: 'Our main work in the
months ahead is to build public confidence in the industry we regulate. We
have big tasks to carry out in disclosure, training and competence and our
ongoing work of monitoring and supervision.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Baggio's magic deserts Italy in shoot-out -
Jurek Martin at the Rose Bowl sees Brazil win their fourth World Cup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roberto Baggio ran out of miracles in Pasadena last night. The man who had
steered Italy to the brink of World Cup glory drove a penalty kick over the
bar to hand Brazil their fourth championship in the first final to be
decided on penalties.
Italy's veteran defender Baresi missed with the first penalty of the
shoot-out, blazing the ball over the bar. But goalkeeper Pagliuca
temporarily rescued Italy when saving Brazil's opening spot-kick from
Santos.
Brazil regained the initiative when Massaro's shot - Italy's fourth penalty
attempt - was saved by Taffarel, diving to his left.
After Dunga scored to give the Brazilians a 3-2 lead, Baggio's miss then
handed Brazil the trophy with a penalty kick to spare.
The match itself was goal-less after 90 minutes. During 30 minutes of
nerve-wracking extra time, clear chances were squandered at both ends as two
magnificent defences finally started to wilt.
After 93 minutes Bebeto missed an apparently open goal for Brazil from an
acute angle and 16 minutes later his fellow striker, Romario, amazingly
missed from only 4 yards' range after Bebeto had set up a cross from Cafu.
But it was not all one way. Twenty-three minutes into extra time Roberto
Baggio worked a beautiful one-two with Massaro and had a clear sight of
goal, but could not summon the energy to put a shot wide of Taffarel, the
goalkeeper falling on a weak effort.
So it went back and forth, with Berti and Baresi in agony with cramp. Brazil
made their last substitution in extra time, Viola for Zinho, and Viola went
close twice. But the defences held.
They had played magnificently all day. The first half was pretty quiet -
pretty at times but mostly uneventful. Play flowed generally Brazil's way,
because Dunga was the dominant mid-fielder on the pitch, but Maldini and
Baresi gave little away at the back and three or four Brazilian half-chances
were blocked by Italian legs and bodies.
In fact, the clearest opportunity fell to Massaro after 18 minutes, when put
through by Baresi who more than once ventured out of defence. But Taffarel,
previously the most under-worked goalkeeper in the World Cup and also
mistrusted by his countrymen, fell smartly on the low, hard shot.
At the other end Pagliuca was never seriously tested, though not for want of
trying by Romario and Bebeto. After 12 minutes Romario headed straight at
him from a Dunga cross. Five minutes later Dunga and Romario combined to set
Bebeto through but his shot was blocked.
The closest Italian squeak came after 24 minutes when Branco practised his
speciality - the bent free-kick - from 25 yards out. Pagliuca got to it at
the post but could not hold on. With Brazilians lined up in solid ranks in
front of goal, Mazinho failed to pull the ball back.
It was Pagliuca who came closest to deciding the match. After 75 minutes he
made a hopeless mess of a long-range shot from Mauro Silva. Bending to
gather it, he let it through his hands. It bounced off his knee and slowly
on to the right-hand post and back to him again.
That apart, neither side created a clear-cut chance and two marvellous
defences increasingly controlled the game with Silva, Santos and Aldair
matched manfully by Maldini and Baresi.
For Brazil, who won the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970 in the Pele era, it
was a dramatic way to win a record fourth title. For Italy, winners in 1934,
1938 and 1982, it was heart-breaking.

FT  18 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: An uncertain future for US soccer's Dollars
100m promise - A look ahead to the problems to be faced in setting up Major
League Soccer
</HEADLINE>

When the US soccer establishment six years ago earned the right to host the
1994 World Cup, it made two promises to Fifa, the sport's governing body.
First, it promised that the US would put on a great World Cup; second, that
the tournament would be so successful that it would leave a priceless legacy
for the game in the form of a sustainable top-flight US professional league.
The US organisers have delivered on their first promise - and then some. The
negatives have been few, the positives many, including record-breaking
attendances, impressive TV ratings, peaceful crowds, superb organisation
and, not least, plenty of exciting soccer.
Delivering on the second promise is likely to be a much trickier
proposition, at least if history is anything to go by.
Since 1960, there have been six attempts to create a major professional
soccer league in the US. All failed, mostly because of lack of support from
fans, sponsors and broadcasters.
The most memorable was the North American Soccer League, which briefly
burned bright in the 1970s with the help of international stars like Pele
and Beckenbauer. The NASL, however, collapsed little more than a decade
later in bankruptcy.
If the new league - named Major League Soccer, and due to kick-off next
April - is to avoid the fate of its predecessors, it has to start well. But
progress so far has been unpromising.
When Alan Rothenberg, head of the US Soccer Federation, unveiled plans for
MLS last December, he said he would announce at the start of the World Cup
the names of the cities where the 12 league franchises would be based. By
June 16, however, only seven locations had been chosen - Boston, Los
Angeles, New Jersey, Washington DC, Long Island, San Jose and Columbus - and
only one city, Columbus, had met the target of attracting deposits from
10,000 potential season-ticket holders that MLS originally required of all
potential franchises.
Rothenberg was also unable to provide names of any corporate sponsors who
had agreed to contribute to the Dollars 100m capital MLS intended to raise
to pay for the running of the league. Since then, MLS has signed up Nike to
provide kits for half the teams, and Mitre to provide the league's official
ball.
Thus, with less than a year before the first ball is due to be kicked, MLS
had an incomplete roster of teams and little money from sponsors.
What it did have was a TV contract - ESPN, the cable sports channel, and the
ABC network have agreed to broadcast the games (at no cost to them, mind
you) - and an organisational structure designed to ensure the league's
financial survival.
In most unAmerican fashion, MLS is centrally-owned. All the teams and
players are owned by the league, rather than individual franchises, as with
every other major US sport. To keep the league competitive, MLS will control
the drafting and movement of players, and set pay levels that are very low
by US standards. The average salary will be Dollars 70,000 a year, with top
players earning little more than Dollars 100,000 a year.
This structure might make good business sense, but it could deter potential
owners who would like to own an MLS franchise but who might balk at ceding
so much control to the league. And fans might not like the idea of a sports
league where a single owner decides who plays where.
The limits on players' salaries could be an especially big problem. Everyone
agrees it is crucial that MLS signs up some well-known players for its first
season, especially some of the Americans who starred for the national team
in the World Cup.
Yet the very success of the US team will make that difficult. The World Cup
was such a good showcase for US players that many foreign clubs have already
expressed interest in signing them to play abroad - at salaries that will
dwarf those on offer in the MLS.
Pay may not be the only issue likely to deter US players from staying at
home. If the US team is to improve its performance at the next World Cup,
the squad has to have a larger contingent from the world's best leagues,
which are all in Europe. It will be years, possibly decades, before the
quality of the MLS rivals that of the top Italian, Spanish German and
English leagues.
Although MLS's chief operating officer, Bill Sage, has said the league would
be willing to pay top rates to attract some stars to the US, the money may
not be enough on its own. It seems that US soccer officials are resigned to
seeing most of the players in the US squad not already employed overseas
sign with top foreign clubs in the next few months.
The success of the World Cup may prove a double-edged sword for MLS in
another way. American sports fans have notoriously short attention spans,
and the enthusiasm for soccer the tournament has generated is likely to have
dissipated by next April.
And once MLS does start, Americans who were captivated during the World Cup
by Romario's sleight-of-foot dribbling and Roberto Baggio's lethal finishes
may find it a huge let-down when they watch a bunch of unknowns battling it
out in a three-quarters-empty stadium somewhere on Long Island.
For now, though, the challenge is to raise enough money to get the league
off the ground. Eager to use the World Cup as a launch-pad, Rothenberg and
other MLS executives met potential corporate sponsors last week.
If they can secure the money to persuade some World Cup stars to join in the
debut of MLS, then they may win over enough US sports fans - plus the weight
of advertising and sponsorship dollars that are the difference between life
and death for all big-time sports.

FT  18 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: All eyes on the boiling bowl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PASADENA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'It never rains in southern California,' goes the old 1960s song (Beach
Boys? Jan and Dean? Mammas and the Poppas? No matter). That's still true,
but the ground has been shaking a bit of late and these days you can barely
see the San Gabriel mountains from the Rose Bowl even though they cannot be
more than five miles away, Jurek Martin writes from Pasadena.
This lack of natural habitat - glowering, mountainous, wet - may explain
Bulgaria's pathetic performance in the World Cup third-place game on
Saturday. But it was also the setting for the big one - Brazil vs Italy -
just after high noon, Pacific time, yesterday.
There is something of the Roman amphitheatre to the Rose Bowl. Its towers
are faintly Romanesque. Its plain seating, for all of 102,000, offers no
relief from the blazing sun, apart from that afforded the emperor and his
court in air-conditioned sky-boxes.
The emperor this weekend was Alan Rothenberg, head of the World Cup
operation and lord of all soccer in America, though doubtless Fifa's Joao
Havelange claims equal status.
Certainly never before have so many Fifa officials, conspicuous in their
smart blue-and-white striped shirts and ties, been gathered together at one
time before; their principal task seemed to be to whip back into their seats
any reporter daring to seek relief from the sun.
The court consisted of luminaries beyond number: Silvio Berlusconi and half
the Italian government; Henry Kissinger, without whom, possibly, the
tournament would not have come to the US for the first time; and what passes
for glitter in Tinseltown. The senior aristocrat, Pele, was, however, frying
like the rest of us, doing his Brazilian TV commentary.
The World Cup is still pretty big locally - big enough on Saturday, in an
increasingly Latino city, to draw about 95,000 to the Rose Bowl to watch a
match between one country stretching into the Arctic Circle and another
whose location 99.9 per cent of Angelenos would be pushed to define.
Fans of Sweden and Bulgaria may be getting anxious at this stage about the
lack of reporting on the outcome. In journalistic parlance, an account of
the same should be 'broken out' - that is, rendered distinct and separate -
much as the FT renders, for example, OECD country reports into dozens of
vital, component parts. There are reasons for this obfuscation. The correct
one is that nobody cares who finishes third in the World Cup, and many
wonder why the match is played at all. (Fifa announced at the weekend that
it would not be discontinued, so there). The real one is that the Bulgarians
have given so much pleasure that it seems indecent to 'break out' their
worst peformance.
It was a perfectly pleasant and civilised match which featured four goals
but had all the life of a left-over souffle. Curiously, all the goals were
scored by Sweden and all in the first half.
The first and last goals, by Brolin and Andersson, came in the northern
European manner, good headers from accurate crosses. Brolin made the second,
for Mild, with a quickly-taken free kick, and Larsson ambled through a
disconnected defence for the third. If Sweden felt they had something to
prove after their negative approach to their semi-final with Brazil, they
may claim vindication.
But the Bulgars never turned on; even the great Stoichkov found himself
alone in front of Ravelli with a few minutes to go and muffed it. This
inspired great rapport in the waning moments between the Swedish goalie and
the crowd, compensating for any disappointment Ravelli may feel for not
having made the tournament All-Star team.
That honour rightly went to another greybeard, Preud'homme of Belgium. He
may have been beaten three times by Germany but miraculously saved twice
that number and looked a cut above a not wholly distinguished goalkeeping
crew. Only Ravelli, accorded 'honourable mention,' and Mohammed Al Deayea of
Saudi Arabia, otherwise looked the part.
The rest of the list drew no controversy. Nor should it, since Pele and
Bobby Charlton were among the judges. It comprised Jorghino and Marcio
Santos of Brazil in defence, along with Maldini of Italy, Dunga (Brazil),
Balakov (Bulgaria), Hagi (Romania) and Brolin in midfield, and Roberto
Baggio (Italy), Romario (Brazil) and Stoichkov.
Six of them, Baggio's hamstring permitting, were due to play in the final
yesterday and for them, their team-mates and what promised to be the
noisiest and most colourful crowd a World Cup final has ever seen, the Rose
Bowl, heat and smog and all, was a fitting arena.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Caracas plans tax rise to cut fiscal deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government is studying a new economic adjustment plan, which
would incorporate tax increases, in an effort to reduce the fiscal deficit.
The programme should be completed over the next several weeks, according to
Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister and the government's chief figure in
economic policy-making.
The minister's statement follows demands by Venezuelan businessmen for the
government to establish a coherent economic policy and anti-inflation
strategy. Since the government of President Rafael Caldera took office in
February, it has had to cope with a host of economic and financial problems,
most of which were inherited.
Mr Caldera has frequently discarded free-market policies implemented under
the previous government.
Venezuela's economic situation has worsened recently. There has been a sharp
devaluation, inflation has soared and the confidence of investors has
plummeted.
Mr Sosa stressed that the administration was working hard to attack a fiscal
deficit projected at 9 per cent of GDP this year, and to lower the deficit
to around 4 per cent of GDP in 1995.
Several proposals mentioned by government officials recently are likely to
be included in the administration's adjustment programme. These are: a rise
in domestic retail prices for petrol; an increase in a new wholesale tax
(from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent); cuts in deductions now allowed for
income taxes; reforms aimed at speeding the privatisation programme and
possible use of debt-equity swaps in privatisations; possible sale of some
of the government's remaining shares in CANTV, the state telecommuncations
company privatised in 1991; and new efforts to slim the government.
Mr Sosa expressed the hope that recently announced controls on prices and
foreign exchange transactions would be 'temporary.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Frosted coffee not so chilly for Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian media sped down south last week, and drove past the main
story. Television crews were in a rush to film snowfalls in the southern
state of Rio Grande do Sul, unusual in even the harshest Brazilian winter.
Residents were shown making snowmen (well, knee-high snowmen) and writing
rude messages in the snow about the new currency introduced this month.
Further north, though, in the country three main coffee-growing states,
frost rather than snow was making the headlines abroad and raising coffee
prices in London and New York. What with damage from a previous frost last
month, up to half of the harvest next year may be threatened. London Robusta
coffee prices have nearly doubled in a month, reflecting worries about
reduced supply.
The media priorities were understandable, even so. Coffee is still one of
the main products which the rest of the world associates with Brazil. But
the coffee industry has lost its importance within the country and, although
it has always been a popular drink among Brazilians, coffee still leaves a
bad taste with those who link it with inequality of land tenure and the
economy's reliance on foreign markets.
Coffee became big business in Brazil a century ago, when the state of Sao
Paulo was found to have suitable land and climate. Slavery had been
abolished nationally in 1888 and the state filled its need for cheap labour
by attracting immigrants from poor regions of Europe, such as southern Italy
and Germany, as well as Japan.
The fortunes made on coffee in the next decades, mainly by a few dozen
landowners, turned Sao Paulo into Brazil's richest state. Accumulated
capital helped to launch the country's industrialisation and led to the
decline of coffee's relative importance.
Brazilian coffee exports, once responsible for more than half of foreign
exchange earnings, last year represented only 3 per cent of total exports,
or Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 774m). Sao Paulo has slowly forgotten its roots.
The Avenida Paulista, once the choicest address in Sao Paulo city for coffee
barons, has been invaded by Brazilian and international banks.
In the countryside, coffee has been overtaken, in terms of area planted and
export values, by soya and orange juice. But it is still an important crop
and one of the biggest employers in the three main coffee growing states -
Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo and Parana. In these areas, the recent frost has
caused severe problems for local growers and workers.
The Guaxupe co-operative, Brazil's largest, groups 6,500 producers from the
three main regions. Mr Joaquim Goulart, technical manager, says the latest
frost spared less than half of the co-operative's plants. 'I'm 44 years old
and remember the frosts of 1965, '69, '81 and '85. This was more serious, it
hit areas which had survived before.'
Brazil's winter lasts until the end of August, and forecasters are already
predicting further frosts. 'It's already serious, but it could become grave
depending on the weather,' Mr Goulart says. 'About 80 per cent of our
producers are small. They will feel the effects worse and have no other
source of income. They have suffered from low prices in the last years, so
there has been a lack of investment. In the worst-hit areas, they will not
get back to normal for three years.'
This disruption does not appear to concern customers in Cafe Martinelli, one
of central Sao Paulo's smartest coffee houses. A group of brokers from the
nearby stock exchange, sipping espressos at a price equivalent to 50 US
cents joked that Brazilians may now have the chance to enjoy top-quality
coffee, which is usually exported. 'The government holds 16m bags which
would normally be sold to Europe, but which will now be sold locally to keep
domestic prices down,' according to one.
This attitude partly reflects the popular Brazilian belief that the
country's best products go abroad. The image of European superiority, which
stems from colonial times, is also reflected in advertisements in many bars
for 'Italian roasted' coffee, even though the same coffee probably grows in
Brazil.
The country's poorer consumers, who drink their coffee in tiny cups,
cafezinhos, often with much sugar to change its bitter taste, have little
time for such musings.
In a large supermarket beside the Avenida Paulista, one housewife had
decided to stock up with 500g bags of ground coffee and was advising fellow
shoppers to do the same. 'The coffee companies will use the frost as an
excuse for higher prices, whatever the government says,' she argued.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Paris warns Rwanda rebels as exodus sparks aid crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France issued a strong warning to troops of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front
(RPF) last night, as international concern mounted over the refugee crisis
in Rwanda and neighbouring Zaire, writes Our Foreign Staff.
Up to 55 panic-stricken refugees died in a stampede at the border, where
hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have crossed in the last five days. Mortar
fire spread turmoil and disrupted aid efforts in the Zairean border town of
Goma.
After an emergency meeting in Paris, French officials warned the RPF to
cease armed incursions into the 'safe zone' which French troops have set up
in south-western Rwanda. There have been several of clashes between French
troops and RPF militiamen in the safe zone. Officials indicated that if the
RPF ignored the warning, France might resort to use of fighter-bombers
deployed at bases in Zaire.
The warning came after the RPF said its militia would move in unless the
French handed over Hutu ringleaders of the slaughter of people of the
minority Tutsi tribe in recent months. The safe zone is harbouring large
numbers of the majority Hutu tribe, including ministers who fled the
capital, Kigali, to escape Tutsi rebels.
Fighting spilled over into Zaire as mortar shells fell across the border
during clashes between advancing rebels and retreating government troops.
One shell landed about 100 metres inside Zaire, killing 20-25 refugees, a
French photographer said. At least four other mortar shells hit the Zairean
town of Goma. A French TV crew said 10 Zairean civilians were killed when
shells fell near Goma airport.
One round landed close to the airport runway where relief flights had been
landing a few hours earlier. The United Nations was reported later to have
suspended its emergency airlift of supplies because of the danger.
The flood of Rwandan refugees fleeing into Zaire over the past five days has
reached between 800,000 and a million, according to aid workers, giving rise
to a humanitarian catastrophe. The French estimate 500,000 refugees have
crossed.
As a vast throng of refugees crossed the border yesterday, a stampede
developed and witnesses said up to 55 people died. A French photographer
said he saw bodies trampled in the dust, many of them children. One child
was screaming as people tore him away from the body of his mother.
Germany announced it would send an air force Boeing 707 loaded with aid
supplies to Goma today after a request from the UN for German help.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako Ogata, appealed for a
ceasefire in Rwanda to avert disaster.
'The situation is out of control. We feel defeated and exhausted,' a UNHCR
official said. The mass flight was the biggest ever in such a short time -
'the exodus of a nation'.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Iraq offers olive branch to Arab neighbours: Saddam tries to
mend fences with 'rulers who misbehaved towards us' in Gulf war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Iraq yesterday offered 'peace and security' to neighbouring regimes which
had 'misbehaved' towards Baghdad, in a speech by President Saddam Hussein
apparently aimed at Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt.
Mr Saddam's remarks, in a televised address on the 26th anniversary of his
ruling Baath party's ascent to power, are among the most direct since the
Gulf war, aimed at mending relations with Arab states which opposed Iraq
during the conflict.
Without naming any countries, Mr Saddam said he was offering peace to all
neighbours, including 'rulers who misbehaved towards us'.
Mr Saddam's speech is a further attempt to rehabilitate Iraq both among its
neighbours and in the west, though it contained characteristically
belligerent proclamations that Iraq remained unweakened and unbowed by its
post-Gulf war isolation. 'It has become known to everybody', said Mr Saddam,
'that we fear no one but the Almighty.'
The apparently placatory remarks, however, follow concerted lobbying by Iraq
for the lifting of the four-year-old sanctions against Baghdad, which have
increased in intensity as economic conditions in the country have continued
to deteriorate.
The United Nations sanctions committee meets today to review the embargo
against Iraq, and diplomats and UN officials expect the restrictions to be
kept in place. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, has been in New
York lobbying Security Council members for the past week, arguing that Iraq
has now fulfilled Gulf war ceasefire resolutions calling for the destruction
and monitoring of its weapons of mass destruction.
However, the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
says it has not yet completed installation of its monitoring regimes for
biological, chemical, ballistic and nuclear weapons. These, officials say,
should be in place by September and would require at least six months'
testing before the commission could conclude that Iraq was meeting the terms
of the monitoring regime.
But diplomats in New York add that Iraq could effect a substantial
improvement in the Security Council's attitude towards Baghdad if Mr
Saddam's regime were to make a public and unequivocal commitment to the
recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and to its newly UN-defined borders
 something at which yesterday's remarks perhaps hinted.
'If they came forward and did this, there would be an immediate effect,'
said one UN official.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Water, land the issues in Mideast peace talks: Jordan and
Israel are eager for a pact which would embody a post-prandial sketch made
by Winston Churchill 66 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Winston Churchill is said to have pencilled out the borders of Transjordan
after lunch on a Sunday afternoon. As colonial secretary of a troublesome
British Empire in 1928, he meant his sketch as a quick fix for mounting
problems between Jews and Arabs living under the British mandate for
Palestine.
Sixty-six years and three Arab-Israeli wars later, Jordanian and Israeli
negotiators meet today along their disputed border hoping finally to agree
on the demarcations laid out by Churchill.
These talks will set in chain a series of unprecedented meetings as the two
sides edge towards a settlement. On Wednesday, Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's
foreign minister will be the first Israeli politician publicly to enter
Jordanian territory, where, accompanied by US secretary of state Warren
Christopher, he will meet Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali, Jordanian foreign
minister, at a Dead Sea resort.
And next Monday in Washington, King Hussein is to meet Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, for the first time in public in a summit described
by Mr Peres as marking 'the end of a state of war and the beginning of
peace'.
Although no final Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty will be signed in
Washington, both the king and Mr Rabin are seeking tangible benefits to take
home to critics of the peace process, many of whom are looking for ways to
exploit the lack of momentum.
The gap between the two countries is not large. Today's talks focus on two
key issues, borders and water. Israel has already agreed in principle to
redrawing the border and Jordan is claiming 360-382 sq km along the Arava
desert, which would entail moving Israeli barbed-wire fences back to
Churchill's line of 1928. Israel is likely to concede a substantial part of
this claim and seek other arrangements, such as a lease-back, for a strip of
disputed land now being farmed by an Israeli kibbutz. Both sides are also
likely to agree quickly on a maritime border.
The water issue is a little more difficult. Jordan, with one of the world's
lowest per capita rates of water consumption, is demanding an increased
water share from the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, which it accuses Israel of
diverting. Israel opposes a redistribution of water and favours the
development of joint projects such as desalination plants to meet Jordan's
water needs.
The future status of Palestinian refugees, a third thorny issue, is to be
decided in a quadrilateral committee of Jordan, Israel, Egypt and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Resolution of borders and water could be resolved by next Monday's
Washington summit. Details have been under negotiation for at least 18
months now, and the past month has involved numerous clandestine meetings.
Israeli officials say the outline of a treaty is largely in place. Mr Peres
said last week the border and water issues were 'technical problems which
can take time or be resolved quickly'.
Israel can hardly hide its impatience to sign anything close to a peace
treaty with Jordan. Such a move would be widely popular among the Israeli
left and right. A second peace treaty with a hostile Arab neighbour since
the Israeli-Egyptian agreement of 1979 would lessen Israel's sense of fear
and isolation and would considerably bolster support for the peace process
and for the Rabin government. Israeli officials believe it would also pile
pressure on Syria, and hence Lebanon, to be more flexible in talks.
However, Middle East experts have said King Hussein, always a cautious
risk-taker, is reluctant to move too quickly towards an official signing
which would leave his powerful neighbour Syria exposed and marginalised.
On the other hand, he is anxious to win concessions from Israel on borders
and water and present his deal to domestic critics as a victory for Jordan's
territorial integrity.
The king is also keen to take several economically beneficial steps such as
opening borders to tourists and trade and developing joint projects in the
Dead Sea and Jordan Valley to boost his economy's flagging fortunes.
In Jordan the king's change of gear has been met with surprise and
criticism. Less than two months ago officials and the state-run newspapers
were talking of a comprehensive peace and praising Jordan's co-ordinated
stance with Syria and Lebanon. Now they are trying to explain why the
kingdom has broken ranks and is sprinting towards the finishing line.
One explanation is the weight of US pressure on Jordan to reach an agreement
with Israel and the other is the king's frustration over the collapse of any
common Arab stance and the lack of co-ordination with the PLO and Syria. The
king is also anxious to maintain some influence on the embryonic Palestinian
state emerging on his border.
In a weekend television appearance to sell his peace moves King Hussein
mixed the promise of benefits, including a US promise to cancel Dollars 950m
(Pounds 625m) in debt, with a blunt warning: 'This country, under pressure
from all sides, may collapse.'
Although the pessimism may be overstated, there is cause for concern. The
kingdom's Moslem fundamentalists have condemned the latest peace moves. The
Islamic Action Front, which holds the largest parliamentary bloc, said a
Rabin-Hussein meeting was 'forbidden by history'. Unless the king is able to
deliver real changes on the ground his Jordanian critics may wonder whether
this new flurry of activity was all worthwhile.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Technocrats wait in North Korea's wings: New leader faces a
test of his ability to give a bigger role to reformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The postponement of the funeral of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung from
yesterday to tomorrow has prompted speculation whether his son and
designated successor, Mr Kim Jong-il, is facing unexpected opposition to his
assumption of complete power.
Some analysts looking for clues to possible shifts in power in North Korea
have interpreted the postponement as a political setback for Mr Kim Jong-il,
who is expected to take formal control of the country after the funeral.
However, a more important indication of Mr Kim's political strength will be
his ability to promote a new generation of technocrats soon.
North Korea has been ruled since the 1950s by members of the late
president's extended family and a small group of ex-guerrillas who fought
with Mr Kim against the Japanese in the 1930s. But since the late 1980s, a
new generation of reform-minded officials, many related to the conservative
ruling elite, have achieved prominence under the patronage of the younger
Kim, according to analysts.
'North Korea has seen a generational struggle among the ruling elite in the
past few years over the direction of the country's economic and diplomatic
policy,' says Mr Michael Breen, editor of Korea Countdown, a Seoul-based
newsletter on North Korean affairs.
The reformers first came to the fore in 1988 under former prime minister Yon
Hyong-muk. North Korea began a tentative opening to the outside world by
joining the UN. Mr Yon held meetings with his South Korean counterparts that
produced non-nuclear and non-aggression pacts between the two Koreas in late
1991.
But a conservative backlash became apparent in late 1992, reflecting
frustration that North Korea's actions had not gained diplomatic recognition
or economic aid from the west.
Mr Yon was dismissed and several key technocrats were subsequently demoted.
The shake-up occurred shortly after disputes with the US and South Korea
over inspections of the North's nuclear programmes first emerged.
North Korea's threat to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
(NPT) in March 1993 may have been an attempt by the younger Kim to appease
the conservative faction while achieving the goals of the reformers by
forcing the US to grant concessions.
'If Kim Jong-il secures full power, he is likely to bring back those
favouring changes in economic and foreign policy,' says Mr Breen.
Analysts are closely watching the fate of two prominent technocrats, Mr Kim
Yong-sun and Mr Kim Dal-hyon, to determine the future direction of North
Korea. Both fell out of favour in the past year to appease conservative
critics, but appear to be making strong comebacks following the death of
President Kim.
Mr Kim Yong-sun was formerly the ruling party's secretary for international
affairs and travelled widely, even attending a congress of the Welsh
nationalist party, Plaid Cymru. In December 1992, he became party secretary
for South Korean affairs in what was regarded as a slight demotion. He also
lost his position as alternate Politburo member in December 1993. He favours
ties with the US, Japan and South Korea, and expressed opposition to the
North's threatened withdrawal from the NPT.
Mr Kim Yong-sun is believed a close confidant of the North's new leader. He
was seen comforting Mr Kim Jong-il's sister during mourning ceremonies last
week and is playing a prominent role in arranging the president's funeral.
He also received a delegation from the pro-Pyongyang federation of Korean
residents in Japan and was responsible for notifying South Korea that the
planned inter-Korean summit would have to be postponed, but not cancelled.
His recent activities indicate that he will assume an important post in the
new leadership.
Mr Kim Dal-hyon, the late president's nephew by marriage, was in charge of
promoting foreign trade and visited South Korea in 1992 to tour industrial
plants. He impressed South Korean officials with frank discussions about
North Korea's economic problems.
He was appointed economic planning chief in December 1992, but was dismissed
a year later and demoted to managing a synthetic fibre factory. Although he
may have been a scapegoat for the country's economic failings, there have
been reports in Seoul that one reason for his fall was that he allegedly
accepted bribes from South Korean companies seeking factories sites in North
Korea. But he has reappeared in the past week. In spite of his low ranking
of 140th in the party hierarchy, he was among 100 selected to attend
mourning ceremonies last week.
Mr Kang Song-san, the prime minister, is also regarded as in the reformist
camp since he pushed for inter-Korean contacts in his first term as premier
in 1984-86 and later promoted cross-border trade with the Soviet Union when
he was governor of the north-eastern province of North Hamyong, now the site
of the country's first free trade and investment zone.

Pakistan yesterday confirmed that an Afghan warlord is due to release 11
Pakistani and two Chinese hostages today or tomorrow in a Saudi-brokered
deal. Mullah Abdul Salaam 'Rocketi', as the warlord is popularly known,
ordered the kidnappings in retaliation for a Pakistani security forces'
operation at his stronghold in Afghanistan's south western Zabul province,
almost three years ago, in which three US-made Stinger missiles were
recovered.
The anti-aircraft missiles were supplied under a CIA covert operation to
back the Afghan mujahideen against Soviet occupation. US officials have been
trying to recover them and western diplomats have been concerned over the
possible threat to aircraft. It is not known how many missiles have been
returned.

200m is expected to become available after the next review mission in
October. The World Bank has also been asked for extra loans to fund
Bulgaria's initial payments on the deal it recently signed with the London
Club Commercial Bank Creditors. The agreement provided for 47.1 per cent
reduction in Bulgaria's Dollars 8.1bn debt to a group of some 300 banks. The
IMF mission reviewed the implementation of Bulgaria's third standby

Ashaari Muhammad. In June, officials described Darul Arqam as a threat to
national security and the government has accused Ashaari Muhammad of
building an armed, 313-member suicide squad trained in Thailand. No evidence
has been produced on the suicide squads. Darul Arqam, founded in 1969,
claims a following of 10,000. Group publications say Ashaari preaches

There was no sign of the ambassadors of Oman and Yemen to Algeria who were
reported missing on Friday, but the Omani envoy was reported safe. The
burnt-out car in which Mr Kacem Askar Djebrane and Mr Hilal Ben Salem were
travelling was discovered 10km from Khemis El Kechna, at the heart of a
region known as the 'death triangle', south east of Algiers. The area has
over the past year been the scene of bloody encounters between the security
forces and supporters of radical Islamic movements who have, on and off,
controlled some of the town and stretches of the countryside. The Oman news
agency said yesterday Mr Bin Salem was 'safe and sound and in good health'.
It said it had learned from Algerian security sources that the ambassador
was safe but it gave no word on his whereabouts. Violence has risen in
recent weeks although the strict media censorship makes the task of
estimating the exact level of violence ever more difficult.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Hope for future of coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's drive to eliminate subsidies and deregulate
markets will greatly improve coal's long-term chances of survival as a fuel
for power generation and as a replacement for unpopular nuclear power,
according to a new energy forecast by DRI, the energy specialists. DRI says
coal's share of the fuel mix will decline between now and the end of the
decade because of the growth in popularity of natural gas. But the shift to
market-driven prices, as well as the growth of clean coal technology, will
raise its attraction as a fuel in the next decade. DRI expects coal to show
relatively small increases in real cost between now and 2015 as expensive
indigenously produced coal is replaced by cheaper imports.

Foreign investment in South-East Asia is rising sharply after two slow years
and domestic investment remains robust, according to figures from national
investment promotion agencies. Governments had feared that investors were
losing interest in their countries and concentrating on China. But
statistics show that companies from Japan, the US and other developed
economies continue to commit billions of dollars to South-East Asia for
everything from electronics and vehicle components factories to new power
stations.
Indonesia's Investment Co-ordinating Board said it had approved Dollars
5.33bn (Pounds 3.5bn) in foreign investment for the first six months of this
year, up 23 per cent from the same period last year. Malaysia reported
approved manufacturing investments of MDollars 10.5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in the
first half of the year, against MDollars 4.3bn. Thailand's Board of
Investment received applications for Dollars 4.8bn in foreign investment in
the first four months, only slightly below the sum for the whole of 1993.
The Philippines BoI approved projects worth a record P239bn (Pounds 5.75bn)
in the first half, more than quadruple the amount at the same time last year
and more than double the target for all the whole of 1994.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Chinese snub for UK minister over Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for a smooth transition to Chinese control of Hong Kong in 1997
dimmed at the weekend when the goodwill visit to Beijing of a UK Foreign
Office minister, Mr Alistair Goodlad, ended in debacle.
China refused to let Mr Goodlad visit the mainland's top official
responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Mr Lu Ping, in the third snub to Mr
Goodlad during his visit.
The visit to Mr Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, would have
given the UK an opportunity to suggest new approaches to the long list of
technical issues it wants sorted out before the handover - including
financing of Hong Kong's new airport and Chinese ratification of a raft of
treaties and laws on such matters as air safety and the validity of business
contracts.
Instead, Mr Goodlad tried to convince Hong Kong journalists that his visit
had been 'most useful' and that relevant issues had been discussed
thoroughly and courteously with other Chinese officials. After the press
conference, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a terse statement
suggesting that the meeting was 'not necessary' because of the Sino-British
dispute over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's programme of political
reform.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Peres takes softer line on returning Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With encouraging signs in peace talks with Jordan, Israel has also softened
its position towards Syria and the vexed question of the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said last week that Israel now
recognised Syrian sovereignty over the strategic Heights, which the Jewish
state seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
'The government of Israel has recognised Syrian sovereignty over the Golan
Heights and the concept of peace based on international borders subject to
the security needs of Israel,' Mr Peres said.
He also referred in a foreign ministry communique to a 1967 secret cabinet
resolution calling for negotiations with Syria on the basis of withdrawal to
the 'international border' in return for full peace, demilitarisation of the
Golan and guarantees of the flow of water to the Jordan Valley.
The foreign minister also spoke of the strong precedent of the 1979 peace
treaty with Egypt which had seen the return of all Egyptian territory
occupied by Israel.
Foreign ministry officials said the formal recognition of Syrian sovereignty
effectively relegated Israel's annexation of the Heights in 1981 and that Mr
Peres' 'far-reaching' remarks were the broadest hint so far that Israel
would yield all the Heights up to the 1967 international border in return
for full peace and security guarantees.
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked as Israel refused to
specify how much of the Heights it would return to Damascus until Syrian
President Hafez al Assad made a commitment to full peace including open
borders, trade, tourism and the establishment of embassies.
However, despite Mr Peres' apparent hints, Israel has still not met Syrian
demands that Jerusalem formally declare it will withdraw to 1967 borders and
return the entire Golan. Syria said Mr Peres' statements added nothing new,
as Israel's recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Heights was 'a
recognition of fact' in accordance with United Nations resolutions.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Gates decides to soften his line: Computer software leader
Microsoft takes a pragmatic approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, undisputed leader of the personal computer software industry, has
done what it vowed it would never do by signing a consent decree to
antitrust charges levelled by the US Justice Department and the European
Commission.
Still proclaiming innocence, the company headed by Bill Gates took a
pragmatic approach when faced with the imminent prospect of being dragged
through US and European courts on charges that it erected barriers to
competition, bullied PC manufacturers into buying its products and tried to
impose restrictive agreements on other software developers to maintain its
dominant role in the PC operating system software market.
'We had very much in mind what happened to IBM,' said Mr Bill Neukom,
Microsoft chief counsel, referring to the computer company's decade-long
struggle against antitrust charges in the US which, when finally dropped,
were picked up in the European courts.
By settling the complaints on what it called 'reasonable terms', Microsoft
has brought to an end four years of speculation surrounding the antitrust
investigations, which raised a far broader range of allegations than those
specified in the official complaint.
Notably omitted from the official complaint, for example, were the
allegations of several Microsoft competitors that the company's applications
software group had unfair advantages over competitors because of internal
links - a charge which if it had been upheld, might have led to a forced
division of the company.
The Justice Department may also be relieved to have resolved a case which
could have placed the Clinton administration in an embarrassing battle with
one of the most successful companies in the US information technology
industry, while promoting high technolgy as the 'engine for US economic
growth'.
Thus some may see the settlement as a let-off for Microsoft, despite the
strong rhetoric of Ms Janet Reno, US attorney general, who charged that
Microsoft was being forced to abandon 'illegal monopolistic practices' that
have 'choked off competition and preserved its monopoly position'.
'Today's settlement levels the playing field and opens the door to
competition,' said Ms Reno. PC buyers will have a wider choice of operating
systems and PC manufacturers will no longer have to pay royalties to
Microsoft for computers not containing its software, she said.
In practice, however, industry analysts do not expect the settlement to have
a significant impact on the balance of power in the software market in the
foreseeable future.
'The operating system wars are over - Microsoft is the winner,' said Mr
Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, a technology research
company in New York.
The huge installed base of Microsoft operating systems - some 120m PCs have
MS-DOS installed - together with the plethora of applications designed to
run on Microsoft's operating systems, virtually guarantee that Microsoft
will continue to dominate the field for some time.
IBM, Microsoft's strongest rival in the PC operating system market, sold
about 3m copies of its OS/2 program last year compared with Microsoft's
sales of about 2m copies of Windows a month.
The consent decree might create a short-lived opportunity for Novell, one of
Microsoft's fiercest antagonists on the antitrust issue.
The Utah company offers an alternative version of Microsoft's DOS, called
DR-DOS, and has been struggling to persuade PC manufacturers to adopt it.
'We will be knocking on the doors of PC makers on Monday morning offering
them an alternative to MS-DOS at competitive prices,' said Mr David
Bradford, Novell's chief counsel.
However, with Microsoft planning later this year to launch 'Chicago' - a new
PC operating system that incorporates all of the functions of MS-DOS,
Windows and more - Novell's chances of stealing Microsoft custom may prove
to be limited.
Had the antitrust settlement come a year ago, it might have had a greater
impact, industry analysts said. Now, with Chicago on the horizon, Microsoft
has little to lose because none of its competitors has a product that can
match the new operating system.
The only obvious beneficiaries of the Microsoft settlement are PC
manufacturers, who now have the right to demand new licensing terms from
Microsoft. Yet their bargaining strength is still limited by Microsoft's
dominant role in the PC industry.
PC buyers are unlikely to notice the effects of the settlement. Operating
systems represent a very small portion of the total cost of a PC - in the
region of Dollars 15-Dollars 50 - so any cost savings by PC makers are
likely to have a minimal effect on prices.
Microsoft is not, however, entirely off the hook. The company is 'wide open
to private antitrust suits', said one industry lawyer. Although Microsoft
has not admitted guilt in the consent decree, the Justice Department
allegations might bolster charges brought by competing software companies,
he said.
Microsoft also faces a 6 1/2 - year period during which its activities will
be closely monitored by the department and by EU competition authorities.
Concerns about antitrust infringement are widely seen as one of the factors
in IBM's fall from industry leadership because the company's day-to-day
management activities were for many years routinely reviewed by lawyers,
slowing decision-making.
'We have been largely successful in avoiding that syndrome,' during the
antitrust investigations, said Mr Neukom.
'We have not let it slow us down or distract us.' He acknowledged, however,
that if Microsoft should become 'slow -footed or start second-guessing
ourselves too much we could fall behind the pace of the industry.'
Other companies have dominated sectors of the computer industry for a period
of years, only to fade into oblivion when new technology overtakes them, Mr
Neukom recalled.
It is a fate that Microsoft must now work harder to avoid.

year from 1.08bn ringgit for the same period last year. Mr Rafidah Aziz,
Malaysian trade and industry minister, told parliament that both countries
were taking steps to enhance bilateral trade. The Malaysian government
banned British companies from government contracts in February in reaction
to what it saw as negative press reports in Britain. Mr Rafidah said that
during the first quarter of the year, nine projects involving joint ventures
with British companies were approved.

<TEXT>
The Malaysian government will ban the teachings of Darul Arqam, a radical
Malaysian Islamic Shia group led the self-styled Abuya Sheikh Imam Ashaari
Muhammad. In June, officials described Darul Arqam as a threat to national
security and the government has accused Ashaari Muhammad of claiming to be
the Iman Mahdi (the second prophet) and of building an armed, 313-member
suicide squad trained in Thailand. No evidence has been produced on the
suicide squads.
Although the Malaysian constitution espouses freedom of religion that has
been interpreted to mean the freedom of the non-Malay races to practise
non-Islamic religions, the government has in the past, detained Islamic
radicals.
Darul Arqam, founded in 1969, claims a following of 10,000. Group
publications say Ashaari preaches returning to life as the Prophet Mohammed
decreed. He demands 'undivided obedience' to his mind and teachings while
rejecting armed revolutions and western politics and preparing for the day
when he will be 'handed over the administration of the country.'

The German government yesterday provided an aircraft to carry humanitarian
aid to central Africa, the first sign that Germany will join the
international humanitarian effort for refugees fleeing fighting in Rwanda.
However, a Bonn official said there were no further plans for the
Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, to take part in efforts to put an end
to the bitter fighting in the African republic.
In the Rwandan capital Kigali, UN officials said up to 2m Rwandans were on
the move in southern Rwanda and a mass exodus there could become a crisis.
In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Sadako
Ogata, appealed for an immediate ceasefire to avert a disaster as rebel
forces drove tens of thousands of refugees and the defeated army across the
border into Zaire .
Germany's move comes days after a decision by the constitutional court in
Karlsruhe allowing German troops to join UN operations outside the Nato
area. The government has taken part in a number of humanitarian operations
in recent years, including Cambodia and Somalia, but the court ruling
prevents opposition parties from contesting the decision as they had in the
past.

Foreign investment in south-east Asia is rising sharply after two slow years
and domestic investment remains robust, according to figures from national
investment promotion agencies.
Governments had feared that investors were losing interest in their
countries and concentrating principally on China, where the market is
exceptionally large and labour costs are low.
But statistics show that companies from Japan, the US and other developed
economies continue to commit billions of dollars to south-east Asia for
everything from electronics and vehicle components factories to new power
stations.
Indonesia's Investment Co-ordinating Board said it had approved Dollars
5.33bn (Pounds 3.5bn) in foreign investment for the first six months of this
year, up 23 per cent from the same period last year.
Malaysia reported approved manufacturing investments of MDollars 10.5bn
(Pounds 2.6bn) in the first half of the year (MDollars 4.6bn from foreign
companies), compared with MDollars 4.3bn in the first half of 1993.
In Thailand, the Board of Investment (BoI) said it had received applications
for Dollars 4.8bn in foreign investment in the first four months of the
year, only slightly below the sum for the whole of 1993.
The Philippines, where Hong Kong and other foreign companies are investing
heavily in new power stations, said its BoI approved projects worth a record
P239bn (Pounds 5.75bn) in the first half, more than quadruple the amount at
the same time last year and more than double the target for all 1994; both
foreign and domestic investment rose sharply.

FT  18 JUL 94 / China snubs UK minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for a smooth transition by Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997
dimmed at the weekend when the goodwill visit to Beijing of a UK Foreign
Office minister, Mr Alistair Goodlad, ended in debacle.
China refused to let Mr Goodlad visit the mainland's top official
responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Mr Lu Ping, in the third snub to Mr
Goodlad during his visit.
The visit to Mr Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, would have
given the UK an opportunity to suggest new approaches to the long list of
technical issues - including financing of Hong Kong's new airport and
Chinese ratification of a raft of treaties and laws on such essential
matters as air safety and the validity of business contracts - which the UK
wants sorted out before the handover.
Instead, Mr Goodlad tried to convince Hong Kong journalists that his visit
had been 'most useful' and that relevant issues had been discussed
thoroughly and courteously with other Chinese officials.
After the press conference, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a
terse statement suggesting that the meeting was 'not necessary' because of
the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's programme of
political reform.
On Friday, Mr Goodlad had made a public appeal to China that the two
countries should put this dispute behind them and get on with other
unresolved issues.
Two hours later, Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, rejected this
plea, in a stinging snub delivered as they met.

FT  18 JUL 94 / International Press Review:  David v Goliath over new trade
HQ - WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the volume of press coverage were the deciding factor, Geneva would be
the victor in the struggle with Bonn to host the new World Trade
Organisation.
A final decision on the site for the WTO headquarters is due to be made by
members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade tomorrow.
The Geneva press, stridently vaunting the city's case, is portraying
Switzerland as a penurious David battling valiantly against the superior
political and economic might of the German Goliath.
The Journal de Geneve last week quoted accusations by Swiss officials of
unfair German tactics, including rumoured promises of extra banana and
coffee imports in return for votes.
Sniffily decrying such a brazen appeal to economic self-interest, the Swiss
press argued that this bodes ill for the independence of a Bonn-based WTO.
'You don't choose the headquarters of an international organisation like you
would the venue for the Olympic Games.'
Most people could be forgiven for being fooled. To tempt the WTO, both Bonn
and Geneva have put up multi-million-dollar packages of office accommodation
and diplomatic privileges for the WTO, its 450-500 staff and the associated
diplomatic missions.
But, while Bonn has allegedly wooed with trade promises, Switzerland has
appealed to the heart. Its offer allows Moslem diplomats to register two
wives (Islamic law permits up to four), the only ploy so far to arouse
international press attention.
The Germans refused to rise to the bait, preferring figures to frills.
'Diplomats with several wives will be particularly well-sited in Bonn where
the cost of living is one-third less than in Geneva,' was the deadpan German
response last week.
It was also calculated to raise Swiss hackles. The cost of living in Geneva
is no more than 10-15 per cent higher than in Bonn, say Swiss officials
crossly, citing United Nations statistics in support.
And if there were any further hesitation on cost grounds 'states should know
that, in Geneva's services sector, the rate of absenteeism for qualified
personnel is 35 per cent less than in Germany and productivity is 16 per
cent higher,' according to the same Swiss officials reported by the Journal
de Geneve.
The German press has paid little attention to the duelling between the two
cities. What little coverage there has been supported the government's view
that an important trading nation such as Germany needed an international
institution such as the WTO but otherwise focused almost entirely on what
Geneva had to offer.
Even Bonn's own newspaper, the General-Anzeiger, which has campaigned
relentlessly to keep the federal government on the banks of the Rhine, could
do no better than a worthy article comparing the two offers in terms of free
parking spaces, available office accommodation and tax-free perks.
The Swiss have taken more interest in the wider political backdrop. While
Geneva has been assured of the support of France and other francophone
countries, the position of the US is causing some concern. To push
Washington in the right direction, the Tribune de Geneve reported, US
citizens in Switzerland have written to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, to put Geneva's case.
Evoking nearly 200 years of US-Swiss friendship, the letter reminds Mr
Kantor of 1801 when a Swiss, Albert Balatin, became US treasury secretary
and negotiated the purchase of Louisiana.
If this does not impress him, there is the more recent role of President
Woodrow Wilson in choosing Geneva for the headquarters of the pre-war League
of Nations.
Yet, having urged the Berne government to fight for the WTO, some Swiss
newspapers are beginning to wonder whether it has been too generous.
'Are we on course to create a class apart of international organisations
whose privileges are disproportionate to the costs involved,' asks Le
Nouveau Quotidien, echoing the Zurich-based Neue Zurcher Zeitung a few days
earlier.
It says officials in the Swiss finance ministry are grinding their teeth at
the VAT exemptions, duty-free booze and petrol, tax-free pensions and the
like being offered to diplomats in Geneva, concessions which will apply to
all UN organisations as well as to the WTO.
The NQ quotes figures showing that the international organisations already
cost the canton of Geneva SFr500m (Pounds 245m) a year.
In return, however, the organisations spend SFr3bn a year, provide some
23,000 jobs (8 per cent of total employment in the city) and fill 40 per
cent of hotel space.
As for the little town on the Rhine, which is groping for a new identity
after the federal government moves to Berlin, it is left with no concrete
prospects if the WTO bid fails.
'Then we will have a new situation and have to take new decisions,' sagely
remarks Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior civil servant in the economics
ministry, which is leading Bonn's campaign.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Details of the complaint and settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft is alleged to have engaged in several restrictive practices
limiting competition in the software market, according to a complaint filed
in a Washington district court by the US Justice Department, writes Louise
Kehoe.
'Virtually all major PC manufacturers find it necessary to offer Microsoft
operating systems on most of their PCs,' the complaint states. 'Microsoft's
monopoly power allows it to induce these manufacturers to enter into
anti-competitive, long-term licences under which they must pay royalties to
Microsoft, not only when they sell PCs containing Microsoft's operating
systems, but also when they sell PCs containing non-Microsoft operating
systems.'
The Justice Department alleges that by making its MS-DOS and Windows
programs available on a 'per processor' basis, Microsoft requires PC
manufacturers to pay a fee for each computer shipped, whether or not that
computer contains a Microsoft operating system.
This arrangement gives Microsoft an unfair advantage by causing a PC
manufacturer selling a non-Microsoft operating system to pay at least two
royalties - one to Microsoft and one to its competitor - thereby making a
non-Microsoft computer more expensive, it is alleged. Microsoft, however,
said that the Justice Department and European competition authorities had
misunderstood the terms of its licensing arrangements, noting that
manufacturers could exclude specific models from their Microsoft licence
agreement.
The Justice Department further charged that Microsoft's contracts are
unreasonably long. By binding manufacturers to purchase Microsoft products
for years the agreements make it difficult for new competitors to enter the
market.
Under the terms of the settlement, Microsoft will be prohibited, for the
next six-and-a-half years from:
Entering into any 'per processor' licensing agreements with PC
manufacturers. Instead, Microsoft must license its operating systems on a
'per system' or per computer basis.
Requiring PC makers to purchase any minimum number of Microsoft operating
systems, regardless of how many computers are sold.
Entering into licensing agreements with terms longer than one year.
Requiring licensees to pay Microsoft on a 'lump sum' basis, rather than
according to the number of copies of the software used.
Another significant element of the settlement refers to alleged 'tying' of
sales of other Microsoft products to purchases of operating systems.
Competitors have charged that Microsoft forces PC manufacturers to buy other
products to obtain discount prices, a charge Microsoft has denied. The
settlement specifically prohibits this practice.
The Justice Department also charges that Microsoft's 'non-disclosure
agreements' with some software developers have been unfairly restrictive.
This issue surfaced recently when software developers claimed Microsoft was
attempting to prevent them working on applications programs that would run
on non-Microsoft operating systems.
The NDAs required programmers granted access to pre-release versions of a
new version of 'Windows' could not work on programs for competing operating
systems for a period of three years. When the issue came to light Microsoft
acknowledged that it had 'made a mistake' and offered to modify the terms of
the agreements.
The antitrust settlement limits duration of an NDA to 12 months and
prohibits Microsoft from imposing any terms that would prevent a software
developer from developing products to run on competing operating systems.
Notable missing from the complaint and settlement documents is any mention
of allegations raised by software industry executives that Microsoft's
applications software developers gain an unfair advantage because they have
greater access to the company's operating system technology.
Microsoft has stridently denied these and other charges. On Saturday,
Microsoft stressed that the settlement agreement covers 'all matters' raised
by the antitrust investigations, which the company acknowledged had
'initially included many allegations raised by our competitors and began as
a very broad probe into lots of aspects of the way we do business.'

FT  18 JUL 94 / Danes attack Brussels over ship subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of Danish Shipbuilders has charged that the European
Commission exceeded its powers by approving German subsidies to shipyards in
the former East Germany and is attempting to bring the issue before the
European Court.
Danish shipbuilders contend that the German subsidies will jeopardise their
own shipbuilding industry. However, the association received a severe
setback late last week when the Danish government refused to take the
Commission to task before the European Court. Any action will have to be
taken by the association itself without concerted government backing.
Requests by the German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, to the Danish prime
minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, not to pursue the shipbuilding issue have
been reported by the Danish media as a factor in the government's decision.
The Danish shipbuilders' case is driven by grave concern that their
shipyards will be rendered uncompetitive. The history of their complaint
dates back to 1992 when German subsidies to four shipyards in the eastern
provinces were approved in principle by an EU directive - the seventh
shipbuilding directive under which several conditions were attached.
'A genuine and irreversible reduction' in shipbuilding capacity was one of
the conditions. Another was that the subsidies should not exceed 36 per cent
of a shipyard's 'normal turnover' after restructuring.
The Danes claim that far from being reduced, capacity at the four German
yards will be dramatically increased. The Danish shipbuilders also contend
that the German yards are being restructured to compete in precisely the
type of ships - supertankers, and Panamax container-carrrying and bulk
carriers (the maximum size for passing through the Panama canal) - in which
two of the largest Danish yards, the Burmeister &amp; Wain Shipyard in
Copenhagen and the AP Moller shipyard near Odense, are specialists.
At the MTW Shipyard at Wismar, say the Danes, the yard will be able to build
up to six supertankers a year, of 300,000dwt each, compared with vessel up
to a maximum of 30,000dwt before restructuring.
The Kvaerner Warnow yard's new drydock at Warnemunde will allow it to build
vessels of up to 180,000dwt compared with its present four slipways each for
vessels up to 7,000dwt. Yearly potential capacity will be much more than
doubled, according to the Danish association.
Similar changes in capacity are planned at Volkswerft (Stralssund), and
Peenewerft, according to the Danes.
The Danish shipbuilders fail to see how this complies with the seventh
directive's call for 'a genuine and irreversible reduction in capacity' and
point to an apparent discrepancy between the seventh directive and the
Commission's wording when in May this year it approved the subsidies for the
MTW Shipyard. In the case of MTW, the Commission declared that 'The German
government is requested to ensure that the volume of production is limited
for five years,' which is not the same as an irreversible reduction.
The Commisson, say the Danes, has agreed to subsidies to the MTW Shipyard
equal to about 70 per cent of annual turnover, not 36 per cent.
The MTW Shipyard is a test case, as it is the first of the yards for which
the Commission's approval has been received. The Danish shipbuilders argue
that the Commission's decision 'will legalize a smilar practice' for the
three other yards.
Under the seventh directive, all operating subsidies were to be paid out by
December 31, 1993, but the latest tranche of operating subsidies was
authorised by the Commission on May 11 this year, which makes the payments
illegal, according to the Danish argument.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Joint effort is warning to others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday said its co-operation with the US
Department of Justice in stopping alleged anti-competitive practices by
Microsoft was a warning to other large businesses.
'It serves as an important model for the future, as it shows how the two
authorities can combine their efforts to deal effectively with giant
multinational companies,' the commission said.
'The success of this joint approach sends a strong signal to all
multinational companies, including those in other sectors.'
The Justice Department and the commission announced a joint deal under which
Microsoft agreed to stop certain licensing practices in exchange for the two
authorities dropping anti-competition actions against the software company.
The Microsoft settlement with US and European competition authorities marks
the first time that the US and the EU have co-ordinated their efforts in
formulating antitrust charges and a settlement.
The precedent-setting case 'sends a powerful message. . . that the antitrust
authorities of the US and the EU are prepared to move decisively and
promptly to pool resources to attack conduct by multinational firms that
violate the antitrust laws of the two jurisdictions,' said Ms Anne Bingaman,
head of the US Justice Department antitrust division.
The US and EU treaty allows the exchange of information in multinational
antitrust cases. However, that treaty is under review by the European Court
of Justice and was not used as the basis for collaboration in this case.
Instead, the department's antitrust division sought Microsoft's approval
before sharing information with its European counterparts. The commission
said the two sides had a number of meetings to prepare a co-ordinated
approach to dealing with Microsoft, then held joint meetings with the
company in both Washington and Brussels.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Italian coalition partners trade blows: Events which have
led to the government's difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agony of Italy's narrow defeat by Brazil in last night's World Cup final
in Los Angeles will deepen the gloom in Rome where a divided cabinet led by
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi nears a government crisis.
Angry exchanges between ministers about the decree to limit the use of
preventive detention, announced last week, have exposed the fragility and
self-interest which characterises the three-party coalition.
The populist Northern League, which has the largest single number of
deputies in parliament among the coalition members, is clearly embarrassed
by having put its signature to the decree as it has championed the rooting
out of corruption. Thus the sight of hundreds of businessmen, politicians
and officials being allowed to leave prison where they have been held on
preventive detention on corruption charges requires much explaining to
League supporters.
Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, has offered full support to Mr
Roberto Maroni, who as minister for home affairs and deputy prime minister
is the party's senior representative in the cabinet. Mr Maroni has said he
was misled by cabinet colleagues about the contents of the decree and is
ready to resign his ministerial post. He also said he had been assured that
the use of a decree, which has immediate effect, rather than draft
legislation had been agreed with opposition parties.
His stance prompted Mr Giuliano Ferrara, minister for parliamentary
relations and press spokesman for Mr Berlusconi's government, to describe Mr
Maroni as politically infantile and amateur. Mr Ferrara belongs to Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.
Mr Maroni said he had been assured that the decree would not lead to the
release from prison of persons accused of corruption. However, it is hard to
believe that someone as astute as Mr Maroni was unaware of the implications
of the decree. All the political parties had been arguing over its contents
for at least two weeks.
The third coalition member, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, has
equally prided itself on being an anti-corruption party. As a result Mr
Berlusconi has been isolated by his two partners, which are both concerned
to prevent their separate identities from being submerged under his Forza
Italia.
The coalition parties had been fully warned about the damaging consequences
in the eyes of the public of appearing to throw in the towel over the
corruption scandals. The Amato government nearly fell in 1993 when it tried
to push through what was seen as legislation pardoning the bulk of those
involved in the scandals.
There were demonstrations in Milan on Saturday against the decree, and in
favour of the team of investigating magistrates who resigned last week in
protest. Opinion polls taken after the decree seem to confirm that it is
unpopular.
Polls for the daily newspaper l'Unita show that nearly three-quarters
consider that the decree is wrong. Only one in seven believes that Mr
Berlusconi is right. More than three-quarters of the paper's sample support
Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the head of the team of investigating magistrates.
Under fire from the public, press, opposition parties and one of his
coalition members, Mr Berlusconi counter-attacked on Saturday, listing 12
points to justify the decree. Among these were the crowded conditions in
Italian prisons and the slow process of justice. Mr Berlusconi said that
remanding in custody should be an exception and only used for serious
offences.
He added that it was the duty of the prime minister to defend the weak and
that any modifications to the decree should reduce still further custody for
suspects. Motives other than concern for weaker citizens have, however, been
attributed to the commitment of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Alfredo Biondi, his
justice minister, to the decree.
Mr Maroni noted that one of the effects of the decree has been to put a
brake on investigations into corruption cases involving the fiscal police in
Milan, where important revelations had been thought imminent. One of the
first beneficiaries of the decree was Mr Biondi's former Liberal party
colleague, Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, former health minister.
The League will use all its influence to try to have the decree withdrawn.
Since it could use its strength in parliament to block it passing through
both houses, this is a real threat. Mr Berlusconi can use only one card -
the threat of early elections. Until now this threat has been credible
against his dissident partners because he has been riding high in the
opinion polls and would almost certainly improve his position at their
expense. But the impact of his conduct over the decree on public opinion
suggests he could now be weakened in the eyes of the electorate.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Compromise offer in Polish strike: A dispute between Warsaw
steelworkers and Italian employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter five-week strike by workers at the Warsaw steelworks, taken over
two years ago by Lucchini, Italy's largest private steelmaker, reached a
turning point at the weekend as strike leaders dropped plans to take control
of production and offered the Italian management a compromise designed to
open talks.
In a landmark confrontation between the 3,400-strong Polish workforce and a
foreign investor, Lucchini is demanding that the strike end before talks can
start on their demand for a 30 per cent wage increase. But the gap between
the two sides - which Catholic bishops acting as mediators are seeking to
close - is large.
Lucchini argues that the wage demand is too high. The workers, who earn an
average Dollars 250 (Pounds 165) a month gross compared with Dollars 175 a
month when Lucchini took over in 1992, say pay increases have not
corresponded to either inflation or the 100 per cent rise in productivity
over the last two years.
Mr Andrzej Wieczorek, the deputy head of the Solidarity union's Warsaw
region, yesterday threatened to step up protests if Lucchini did not accept
the compromise proposal. He was speaking after a church service at the works
at which the workers and their families heard Fr Henryk Michalak, a local
parish priest, tell them: 'When there is a conflict between capital and
labour, labour always comes before capital.'
The workers' determination is fuelled by the feeling that the new Italian
owners are failing to respect their past achievements. Under communist rule
the plant, built in the 1950s, enjoyed prestige as a crucial supplier to the
defence and engineering industries. Then, in the 1980s when the plant was a
Solidarity stronghold, the authorities went out of their way to accommodate
their requests. Even now it is a key supplier to local industries, including
Fiat Auto Poland's Cinquecento plant in Bielsko. But a sign on the gate
saying 'Welcome to the white blacks at Lucchini' implies that they feel they
have been pushed into a neo-colonial situation.
Workers complain that the foreign owners show them no respect. The mood
contrasts sharply with the almost 100 per cent backing for the joint venture
with Lucchini which the workforce, then 4,500 strong, voted in a referendum
two years ago.
At that time the Lucchini joint venture was seen as the only way out for the
debt-laden works, which was beginning to recover from a sharp drop in sales
in 1991 as Comecon markets collapsed.
The agreement with Lucchini, which has a Polish government golden share
giving it veto powers in the joint venture, commits the Italians to an
Ecu150m (Pounds 115.5m) modernisation programme to cut costs while bringing
output up to 1m tonnes a year from present annual sales of 300,000 tonnes,
15 per cent of which are exported. Last year Lucchini's output in Italy was
2.4m tonnes and the strategy in Poland was to position the company to be
ready to supply the countries of the former Soviet Union once the area
recovers.
However, the modernisation plans ran foul of a complex land ownership
situation. Lucchini says it did not know when it signed the initial deal
that much of the steelworks was built on a former tsarist military training
ground taken over in 1920 by the newly independent Polish state, which
however failed to document its title to the land. The registration of
ownership has taken 18 months to complete. Meanwhile, the International
Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and a group of Italian banks whose loan is to be guaranteed by SACE, the
Italian credit agency, have held up the already arranged Ecu150m in
modernisation loans until the land deeds were ready.
The delay infuriated the workers, one of whose strike demands is that the
modernisation be started immediately. Last year the group showed a net loss
in Warsaw of 27bn zlotys (Pounds 780,000), against more than 400bn zlotys
recorded in 1992, the last year of Polish management.
Lucchini says it will not abandon its initial investment commitment - Ecu19m
in cash and knowhow transfers and Ecu8.3m in promissory notes. Actual
investment in Warsaw by the Italians has been a mere 100bn zlotys.
The Polish government so far has backed the Italians. Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek,
privatisation minister, told parliament recently the strike was illegal and
the blame for the delay in modernisation was to be laid entirely at the door
of the Polish side.
But the conflict has a nationalist undertone. 'Not only are you fighting for
wages you deserve, you are also fighting for control of the nation's right
to its means of production,' the strikers heard Fr Michalak say yesterday.
If the stoppage is allowed to escalate, it will put question marks over the
viability of foreign investment in Poland.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Kuchma shows his true colours: Ukraine's new leader is ready
to embrace market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the cold war, it was a truism of US politics that only Republican
leaders, with their impeccable anti-communist credentials, had the clout to
negotiate with the Soviets.
In a Ukrainian version of this political axiom, Mr Leonid Kuchma, the
president-elect who is to be inaugurated tomorrow, appears ready to
implement policies which, under a different leader, would provoke the
fiercest outcry from his own constituencies.
He was swept into office last weekend through the pro-Russian and communist
vote, and is setting himself up as a free marketeer, a defender of the new
republic and a cautious friend to Russia.
Mr Kuchma is a farm-boy from central Ukraine who made his career in the
Russian-speaking defence industry but is increasingly reverting to the
Ukrainian language of his childhood. The new president has a far greater
ambivalence towards Russia than romantic proponents of Slavic brotherhood in
Moscow, or his Russian-speaking supporters at home, might wish.
He sees the Ukraine's economic future as closely tied to Russia's fortunes
and he aims to create 'a Euro-Asia common market'. Mr Kuchma intends to tear
down trade barriers between Ukraine and its largest market, viewing Russia
as a potential economic partner rather than a still clawed, recently ousted,
overlord.
Even so, Mr Kuchma and his advisers retain what many Ukrainians would see as
a healthy wariness of mother Russia. One of the new president's top economic
aides (an ethnic Russian entrepreneur) bustled through the campaign
headquarters serving as Mr Kuchma's temporary office with a tale of Russian
'spies' who had already visited him.
Mr Kuchma is also committed to hold on to the contested Crimean peninsula.
It 'is now a part of Ukraine and will stay that way'. He points out that it
'voted for the new Ukrainian president.'
The new leader's confidants admit that the hard-headed industrialist has 'a
romantic side; this is a man who strums the guitar in his free time'.
Some observers have feared that this sentimental streak might extend to a
belief that the old days of cheap Russian fuel might return, given a
sufficiently accommodating government in Kiev. But his tenure as prime
minister, while Russia was jacking up oil prices almost to world market
levels, appears to have cured Mr Kuchma of this nostalgia.
'Of course, Russia won't sell us oil and gas at subsidised rates,' Mr Kuchma
says, lecturing on the rules of the free market as though to a dim pupil.
'That's how the market works - no-one sells anything more cheaply than he
has to.'
The new president realises that closer economic ties with Russia are no
panacea - a harsh reality which Mr Kuchma did not often share with his
voters. The fledgling administration will struggle to find more viable
economic solutions.
Ukrainian bureaucrats, many of them hand-picked for their loyalty to the
out-going president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, are only reluctantly releasing
information to the new administration. Each new revelation makes the Kuchma
team more depressed. The new man has inherited a debt-laden government with
no official budget and outstanding promised credits - which Mr Kuchma says
he will try to block - which could trigger a new round of inflation. It also
has a huge debt to Russia and Turkmenistan for oil and gas.
He still cherishes warm memories of the old days when heavy industry,
including the missile factory he managed, was the pride of Soviet industry,
but Mr Kuchma appears to have decided that market reforms are the only
solution.
He hopes to meet Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, as soon as possible and has already met the US ambassador
twice as part of his bid to secure the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) promised
to Ukraine by the Group of Seven industrialised countries if it begins
reforms. Mr Kuchma realises, though, that western aid can alleviate no more
than slightly the pain of economic transition.
'Between 20 and 25 per cent of our factories must be closed down. They are
barely operating and what they do produce they sell to themselves,' Mr
Kuchma says. 'Our main task now is to figure out how to transfer state
factories to private ownership.'
That sounds promising but, as Mr Kuchma himself is the first to admit, as
the leader of the country with one of the worst economic records in what was
the Soviet Union, he has a credibility problem. 'We've had so many
programmes already, I don't even want to talk about mine. Now is the time
just to do it.'
First, Mr Kuchma must assemble a government and take control of the state.
He appears to be vetting the reformist credentials of current and future
cabinet members: Mr Roman Shpek, economy minister and the most progressive
figure in the old government, will stay. Mr Viktor Iushchenko, chairman of
the national bank, will need to explain to the new president 'why he did not
more forcefully fulfill his mission to defend the national currency' if he
wants to keep his job.
Mr Kuchma says he will let the new prime minister stay on initially - 'I met
him and he seems to be a reformer' - but the president-elect wryly admits,
'I do not expect passionate embraces' from parliament, which is dominated by
hard-line leftists.
Mr Kravchuk ruled Ukraine through an agile series of political manoeuvres,
at the expense of a clear political agenda. Mr Kuchma, accustomed to the
disciplined obedience of the Soviet defence industry, is by nature inclined
to a very different sort of leadership. The first stages of his
administration will show whether his commitment to reform Ukraine's economy
and create an effective, but not subservient, relationship with Russia
survive in the often brutal and inchoate world of Ukrainian politics.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Setback for Balladur as minister goes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government of prime minister Edouard Balladur suffered a blow
last night with the announcement of the resignation of Mr Alain Carignon,
the communications minister.
A brief communique announcing his surprise resignation said that Mr Carignon
had said he was stepping down because he wanted to be able to express
himself freely in a corruption investigation involving a press company at
Grenoble, the south-eastern, Alpine city where he is mayor.
Mr Carignon, 45, is the first minister to resign since Mr Balladur's
centre-right government took office in March last year. In stepping down, Mr
Carignon has also become the latest figure to be affected by a series of
corruption investigations of French politicians and businessmen over the
past few months.
The minister said that he wanted to be placed formally under investigation
in the case so that he would have access to police files for his defence,
while minimising embarrassment to the government.
Mr Balladur said that he 'saluted' Mr Carignon's decision, adding that he
hoped the unfolding of the legal case would allow Mr Carignon to establish
his good faith and to be cleared of any blame.
The investigation behind Mr Carignon's resignation concerns Dauphine News, a
press group which publishes a magazine at Grenoble.
In a letter to his ministerial staff, Mr Carignon said that the case did not
involve any concealment or diversion of public funds, no personal enrichment
or fiscal fraud.
'In withdrawing from the government, I will become a citizen again. In
taking my liberty, I am also ensuring that neither the independence of the
judiciary nor that of the government can be compromised,' he said.
The minister submitted his resignation yesterday, and it was accepted by the
prime minister. A statement from Mr Balladur's office said that Mr
Carignon's functions would pass, for the time being, to Mr Nicolas Sarkozy,
budget minister and government spokesman.
Over the past few months, various political and business figures in France,
on the right and the left of the political range, have been involved in
corruption investigations.
Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, has been investigated for alleged
illegal financing of the Republican Party. Mr Bernard Tapie, a left-wing
entrepreneur and politician is being investigated for fraud and tax evasion.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs may reject peace proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnia's rival assemblies - the republic's Moslem-led legislature in
Sarajevo and the Serb deputies in nearby Pale - will today give their
verdict on an internationally sponsored peace plan. And all the signs are
that the Serbs will say No.
Diplomats said yesterday that only a last-minute turnround, under the
influence of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, could avert a resounding
rejection from delegates in Pale.
If they turn down the plan devised by a five-nation contact group, the
Bosnian Serbs will by defying international opinion. In effect, they would
be challenging the group to put into effect the threatened 'disincentives'
for those who refuse to co-operate.
The contact group has pledged to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia
and possibly to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian government, if the
Serbs say No and the government says Yes. United Nations and Nato commanders
at the weekend met in Zagreb to decide possible responses if one side
rejects the plan.
Senior Bosnian Serb officials have defiantly predicted that the deputies who
arrived in Pale over the weekend from all parts of their self-proclaimed
Serb republic will turn down the proposals.
In Belgrade, President Milosevic has not delivered a firm opinion on the
peace plan but is believed to support it, if only to ease economic pressure
on Serbia. But he claims to have only limited influence over his kinsmen in
Bosnia, and he wants to avoid the humiliation he suffered last year, when
the Bosnian Serbs ran counter to his advice and turned down the Vance-Owen
peace plan.
The latest proposals call for a Moslem-Croat federation to control 51 per
cent of Bosnia, while the Serbs - who currently control 70 per cent - would
pull back to a 49 per cent share.
Mr Milosevic indicated to the British and French foreign ministers last week
that he took seriously their offer to lift economic sanctions in return for
co-operation.
But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told the visiting ministers he
had strong objections to the plan, mainly constitutional. He wanted the
Bosnian Serb territory to be fully independent, while the plan called for
both statelets to form a loose confederation.
Politicians from the Serbian Democratic Party, the main political grouping
in Pale, made it clear they intend to vote No. Some of the loudest
rejections have come from representatives of regions that would have to be
ceded to the Moslem-Croat federation under the peace plan. Bosnian Serb
paramilitaries at the weekend rounded up Moslems who have remained in
Serb-held territory.
General Ratko Mladic, military commander of the Bosnian Serbs, has told Mr
Milosevic he will never hand over such strategic positions as Mount Ozren in
northern Bosnia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'We get on well with everyone,' said a Luxembourg hat-shop owner, in one of
the narrow, sandy-coloured stone streets that run steeply downhill from the
city's main square. 'We are the very best Europeans.'
On Saturday, the morning after Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime
minister, had been chosen to replace Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
European Commission, it was difficult to find Luxembourgers in the Grand
Duchy.
The woman serving in a coffee shop in the city centre was Belgian. 'You
won't find any Luxembourgers round here,' she confidently predicted. 'You
have to go to the country to find a pure Luxembourger.'
The man behind a stall in the fruit market was from Portugal. 'We're all
European now, anyway,' he said grumpily. Two elderly ladies daintily eating
fruit salad in the shade of a tree were Dutch.
Each day, thousands of commuters travel to the Grand Duchy to work in banks,
insurance companies, bars and restaurants, the result being a polyglot
nation where some 30 per cent of the 400,000-strong population and half the
workforce is foreign.
Luxembourg's location - boxed in by France, Belgium and Germany - means that
the citizens are tri-lingual, speaking French, German and the local
language, Letzebuergesch. A German dialect heavily laced with French, it has
recently been designated the official language, although government business
is still mainly carried out in French.
'There's no point asking what Luxembourgers think about something, because
there is virtually no such thing as a real Luxembourger any more,' said a
barman of French and Luxembourger origin, who carried a Luxembourg passport.
'There is nothing here to feel really proud of, but it's a nice, convenient
place to come from,' he adds, with a modesty indicative of the country.

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has avoided
potentially costly legal actions on both sides of the Atlantic by settling
charges that it used anti-competitive practices to maintain a mono-poly in
the personal computer market.
The deal between Microsoft, the US Justice Department and the European
Commission settles one of the biggest antitrust investigations since the
break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telephone group, in
1984.
The settlement, which requires Microsoft to drop some alleged monopolistic
practices, marks the end of a four-year investigation which involved
unprecedented co-operation between competition authorities in the US and
Europe.
In a telling judgment upon the methods Microsoft used to maintain its
predominance in the software industry, the US Justice Department said:
'While the company fairly and legally climbed to the top of the industry
ladder, it used unfair and illegal practices to maintain its dominant
position.'
Microsoft, with annual revenues of Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn), dominates the
personal computer software industry with its operating systems installed in
more than 120m machines. Operating systems act as the 'central nervous
system' of a computer, controlling its basic functions.
The company founded by Mr Bill Gates, a young entrepreneur who has become
one of the richest people in the world, has faced increasing criticism for
commercial practices which its competitors allege limit their ability to
break into the market.
Microsoft provided the operating system for the original International
Business Machines PC in 1981. This became a world standard and allowed
Microsoft to become the leader in its field.
The US authorities, announcing the settlement on Saturday, said Microsoft
had 'built a barricade of exclusionary and unreasonably restrictive
licensing agreements to deny others an opportunity to develop and market
competing products'.
Ms Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust
division of the US Justice Department, said: 'Microsoft is an American
success story, but there is no excuse for any company to try to cement its
success through unlawful means, as Microsoft has done.'
She added: 'This case sends a powerful message that the antitrust
authorities of the US and the EC are prepared to move decisively and
promptly to pool resources to attack conduct by multinational firms that
violate the antitrust laws of the two jurisdictions.'
The Justice Department antitrust suit cites in particular Microsoft's 'per
processor' licensing contracts, which require personal computer
manufacturers to pay royalties to Microsoft based on the number of computers
they sell, regardless of whether Microsoft programs are installed.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Cabinet reshuffle due before election of new Labour leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle lines of British politics until the next election will be drawn
this week with sweeping changes among top government ministers and the
almost inevitable election of Mr Tony Blair as Labour leader on Thursday.
Mr John Major is likely to announce his cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, a
day before the Commons rises for the summer recess, although it could come
as early as today. The changes will pit a modernising Labour leader
promising new political ideas against a government seeking to re-establish
its popularity after two divisive years in which morale and cohesion have
been sorely tested.
The new line-up of ministers will give Mr Major a chance to reassert his
authority over a fractious Conservative party which has suffered setbacks in
recent local government, European and parliamentary by-elections.
They will face a reconstituted Labour leadership. Also contesting the
party's top job are Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting party leader and shadow
leader of the Commons, and Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary.
While Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, looks assured of victory, there is
less certainty over the outcome of the contest for deputy leader. But
political observers say it isincreasingly likely Mr Prescott will defeat Mrs
Beckett for that post.
Commenting on the government reshuffle, Sir Norman Fowler, outgoing Tory
party chairman, said yesterday that the prime minister would aim to bring in
new faces. 'I imagine there will be quite a number of changes,' he said.
However, it is thought unlikely that any of the three main offices of state
will change hands.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, remains the standard bearer of the
government's determination to restore the public finances to health. Mr
Douglas Hurd is expected to stay as foreign secretary despite pressure from
the party's right wing for a Euro-sceptic replacement.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has had a difficult year pushing the
Criminal Justice Bill through parliament, but his position is considered
safe.
Instead, the focus of the reshuffle will be the appointment of a new party
chairman to rally the party until the next general election. Favourite for
the post, which should come with a place in cabinet, is Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary. However, in recent weeks Mrs Gillian Shephard,
agriculture minister, and Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, have been
suggested as contenders.
Those most likely to leave their posts are Mr John Patten, education
secretary, and Mr Peter Brooke at National Heritage.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Minister's threat puts Italian coalition in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The survival of Italy's three-party coalition government led by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi was in danger last night, following the resignation threat of a
senior cabinet minister in a worsening row over a decree curbing the power
of magistrates.
Mr Roberto Maroni, minister for home affairs and deputy to Mr Berlusconi,
accused cabinet colleagues of trickery. He said he had been deceived about
the contents of the decree, promulgated last week, which has already led to
the release from jail of several well-known politicians and business people
accused of involvement in the 'tangentopoli', or bribesville, corruption
scandal.
Mr Berlusconi said yesterday evening that Mr Maroni's accusations were not
true. He demanded that his deputy make an unconditional withdrawal of the
accusations or resign.
The cabinet crisis and trial of strength between Mr Berlusconi and members
of his government come at the start of a week when the government's economic
policy is scheduled to be announced.
Mr Maroni, who said he should not have trusted his cabinet colleagues when
he sought assurances that the decree would not lead to the freeing of
suspects, told his party, the populist Northern League, that he was ready to
resign from government. However, the League's executive yesterday declined
Mr Maroni's offer to resign from Mr Berlusconi's cabinet. Mr Umberto Bossi,
the League's leader, said the deputy prime minister enjoyed the full
confidence and support of the party.
Mr Bossi said the decree should be withdrawn. He said the affair should not
be used as an excuse for fresh parliamentary elections, which Mr Berlusconi
has threatened to call on several occasions since assuming power two months
ago.
A firm line against corruption has been a fundamental part of the Northern
League's policy. Any softening of this position would threaten the standing
of Mr Bossi, and the release of those under investigation might be seen as a
sign of weakening.
Mr Bossi's call for withdrawal of the decree aims to reassure his party's
followers. Similar calls were made this weekend by the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance party, government partners with the League and Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia. In common with the League, the MSI takes a strong
line against corruption.
With two of the coalition members expressing serious misgivings about the
decree, Mr Berlusconi has been left isolated. Opinion polls suggest the
public is against the decree and supports the Milan investigating
magistrates who resigned in protest last week.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Unilever and Procter open new front in soap war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble are about to open a new front in their soap
wars, with Unilever preparing to test samples of a new product developed by
its rival.
The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group said it had obtained a draft sales
brochure and a sample of a new Procter &amp; Gamble detergent.
Procter &amp; Gamble plans to launch its own new generation detergent, called
Ariel Future, in Germany in the autumn and then elsewhere in Europe.
The two consumer giants have been engaged in a battle for months over
Unilever's detergent, called Persil Power or Omo Power. Procter &amp; Gamble
claims the detergent could damage clothes after frequent washing.
Unilever will later this week publish details of its own tests on its
detergent which, it will argue, vindicate the product.
Mr Andrew Seth, who heads Unilever's UK detergent business, said the Procter
product, Ariel Future, was 'rivetingly similar' to its own detergents in the
way the sales literature emphasised better stain removal at lower
temperatures.
Mr Seth said the apparent similarities between the products "unquestionably'
explained Procter's attacks. 'This completed the jigsaw puzzle for me,' he
said.
Mr Seth said he thought Procter had been working on its new formulation for
some time but had been pipped to the post by Unilever: 'I think this is
something they've been intending to do for a long time but we got in a bit
sooner than they thought we would. You realise how galling it must be to
have somebody do it before you.'
However, Procter &amp; Gamble is already preparing its defence of Ariel Future.
It said yesterday: 'This is not a copy-cat product but a leap-frog product.'
It emphasised that Ariel Future would not contain the manganese based
ingredient which has been at the centre of the controversy over the Unilever
detergents. Procter &amp; Gamble said Unilever's comments on the new detergent
were 'pure speculation' since none of the new product has yet left its
factories.
Unilever is not sure the Procter &amp; Gamble product it is preparing to test
will be the final formulation for Ariel Future. But even if the tests were
to reveal damaging information on their rival, Unilever says it would not
use the same tactics as Procter. Mr Seth said: 'We would let the market work
it out.'
Mr Seth added that the publication of Unilever's laboratory results on
Persil Power and Omo Power was irrelevant to the British market where the
reformulated Persil is the market leader with a 30 per cent share, compared
with Procter's Ariel's 28 per cent.

FT  16 JUL 94 / AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn merger with McCaw cleared: Historic
telecoms deal beats last obstacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the biggest deals in US corporate history was given the go-ahead
yesterday when the Justice Department signed a consent decree allowing
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to buy McCaw Cellular Communications for
Dollars 12.6bn (Pounds 8.1bn).
The all-share transaction will bring together the largest long-distance
telecommunications company in the US with the country's biggest operator in
the mobile phone business.
The deal was originally announced in August last year but had to be
investigated by the Justice Department to determine whether or not it could
be considered anti-competitive.
The department attached conditions to its consent to make sure the merged
company did not abuse its market position:
McCaw must allow equal access to its cellular systems to all long-distance
carriers, including AT&amp;T's competitors, so consumers can use the
long-distance carrier of their choice.
AT&amp;T must ensure that companies buying the cellular equipment AT&amp;T already
manufactures - many of them competitors of McCaw - are not disadvantaged by
the merger.
AT&amp;T said it was happy with the terms of the decree and that they did not
undermine the merger.
AT&amp;T invented cellular telephone technology more than 30 years ago and is a
big manufacturer of the equipment, but until now it has been unable to offer
mobile phone services.
One possible regulatory hurdle to the takeover was that, under the court
agreement which broke up the old Bell System company and gave birth to AT&amp;T
and the local telephone companies, AT&amp;T became a long-distance carrier. The
so-called Baby Bells were given the local phone markets.
Some Baby Bells said it would be unfair to allow AT&amp;T to enter their markets
through the acquisition of McCaw because the break-up agreement forbids them
from entering the long-distance market. But AT&amp;T said the overwhelming
majority of local calls would continue to be made through ordinary
telephones and it was not interested in competing in local telephone
markets.
Although McCaw is heavily indebted and loss-making, AT&amp;T wants to acquire it
because it regards mobile phones as the way of the future.
The deal still has to be agreed by the US district court in Washington, and
there will be a 60-day period for comments. But it is unlikely to face any
further big hurdles, and AT&amp;T said yesterday its would put its merger plans
into operation very soon.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Seoul uneasy as funeral put off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea early today postponed the state funeral of Kim Il-sung - a
surprise move that caused some concern among South Korean officials.
The North said the former president's funeral, planned for tomorrow, would
be put off until Tuesday to allow more mourners to stream past his body,
lying in state in Pyongyang.
Officials in Seoul fear one result of the postponement may be to fan unrest
in the South, where there is increasingly bitter debate about how the Seoul
government should respond to the death a week ago of the North's Communist
leader.
The Seoul authorities have announced a crackdown on left-wing organisations
planning mourning ceremonies. This follows the firebombing of six police
stations in Seoul on Thursday by radical students protesting at the arrest
of student organisers for praising President Kim. Student organisations have
said they will send groups with condolences to Pyongyang, after North Korea
announced it would let South Koreans wanting to pay homage cross the heavily
fortified demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas.
North Korea yesterday resumed propaganda attacks against the South. It
criticised South Korean President Kim Young-sam for placing troops and
police on alert.
'Despite the fact that even the US president and Japanese prime minister
expressed their regrets over the death of President Kim Il-sung, only Kim
Young-sam. . . is acting recklessly,' declared the state-controlled Radio
Pyongyang.
South Korean officials have privately criticised President Bill Clinton for
offering condolences over Mr Kim's death in a diplomatic gesture to maintain
US dialogue with the new North Korean leadership.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has offered US airlines two new routes across the Atlantic, from
Manchester to Los Angeles and from Stansted via New York to Chicago.
Transport secretary John MacGregor said the offer was being made to maintain
services for travellers and to show Britain's interest in getting a new air
services accord with the US. American Airlines withdrew from the
Stansted-Chicago route last year and British Airways will suspend its
Manchester-Los Angeles service in the autumn.
The US broke off negotiations on air routes last December, claiming Britain
was not offering US airlines enough slots at Heathrow in return for better
US access for British airlines. Under the 1991 accord only American
Airlines, United Airlines, British Airways and Virgin can serve Heathrow on
the two nations' transatlantic routes.

'What did you do in the struggle? The battle for freedom? The apartheid
years? Does anyone remember?'
There is an old Afrikaner ailment that seems to have reached epidemic
proportions here in this most southern African land of rising hope. It is
called Raubenheimer's disease.
It was first noticed after the Boer war, when the British empire was nearly
forced to its knees by the Boer guerrillas in the mist. This type of warfare
was then exported to various skirmishes, from Afghanistan to Bosnia, with
great success, while the British introduced the civilised world to their new
concept: the concentration camp.
After the Boer war, and while there was still great hatred and grumbling
against the British, the Afrikaner found himself, by 1910, in a newly-formed
union, blue-printed by the parliament in London and symbolised by the new
South African flag: a compromise between those of the Cape Colony (Union
flag) and the two ex-Boer republics (not the Union flag). The effect of this
was to trap the Afrikaner in the centre of an orange, white and blue banner
until the stroke of midnight before April 27 1994.
Raubenheimer's disease was then spotted for the first time in a small dusty
dorp on the wide plains of the Karoo, where Farmer Raubenheimer, having just
lost his farm to fire and his family to famine, suddenly started speaking
English and singing 'God Save the Queen'. He seemed to have forgotten
completely the reason for the pain of his past.
This - some people said - merciful amnesia made it possible for him to live
side by side with his bloody enemy in peace. He even married again - a
younger English girl - and they had three sons and called them after various
recent British kings. Some of his bitter neighbours, however, swore that
Farmer Raubenheimer had, in fact, lost his marbles.
It is said that since then all Afrikaners have been born with a trace of
Raubenheimer's disease. In decent company it was merely whispered that these
strange bearded and braided volk knew how to adapt and not to die. 'Damn
pragmatic' and 'bloody unbalanced' were more often used to explain the
strange ways by which Afrikaners turned the other cheek and then whipped
round, guns ablazing.
We Afrikaners have always been great artists in absorbing - no, call it
stealing. We would take something from another people, maybe a Dutch
language, and unrecognisably beat it up to become Afrikaans. Or we would
take a democratic Westminster system of government and bleed it dry of its
truth.
We even legitimised an inbred sense of racial madness, gave it an official
Afrikaans name (that the English spelt apart-hate), wove it into our statute
books 'democratically' and ended up in the smelly corner of the world's
classroom with a skunk's tail pinned to our backs.
But no more. Chalk has become cheese. The bad old days are gone. Mandela
rules OK] Now, shockingly, it has become the time to be not anti but pro.
One is proud of being a South African. Political satirists are jumping off
roofs. Nostalgia-wracked anti-apartheid activists are ignoring the
complexity of Bosnia and those political prisoners in Northern Ireland and
are being treated for withdrawal symptoms. The black-and-white issues of
Afrikanerdom's experiment in separate development have vanished.
Like that flesh-eating streptococcus, Raubenheimer's disease has struck
again. Here in this brand new South Africa it is impossible to find anyone
more or less white and relatively sane who will admit to having supported
apartheid.
It is the same elsewhere, of course. In East Germany, after the Berlin Wall
came down, there were suddenly no communists to be found, just as there had
been no Nazis in Germany in 1945 (nor even, particularly, in Austria,
Holland or France). No one recalls voting Margaret Thatcher into power all
those years ago when British democracy still had a ring of authenticity to
it.
Some Afrikaners who swore bloody revenge on a democratically-elected,
non-racial, non-sexist government are now swapping fond stories of
election-day braais (barbecues) with their new non-white neighbours. Beers
in hand, former terrorists and old fascists are comrades in arms; a
cloudburst over a squatter camp is no longer the result of bad nationalist
politics - only of bad weather.
Amnesties and amnesias seem to go together. There are now more free men on
the street (and in parliament) with blood on their hands than in the
prisons. Politically-motivated crimes, ranging from mass murder to messy
murder, have a cut-off date - if you blasted your enemies away before the
cut-off, you are fine.
During our past - until April 27 1994 - South African democracy was too good
to share with just anyone. As a result, the world hated us. Now we are more
of a democracy than Britain.
Good news is no news and at the moment nearly everything here is good news,
give or take a couple of killings that last year would have been called a
political massacre; now it is just the criminal element.
Everyone in government is united by salary and perks, from the old regime to
the new extreme, from Chief Buthelezi to Winnie Mandela, the Black Evita,
appointed not as minister of child welfare, which she had rehearsed for, but
as deputy minister of culture. ('Culture?' she said. 'That's a funny post.'
Please do not send her a biography of Madame Mao.)
The world is still fascinated with South Africa, though no longer confronted
by the nightly Munch-scream of black South Africa on the news; no longer
turfing the Outspan orange into the toilet; no longer wearing the 'Free
Mandela' T-shirt and feeling good for being so good.
What now fascinates the world is this relatively well-educated, relatively
civilised, relatively relatively pleasant group of white Christians (and
Jews) who took the most beautiful country in the world and utterly and
completely screwed it up - and nearly got away with it. And then turned
round with a smile at the edge of the cliff and handed their only parachute
to the former enemy.
I thought I started with a question. Perhaps I had the answer. I really
cannot remember. Call it Raubenheimer's disease.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Private View: The gentle touch in a tough business - Valerie
Strachan, chairman of the board of Customs and Excise, says she has 'no
difficulty' with the changes proposed for the civil service in this week's
white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After work, mandarins are supposed to go to Covent Garden for the opera or,
at a pinch, the ballet. Valerie Strachan, the most senior woman in the
British civil service, likes to go Scottish dancing.
Times are changing at the summit of the Establishment, and will change again
as a result of a white paper published this week. Strachan is a symptom of
that change. The chairman of the board of Customs and Excise is a woman, but
she is a woman who does not waste time pretending to be a man.
Appearances, we all know, are deceptive. So encountering an eager, chatty,
smiling and feminine Permanent Secretary, Grade One, I was immediately on my
guard.
Valerie Strachan is tall with a strong handsome face, wide mouth and
innocent brown eyes. There is a look about her of those rangy female tennis
players who used to bound about Wimbledon in the old days. Or one could
imagine her as a painter and artist's model from the free-thinking,
free-loving Bloomsbury Group.
Whatever the comparison, she appears altogether too jolly, too nice, to be
running a government department charged with hunting drug-dealers,
pornographers and smugglers, let alone enforcing the collection of VAT.
There was something girlishly naive about the way, at the end of the
interview, she confessed to a love of Highland dancing. Or was the naivety
just a little bit calculated?
I asked her first if she had thought of feminising her title in order to
reflect current fashion.
She had thought about it, she said, and was committed to equal opportunities
but had decided against. 'It's a traditional title and to have changed it
would have been making a much louder statement than I wanted to make.' Her
staff have been told to call her 'Valerie' or 'Mrs Strachan', according to
how well they know her.
By coincidence - if it is coincidence - the three top women in Whitehall all
run law-enforcement agencies. The other two are Barbara Mills, Director of
Public Prosecutions, and Stella Rimington, head of MI5, the domestic
intelligence service. Did they talk to each other, as women?
'We do have chats about things,' she said. 'But it's sort of on the hoof, as
it were . . . me saying to Stella as we go into permanent secretaries (the
Wednesday morning meeting at the Cabinet Office): 'I know where you've got
that jacket from; I must remember not to get the same one.' That sort of
thing. Or talking a bit to Barbara about some equal opportunities issues.'
Do the male permanent secretaries call you 'The Girls'?
'No.' She laughed scornfully. 'No, nor do we call them 'The Boys'. I don't
think they see us a little tightly-knit group. Nor do we see ourselves as
being a threatened minority. All of us have been around for a long time and
know each other really quite well. So it's not an issue between us.'
Does it not feel like a men's club?
'Mmm. Not particularly, no. There is a clubby atmosphere but it is the club
of 20-however-many-it-is people, each of whom is at the top of an
organisation, all of the organisations having something in common. It is not
like the Reform Club or whatever I imagine other clubs might be like.'
Clubmanship, public school and Oxbridge are no longer essential
qualifications for the mandarinate. Strachan herself comes from Hull, went
to the local girls' high school and to Manchester University, is married to
another civil servant and has two children.
She joined Customs and Excise straight from university (the Department of
Education was her first choice) having little idea of what it did. ('I
thought they were the people that chalked your bags when you came into the
country.') She has spent time at the Home Office and Treasury. Some say that
if any woman can make it to the very top as Cabinet Secretary and head of
the home civil service, Valerie Strachan can.
Customs and Excise is not a typical government department: it has its own
matey atmosphere and has escaped a lot of the pain of civil service reform.
But Strachan is, with qualifications, a promoter of the new business
culture. When I suggested that her title, chairman of the board, might be
getting uncomfortably close to the truth, she claimed that the white paper
reinforced the traditional virtues of the British civil service.
Is she a traditionalist or a young Turk?
'Am I allowed to be both? In my time I have been as young Turkish as
anybody, including pushing the financial management initiative and being a
supporter of the basic concepts of Next Steps. But I don't see there is a
necessary conflict between that and between maintaining public service
values.'
It would be unsuitable to privatise VAT inspectors, for example.
Traffic wardens had been, I said. Why not VAT inspectors?
'I think VAT inspectors are having to exercise discretion and judgment all
the time, every day of their lives. I think it is quite important that they
should be publicly accountable.'
Was there nowhere where efficiency was being won at the expense of public
service?
'I think you have trade-offs, but there are all sorts of trade-offs. In real
life there are trade-offs between efficiency and collecting the last penny
of revenue, between obligations to get off the back of small business and
tax morality.'
So you are not going to be put on either side of this debate?
'I would like, please, to have my cake and eat it.'
Vatwoman's main worry at present is the Vatman's public image. Do you mean,
I said, that the department is hated by business?
'That's not what I mean, no. What I mean is . . . You haven't mentioned the
Citizens' Charter.'
I don't want to mention it, I said.
'No, I daresay you don't' She sounded sympathetic. 'But we have got a lot of
charter obligations. The tax man is never popular, the taxwoman is never
popular and I don't expect them ever to be. But I have felt that we could
usefully soften the image we present while not losing our effectiveness. We
are law enforcers, but we can be friendly law enforcers.'
Are you prepared to say the department has been heavy-handed in the past?
She paused and sighed. 'No, that wouldn't be quite right.'
Do you want to supply a better word?
'Let me think. Um. We have sometimes had a reputation for being
heavy-handed. The reputation has been based on remarkably few instances.
When we go out and actually ask people what they think of us and what they
think of the service, people are on the whole pretty satisfied. What I am
trying to do is not so much remove causes for complaint but be positively
more helpful.'
This week's white paper would put senior civil servants on personal
contracts, with salaries set according to performance as judged by a
company-style remuneration committee. They would no longer get a fixed rate
according to seniority, and their jobs - some of them - would be open to
outsiders.
The head of customs said the proposed reforms only made explicit what was
already implicit in the mandarin's terms of employment. She had 'no
difficulty' with the changes, she said, but was very anxious that her and
her staff's performance should not be judged in crude terms - say, by the
amount of revenue the department brought in.
Hoping to discover the steel behind those candid eyes, I said: You smile a
lot. Or is it just today?
'No, I think I smile a lot. This may be, I have to say, a terrible character
weakness.' She smiled.
So people think 'She's a nice girl. We can swing this one past her.'?
'No, I don't think they think that. They have probably learned that if I
think something ought to be done, then I will be quite persistent in making
sure that it does get done.
'I like working with people, and working in a co-operative way. But at the
end of the day, once I've heard everybody's views and formed a view about
how we ought to go forward then I will be quite persistent.'
Can you be a brute when required?
'I don't set out to be a brute. I set out to achieve the desired result,
preferably while making people feel . . .
You mean they don't feel it while you kick them?
'I really do try not to kick people,' she laughed, 'because I never think
bruises are the best way of achieving results. I mean, there will be times
when I run out of patience and people are aware of the fact.'
Do you mind confrontation? 'No, I confront if I need to confront. But I
prefer to operate without, you know, pinning somebody in a chair and saying
'You have done wrong.'
'I'm quite patient - most of the time.' She laughed again and reached for a
homely example. 'Don't try me in the hairdresser's. I'm not patient there.
One of the chief virtues of the man who dresses my hair at the moment is
that he does it on time. I hate being kept waiting.'
I struggled to regain a footing. The art of dissembling, I said, must be in
the armoury of any top civil servant.
'I don't think that's the way I operate. I suppose I would lie if I had to
for my country. But on the whole I try and negotiate straight.' (She led the
negotiations on the European Union single market changes in VAT and excise
duty collection, and is chairman of the world customs co-operation council.)
'I do try not to dissemble. I'm not sure I could keep it up for long
enough.' She paused. 'I don't suppose I always show all my negotiating
cards.'
I'm sure you don't, I agreed. You probably play poker till late at night
wearing a green eyeshade.
'No, no.' She laughed. 'I hate card games. It's a lovely picture, though,
isn't it?'
When, finally, I asked her if she had eyes on the pinnacle of the civil
service, the Cabinet Office, she said she had not even begun to think about
it. There were 'hordes' of people - well, several at least - who would be
obvious candidates.
But I got the strong feeling that Valerie Strachan would not be suffused
with maidenly blushes if the job were offered to her. Meanwhile, it was time
to pack up and get off to dancing class.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: From figures to dragons, suns, moons and laughter - An
exhibition of Maggi Hambling's recent work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As she approaches 50, Maggi Hambling remains as unpredictable and
unclassifiable as she is prolific. Not only does she never seem to stop
unless tied down, her paints confiscated and studio locked, but what she
does is likely to surprise and test even the most committed of her
supporters. Portraits, life drawings, landscapes, mystical abstractions upon
landscape, symbolist or mystical abstraction - all have appeared in their
turn over the past dozen years or so, and not as single spies at that, but
in battalions.
She is something of a surrealist, and an expressionist within the broad
meaning of the act - though for saying as much I was once pinned against the
wall by the late and redoubtable Vera Russell, who said to me darkly as she
shook me by the throat: 'Maggi is not an Expressionist: Expressionists are
German.' Even she, I feel, had she seen this latest work, would now concede
the point.
Towards Laughter, her show at the Barbican, offers us a just such a view of
the paintings of the last ten years, with a handful of earlier works to set
the thread. It is not a straightforward retrospective, but more a
retrospective of an idea, and its development within the work.
Miss Hambling, in her portraiture and figure painting, has always been
interested in physical expression, passing moods and states of mind. The
show opens with one or two examples - a portrait, from the mid-1970s, of
Lett Haines, her sometime teacher, roaring with laughter and profoundly
convincing in its psychological subtlety; and another laughing and this time
female head from 1984, which is more robustly stated.
But rather closer to the particular idea, as we see it develop through the
show, are two much stranger images. The first is of the ghost of another of
her great teacher-friends, the artist Cedric Morris, a wispy and transparent
ectoplasmic figure in his chair against the light. The second, 'In Praise of
Smoking', is a conversation piece in the extended series of paintings she
made of her friend, the comedian Max Wall, in the early 1980s. It shows the
two of them in the studio, one posing, the other painting, with the smoke
from their cigarettes rising to come together in a cloud above their heads,
a cloud personified in the head of ghostly monkey.
The jump from this to the first of the sunrise paintings, which marks the
transition from overtly figurative painting to the abstraction that makes up
by far the greater part of the show, is thus not so great as it might at
first appear. The key work is the Dragon Sunrise of 1986, a burst of orange
against the blue out of a black cloud that immediately calls to mind the Zen
temple ceiling paintings of Japan. Soon the moon appears, to do battle with
the sun - reflected images, ambiguous surfaces, suggestions of pools and
water, or dragons and demons chasing the richly darkening sky. These are
increasingly ambitious and dangerous paintings, in terms both of scale and
content, and it is a measure of the artist's skill that she carries them off
so often, and so beautifully, in this phase of the work.
And suddenly, with the 1990s, the laughs take over, great bursts and belly
laughs of pigment, pools of colour, swirling and rioting together. They
begin quite soberly with 'The Happy Dead', another symbolic and abstracted
sky, and so, happiness to laughter, the thought of the physical, visible
presence and description of mood and sound, the intangible and the
evanescent, is born.
These are now high risk ideas and images, the danger ever-present of
ludicrous, bathetic failure and belly flop, and it is a measure of Miss
Hambling's nerve that she has persisted with them with such spirit and, in
the event, to such effect. Here they are: 'Brothel Laugh', all puce, pink
and voluptuous with hints of buttocks and black stockings; 'Suicide Laugh',
desperate, defiant and vertiginous, light on dark and into the void;
'Bathroom Laugh', swirling, supine forms, pink against blue; 'Laugh Defying
Death', legs kicked in the air; 'Champagne Laugh', yellow froth and glass
held high; 'Secret Laugh', off to the side and turning away; 'Ghosts of
Laughs', fading into silence.
Lately Miss Hambling has also made some ceramic sculpture, linear, spindly,
precariously curling and colourful objects that are, in sort, cousins to her
painted images. Like them they are suggestive and evocative things that
invite sympathetic recognition and fellow feeling. But then the shared joke
is no mere laughing matter, but a privilege too. We laugh or die. Maggi
Hambling laughs a lot, and this is a brave show.
Maggi Hambling - Towards Laughter; the Concourse Gallery, Level 5, the
Barbican EC2, until July 31, then on to Preston. Sponsored by Northern
Centre for Contemporary Art and Northern Electric, funded by the Arts
Council.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Into the 21st century - Video / Nigel Andrews has fun
playing with a new toy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have seen the future and I have almost got it to work. My life has been
transformed in recent weeks by the acquisition of a CDi Digital Video
machine.
Welcome to the wonderful world of advanced interactive home viewing.
Technophobic teething troubles mean that I am still striving to master the
intriguing game Caesar's World Of Boxing, in which you programme your own
pugilist and watch him battle in glorious live-action colour. And I am also
settling slowly into the other game requiring use of a remote-control
joystick, Voyeur. In this you roam around a US presidential contender's
mansion eavesdropping on possible would-be murderers. A computer-enhanced
Robert Culp plays the politico, and a flotilla of semi-recognisable TV
actors occupy the guest rooms. Using your handset, you zoom in and out
picking up clues, highlighting evidence, or punching up your choice of
tell-tale dialogue scenes.
My mastery of this games universe is limited as yet. But I have screened the
CDi feature films without problem and I can announce: you might as well
throw out that steam-driven VCR now. This system comes closer than any
previous small-screen viewing experience to providing the resolution, hi-fi
colours and sound quality of a cinema.
So far the Philips CDi people seem to have tied up Paramount and Polygram
alone as major product sources, so the movie catalogue is small. Top Gun,
Naked Gun 2 1/2 , Ghost, The Crying Game and a couple of dozen more.
But for the first few days of using this machine, what you watch hardly
matters. You are startled that faces look real and humanly coloured rather
than blobbed in with video-pink; that night time scenes are not invisible to
all but badgers; that grain and blurriness are things of the past. A
favourite movie scene that on the VCR looked scarcely better than a home
video - let us say, Frank Drebin's lobster-terrorised White House dinner
with the Bushes in Naked Gun 2 1/2 - now plays like something out of
Visconti.
Since this machine has been handed to me on indefinite loan by the Philips
CDi promotion people (its high street cost is Pounds 550), I should probably
moderate my enthusiasm lest there are cries of bribery and corruption. I
also hesitate, as a film critic, to trumpet a viewing device that might
encourage even more of you to stay away from cinemas.
But a breakthrough is a breakthrough. And with movie CDs as with music CDs -
to which they are near-identical in size, shape and price (Pounds 15 per
film) - you have unprecedented intervention powers. Scenes are
'chapter-headed' so that you can jump straight to them. There is a freeze
button, producing a perfect image not an imitation of a distressed
blancmange. And when you press the final stop button, that is it: you do not
have to look at the ceiling for five minutes while the tape rewinds.
With my credibility as a cassette-recommender under threat, I must now turn
180 degrees and argue for such virtues as VCR viewing still has. The main
one is range. There is movie life outside Paramount, and in the foreign film
department July offers riches aplenty. Pick of the month is Farewell My
Concubine (Artificial Eye), Chen Kaige's epic of modern Chinese history,
escorting us through 50 sumptuously dramatised years from 1920 to the
Cultural Revolution.
Other sensory feasts have made the journey from large screen to small. Juzo
Itami's Tampopo (Electric) is a Japanese comedy about food, sex and
Buddhism. Fassbinder's Effi Briest (Connoisseur) is a hieratically handsome
version of the classic German novel. And on a new video label called
'Dangerous To Know' you might try Hamlet and A Midsummer Night's Dream: two
kitsch-rich Shakespeare adaptations by Anglo-Italian director Celestino
Coronado, a sort of bantamweight Derek Jarman.
But it is no good. I cannot stay away from the CDi. I am now playing an
interactive disc called The Worlds Of . . ., which features several pop
groups I have never heard of called 'Sultans of Ping', 'Ugly' and the like.
Coaxing my handset's mushroom-shaped control button, I dodge about between
groups and between songs. I can also answer quizzes, choose bits of
interview and even play a hide-and-seek game with the 'Sultans' on the Tokyo
subway. Amazing. I was only just getting used to the 20th century, and now
here is the 21st.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Ideal opera for Drottningholm - Haydn's 'Orlando
paladino'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abundant pleasures of visiting the Drottningholm Court Theatre - 50
minutes from Stockholm by lake steamer - have been recounted on this page
before. But the single most satisfying experience there is of course a good
opera production, and Haydn's Orlando paladino, the main project this year -
the second season under Elisabeth Soderstrom's artistic direction and the
chief conductorship of Nicholas McGegan - is very fine indeed.
One of Soderstrom's aims is to explore the operatic genealogy of the Mozart
and Gluck works that have been central to Drottningholm's repertory over the
years. Orlando paladino was Haydn's most popular opera, and it is likely
that Mozart heard it; certainly, there are pre-echoes of Don Giovanni in the
characterisation of Medoro (a Don Ottavio figure) and Pasquale, whose
catalogued grievances call to mind Leporello. Though the plot cannot stand
dramatic scrutiny, it serves as a framework for marvellous music, much of it
worthy of Mozart's operas.
Orlando paladino is ideally suited to Drottningholm's 1766 jewel-box of a
theatre. It was composed (1782) for a court theatre of about the same size
and period - that at Eszterhaza, long since destroyed - which like
Drottningholm was on the fringe of European culture but flourished under
enlightened patronage. The libretto, stitched together from Ariosto's heroic
legends, calls for all of Drottningholm's famous stage effects: the thunder-
and wave-machines work their magic, Alcina descends sitting on a cloud,
Orlando decapitates one statue and is himself transformed into another.
Drottningholm's deep stage provides the dark recesses for Alcina's magic
grotto. As if in a time capsule, the original, 18th-century stage machinery
is still in place: scene changes are accomplished within a matter of
seconds, dissolving with breathtaking beauty.
Ivo Cramer's production, in Dominique Delouche's lavish costumes, catches
the opera's naive blend of comedy, romance and heroism. Cramer, a
choreographer of long experience, provides lively spectacle (Alcina's
monsters were taken by dancers) that almost disguises the work's lack of
stage sense.
Drottningholm's cast was strong, with two especially good sopranos.
Elisabeth Berg was bright and bell-like as the shepherdess Eurilla, and
Pia-Marie Nilsson sang with almost perfect poise as the languishing
Angelica. The tenor Klas Hedlund stood out for his expressively comic
Pasquale and skilful patter singing. Gunnar Lundberg blustered powerfully as
the swashbukcling but ineffectual king of Barbary, Rodomonte; Anita Soldh
characterised the benign sorceress Alcina well; Stefan Dahlberg was more
than adequate as the ridiculous, swooning Orlando; but Lars Magnusson's
Medoro was too loud and unyielding.
Haydn's score sparkled under McGegan's energetic direction, but it never
seemed pushed. McGegan caught the music's essential lyricism, and the
'period' instruments - beautiful winds - sounded smooth in the theatre's
intimate acoustics.
The Festival runs until September 9.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Canterbury Tales' on the vicarage lawn - Martin Hoyle
finds more postcard humour than Chaucer in this revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across the road from the Garrick Theatre on Thursday evening a group of
Morris Men, biologically if not politically corrected to Morris Women,
jingled their stuff. Inside the theatre ominous signs directed us 'to the
vicarage lawn'. In the auditorium we were assailed with the determined
jollity of actors acting normal people, uttering lines like 'I'm the local
vicar here' and 'It's lovely weather, just what we needed' as they mingled
in the stalls with the insouciant spontaneity of Desert Storm. At the
appearance of the ultimate deterrent, notebooks and pens in the hands of
some of my colleagues, their cordiality became less marked and they turned
their frozen smiles elsewhere.
The mood of village theatricals is deliberate. The latest resurrection of
Michael Bogdanov's 1978 Young Vic adaptation of The Canterbury Tales is set
during the annual Geoffrey Chaucer Storytelling Competition supervised by
the vicar of Upper Hopewell. This framework cunningly licences the muse of
writer Robin Davies to roam through such well-loved comic exchanges as 'Can
I have the actors on the lawn, please?' Excited female voice: 'You can have
me, vicar]' and 'I'm the Reverend Nicholas Nunn.' Brian Glover, heckling
from the audience: 'Knickerless nun? Oo]' There are time-honoured references
to 'spanking tarts' and competitors 'getting the biggest clap'. If the
thrust and parry of 'You're the fakir]' 'I beg your pardon]' and the spirit
of Donald Magill postcards are your sort of thing, you will find this a
painless introduction to the first great English poet.
Ah yes, Geoffrey Chaucer. The amateur thesps of Upper Hopewell mount (ho ho)
five of his tales, while the audience is coerced, panto-style, into
demanding a sixth, the Miller's Tale, needless to say, from the previously
proscribed Brian Glover. Your final receptiveness to Peter James' production
depends on how you take Mr Glover, voice of a thousand TV commercials (even
the theatre posters refer to 'Chaucer with nowt taken out'), God in the
National's Mysteries and remorselessly jovial professional Yorkshireman.
Here he turns up as everything from a fakir to a busty barmaid in costumes
that ingeniously incorporate an elephant and the bar respectively. What is
more, much more, is that he fills in with what used to be called saloon bar
stories, a few of which go a long way, some decidedly too far.
When not cringeing, or blossoming, before this campaign of ferocious comic
attrition, you can find much to admire in a cast that gives signs of being
rather classier than its material. Richard Cant, an accomplished young
comic, and the pretty Katherine Oliver deserve mention for gallantry that
includes exposing bare bottoms in the Miller's Tale. Nicolas Lumley's vicar
puts over hoary old facetiousness as if it were fresh; but then the whole
company deserves a clearer brief. Is this a family show? It strikes me as
too unremittingly, leeringly smutty. Is it an adults only show? It is too
clumpingly unsophisticated. I have an awful idea that it may be fitted into
a sixteen-pints-and-a-vindaloo evening by office parties or those still
suffering withdrawal symptoms over the World Cup. I would hesitate to
recommend it to Eng. Lit. students.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Four Weddings and a poem - Anthony Curtis on the work
of the suddenly voguish WH Auden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once before, a film turned a poem into a best-seller. In 1945, when John
Pudney's RAF poem 'Do not despair/For Johnny Head-in-Air' was included by
Terence Rattigan in his screenplay for The Way To the Stars, Pudney's sales
shot up from hundreds to thousands. Now Richard Curtis has done it again
with Auden's 'Funeral Blues', 'Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone .
. .' in Four Weddings and A Funeral.
Faber have re-printed 'Funeral Blues' with some other Auden favourites in a
handy pamphlet (Pounds 2.50, 32 pages) that has already sold 40,000 copies
and featured in a reader's offer in The Sun, a tabloid newspaper not
previously noted for its commitment to poetry.
Curiously, Auden and Pudney were at school together, pupils at Gresham's
Holt in Norfolk in the 1920s. Auden a couple of years older than Pudney, had
rather a crush on the younger boy. When Auden threw a batch of his poems
into the school pond, saying that he had abandoned poetry for science, it
was Pudney who helped him fish them out.
At Oxford in 1925, Auden read Natural Science before switching to English.
He published poetry in Oxford journals, edited Oxford Poetry with Day Lewis
and had his first homosexual affairs. All the while he continued to write
enormous quantities of poetry and he sent copies of them all to Pudney, who
was still at Gresham's. Auden's undergraduate poetic output was staggering.
No wonder he got a Third in his finals.
The Pudney collection is one source for Katherine Bucknell's timely edition
of Auden's Juvenilia 1922-28 (Faber Pounds 25, 320 pages). Other sources are
poems preserved by Auden's mother, and those given by Auden to other friends
of his youth, among them the painter Robert Medley, Christopher Isherwood,
Tom Driberg. The typescripts often show several variants of a single poem.
Most are now safely lodged in the Bodleian and other libraries but the
Isherwood collection, the largest, is still in private hands.
There are many lines and whole verses that were re-cycled into later poems
in his published work. Dr Bucknell (who runs the Auden Society's Newsletter)
notes all this in a running commentary of considerable fascination.
Altogether she has assembled more than 200 poems written by Auden between
the ages of 15 and 22. Most of them have never been published before. A few
were published by Stephen Spender in an edition on a hand press limited to
30 copies as Poems (1928). It was Auden's first book. Most of the copies
have disappeared. Dr Bucknell re-prints everything that was in it.
From the start the young Auden was able to assume the manner of well-known
poets he admired with amazing assurance. We can watch him restlessly trying
on poetic styles until he found one that really suited him. He goes through
a Georgian phase based on Edward Thomas, Walter de la Mare, where the
imagery of disused mines, kestrels and the Midlands rural landscape of his
childhood, is already obsessively captured. Then he has a pessimistic Hardy
and Wilfred Owen phase that lasts until he works his way through to the
moderns, Edith Sitwell, TS Eliot, Hopkins. Here is Auden at 20 becoming
Gerard Manley Hopkins in a poem called Aware:
'Bones wrenched, weak whimper, lids wrinkled, first dazzle known,/
World-wonder hardens as bigness, years; brings knowledge, you.'
More typical, however, than this denseness is a playful poem structured like
a game of Consequences:
'She said: 'How tiring the lights are]/' I said 'How noisy it is]' So up we
scrambled/ Into the loft which smelt of hay/. 'Supper]' they said, all too
soon.'
Auden later called this phase a process of 'literary transference'; by
assiduously copying the style of a master the novice-poet discovers his own
voice. Certainly by the end of the volume Auden has done that. There is a
sequence called The Megalopsych (Aristotle's Great-minded man) that shows
him maturing almost over-night. As Bucknell says, as soon he had finished it
Auden began to iron out its pomposities and simplify. That simplicity was
second nature to him by the time he came to write 'Funeral Blues'.
In its 30 pages, Faber's new slim volume amply reveals Auden's power to
haunt us with memorable lines, also his stunning versatility: it has a
ballad, 'O what is that sound that fills the ear'; a calypso 'Driver drive
faster'; a lullaby 'Lay your sleeping head my love'; an exhortation 'Lover
sulk no more' (for Britten); a couple of Cowardy cabaret songs, and a clutch
of love-lyrics in which complex metrical problems are solved.
For those who wish to read 'Funeral Blues' in the context of Auden's entire
poetic output, the Collected Poems (edited by Edward Mendelson Faber &amp; Faber
Pounds 14.99, 928 pages) contains 'all the poems that WH Auden wished to
preserve'. He did not, however, wish to preserve the juvenilia but, as an
insight into the development of a great poet who has become unexpectedly
voguish, we are grateful to Dr Bucknell for the trouble she has taken to let
us have them.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Scrapyard to splendour - The V&amp;A's new Ironwork
Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Victoria &amp; Albert's unparalleled ironwork collection is housed in one of
the oddest spaces in any museum. Spanning the entire 220m width of the
building at first-floor level and at times less than five metres wide, it is
more flyover than gallery, top lit by glass domes and pierced by light wells
affording unexpected bird's-eye-views of the galleries below.
Two years ago the space was closed for essential repairs to the roof.
Yesterday, the re-displayed Ironwork Gallery re-opened to reveal what is one
of the most visually stimulating galleries the museum has to offer - at
least in part. Funding has only been available for the first phase of the
project, and none forthcoming for an accompanying catalogue. Indeed no
publication on this extraordinary collection is currently in print.
As if to emphasise the lack of cash, the display ends abruptly with a
stencil representation of the massive screen designed by George Gilbert
Scott for Hereford Cathedral. This tour-de-force of Gothic Revival metalwork
still languishes in store awaiting a sponsor for its restoration. The sole
elements in place over the stencil, like 3D jigsaw pieces, are the
'terracotta' figures of Christ and a Choir of Angels ingeniously
manufactured out of electroformed copper.
Dismantled and removed from the cathedral in 1967, the Hereford screen is
also eloquent witness to the metalwork department's enterprise in
architectural salvage on a monumental scale. Many of its treasures are here
as a result of church and state's cavalier disregard for its heritage - from
the 13th-century wrought-iron grilles from Chichester Cathedral rescued from
a scrap-metal merchant in 1896, to an Art Nouveau fireplace designed around
1904 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and pulled out of the Willow Street Tea
Rooms in Glasgow before they were demolished.
A 12th-century wooden chest ornamented and protected by elaborate
S-scrolling iron hinges and latchwork came from the derelict St Albans
Abbey; the 17th-century polychrome chandelier rods on display once adorned
Wren's St Michael Queenhithe, demolished in 1876. Garden gates stand as a
solitary survivor of Robert Adam's Lansdowne House in Berkeley Square; the
elegant neo-Classical lampholder a poignant reminder of one of the London's
most tragic losses, the Adams' Adelphi buildings off the Strand. This sad
litany continues with the disembodied balconies, balusters and grilles from
France, Italy, Germany and Spain.
Most of the collection, of predominantly wrought rather than cast iron from
1600-1800, was acquired by the museum 1860-1930, often through the agency of
passionate preservationists. Perhaps the unlikeliest Albert Steptoe of all
was the pioneering Lady Dorothy Nevill, who saw her mission as relieving
workers' cottages on the Weald of their 16th-century decorative cast-iron
firebacks and presenting them to the nation in 1914.
The museum's mission was, of course, to improve modern design and
manufactures by exhibiting the finest examples of the arts of the past and
present. In this sense the V&amp;A itself was - and is - an exhibit. On show,
for instance, is one of the ropework cast-iron radiator panels with their
curious hermaphroditic friezes designed by Alfred Stevens for the museum
around 1862. The department's most recent commission, a steel bench by the
American artist Albert Paley, is due to arrive in late October.
James Horrobin's impressive hammered gates to the gallery of 1981 are
evidence of the relatively recent flowering of contemporary blacksmithing in
Britain, a phenomenon that makes the abysmal design and poor execution of
the new Queen Elizabeth Gates in Hyde Park as bewildering as they are a
wasted opportunity. Their only saving grace is as a reminder that decorative
ironwork was traditionally painted and gilt; black was late Victorian
convention.
It is, however, the stark contrast of the black, calligraphic lines of
wrought iron imaginatively set against white walls that provides the gallery
with its immediate drama. Its eclectic collections of smaller ironwork
warrant closer inspection: fiendishly complex medieval and renaissance locks
and keys take their place alongside gleaming 16th-century Venetian gondola
prows, the dull, delicate filigree of Berlin iron jewellery and jolly
turn-of-the-century biscuit tins.
Black-stained wooden display cases are re-used from the old Glass Gallery,
the first of the V&amp;A's 'materials and techniques' galleries to be
re-displayed. These, plus the gimmick-free simplicity of the new
installation, are virtues born of necessity.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Surprising last refuge for the avant-garde - Off the
Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Glyndebourne has only been open seven weeks but it is proving a much
more exciting place than its sedate predecessor. The booing that greeted
Deborah Warner's abstract version of Don Giovanni on Sunday was not
unprecedented - Peter Sellar's equally revisionist Magic Flute was heartily
disliked by traditionalists (most of the Glyndebourne audience) a few years
back - but this time the barracking was more confident and showed a welcome
tendency to start fresh traditions in the new auditorium.
More startling still have been the advertisements alerting the public to
unsold tickets this season. It has always been true that a ticket to
Glyndebourne was almost impossible to come by, even from touts. There are
over 6,000 opera lovers waiting (at a signing on fee of Pounds 50) many
years for the membership which guarantees tickets: most regard a trip to
Glyndebourne with as much longing as the three sisters dreamed of Moscow.
Now the Sussex Downs are suddenly much closer. The enlarged auditorium means
that there are around 400 extra tickets to sell each evening and for the
August performances of Peter Grimes and The Rake's Progress (20th century
opera is blatantly less popular with the social element in the Glyndebourne
audience) there is still availability. Hence the ads. There has also been
confusion about the 42 standing places priced at Pounds 10 and Pounds 15 for
each performance. They can be booked in advance. So if you are quick you can
go to Glyndebourne this summer for a tenner.
Next summer it should be open house for everyone. The programme consists of
new productions of a rare Handel oratorio and Berg's Lulu, not obvious box
office hits, plus revivals of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which
failed to sell out completely last time - and Don Giovanni. As the ENO
rejects experimentalism for popular operatic favourites Glyndebourne seems
to be the surprising last refuge of the avant-garde.
Sponsors love a credit, a little plug in the press for the opera, concert,
art show, they have supported. This is mainly because only a minority of
company directors appreciate the arts, and media coverage is the obvious way
that they can prove to their more hard-headed colleagues that there is a
tangible return from the corporate investment.
In the past such credits were hit and miss affairs, with the BBC and some
national newspapers refusing to acknowledge the sponsors' contribution. As a
result, the arts lost patrons. In recent months the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts, and arts organisations like the National Theatre
and the Tate, have launched a strenuous campaign to persuade the media to
include the sponsor in coverage of arts events.
It seems to be paying off. In a survey conducted in May, 74 per cent of
sponsors were credited, compared with only 49 per cent in February. Six
newspapers had a 100 per cent success rate, including the FT (of course),
but also such traditional sceptics as the Guardian (now an ABSA member) and
the Evening Standard.
The research also indicated that sponsorship is still comparatively rare.
Only 39, or 22 per cent, of the 180 reviews were of events that had been
sponsored.
There is only one topic of conversation in the arts and heritage world at
the moment - the National Lottery. It would be a dozy arts administrator, or
museum director, who did not want to jump on this particular gravy train.
The problem is which compartment to make for - the Millennium Fund, the arts
treasure chest, or the heritage pay outs.
The Millennium Fund is channelling half its anticipated revenue, or roughly
Pounds 800m by the year 2000, into large prestigious new building projects
of national significance, which puts it off-limits to art galleries and
theatres that only need refurbishment. The arts money is likely to be
competed for by every arts institution in the country, from the National
Theatre to a local video workshop. This leaves the National Heritage Fund's
largesse as the centre of most speculation.
One gallery that has moved swiftly is Dulwich Picture Gallery in south
London. This week the chairman of its trustees, Lord Sainsbury, launched an
endowment appeal which aims to provide Pounds 400,000 a year to improve both
the display of the collection and the out-reach programme of this, the
oldest public art gallery in the UK. To ensure such extra income suggests an
endowment fund approaching Pounds 8m.
Dulwich has pulled off a coup by receiving a promise of help from the
National Heritage Fund, although, surprisingly, not from its lottery
resources but from its annual grant, which is to be reduced next year to
Pounds 8.8m. This is because the Heritage Lottery Fund can only give
endowment support to projects to which it has also given capital funding, a
strange quirk of the legislation.
Of course help for Dulwich depends on the Trustees raising a substantial sum
by their own efforts, but with Lord Sainsbury and Mrs Vivien Duffield on
board the omens are good that this little artistic jewel should gleam even
more brightly in future.
Every now and then you catch sight of the extent of the recession in the art
market, or rather in the picture market, where things are toughest. In July
1990 a bidder quickly acquired on the same day at Sotheby's some 18th
century ancestors by paying Pounds 820,000 for a family portrait by Zoffany;
Pounds 380,000 for one by Joseph Wright of Derby; and Pounds 68,000 for a
Gainsborough. Fate forced him to sell them at Christie's this week. The
Gainsborough sold - for Pounds 45,500, but even at Pounds 220,000 there was
no bidding on the Zoffany and the Wright of Derby was bought in at Pounds
180,000. The market for smart decorators' paintings is still stone-cold
dead.
By chance this week an aristocrat was actually buying in the saleroom. The
Duke of Devonshire, through his Chatsworth Trust, paid Pounds 265,500 at
Sotheby's for a Gainsborough portrait of Georgina, an 18th century
Devonshire Duchess. In 1876 it sold for 10,000 guineas, at the time the
highest sum ever paid in the saleroom. How tastes change.

SWEET KILLOUGH: LET GO YOUR ANCHOR by Maurice Hayes The Blackstaff Press
Pounds 7.99, 240 pages
As a junior minister in Belfast, opening a red box for the first time, I was
disgracefully spoiled. My permanent secretary in the Northern Ireland civil
service was a Lancastrian Ulsterman called Norman Dugdale. He is a fine poet
(also published by the admirable Blackstaff Press) and a student of Cavafy -
and maybe, not surprisingly, the best drafter of a ministerial submission I
have ever encountered.
And then, such are the riches of the Province, when Dugdale retired, he was
followed by Maurice Hayes, a former town clerk of Downpatrick, chairman of
the Community Relations Commission and a senior mechanic in most of the
efforts in the 1970s to broker civilised constitutional deals between the
warring tribes of Ulster.
Maurice Hayes, who went on to become Northern Ireland's Ombudsman and
today's chairman of the Ireland Fund's advisory committee, is a Gaelic
scholar and polymath and a high-scoring member of Ireland's 'Round Britain
Quiz' team on BBC Radio. A trenchant analyst of politics and a brave and
decent public servant, he has like Mary Robinson or Garret Fitzgerald, all
the wit, the learning, the courage and the crack, that give the Irish at
their best a head-start in the charm stakes.
Now he has written a book about growing up in a seaside village in County
Down before the war. And if there is a more magical album of childhood
memories, real or fantasy, I would like to know what it is. As Seamus Heaney
points out in his introduction, Sweet Killough is part-census,
part-inventory of births and deaths, rumours and gossip, tides and winds,
moons and stars, harvests and catches, trains, boats, horses, sayings and
songs.
Killough was a self-contained community into which the outside world
encroached little. The biggest employer was the brickworks, not a very sound
foundation for the local economy given the state of the building trade and
the tendency of the local bricks to split and spall and let in the wet.
Otherwise fishing and farming provided the jobs.
Hayes described the farming calendar - the ploughing, the sowing, the
harrowing, the threshing - and reminds us of the 'fragility of crops at the
mercy of the weather'. But above all, in sight of the Mournes and the Isle
of Man, Killough is made by the sea: 'the sea is everything, everywhere,
determining the limits off existence, the weather, the rotation of
activities, and often life itself and death'.
We read of the shore, the jetsam, the bays, the piers, the rocks, the
wrecks, the drownings, the cod, the mackerel, the lobsters, the limpets, the
nuns stranded like penguins by the changing tide, and the mariners' tales
which link the coast with more exotic landfalls, Table Mountain in Cape Town
or Sugar Loaf in Rio.
Killough itself was mercifully free of religious bigotry though reminded of
it from time to time by riots and sectarian rites up the road in Belfast.
'The tell-tale signs by which religion was treated: the presence of rosary
beads . . . the failure to say which instead of who in the third word of the
'Our Father' . . . to be called Liam instead of Billy . . .' none of these
things mattered in Killough.
Hayes grew up in a Catholic home in which the superstition of a fishing
village fused with the deeper rhythms of the church's liturgical year;
abstinence and fasts, Ash Wednesday and additional rosaries, and always the
minutia of ritual and indulgences, for example 'how many prayers (known
faintly as ejaculations) were necessary to bring about a desired end.' His
father was from Waterford, had fought for the King in Mesopotamia and India,
and even received a patriotic wound, though for playing football not from a
Turkish scimitar.
Hayes draws a marvellously evocative picture of his mother, to whom
childhood illness inevitably drew him very close, as well perhaps as the
fact that as the second of twins he had been expected to die, until 'coaxed
into life by the heroic efforts of the mid-wife and a couple of drops of
brandy'. We see his mother sewing and making jams and marmalade, apple jelly
and puff pastry, we learn of her careful collection of people with cures for
warts and haemorrhages and ring worm; we hear her aphorisms and the precepts
learned from the nuns and from her own mother. She was obviously a
remarkable woman, and at the book's end is borrowing money to buy a rundown
commercial hotel in Downpatrick to help pay for a better education for her
children. As in other happy childhoods, she is the heroine of the tale - at
one moment bent over her sewing machine, 'her hair tumbled down on one side,
masking the work', seeming to envelope mother and son in their own private
tent. And then, alas, she is knocked over on her way back from the station
by touring cyclists, and after that she never seemed young again.
It is customary at this time of year to give advice on the books that should
be packed for the beach or the river bank. All I can say, as politely as
possible, is that if you do not take Sweet Killough with you this year, you
are mad.

TITO by Jasper Ridley Constable Pounds 20, 495 pages
TITO AND THE RISE AND FALL OF YUGOSLAVIA by Richard West Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 20, 436 pages
Tito was dying. But anyone watching the thousands of ordinary people who in
1980 packed a square in Skopje for a spring festival of singing and folk
dancing would have concluded that Tito's Yugoslavia was very much alive.
Even in Pristina, capital of neighbouring Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians drank their defiance of the Serb authorities it seemed - certainly
to the younger generation - that the Old Man's federal framework, however
fragile, was simply too precious to be allowed to break.
Tito knew how fragile it was. Nine years before he died, Jasper Ridley
records, he warned Croatian Communist party leaders who had met to discuss
an outbreak of nationalist separatism: 'Under the cover of 'national
interest', all hell is assembling . . . In some villages the Serbs, out of
fear, are drilling and arming themselves . . . Do we want to have 1941
again?'
Foreigners, he said, were speculating that after his death - he was then 79
 -'the whole thing will collapse'. Meanwhile Brezhnev had mischievously
offered to lend him Soviet troops to suppress the Croat militants.
Josip Broz was a Croat himself. Yet he had no time for the absurdities of
myth and language with which his heirs have attempted to justify the killing
and the 'cleansing'. However cruel his courageous wartime leadership of the
Partisans may have been and however ruthless his subsequent treatment of
political opponents he could be pragmatic to the point of generosity when
national unity was at stake.
The topical question, of course, is to what extent Tito and the government
he led can be held responsible for the dreadful civil war that has followed
his departure.
To some he is a benign dictator - the only good advertisement communism ever
had - whose personal charisma and political vision converted ancient
tribalisms into a convincing national identity. To others he is a
sharp-suited, luxurious ex-revolutionary whose corrupt, extravagant regime
was waiting to be hijacked by power-grabbing nationalists such as the Serb,
Slobodan Milosevic, and the Croat, Franjo Tudjman.
Both biographers incline to the first interpretation, but neither supplies
an answer.
Ridley's book is more history than biography. Being the historian he is, he
not only maps out the life but carefully and usefully supplies the world
context in which Tito operated, from the break with Stalin in 1948, through
the depths of the Cold War to his reincarnation as a world statesman, leader
of the 'non-aligned' nations. Ridley also scorns the theory advanced by
Michael Lees in The Rape of Serbia that Winston Churchill was duped by
left-wing intelligence advisers into switching British wartime support from
Mihailovic's Cetniks to Tito's Communist partisans.
But little emerges of Tito the man that has not already been recorded by his
wartime comrades: Vladimir Dedijer in his politically-correct hagiography or
Milovan Djilas in his sharp, dissident and more subjective portrait.
With his chosen perspective, Ridley's Tito reads like a well-researched
textbook, full of background but short of foreground. The pace quickens and
lightens in the final chapters - there is a good anecdote about Tito's
boar-hunt with an unsportsmanlike Ceausescu - but Ridley makes no attempt to
analyse the man or his works, to offer a biographer's verdict.
Richard West's book is really two. He set out to write his memoirs of a
country he has been visiting as a journalist since 1951. His publisher
suggested a biography. The result is a quick summary of Balkan history, a
cursory narrative of Tito's life and a detailed indictment of the Croats,
from the Catholic Ustasha's wartime butchery of Serbs to the revisionist
ideology of the current Croat leadership, with a visit to the shrine of
Medjugorje on the way.
The book concludes with anecdotes and reminiscences whose effect is to
illustrate rather than illuminate the Serbs' 'revenge' (a revenge in which
the Moslems have once again become the proxy victims). Tito has vanished.
His biographer muses vaguely about history and religion as the inevitable
causes of the war, but it is a view contradicted by refugees of the conflict
and by the humble folk that West himself has interviewed on his travels.
Tito always divided outside opinion: ambivalence was one of his political
gifts. Courageous, charming, autocratic, fond of dogs, hunting and women, he
has exerted a particular fascination over the British, from the soldiers who
met him in the mountains to modern historians at their desks. He inspires
extremes of admiration and distaste. On balance his reputation seems to have
been enhanced by the deluge which has followed his death. It may be too soon
for history to judge.
In the meantime, if one had to make room on the bookshelf for one more
biography of Tito, it would probably be Ridley's.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Books: The voice of moderation - The legacy of a great 16th
century thinker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERASMUS THE REFORMER by AG Dickens and Whitney RD Jones Methuen Pounds 25,
367 pages
Illegitimate, orphaned in adolescence, abandoned into an institution by his
guardians - the auguries were not good.
Yet Erasmus of Rotterdam became one of the greatest thinkers and scholars of
his age, with profound influence on Europe in the early 16th century and
beyond.
Through the turbulence of religious divide and war, his was a voice of
moderation and reason heard - and sometimes hearkened to - across the
continent.
The Emperor Charles V made him a member of his council; his works were read
not just in the Germanic and Spanish heartlands of the Habsburg empire and
France, Italy and England but also in the further flung corners of Europe
like Hungary and Poland. He corresponded with reformer and traditionalist
alike across the great swathe of European intellectual thought.
Yet within a few years of his death his works were placed on the Papal Index
of banned books. Erasmus laid the egg which Martin Luther hatched, it was
said, and he was seen as dangerously subversive.
The strands and legacy of this subversion are ably explored by Professor AG
Dickens and Dr Whitney RD Jones in a new study of Erasmus' philosophy and
theology.
To Martin Luther in 1519, Erasmus set out one of the fundamentals underlying
his approach to the quarrels of a bitterly divided continent: 'I think we
get further by courtesy and moderation than by clamour. That was how Christ
brought the world under his sway . . . Things which are of such wide
acceptance that they cannot be torn out of men's minds all at once should be
met with argument, close-reasoned forcible argument rather than bare
assertion.'
Toleration remained the hallmark of his thinking, but there was no precursor
here of a multi-faith society in which all beliefs are accorded equal
respect.
'Let them burn, by all means, those who fight the teaching of the articles
of the faith or something of equal authority by the consensus of the
church,' he was to write as the schisms grew.
But the condemnation was tempered; heresy merited burning at the stake only
if it was 'linked with sedition or any other crime which the laws punish by
death.'
His aim was to avoid schism and to maintain the polity. It was, he argued,
important to understand how few things were basic to a true faith and how
false scholarship had perverted the essentials and been used in the pursuit
of power at the expense of peace.
Above all, he believed, war had to be avoided; those who advocated it, be
they popes or kings, were guilty of the worst of sins.
Universal government, he maintained, was no answer to the imperative of
peace; it could merely lead to a bigger tyranny than was possible in a world
of fragmented states.
In the 16th century, these sentiments were seen as highly seditious. The
wonder is that Erasmus himself survived, respected till the end; it was only
after his death that his works were banned.
He may have been a critic of much of the prevailing order, but he gauged the
limits to which criticism could be taken. Vigorous refutation awaited those
who, seeing in him an ally, sought to interpret his writings beyond those
limits.
How much of a legacy has he left? For Professor Dickens and Dr Jones, the
influence of Erasmus is profound. He would, they suggest, have been in the
vanguard of today's ecumenical movement. And his influence in shaping the
thinking of those around him and who came after him meant he helped to shape
the world we live in.
There is much that is recognisably 'modern' in his outlook, in contrast with
others, such as Martin Luther, who had such a big influence on Europe's
development.
Though steeped in the ruling currents of the time, he frequently rose
brilliantly above them. His understanding, his insistence on distinguishing
between substance and form and examining basic principles, and above all his
humanity illuminate a world in which rival certainties battled for
supremacy.
The world today is as divided, though driven by doubt rather than certainty.
The Erasmian approach, as we stumble our way through, has as much validity
now as then.
Dispatches / Cape Town
Selective amnesia heals the wounds
Pieter-Dirk Uys says that former terrorists and old fascists are now
comrades-in-arms 'What did you do in the struggle? The battle for freedom?
The apartheid years? Does anyone remember?'
There is an old Afrikaner ailment that seems to have reached epidemic
proportions here in this most southern African land of rising hope. It is
called Raubenheimer's disease.
It was first noticed after the Boer war, when the British empire was nearly
forced to its knees by the Boer guerrillas in the mist. This type of warfare
was then exported to various skirmishes, from Afghanistan to Bosnia, with
great success, while the British introduced the civilised world to their new
concept: the concentration camp.
After the Boer war, and while there was still great hatred and grumbling
against the British, the Afrikaner found himself, by 1910, in a newly-formed
union, blue-printed by the parliament in London and symbolised by the new
South African flag: a compromise between those of the Cape Colony (Union
flag) and the two ex-Boer republics (not the Union flag). The effect of this
was to trap the Afrikaner in the centre of an orange, white and blue banner
until the stroke of midnight before April 27 1994.
Raubenheimer's disease was then spotted for the first time in a small dusty
dorp on the wide plains of the Karoo, where Farmer Raubenheimer, having just
lost his farm to fire and his family to famine, suddenly started speaking
English and singing 'God Save the Queen'. He seemed to have forgotten
completely the reason for the pain of his past.
This - some people said - merciful amnesia made it possible for him to live
side by side with his bloody enemy in peace. He even married again - a
younger English girl - and they had three sons and called them after various
recent British kings. Some of his bitter neighbours, however, swore that
Farmer Raubenheimer had, in fact, lost his marbles.
It is said that since then all Afrikaners have been born with a trace of
Raubenheimer's disease. In decent company it was merely whispered that these
strange bearded and braided volk knew how to adapt and not to die. 'Damn
pragmatic' and 'bloody unbalanced' were more often used to explain the
strange ways by which Afrikaners turned the other cheek and then whipped
round, guns ablazing.
We Afrikaners have always been great artists in absorbing - no, call it
stealing. We would take something from another people, maybe a Dutch
language, and unrecognisably beat it up to become Afrikaans. Or we would
take a democratic Westminster system of government and bleed it dry of its
truth.
We even legitimised an inbred sense of racial madness, gave it an official
Afrikaans name (that the English spelt apart-hate), wove it into our statute
books 'democratically' and ended up in the smelly corner of the world's
classroom with a skunk's tail pinned to our backs.
But no more. Chalk has become cheese. The bad old days are gone. Mandela
rules OK] Now, shockingly, it has become the time to be not anti but pro.
One is proud of being a South African. Political satirists are jumping off
roofs. Nostalgia-wracked anti-apartheid activists are ignoring the
complexity of Bosnia and those political prisoners in Northern Ireland and
are being treated for withdrawal symptoms. The black-and-white issues of
Afrikanerdom's experiment in separate development have vanished.
Like that flesh-eating streptococcus, Raubenheimer's disease has struck
again. Here in this brand new South Africa it is impossible to find anyone
more or less white and relatively sane who will admit to having supported
apartheid.
It is the same elsewhere, of course. In East Germany, after the Berlin Wall
came down, there were suddenly no communists to be found, just as there had
been no Nazis in Germany in 1945 (nor even, particularly, in Austria,
Holland or France). No one recalls voting Margaret Thatcher into power all
those years ago when British democracy still had a ring of authenticity to
it.
Some Afrikaners who swore bloody revenge on a democratically-elected,
non-racial, non-sexist government are now swapping fond stories of
election-day braais (barbecues) with their new non-white neighbours. Beers
in hand, former terrorists and old fascists are comrades in arms; a
cloudburst over a squatter camp is no longer the result of bad nationalist
politics - only of bad weather.
Amnesties and amnesias seem to go together. There are now more free men on
the street (and in parliament) with blood on their hands than in the
prisons. Politically-motivated crimes, ranging from mass murder to messy
murder, have a cut-off date - if you blasted your enemies away before the
cut-off, you are fine.
During our past - until April 27 1994 - South African democracy was too good
to share with just anyone. As a result, the world hated us. Now we are more
of a democracy than Britain.
Good news is no news and at the moment nearly everything here is good news,
give or take a couple of killings that last year would have been called a
political massacre; now it is just the criminal element.
Everyone in government is united by salary and perks, from the old regime to
the new extreme, from Chief Buthelezi to Winnie Mandela, the Black Evita,
appointed not as minister of child welfare, which she had rehearsed for, but
as deputy minister of culture. ('Culture?' she said. 'That's a funny post.'
Please do not send her a biography of Madame Mao.)
The world is still fascinated with South Africa, though no longer confronted
by the nightly Munch-scream of black South Africa on the news; no longer
turfing the Outspan orange into the toilet; no longer wearing the 'Free
Mandela' T-shirt and feeling good for being so good.
What now fascinates the world is this relatively well-educated, relatively
civilised, relatively relatively pleasant group of white Christians (and
Jews) who took the most beautiful country in the world and utterly and
completely screwed it up - and nearly got away with it. And then turned
round with a smile at the edge of the cliff and handed their only parachute
to the former enemy.
I thought I started with a question. Perhaps I had the answer. I really
cannot remember. Call it Raubenheimer's disease.

on the life of Robert Louis Stevenson

<TEXT>
THE LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, VOLS I and II edited by Radford A.
Booth and Ernest Mehew Yale Pounds 29.95each, 525 and 352 pages
Fans called him Velvet Jacket, the lovable, smoking Bohemian artist. To
others he was Seraph in Chocolate, an arch fin-de-siecle sensualist,
possibly over-sweet. On the island of Samoa, he was White Chief, protector
of a tribe of former cannibals. By the time Robert Louis Stevenson died in
1894, aged 44, he had become such a mythical, untouchable figure, that,
reviewing an early book of letters, a sceptical Henry James said: 'one
smells the things unprinted'.
Now, in the centenary year of his death, a magisterial eight volumed edition
of Stevenson's letters gives us a full rich portrait of the writer. Told in
his own voice - or rather in the two voices of someone whose imaginative
existence propelled his actual one - his strange short life is riveting. On
the one hand, RLS was a romantic, living out the swashbuckling fun of
Kidnapped and Treasure Island on voyages to the South Seas and a marriage to
a fast, gun-carrying Californian. On the other, there emerges a decent,
everyday guy who cared about food and the weather, ran out of cash, and
wrote home each week to his mum. RLS is already enjoying a revival as a
Victorian New Man - emotional, honest, tolerant, a model of equality in his
marriage and his friendships with South Sea islanders. These letters will
enhance both his literary reputation and his popular image.
Like many children's writers, he never quite grew up, and most of the
letters in these two volumes - ending when he was 29 - are to his parents,
or the art critic Sidney Colvin and literary hostess Frances Sitwell who
supported him when a religious row drove him from his strict Edinburgh
family. These form a journal of this critical point in his life, when he was
fighting for the freedom to be himself and to write. In becoming 'a horrible
atheist', his father said, 'you have rendered my whole life a failure'; to
his mother it was 'the heaviest affliction that has ever befallen me.'
To RLS, the pampered only child, the break with home was devastating. As
Frances Sitwell, 'a sybylline beauty over which time had no power', guided
him through the storm, he became infatuated with her. He addresses her as
Madonna: 'Your sympathy is the wind in my sails,' and 'you are the very
texture of my thought.' Colvin was also in love with her and after a 30-year
courtship, she married him. Initially a rival, RLS was devoted to Colvin. 'I
can see no harm in my dying like a burst pig upon some outlandish island,'
he tells the older man, 'but if you died, without due notice and a chance
for me to come and see you, I should count it a disloyalty, no less.'
RLS was always sickly: the rapidly changing addresses here as he moved from
spa to spa is the journey of a typical Victorian consumptive. After his
religious crisis, convalescence in the south of France was psychological as
well as physical. It healed wounds, and soon he was writing, in un-Scottish
fever pitch, 'my dear father and mother, I wish to do no more today than
tell you how much you are in my thoughts, and how much I love you . . .
please never imagine that you will lose me, or I lose you, until death
interferes . . . do believe that I love you with all my heart.'
As his biographer Ian Bell pointed out, Stevenson's style is a sick man's
response to the world heightened, distanced, specific. No letter writer has
a more intense feel for places. From Scotland 'very cold in body and black
at heart,' he writes one summer of the 'high wintry winds, and the grey sky
and faint northern daylight,' and air so invigorating 'that my scalp was
sore.' In France he swoons over sun-trapped valleys and hikes across the
Cevennes with his donkey Modestine' ('65 francs and a glass of brandy'),
taking just a change of clothing and a whisk - for his breakfast cocktail of
raw eggs. One recalls 'many is the long night I've dreamed of cheese -
toasted, mostly', in Treasure Island. The same mix of thrills and homeliness
that make his stories so shudderingly authentic informs these letters.
'You may paddle all day long,' he says of a canoeing trip in Belgium in
1876, 'but it is when you come back at nightfall, and look in a familiar
room, that you find Love or Death awaiting you beside the stove; and the
most beautiful adventures are not those we go to seek.' He ended that trip
with a visit to the Barbizon artists, and stopped one night outside the
hotel Chevillon near Fontainebleu. Peering through to the dining room, he
saw a dark, lively American woman and, to screeching delight from the
artists, faltered through the window to sit beside her.
She was a married mother called Fanny: she liked him but was unnerved by his
habit of bursting into tears. A year later, she cabled from California in
distress. RLS caught the next boat across the Atlantic, rescued her from a
disastrous husband, and married her. 'Count on Pounds 250 a year,' his
father cabled, announcing a reconciliatory allowance.
Volume two leaves RLS in the middle of this affair. Many figures from
Victorian Britain have come to life, from the crippled editor WS Henley,
model for Long John Silver, knocking down Oscar Wilde with his stick, to the
'lighthouse Stevenson's' touring the coast to show off their beacons. The
remaining six volumes promise to be as entertaining.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Lunch with the FT: The appeal of a celebrity lawyer -
Christina Lamb meets Alan Dershowitz, controversial advocate to a string of
famous clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight the Harvest restaurant in a small alley near Harvard
University offers little of note beyond some colourful murals depicting a
swirling mass of fruit and vegetables. Lunching there with Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz, however, it takes on a whole new complexion.
Often described as America's most controversial lawyer, Dershowitz has
handled a succession of high profile appeals for famous felons. His
celebrity clients include junk-bond king Michael Millken, tax-evading New
York hotelier Leona Helmsley, and former boxing champion Mike Tyson. And he
brings all of them to lunch at the Harvest. 'This place holds a lot of
memories,' he told me. 'I was here last week with Mia Farrow. I've eaten
frequently with Claus von Bulow at that table over there and this one with
Mike Millken.'
Today he has arrived late and slightly breathless from working on the appeal
to reduce Tyson's sentence. Full of energy in a nervy Woody Allenesque way,
his mop of curly red hair and casual dress make him look younger than his 54
years and surprisingly undaunting for a ruthless superlawyer said to be
capable of securing a suspended sentence for Jack the Ripper.
Though he describes himself as an agnostic, he is so proud of his Jewish
identity and Orthodox upbringing in Brooklyn that he wrote a best-selling
book about it called Chutzpah. In his house he has a framed piece of barbed
wire from Auschwitz as well as paintings from the Jewish ghetto, and he
checks on the ingredients before ordering vegetable soup followed by anchovy
tart with chicory and fennel salad.
'It's very difficult to get good kosher food around Harvard,' he complains.
'I got so fed up that I actually started my own deli. It was very popular
among students but we were losing Dollars 2 a sandwich so had to close
down.'
Fiendishly bright, it is surprising to learn that in his teenage years he
was regarded as a troublemaker and academic failure. Having just squeaked
into Brooklyn College, he discovered his true calling in law, going on to
Yale where he graduated first in his class. At 28 he was appointed tenured
professor at Harvard - the youngest in the Law School's history - and became
an appellate lawyer because he says, 'it fits in best with my teaching
schedule'.
His reputation as a lawyer of last resort began as defence for a series of
controversial characters from porn stars to Soviet dissidents. In 1982 he
hit the headlines after Claus von Bulow hired him to overturn a 30-year
sentence imposed for trying to murder his wife Sunny with insulin
injections. The call came on April Fools' Day and initially Dershowitz did
not believe it was really von Bulow. Warning him: 'I'm not a hired gun', he
put together a team of his best students and secured a reversal of the
conviction on a technicality. Reversal of Fortune, Dershowitz's book on the
case, became a successful film.
It was seeing the movie that made Lori Millken decide that he was just the
man to help her husband, former head of high yield securities for Drexel
Burnham Lambert, who had been sentenced to 10 years after pleading guilty to
violating federal security laws.
Dershowitz seems to relish being seen as the St Jude of legal lost causes:
'It's a great challenge to be the last stop before the gas chamber. The
justice system is only as good as it is toward the worst person.'
I ask if he deliberately chooses guilty clients. He replies: 'Every lawyer
prefers innocent clients but there are just not that many innocent guys
around.'
Does it makes any difference whether they are guilty as to your chances of
getting them off?
'It didn't use to. You could always get people off on a technicality or
constitutional hitch. Now it's not so easy.'
In one of his books he wrote about a recurring nightmare in which Josef
Mengele asked him to be his lawyer. I ask if he would feel bad about getting
a murderer let loose in society.
He smiles: 'Court cases are not so black and white as portrayed on TV or in
movies. In the Mike Tyson case the girl claims she got on top of him in
order to escape. But she didn't say that at the time.'
Surely, though, he must form an opinion about a client's innocence. 'Yes, I
do,' he says, intriguingly. 'Von Bulow I'm absolutely convinced is innocent.
But you never know. I remember when we got some forensic evidence in his
favour and I said to him 'Now I know you're innocent'. Claus smiled and said
'Alan, you don't know. Only two people in the world know that - me and
Sunny, and she's in a coma'.'
As Dershowitz makes no secret of his dislike of the Establishment, I wonder
if he likes the people he represents. 'Yes,' he replies 'I'm close friends
with von Bulow, Millken is really sweet.' He does not feel the same about
Leona Helmsley: 'She's bitchy, and I use the word advisedly. But that's why
I liked defending her. I felt she was being punished for how she is, like a
female Donald Trump, qualities that in a man may have been admired.'
Reward comes in the shape of fat fees - about Dollars 450 an hour - much of
which goes on his art collection. But Dershowitz claims his most gratifying
case was that of Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky, which he worked on
unpaid for nine years to free him from prison. Why? 'Our ancestors came from
the same part of what is now Ukraine.'
He gets hundreds of requests each week from potential clients. 'Every case
you see in the media comes across my desk,' he says, 'but I'm lucky because
I have a full-time career as professor so can pick and choose. I try to do
precedent-setting things which will be useful in class. I wanted Tyson
because date rape is a cutting-edge issue. Along with abuse it's one of the
least reported and most falsely reported crimes.'
Dershowitz has a new book about to be published - The Abuse Excuse - and he
is completing a novel, The Advocate's Devil, as well as a sequel to
Chutzpah. He says: 'There's nothing I like better than sitting in my study
writing and listening to opera, with Ella (his four-year-old daughter)
playing on the floor.'
He even has spare time, in which he is writing an opera. 'My secretary
calculates I write one million words a year - all in felt tip.' I ask if he
is a publicity junkie. 'I use it as a tool,' he replies. 'Usually, when I
come into a case my clients are getting a very bad press, so I try to get
them portrayed in a better light.'
Some would say you are the one getting all the publicity.
He laughs. 'The one person I cannot defend is myself.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Let there be light: The Nature of Things - A British
breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you make everyday materials give out light without heating them?
Scientists have recently produced two new solutions in the form of plastics
and silicon that glow when an electric voltage is applied.
Both have immense commercial potential. Light-emitting plastics could make
paper-thin screens for televisions and computers. These would be far tougher
and more adaptable than either the cathode ray tubes used for conventional
televisions or the new generation of liquid crystal displays.
Light emission from silicon, the main material of electronic chips and the
semiconductor industry, could lead the way to the super-fast optical
processors that have been a dream of the computer industry for a long time.
Such devices, running on photons (pulses of light), would be much more
efficient and compact than the present generation of computers which use
electrons (pulses of electricity) to process data.
UK researchers have played a leading part in both advances. Leigh Canham and
colleagues at the Defence Research Agency, Malvern, discovered how to make
silicon glow. Richard Friend, Andrew Holmes and other scientists at
Cambridge University have led the development of light-emitting plastics.
Both groups have taken out strong patent protection, and the Cambridge
scientists have set up a company, Cambridge Display Technology. If the
discoveries live up to expectation, they will bring in significant royalty
income; but there seems little chance that what remains of the UK
electronics industry will be able to make either plastic displays or optical
computers on a large scale for world markets.
The common factor behind the two developments is a new understanding of the
way electrons behave on what scientists call the nano-scale. (Its name comes
from the nanometre, a unit of length equal to a millionth of a millimetre.)
The trick is to construct special conditions under which electrons release
energy as light, rather than the usual heat.
Leigh Canham's process for making light-emitting silicon is deceptively
simple. He treats a conventional silicon wafer, used for making chips, with
highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid. This eats away more than 80 per cent of
the material.
The porous silicon sponge left behind is, in effect, a web of extremely fine
silicon wires, each 70,000 times thinner than a human hair. When electricity
passes through such thin wires, some of the electrons lose energy by
emitting visible light. The colour of the radiation varies with the
thickness of the silicon.
Canham explains: 'The conventional semiconductor industry uses lithographic
equipment costing millions of pounds. Our structures can be made in a
bucket. It is really cheap and fast to process silicon wafers in this way.'
Even so, there are several essential production tricks - for example, how to
prevent the silicon sponge collapsing as the acid dries - which would not be
obvious to an imitator with a bucket of hydrofluoric acid.
Until now, researchers have had to use more complex and expensive materials,
such as gallium arsenide, as light sources for experiments in optical
computing. If silicon itself can give off light reliably - and, despite the
progress so far, this has yet to be proved - then the outlook for
opto-electronics will be far brighter.
Although optical computers are, potentially, the most important application,
Canham says light-emitting silicon could also lead to a new display
technology, particularly for high-resolution screens connected directly to
silicon circuitry. It could then be competing with the new light-emitting
plastics.
These are a development from the electrically conducting plastics discovered
in the 1970s. When you apply a voltage to ordinary plastics, nothing
happens. But they can carry electricity like a metal if they have a special
molecular structure in which mobile electrons can run along the long polymer
chains.
The Cambridge group first achieved light emission in 1990 by sandwiching a
conducting plastic, PPV, between oppositely charged electrodes. The positive
terminal removes electrons - which is equivalent to pumping positively
charged 'holes' into the plastic. When electrons from the negative electrode
fall into these holes, they give off energy in the form of photons.
Over the past four years, the Cambridge scientists and their main
competitors at the University of California have manipulated the structure
of their light-emitting plastics to improve their efficiency - now at 4 per
cent, compared with 10 per cent for an ordinary light bulb - and tune their
wave-lengths to give a range of colours. The main problem still to overcome
is that PPV and its derivatives break down and stop glowing with long-term
use.
Although the scientists do not understand fully the reasons for this
instability, they are confident it can be overcome. And just as porous
silicon could encroach on the main potential market for plastics - displays
 -the converse is also possible. If the plastics can be made compatible with
integrated circuits, they will be potential light sources for optical
computers.
So, a photo-finish is likely early next century in the race between
light-emitting silicon and plastic to achieve large-scale commercial
production.

FT  16 JUL 94 / As They Say in Europe: Faking a grand occasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are many kinds of foreign correspondent. There are those who say, in
effect: 'Dreadful things go on here but I'm going to do my best to tell the
story straight.' Such people, those who divorce themselves from their own
prejudices, were found in Johannesburg yesterday and are in Beijing today.
Then, there are those who try to convince their readers that their patch is
not only important but also diverting, however harsh and unattractive it
might seem - Moscow or Tokyo for example.
Another group, which I call the 'Paris Club', attempts to combat long-held
prejudices back home. Its members recount, all too often, how well the
French do things ('The-metro-runs-on-time' is a favoured theme). In Bonn,
meanwhile, the foreign press corps does its best to make Germany exciting -
and usually fails.
Which brings us to the Frankfurter Allgemeine's man in Rome, Heinz-Joachim
Fischer. He has the most envied job among German foreign correspondents.
Italy provides the nearest thing to the German idea of paradise on earth.
Fischer, however, rarely succumbs to the country's charms and, in fact,
finds it rather objectionable. But he is always a good read, and a must for
anyone seeking to come to grips with the Italy of today.
Fischer's curtain-raiser before last week's summit in Naples reflected
perfectly his approach, an amalgam of erudition and contempt. He noted how
lucky it was that reports of parliamentary investigations did not get read.
For, if they were, the seven leaders might have thought twice about holding
a summit in Naples.
The report produced last December on the workings of the Neapolitan Camorra
made the Mafia seem like a Rotary Club. The Naples region produces twice the
national average of murders, more than twice the number of officials driven
from office as in Sicily, and an industrial structure based on fraud and
corruption.
Yet, Naples was dressed up for the summit. Had not the authorities done a
good job? Not according to Fischer. 'Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton,
like the Tsarina Catherine II on her Crimean trip with Count Potemkin in
1787, are expected to praise the order and prosperity of Naples, a city
where drivers prefer to print the image of a seat belt on their shirts
rather than actually use a real one.'
The idea of Naples as a Potemkin village, where everything is faked for the
grand occasion, provides an insight that adds to one's understanding of
summits. It also, unconsciously, came to dominate much of the comment on the
event itself. There was far less in it than met the eye.
Le Figaro's editor, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, pursued the theme with reference
to France which, he said, 'freely confuses the cosmos and the farmyard'.
There followed a quotation from Cocteau: 'What is France? I ask you. A cock
on a dungheap. Take away the dungheap, the cock dies.'
The summit had played a vital dungheap role, and sending troops to Rwanda
meant France could crow as the conscience of the world. 'France exists, the
G-7, sorry G-8 (Russia included), have recognised it. That is one of the
lessons of the summit . . .' Charging on through his thicket of metaphors,
Giesbert concluded that it was 'a summit of the seven dwarves. Without Snow
White'.
A different view was expressed in La Stampa, which headlined its comment:
'The chimera of a world government.' It argued that while the G-7 was the
pinnacle among international bodies designed to construct a better world, it
should, in fact, do nothing at all.
According to the newspaper, the very act of trying to govern the world was
doomed, for it made things worse. There was a 'big bang' in 1914 when old
empires started to explode into new states, and that had not settled down.
Neo-nationalists and neo-fundamentalists resented anything that smacked of
trying to impose any order, new or old, and G-7 political declarations were,
therefore, a waste of time.
I once knew a house in Devon where the hall was full of 18th century painted
figures cut from wood panels. The lone inhabitant found it comforting to
join these guests from another world. With modern technology, it should be
easy enough to construct a Potemkin summit which would be no less impressive
than those we enjoy today.
Next year's venue, a spot known as Halifax, Nova Scotia, would be an
excellent place to start.

FT  16 JUL 94 / The real reasons why science is under attack: In the Weekend
FT last month, Professor John Postgate posed the question: 'Religion: are we
better off without it?' Here Hugh Dickinson, the Dean of Salisbury, gives
his reply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The age-old dispute between science and religion has resurfaced. But
science has the moral high ground.'
 - Professor Postgate
The clarion call by Professor Postgate in defence of science sounds a bit
like a nervous Roman legate warning his troops of impending rebellion by
wild Germanic tribes across the Rhine. He pictures a rational scientific
elite having to defend itself against repeated onslaughts of religious
fanatics.
But is it really like that? This is not the first article in the FT by a
contemporary scientist expressing a sense that 'science' or scientists are
somehow beleaguered or under threat, and to attribute that threat to the
malign influence of 'religion', specifically Christianity and Islam.
Postgate devotes much space to the fruitless game of balancing the profit
and loss accounts of religion and science - a sort of tit-for-tat of 'you've
done nastier things than we have'. The enterprise is naive and pointless
unless he defines what he means by 'science' and 'religion'.
Both are complex, pluriform concepts, not single unitary entities. 'Science'
stretches all the way from the abstractions of theoretical physics through
the Cern cyclotron, via molecular biology, keyhole surgery, ceramic
saucepans, and on to the hill farmer using the latest herbicide sold to him
by the agri-chemical multi-nationals.
'Religion', likewise, stretches from human sacrifice in the Amazon basin
through the sack of Constantinople, the prophet Mohammed, Giotto, George
Herbert, Salisbury Cathedral, Francis of Assisi, Lord Shaftesbury and the
Sermon on the Mount.
Both religion and science (in that general sense) do have dark episodes and
great achievements; both have a history of terrible distortions. But unless
religion is fundamentalist and science positivist and systematically
reductionist, there is no necessary collision. It is cheap to accuse the
many first-class scientists who also have deep religious conviction of
keeping their minds in two water-tight compartments. The innuendo of
intellectual dishonesty is inescapable.
Science and religion occupy different realms of discourse, each with its
distinctive appropriate language. Religion is about meanings, purposes and
values; science about physical phenomena and their relationships. Religion
is about the quality of things, people and experiences; science is about
enumeration, measurement and quantity. The most profound human experiences
cannot be measured or enumerated, and the integrity required for honest
measurement is only one segment of a broad spectrum of moral imperatives
needed by human society. Alone, it offers no specially high ground.
But there are two issues raised by Postgate which are of real interest. Why
is there a widespread distrust of 'science'? And what kind of morality can
'science' offer humanity?
The distrust of science is not generated by religion - it is far too
widespread for fundamentalist hostility alone to account for it. Admittedly,
there are fundamentalist groups in all religions whose authoritarian hold
over their adherents is threatened by a modern understanding of the
universe. But the unease about 'science' is a deeply felt anxiety in secular
society at large.
It arises from the fact that applied science is not value neutral - it has
immense economic and political and environmental consequences. The public
knows that 'science' is an often ambivalent benefactor - like the Greeks
bringing gifts, its contribution to the welfare of society is not always
beneficial.
More sinister, who pays for science - who calls the tune? Scientists must be
paid by someone. And too many have manifestly sold their objective
independence to governments, multinational corporations or interest groups.
They are happy to be called as witness on opposite sides of public inquiries
 -who are we to believe?
Of course, pure scientists are not like that - they are as pure as the
driven snow. Except that, for the layman, it is hard to understand how one
generation's heresies become the orthodoxy of the next - plate tectonics,
for example.
The trouble is that the general public does not see the pure scientist at
work in his beautiful ivory laboratory of moral integrity - it sees the
results down the line: the experiments on embryos, the extravagantly
expensive high-tech surgery, the environmental consequences of Chernobyl,
the genetic engineering, the astonishing array of lethal substances designed
to kill or maim. It sees Hiroshima. And, quite simply, it is scared stiff
because it feels the whole huge techno-scientific machine is out of control,
and that the global environment is going to be damaged irreparably.
Of course, it is not fair. That is not what real science is about. I know
that. You know that. But if Postgate is really wanting to know why science
is under attack, it is more to do with the loss of butterflies from toxic
spray than from fanatical Christians rejecting a scientific world view. I
owe my life - twice - to modern medical science. No complaints there.
More intriguing, to my mind, is the issue of moral superiority. Let us turn
the question round. Can science offer humanity a moral code to live by? The
scientific method of meticulous observation and controlled experiment, from
which human factors are excluded as far as possible, does require qualities
of integrity and truthfulness of a high order.
But science can never tell us the value of anything. What is the moral
status of the human foetus? Is life sacred? Should we act with altruism? Why
is Rembrandt so important? What has King Lear to tell us about the human
condition? Why has Jesus of Nazareth won the hearts and lives of so many
people? Why is it important to care for grossly handicapped children? Is
eugenics as a political programme morally wrong?
All those questions, and many more like them, cannot be addressed by pure
science - nor are Fellows of the Royal Society better qualified to address
them than moral philosophers, historians or theologians. Yet, these are the
kind of religious questions which we have to address if we are to set out to
live the good life or create a humane society.
Science has often tried to dismiss these fundamental human issues by a
systematic reductionism with an arrogance which itself has, in the past,
been cause enough for an instinctive distrust in the non-scientific
community. But it seems to me that more and more scientists are now open to
a new awareness of the boundaries and limitations of their own discipline's
contribution to human wisdom. There is nothing like a bit of chaos to teach
us humility.
Science at its best is - or can be - the paragon of intellectual integrity
proclaimed by Postgate. But religion also has its better aspects. Should not
an objective scientist list and acknowledge them - and gladly? Is that not
part of his moral integrity?
Would the extraordinary shift of power from white to black majority in South
Africa have taken place with such astonishing speed and calm if the
Christian churches, and the values of reconciliation and multi-racial
community which they preached, had not been a constant and pervasive
influence in the leadership for 50 years? They, at least, would not have
been better off without that moderating moral influence.
The backlash against science - where it really exists - is a genuinely
worrying feature of a secular society increasingly prone to mystical
imaginings from a world of fantasy, science fiction and New Age gurus. But
it must be equally worrying to the thoughtful Christian, for whom the
rational pursuit of truth is just as important as it is for the FRS. And it
is worth noting that some Fellows are also thoughtful Christians.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Where have all the shops gone? - . . . gone to
flower shows every one. When will they ever learn?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year, I vow to go to look, not to shop, and I end up lop-sided with
bags of plants. Last weekend, the crowds poured into the Hampton Court
Flower Show; marvellous rubbish was changing hands in the craft village;
wooden trellis was being booked up by the 100 metres; after two hours, most
of us thought of joining the stand called Glazed Additions because it
matched the look on our faces.
Remember that the British like shopping somewhere other than the high
street. At horse shows, they want to buy suede and leather; at dog shows, I
have seen them buying carpet; at flower shows, they will buy anything in
frames or blue and white number-plates to give a French look to the front of
the house.
Hampton Court strives hard to show flowers under canvas and, this year, the
sweet peas, half-hardy perennials and the border plants from Bressingham
were up to Chelsea standards. But if anyone thinks that it is the new
Chelsea of the future, they are horticulturally impoverished.
There were some brave exceptions but the sponsored theme tent for
international gardens led to the inevitable attempt to do too much in a too
small, publicity-centred space: how could anyone believe that they were
being shown the essential art of Italy and its great former garden at La
Mortola in a confined space under canvas, even allowing for the awkward fact
that its Italian committee of university inheritors are widely agreed to
have ruined the style of La Mortola and its English origins anyway?
The Royal Horticultural Society has taken the Hampton show under its care
after previous confusions in the partnership with Network SouthEast. The
nursery exhibits seldom have the scale or combined impact of Chelsea's main
tent and the outdoor gardens are on the lower end of Chelsea's very low
scale.
The supreme distinction of Hampton Court is the scope for shopping. I fear
that it may dent Chelsea - but only because it occupies different ground.
Once you allow the public to shop on it, they will career downmarket like
Gadarene swine. As Gadarene as the best of them, I think I have avoided pigs
in a poke.
The fact is that after five years of bagging and buying at Hampton Court, my
garden wears a new look. It is at this show that I really appreciate the
strength of the new Alstro-emerias, which have been steadily produced by
Peter Smith, of Chanctonbury Nurseries, Ashington, West Sussex.
This weekend sees their lesser relations, the old Peruvian lilies and Ligtu
forms, just ending their handsome season of flower. Peter Smith's new
varieties will continue for months and some of the best are unarguably
hardy. There is no disputing the strength and hardiness of its Little
Princess forms, which flower at a height of about a foot, last for weeks and
have the exquisite markings which you find on their cousins in florists'
shops.
Many gardeners rightly hate novelties and mini-plants but I do urge you to
try these splendid innovations where you have a sunny bed and a light, open
soil. They are extremely easy, although they disappear below ground in late
autumn: I doubt if half-hearted gardeners could kill them.
Dodging the conservatories and wrought iron, I always head for the
conservation tent, where the plants are more unusual and the crowds are less
frantic. Here, too, I have struck gold.
The best exhibits are backed by the National Conservation of Plants and
Gardens Collections, which aims to conserve a wide range of varieties in
major families of use to the gardener. This year's exhibit of the new Day
Lilies made me wonder whether anyone will conserve most of them in 50 years.
Much of the breeding seems to be stuck with the search for ever-hotter
colours and smaller stems: the orange-yellow Stella D'Oro has turned out to
be a shocker, as many of us verified when walking past the rather dreary
plantings in the gardens of Hampton Court Palace itself.
However, the pale yellow Giant Moon has real class and I am glad of its cool
colour and vigour in the front to middle row of a border. I made positive
notes on Michelle Coe, a tall, pale peach, and Chicago Picottee Pride, both
of which are in softer colours than many of the newest breaks.
The moral of all this study is that we should never risk buying a new Day
Lily blind: the strength of colouring can be most misleading. The effort to
find the best is worthwhile because these plants really do block out weeds
and last for years without attention.
I rank them second only to my essential answer to gardening without effort
in shade or any difficult soil: the matchless Geranium endressii.
Hampton Court has also alerted me to a new trick: the special merit of the
new Wageningen variety, the flowers of which are a particularly clear and
strong pink. If you have a choice, opt for it first.
At Hampton, I feel more in the mood for Ceanothus than at Chelsea, when
their season is not far advanced. Specialists allow us to compare a wide
range, some of them new from west America or the Antipodes. They are also
prepared to discuss the difficult question of hardiness, the fact which
rules out most of the best.
I return to the strong blue of Concha and also Edinburgh, neither of which
is entirely trustworthy in a serious winter. They grow so fast that they are
worth a gamble anywhere but I continue to be most thankful for one of the
commonest forms.
The sky-blue Gloire de Versailles will grow anywhere on well-drained soil.
It is at its absolute best in big Hampshire gardens from this weekend
onwards, where it stands among old roses as a free shrub in its own right.
It picks up the show this weekend when the roses are fading and, after four
winters with me, it has shown no serious loss. Each spring, pruning should
be light. Impatient gardeners would love it as a filling between slower
plants in a new garden wherever there is warmth and shelter.
Lastly, the return of an old favourite. Our grandfathers grew lots of the
tall, lemon-yellow daisies of Anthemis Wargrave throughout their herbaceous
borders, but the mad keen gardeners of the 1970s managed to lose most of the
stock. Three years ago, I thought I had found it but it turned out to be the
shorter, and more vivid, Anthemis EC Buxton, which has supplanted it in
common nurseries. Did no one remember the height and paleness of the true
daisies which were upheld in iron plant-hoops in my early years?
At Hampton Court, the real Wargrave surfaced - alive and well at Pounds 3 a
plant from Rushfields, of Ross Road, Ledbury, Herefordshire. Rushfields is
expert at staging displays of the softer colours among border plants and
last week it confirmed that Wargrave was still in good supply. I left
Hampton Court reunited with this long-lost friend.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Fagin and his raiders - Beekeeping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERRY NORTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the time of year when I start to feel like Fagin, sending my young
apprentices on raids all over town, and rubbing my hands as they return to
the den with their spoils.
The hives are filling up with honey as my thousands upon thousands of little
Artful Dodgers and Olivia Twists fly back and forth across a three-mile
radius sucking nectar from flowers and race back to share it (if
unwittingly) with me.
The speed with which they work is breathtaking. Three weeks ago, before the
main nectar flow, I added a lightweight cedar box to the top storey of each
hive, filled with empty frames to hold the honeycomb.
Today, I find it a struggle to lift, weighed down as it is with the dense
pale honies from various flowers which have been crammed into it.
They are fairly well mixed, but you can find pockets of particular flavours,
the best of them, to my taste, being the delicate nutty sweetness of the
hawthorn.
The making of honeycomb is as fascinating as the filling of it and is
proving particularly poignant to watch this year against the backdrop of a
nine-acre building site which we now overlook from our garden.
Huge stores of stone, wood and tile have been trucked on to the former
school grounds, while inside the hives, with no fuss, no materials and no
machinery, the bees are building too.
Beginning with the empty wooden frames, the apian workers first find a true
vertical by making a plumb-line of their own bodies.
They have had an instinct for doing this in holes and hollow trees for
millions of years.
Twenty or so of them hang in a chain holding leg to leg while the wax-makers
and labourers move in to begin construction.
Cell by cell the hexagonal structure is created in symmetry, on either side
like a mirror-image until it perfectly fills the frame, each cell smoothed
and polished just a fraction longer than a worker bee and built sloping
upwards at a few degrees to the horizontal to keep the honey from dripping
out.
For added strength, the pattern of cells is offset so that the centres of
the hexagons on one side key the corners on the other.
Using nothing but their own secretions, the workers build enough comb in a
week to hold 35lbs of honey - many times their total body weight.
As a collective display of skill, it must rival building Manhattan out of
your own eyelashes. The bees approach this project with such dedication that
it is usually safe to lift the roof to watch them at work and wonder how
each tiny brain can possibly hold so much instinct.
They do not disturb easily, since time is short in the weeks of the
honey-flow and the colony's survival in the coming year will depend on
building sufficient stores. The mood of their energetic buzzing is now
diligent rather than aggressive.
If they do seem tetchy on first opening the hive, it may mean that they are
agitated about running short of space to build yet more honeycomb, which
they recognise as a dangerous condition. The wise apiarist will take care to
recognise this too, before rioting breaks out.
Once filled, each hexagonal cell is capped with a thin air-tight lid of wax
to preserve the honey for the winter.
But it is at this moment that Fagin robs his own apprentices of their
bounty.
There are reports of sealed honey lasting for years - even centuries - in
perfect condition.
I rely on printed wisdom for that, since in our house we are lucky if a
piece of honeycomb lasts a week before it is perfectly gone.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Broken finger, broken vehicle - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are now near the Chile-Argentina border.
As we swooped low over the smouldering furnace in the crater of the
Villarrica volcano, a huge swirling cloud of sulphurous smoke billowed
towards us: our Cessna felt as vulnerable as a model aircraft made of balsa
wood and glue.
We circled the crater four or five times until, in a near trance-like state
we seemed to be on the verge of being sucked into it. But Robert Stanton,
our pilot, had flown over this volcano many times and was as cool as
Biggles.
Stanton had flown south to meet us to deliver essential documents to enable
us to cross the border from Chile into Argentina in the four-wheel-drive
Lada vehicle we had borrowed from him. Before flying home, he offered to
take us for a buzz over Villarrica.
This was infinitely more exciting than experiencing the volcano on skis:
like so many Chilean ski areas, Villarrica's skiing was severely restricted
by lack of snow.
Ski resorts in the Chilean Lake District receive considerable moisture in
their snow from winds blowing across the lakes. Lift towers can become so
encrusted with ice from freezing rain blowing in from Lake Villarrica that
the weight can bring them down.
The wind was especially violent during our last morning there: the door of
the Lada hit my hand with such force that my middle finger is now in a
splint, feared broken.
Ronald Turner, the general manager at the Club Esqui Andino in Antillanca,
surveyed his resort and said: 'These winds make it impossible to operate the
lifts. This is rather a disastrous start to the season which is short enough
at the best of times.'
When at last the winds dropped we were able to ski Antillanca at will,
floating, cruising and drifting down rippling gullies and around huge
craters, marvelling at the most spectacular scenery we have seen in Chile so
far: the bizarrely beautiful Puntiagudo almost shoulder to shoulder with the
Fuji-like Osorno volcano; and the triple-peaked Mount Tronador.
But our elation evaporated as our adopted vehicle broke down in the middle
of the night in the wilderness. Fortunately, although we were miles from a
village, we were close to a Chilean border post.
The border post is kept at the ready in case of tensions with Argentina, and
horses are best suited to this mountain terrain. We had been rescued by the
Chilean cavalry.
Being rescued on horseback would have been more dramatic, but the cavalry
had transport to get the Financial Times expedition to safe quarters, to
ponder how we were to cross into Argentina with a stricken Russian vehicle.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Property: When home is just a short iron away - So golf is
your religion and heaven is living near your local course? Gerald Cadogan
examines the possibilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keen golfers moving house always want to know about the nearest course and
how good it is. It follows that the best way to find out is for them to take
their clubs and play 18 holes - as an essential part of househunting.
As they watch the 123rd Open championship at Turnberry in south-west
Scotland this weekend, they can dream of owning a house within a chipping
wedge of any of the venues where the Open is played. Or any course, for that
matter.
A more costly option is actually to buy a working course, or acquire a
greenfield site with planning permission for a course and develop it. Those
with real money might even like to buy a house with its own private course.
Agent Roger Pryor, of Strutt &amp; Parker, says the market for working courses
has stabilised following the property boom of 1988-89 and the subsequent
fall.
As for new courses, planning applications in the south-east were, by 1993,
more than 60 per cent down from their peak in 1990-91 - but 46 per cent of
these were granted, compared with 25 per cent in 1991.
The change has come about because land-owners, developers and local planners
have become stricter in assessing the earnings potential of a course and its
impact on the community and environment. The banks, which lost large amounts
in funding grandiose schemes, are more circumspect too.
Today, planning permission for a golf course does not provide an automatic
premium over agricultural value, says Jim Bryant, of Bidwells' leisure team.
Gone are the 1988-89 days of Pounds 15,000 an acre. Pryor agrees. Only prime
sites are likely to achieve a top premium of Pounds 1,000 an acre - which
equates to a total price per acre of about Pounds 3,000.
That sort of figure is reflected in the Pounds 350,000 being asked by
Savills of Banbury for a 121-acre site with permission for an 18-hole
pay-and-play course at Cadmore End, near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. It
is close to the M40, and 630,000 people live within 30 minutes' drive. A
pay-and-play alternative nearby has a long waiting list, and Wycombe
district council accepts there is continuing demand.
Strutt &amp; Parker estimates that, at the end of 1993, there was an 18-hole
course for every 15,332 people in south-east England (if those with planning
consent are included). This is half the pre-1989 ratio of one existing
course for every 31,555 people but, says the agent, not all the consents
will be taken up.
County ratios vary widely. Oxfordshire offers one course for every 21,267
people, Buckinghamshire 1:10,230 and Surrey 1:9,550 (using the total of
existing and agreed courses).
Developing a greenfield site can cost up to Pounds 1m, depending on the
design and terrain. But it could be two years before members join and the
cash starts to come in.
At Cadmore End, the estimate for development costs is between Pounds 600,000
and Pounds 750,000 (to include a 4,000 sq ft clubhouse). In the first full
year, the agent expects 35,000 rounds at, say, Pounds 10 apiece on weekdays
and Pounds 15 at the weekend, plus club fees for 850 members. (At many
courses, non-members can pay well over Pounds 20 a round.)
For two similar sites - beside the A27 at Lancing in West Sussex, and at
Welton near Lincoln - Clegg Kennedy Drew is waiting for buyers to suggest a
price. In Devon, though, a site on the Kingsbridge estuary - now a farm with
a five-bedroom house - is on offer through Stags at Pounds 395,000.
According to Tom Marriott, of Humberts Leisure, pay-and-play courses and
commercial clubs are taking over from the traditional private member clubs.
Ten years ago, they made up only 10-20 per cent of all courses; now,
Marriott estimates, they total 30-40 per cent. He says most courses appear
to be trading reasonably; only a few are put on the market by receivers.
If the course operates on a leasehold - as many do - the ground rent and its
review date are important factors for potential buyers (Pounds 300-Pounds
400 an acre is the figure now, says Bryant). One working leasehold course,
on offer from Humberts or the Glasgow agent Ryden, is Brunston Castle near
Turnberry. It was designed by Donald Steel around the Water of Girvan that
flows through the middle, with space for houses, chalets and a hotel. Offers
of more than Pounds 1m are invited.
For Pounds 900,000, Humberts is also selling the Mid-Dorset club in lovely
downlands at Blandford Forum (its thatched farmhouse is extra) and (with
Strutt &amp; Parker) is asking Pounds 1.75m for Woodbury Park near Exeter, with
27 holes. Designed by Hamilton Stutt, of Turnberry fame, it has been working
on a pay-and-play basis and still awaits a proper clubhouse - perhaps even a
hotel.
So you would like a house adjoining a fairway? One such is Little Mingary,
by the 15th at Worplesdon in Surrey (Browns, Pounds 400,000). Then there is
Gullane (from Rettie, offers over Pounds 265,000) by the 1st at the famous
Muirfield course outside Edinburgh which celebrated its 250th anniversary
last weekend.
A little further north are an apartment at Gleneagles, site of the recent
Scottish Open (Bidwells, Pounds 180,000), and Broomfield, a substantial
Edwardian house on Golf Course Road leading to the Rosemount course in
Perthshire (Savills in Brechin, offers over Pounds 390,000).
Cluttons in Ayr has a few houses well placed for the Turnberry, West
Kilbride and Royal Troon courses at prices from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds
250,000 - quite cheap by southern standards.
In Surrey, apartments for sale between Pounds 190,000 and Pounds 250,000 on
the Pyrford course include lifetime membership of the club; Curchods is the
agent. John D. Wood offers two houses in Coombe Park, Kingston upon Thames,
beside the Coombe Hill course, for Pounds 535,000 or Pounds 850,000.
The ultimate must be a course of your own, as at Sundial House near Farnham,
Surrey. Apart from its nine holes, the owners have built a go-kart track in
13.5 acres. Offers over Pounds 800,000 are sought (down from over Pounds
900,000) through Hamptons or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Another with its own
course is Great Swifts at Cranbrook, Kent, a 1930s' Georgian-style mansion
for which Lane Fox set a guide price of Pounds 950,000. Offers came in at
more than Pounds 1m.
Finally, an agent near Turnberry said this week: 'The whole of south
Ayrshire is off on holiday.' That is because householders who are prepared
to surrender their four-bedroom homes to Open competitors or fans can demand
Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,000 for a nine-day let. And if the house is really
big, they can charge well over Pounds 1,000 a day.
Bidwells, Perth (0738-630 666); Browns, Guildford (0483-311 66); Clegg
Kennedy Drew, London (071-409 1944) and Stamford (0780-527 88); Cluttons,

FT  16 JUL 94 / Motoring: Topless in country lanes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past few summery weeks in south-east England, there have only been
two kinds of car: those with air-conditioning or the others in which you
feel sticky and uncomfortable, especially in motorway jams.
But what about convertibles, you ask. Certainly, they are an alternative,
although I am not sure sitting in the sun for several hours at a time is a
good idea. The rush of wind masks the heat and makes you forget the risks of
over-exposure. For these reasons, convertibles are none too popular in
really hot countries.
Still, I have to admit that driving topless through English lanes on a
moderately hot day can be very pleasant. You savour the smells of the
countryside (well, some of them; others are best avoided) and feel more in
touch with your surroundings. Just remember to cover your head and use sun
block on bare arms.
Not for years has there been such a wide choice of convertibles at prices
ranging from modest to mind-blowing. It depends if your fancy is the Fiat
Punto 90 ELX Cabrio, just arrived in British showrooms at Pounds 12,995, or
a Pounds 166,681 Rolls-Royce Corniche IV.
Like the Punto 55 hatchback (this column, July 4), the Cabrio scored a hit
with me. For a car that opens, the body feels reassuringly stiff on
less-than-perfect roads. Dropping one wheel into a pot-hole makes the fascia
creak momentarily and the side windows tremble, but no more than it would in
any other car lacking a steel roof. At all other times, it is agreeably
taut.
Windscreen pillars with strong reinforcing enable the Cabrio to pass the US
test which assesses the ability of cars to protect their occupants should
they roll over - even though the test is not yet compulsory for soft-tops in
that country.
Remarkably, for such an affordable car, the Cabrio has a power-operated
hood. Undo two clips at the top of the windscreen, make sure the handbrake
is on, press a button and the hood folds into the rear deck.
It does not lie quite flat - as it does in the delicious but far costlier
(Pounds 17,700) Peugeot 306 convertible - but an easily-attached loose
cover, which lives in the rather pokey little boot, makes an open Cabrio
look neat. The rear seats are habitable by two average adults.
The Cabrio is not just a fair-weather car, either: the three-layer hood fits
snugly when up, although the flexible rear window has no demister. But it is
not quite as light inside as a larger-windowed three-door Punto hatchback.
Power steering, engine immobiliser, fuel-flow stop valve and electric front
windows are standard. Radio controls are built into the steering wheel,
unless you decide to have a driver's-side airbag as an optional extra.
The 1.6-litre, 88-horsepower engine is new and will be appearing in other
Fiats in due course. Already, it meets European Union emission requirements
that will not come into force for several years. It pulls hard at low
revolutions or spins freely up to a boy racer's red-lined 6,500rpm.
The five-speed gearbox shifts easily and the Cabrio feels quite lively. Fiat
claims a top speed of 105mph (170kph) and says a kilometre is covered in 34
seconds from a standing start. Fuel consumption should be 33mpg (8.56
l/100km).
Two other versions of the Punto that also are new to Britain are the 55 EL
six-speed and the 60 SX Selecta. The Selecta has a continuously variable
transmission which provides the easy driving benefits of a conventional
automatic without its cost and complication. Price: Pounds 8,449.
As for the six-speed 55, it is really an Italian market special. There,
newly-qualified drivers are, very sensibly, restricted to cars with a low
power-to-weight ratio. The idea of the 55 EL six-speed is that it allows
them to stir the gear lever and indulge their fantasies without breaking
laws or going too quickly.
There is no such law in Britain, although the insurance industry exerts a
moderating influence. But I did not much like the 55 EL, not least because
it is geared lower in sixth than the normal 55 in fifth. Unless you have a
fixation about gear levers, my advice would be to go for a standard 55 S at
Pounds 6,760. That would save you Pounds 539 - and a lot of unnecessary gear
shifting.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Sport: Faldo struggles to assert his rights - Golf / Can the
old guard be seen handing over to the new at the Open championship at
Turnberry?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was all so simple a few years ago. If the Open was held in Scotland then
the winner would be Nick Faldo. It happened in 1987 at Muirfield, at St
Andrews in 1990, and again at Muirfield two years ago.
Faldo's right to be considered the dominant player of the age was made in
Scotland. It was to Scotland he came last week to assert that right once
more.
He faced the most onerous task. The imperious aura with which he surrounded
himself at the start of the decade has evaporated and the lesson of the past
is that once gone, it rarely returns.
Think of Tom Watson, winner of five Opens between 1977 and 1984, but none
since. Think of Arnold Palmer, who won all his eight major championships in
a similarly bountiful six-year period.
Faldo also won two Masters in his five-year span of mastery that began in
1987 but what was also significant was the number of other opportunities
that he gave himself to win.
From 1989 to 1992, Faldo never finished outside the top 20 in any major
championship. Last year, he challenged Greg Norman every step of the way at
Sandwich, before eventually settling for runner's up spot, and again at the
USPGA championship, where he finished third.
But the old consistency was missing for the first time, with poor
performances at the Masters where he finished 39th, and the US Open, where
he tied for 72nd place. This year, it is that trend that has continued.
Last month, Faldo missed the cut in the US Open, the first time he had
suffered such ignominy in 28 major championships. He had gone to the event a
week before it had been due to start - for this is the event, above all
others, that he would most like to win.
That rude awakening, though, was as nothing to what happened to Faldo on the
first day here at Turnberry.
We all know Faldo's characteristics: examine every detail; leave nothing to
chance. Faldo's first task for his caddie, Fanny Sunesson, after appointing
her, was to send her to Florida for a fortnight to learn about his swing
from his coach, David Leadbetter.
Faldo would be the last player, then, who you would expect to play a wrong
ball, yet that is what he did on the 17th hole in the first round.
After hitting his drive into the rough, he did not even check the ball's
markings; he just went up to it, and hit it. It was the sort of error that
would make a beginner blush, let alone the man whose philosophy towards the
game is dictated by its meticulousness.
His 75 was the worst he has scored in an Open in relation to par since the
last time the championship was played here in 1986.
Faldo's playing partner in the first two rounds was Ernie Els, and it was
hard not to think of this as a meeting between the old guard and the new.
It was the first time they had played together since the young South
African's win in the US Open.
Els is just 24; Faldo will be 37 on Monday. Faldo is strong but Els
stronger. At times at Turnberry on Thursday the latter was out-driving the
former by 40 yards. While Faldo went through all his fidgety routines, Els
just stood up to the ball and hit it. Where Faldo was plagued by hesitancy
and self-doubt on the greens, Els suffered no such problems.
Faldo believes his swing is better now than when he was lapping the field,
but the results sheet betrays his remarks. At least it did until yesterday,
when a second-round 66 deflected some of the anguish and was three shots
better than his partner Els could manage.
For such a proud, intense man, the frustration of such inconsistency must be
horrific and fully explains why he looks so miserable these days. His
expression hardly changed at Turnberry - just this side of manic depression.
It was hard not to come to the conclusion that the only thing Faldo has left
on Els is experience and increasingly that it would prove no protection at
all.
The mechanical nature of Faldo's swing contrasted sharply with Els's natural
rhythm. Many believe that Faldo would be better off if he had six months
away from the man he calls 'Lead', his coach Leadbetter, whom he seems to
consult about everything. A time to be Lead-free perhaps?
Faldo was left to battle against missing the cut for the first time in an
Open, which was hardly the contest he had in mind at the start of the event.
With yesterday's 66, Faldo at least has a platform. But what a critical
weekend this is for him, and the odds are against the restoration of his
pre-eminence. Indeed, as he and Els shook hands on the 18th yesterday it was
hard not to see the symbolism in this gesture.
A handshake to signal the exchange of power?

FT  16 JUL 94 / Sport: C stands for seaworthy - Sailing / Keith Wheatley
draws up his own guide to top sailing events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something about the letter C appears to have seized hold of the sailing
world - Cork Week, Commodore's Cup, Cowes Week - they all take place this
month.
The letter C is about all these events have in common, however, marvellous
though each of them is.
CORK WEEK
Cork Week has been described as 'a party with yachts'. The organisers
promise in the Notice of Race that no competition afloat should take more
than about three hours, thus leaving ample time for the festivities to
re-convene in the marquees ashore.
In spite of its grand and authentic claim to be the world's oldest yacht
club, the Royal Cork promotes Cork Week with almost teenage zest. The
grounds of the RCYC, above the harbour at Cross-haven, are turned into a
tented village with bars, shops and restaurants.
Nearly 400 boats turned up to race this week in 10 classes, making the Irish
regatta one of Europe's largest, second only to Cowes in the number of
entries.
The heatwave and light airs were a marked contrast to 1992 (the event is
bi-annual) when rain and gales lashed down, requiring even more inner
fortification.
Such conditions can be disastrous for the big racing machines that even
their opponents want to see at full blast. Yachts such as Richard Mathews'
ex-America's Cup 12-metre Crusader, the Swan yachts Highland Fling VII
(Irving Laidlaw) and Desperado (Richard Loftus) had to wriggle through big
packs of smaller boats. Only the latter found enough of a lead to save its
handicap.
Laidlaw has been a keen and successful competitor at the regular Swan
regattas around Europe and has persuaded the Finnish yard to build him the
first fractionally-rigged Swan in Highland Fling VII.
Success on the water - two wins in the first three days - indicates that
other racing owners may soon be calling on Swan to vary the previously
obligatory masthead rig.
Laidlaw's new boat made Desperado, 10ft longer and theoretically faster on
handicap, look pedestrian.
THE COMMODORE'S CUP
The Royal Ocean Racing Club created the inaugural Rolex Commodore's Cup two
years ago. Its function was to let owners of non-Grand Prix production
yachts compete for their country in an international competition. There was
a widespread feeling that the Admiral's Cup had become an entirely
professional event, with oblivion and penury likely for amateur competitors.
However, rivalry for places in the Commodore's Cup national teams has been
so intense that one skipper suggested United Nations intervention.
Of the nine nations competing, the US and Germany are bringing two
three-boat teams. And the American crew whose Mumm 36 Pigs in Space was held
to ransom in a Merseyside wharf dispute can confirm that dock strikes are
not a slice of history.
Officially, England has but one team when racing begins on Wednesday.
However, the Jersey team consists largely of top British big-boat sailors
anxious to avoid the knife-fight of the selection process.
Graham Walker's crack Indulgence heads the Channel Islands' effort, with the
interesting Tram in support. In her initial guise of an IOR one-tonner, Tram
was better known as the King of Norway's yacht Fram XI, sunk so
spectacularly last year by Harold Cudmore during the Admiral's Cup.
Also competing is a Welsh team. A trio of yachts, Eagle, Integrity and
Shogun, that just missed the England call-up tried to register as England-B.
RORC polled the field but only England-A objected. So the owners scoured
Welsh sailing clubs to make up a requisite 30 per cent crew on each boat of
the appropriate nationality.
Sheep carried as ballast were ruled not to count.
COWES WEEK
As usual with Cowes Week, beginning on July 30, the sailing will be
excellent while the onshore muddle continues. Unfortunately, good
on-the-water organisation is expensive. Without sponsorship, entry fees for
an average 32ft yacht might rise from around Pounds 250 to Pounds 750.
This year's fairy godmother seemed to have arrived in the form of the
Japanese-owned Aquascutum clothing company.
But then at Easter, when the Pounds 100,000 sponsorship deal was close to
completion, Aquascutum's advisers discovered that Cowes Combined Clubs had
sold the Japanese rights in the name Cowes Week a decade ago. Exit
Aquascutum.
Lawyers began combing Greater Tokyo for the Mr Yamaguchi who owns the
trademark purchased in perpetuity, it seems, for the princely sum of Pounds
1,000.
However, in the nick of time the taxpayer rode to the rescue. Medina borough
council came up with a Pounds 100,000 financial package to support Cowes
Week. MBC said in its announcement that the regatta brought in Pounds 6m to
the island during the eight-day event, in a struggling local economy where
25 per cent of jobs depended on tourism.
Residents steeped in local government cynicism observed that since the
council was shortly to disappear in a reorganisation that will bring a
unitary authority to the Isle of Wight, the grant to the yachties might be
seen as a last carefree fling with the chequebook by councillors who will
not have to go back and face the electorate.

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Rio waits for Romario to bring home 'his' Cup
 -The unpredictable brilliance of one of the world's great strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Normally Brazil play the best football in the World Cup and get knocked out
early.
This year has been different for two reasons: their defenders can defend and
they have a striker who can score. Romario (da Souza Faria) has five goals
in six World Cup games so far - about the average rate for his career. This
league season, he scored 30 for Barcelona.
Carlos Alberto Parreira, the Brazilian coach, may never invite Romario to
his birthday party, but he has decided to forget the great man's personality
flaws at least until tomorrow night.
Now that Maradona has retired yet again, Romario is probably the best player
in the world, but in the last World Cup his irksome char-acter kept him from
playing more than part of one match.
This is a man who says his hobby is sleeping (14 hours a day); who informed
the Dutch press that his PSV Eindhoven team-mates could not play soccer; who
flies home to Rio when he feels like it, league fixtures or not; who likes
nightlife so much that he is 'going to keep going out until I am 90 years
old'; and who called Pele 'mentally retarded.'
Romario lacks Maradona's self-destructive streak (when he goes out he
neither drinks nor smokes, not even cigarettes), but he is also a good deal
less sociable than the Argentine. He thought it most unreasonable that he
had to sit next to his striking partner Bebeto on the plane to the US.
Carlos Alberto Parreira, a European type of coach, only recently came round
to the idea of letting this man into his team.
If you are Romario you don't have to be nice to people. Bobby Robson managed
him at PSV and was frequently tempted to fire him, but then the striker
would appear suddenly on an overnight flight from Brazil and score a
hat-trick against Ajax.
The problem at PSV was that Romario disliked Holland. He failed to
understand the weather, or the Dutch habit of turning up for appointments,
or the way they treat soccer stars as normal people, and he failed to charm
the natives by saying things like: 'In Holland I work; I live in Rio.'
He was never at home in sleepy Eindhoven. Born in a Rio slum, he moved with
his parents to a slightly nicer slum before becoming a star.
He does not dare visit the neighbourhoods where he grew up, but he loves
driving around Rio like a madman, and when, during a recent game of beach
volley-ball, he noticed a new building going up, he bought 10 apartments on
the spot.
Rio came through for him again after his father was kidnapped in May. Within
days, the police had found the old man.
It seems that the tip-off came from a gangster who feared that Romario's
form might suffer if his father were killed. 'The only way I can repay the
Brazilian people,' Romario said, 'is by scoring goals and helping to win the
World Cup.' This, he declared, was going to be 'Romario's Cup.'
During it, he has been the closest we have to a Maradona Mark II. About the
same height as the Argentine, with the same enormous chest and thighs and
skinny calves, he has Maradona's sense of balance and can similarly beat
multiple defenders within a few feet in the penalty area.
Romario, too, has taken to running with the ball from mid-field. He is
always surprising. 'If it had been a European player, he would have put it
in the far corner,' observed Russian 'keeper Dmitri Kharin after Romario
scored against him. 'But Romario is a Brazilian and he put it in the near
corner.'
Romario's goal against Holland (he considered shaving his head before the
game) was even more special.
A cross landed far too far in front of him, so he flicked himself three
yards through the air and, while he was still dropping, virtually on top of
the ball, hit a half-volley with the outside of his right boot into the
inside side-netting of the Dutch goal.
The Italian defence will probably not permit much of a goalfest tomorrow,
and Romario was part of the Barcelona team that lost 4-0 to AC Milan in
May's European Cup final.
But when Romario says that this is Romario's Cup, and that he is the real
thing, why should we argue?

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Losing wagers litter path to final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting-wise, the World Cup has not proved my finest hour, writes Michael
Thompson-Noel. No bookmakers have topped themselves as a result of my bets,
which is always the bonus I savour most.
I got over-heated to start with; then slowed to a crawl; and was finally
flattened by queasiness at the sight of Brazil's shrinking odds. In short:
bad strategy, poor money management, and loss of nerve.
I started too excitedly, backing Colombia and Argentina, then Romania,
Nigeria and Germany, and eventually Bulgaria - six squads of shirt-lifters.
Between them, these australopithecines cost me Pounds 308 (including tax).
The only sensible bet I made all month was Pounds 60 Brazil to win the World
Cup at 3-1, which was the best price you could find in London on June 17.
Italy were 6-1 that day, but I have never backed Italy in my life. On the
other hand, the bookies were offering half-odds if teams reached the final,
so there must be thousands of Italians already showing a huge collective
profit.
This is what attracted me to Romania at 33-1 after they trounced Colombia.
Romania - I divined - were a team from the 21st century; pity about their
penalty-taking.
As the tournament progressed and Brazil looked far from convincing, I stared
in horror at their rapidly-shrinking price. This was my big mistake.
There is a streak of showiness in my character which at times mutates into a
bulging vein of vulgarity. Among other things, this makes me a
contra-bettor. I disdain sensibly-priced favourites such as Brazil and
instead bet on flashy outsiders such as Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria.
As things stand, I will lose Pounds 134 even if Brazil win tomorrow. So
yesterday I rang the wretched bookies, looking for an escape.
I started with the rascals at Ladbroke, which calls itself, smugly, the
biggest bookmaker in the solar system. Brazil, said Ladbroke, are now 8-15
to win the cup, and Italy 11-8. This is no help to me. I never bet odds-on.
So I questioned the rascals severely. I asked them what the odds were
against Brazil beating Italy 4-1, as they did in the World Cup final in
1970. Answer: 40-1. Brazil to win by 10 goals to nil? Answer: 100-1.
These odds are inhumanly cramped. I would rather buy blood from a vampire.
But I believe I have no choice. With a mighty smirk and swagger, I will
today bet Pounds 20 on a 4-1 Brazilian win and Pounds 20 on a 10-0 pasting.
I mean, Italy?

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Coaches ponder their final teams - The jobs
of Carlos Alberto Parreira and Arrigo Sacchi are on the line tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When their team was announced before the semi-final against Sweden,
Brazilian fans in the stadium greeted every name with a roar - all names but
the last one. They gave coach Carlos Alberto Parreira the bird.
One of the oddities of this World Cup is that the coaches of both finalists
could be fired. In part this reflects the whole tournament: lots of great
games, no great teams.
Brazil's fans yearn for more fantasia than Parreira has been able to
provide. He did not invent the five-man back line that Brazil have used, but
in this World Cup the formation has suddenly looked terribly defensive.
Part of the blame lies with the players Parreira has. The three central
defenders are all good, old-fashioned centre-halves: quick, strong and
athletic and, as with all Brazilians, comfortable on the ball. But they are
unwilling to burst forward.
On the rare occasions that Mauro Silva has joined the attack he has not made
a telling contribution. In front of the centre-backs sits Dunga, the best
defensive mid-field player in the competition.
He, too, is slow to commit himself to attack.
Often when Brazil are attacking, four or five of their players loiter at the
half-way line marking one opposing striker. Memories of last summer's
defensive collapse against Germany in a friendly in Washington DC still
linger.
The Brazilian approach depends on the attacking abilities of the wing-backs
and mid-field players. The suspension of Leonardo has been a severe blow.
His replacement, Branco, is a menace at free kicks but lacks the pace and
stamina to pose a consistent threat to the opposing full-back.
The attacking mid-field men have disappointed. Mazinho and Zinho have been
patchy, Ra pedestrian. Perhaps the coach will give in to the Brazilian
president, fans (and to memories of Pele) and pick the 17-year-old
wonder-child Ronaldo.
Brazil have had difficulty breaking down defences. Their passing and
movement off the ball remain pleasing to watch, but often lack thrust.
They have been most dangerous on the rapid counter, when a long ball from
defence finds Bebeto and Romario facing just two or three defenders, with
the whole opposing half to move in. These two have demonstrated time after
time how dangerous two attackers hunting as a pair can be.
So far, Parreira's system has worked. Brazil's style is well-suited to the
heat. The team have looked in control throughout all but one of their games.
The solitary exception came after they took a 2-0 lead against Holland.
Brazil may have been guilty of losing concentration or it may be that until
they backed the Dutch into a corner they had not faced a dangerous attacking
side.
The suspicion remains that Brazil have looked so comfortable in most of
their games not because they are good but because their other opponents  -
Sweden (twice), Russia, Cameroon and the US - have been poor and defensive.
Italy are capable of applying pressure that Brazil have not yet experienced.
If Dennis Bergkamp can run through the Brazilian defence, so can Roberto
Baggio. If Aron Winter can beat them in the air, so can Pierluigi Casiraghi
 -if Sacchi picks him.
Nevertheless, the Brazilians probably hope they face the industrious but
goal-shy Casiraghi rather than the speedy, sharp-shooting alternatives:
Giuseppe Signori and Daniele Massaro. The Brazilian solution will be to
defend in numbers.
Italy, too, will be obsessed with double- and triple-marking Bebeto and
Romario. The hope tomorrow is for an early stroke of genius which brings a
goal and loosens up both defences.
The only people who do not have happy memories of the 1970 World Cup final,
when Brazil produced a virtuoso display, are Italians. They lost 4-1.
But if the attitude of the Italian team in earlier rounds of this World Cup
is a guide, they will be glad that they face Brazil tomorrow and not Sweden
 -not because they desire revenge, but because they want an opponent they
can lose to without losing face.
But which Italian side will show up? Will it be the confident side that tore
into Bulgaria for 20 minutes in the first half of their semi-final,
producing the best passage of sustained attacking play in the tournament?
Or will it be the team that surrendered after Spain equalised in the
quarter-final, spent 20 minutes in an abject defensive crouch and were
rescued only by goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca's fortuitous save against Julio
Salinas and by Roberto Baggio's off-side goal immediately afterwards?
Italy's progress to the final has not stilled coach Arrigo Sacchi's army of
critics. Some dislike his English-style tactics, others his endless
tinkering with the team - Sacchi has used 20 of his 22 players  - as he
searches for 11 who will conform to his plan. Some object to him on
political grounds: he is Berlusconi's protege.
It is easy to second-guess Sacchi's squad selection. Roberto Donadoni is the
only genuine wide player and, canny, skilful and tough as he is, Donadoni
now lacks the pace to beat defenders on the outside. Only Roberto Mussi, a
full-back, and Giuseppe Signori, playing out of position, have consistently
found good crossing positions, though, like everyone in this World Cup, they
have had trouble crossing well.
Critics argue that it is no accident that Italy have earned the nickname of
'Cardiac Kids,' winning twice with 10 men. Only when they have a player sent
off can they safely shake off Sacchi's tactics, it appears.
Yet against Bulgaria, Sacchi's thinking paid off. The Italians applied
relentless pressure to the ball carrier. Two or three blue shirts would
harry every Bulgarian. The Bulgarians tried switching the ball back and
forth across the field, away from the crowds of Italians, yet could never
escape. They were penned in their half. Italy seemed to have more men on the
field.
The Brazilians like to move out of defence with quick short passes, which
should provide the Italians with chances to regain the ball quickly in the
most dangerous area, as the Dutch did in the later stages of their match
against Brazil. It also means that Italy could spend an exhausting afternoon
in the heat chasing shadows.
Since the injury to Franco Baresi, who showed his age against Ireland, the
Italian defence has been impressively solid. Yes, they occasionally look
shaky when players run at them, as Bebeto and Romario will, but so does any
defence. Now they will be without Sandro Costacurta and, unless Fifa has an
uncharacteristic change of heart, Mauro Tassotti. If this means a return for
Baresi, who had knee surgery on June 19, the Brazilian strikers will be
eager to test him out.
Sacchi's squad is showing signs of wear. Baggio tweaked a hamstring against
Bulgaria. With three days' rest he should be able to start, but he will know
that if he extends himself the hamstring could pop again at any time.
Pierluigi Casiraghi showed signs of cramp after barely an hour of his first
World Cup start. That may be because he has hardly played for a month or,
more likely, because the 90` heat on Wednesday and over the last month has
taken a toll on even the best-rested players.
But the key for the Italians lies not in their legs but in their heads. If
their nerve and luck hold, they are capable of avenging 1970.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Travel: The Silk Road's route to a living laboratory - John
Lloyd on the road from Khiva through Samarkandto Tashkent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few tourists presently travel Uzbekistan's part of the Silk Road - through
Khiva, Bokhara and Samarkand to Tashkent. Countries ending in 'stan' give
off an impression of danger now, enough to deter from the poetry of the
names of the road-cities.
This is a shame, for the Silk Road is not merely a parade of cultural
artefacts of extraordinary beauty and power strung along a former caravan
route which the Chinese pioneered to sell their unique commodity before the
birth of Christ, but also a living laboratory of the retreat, and survival,
of the road's latest civilisation, the Soviet one.
Khiva, from where it is best to start, is in the north-west of the long
strip of land called Uzbekistan, and is a museum. Its walled core has few
inhabitants, but a welter of madrasas (Moslem seminaries), mosques, palaces,
harems and dungeons.
The Khivan khans were, according to the Soviet-era museum displays,
connoisseurs of cruelty: they embedded victims in 'bug pits' of scorpions
and ants, impaled them on spikes, executed and strangled them, threw them
from the towers of mosques and fed them alive to beasts.
On some accounts, they continued to do at least some of this until deep into
this century. Gustav Krist's marvellous, John Buchan-esque memoir, Alone
Through a Forbidden Land, records executions by throwing from a mosque tower
as late as 1920. In that year, the last of the khans left before the
Bolsheviks got him and moved to Afghanistan (his son fetched up as a Soviet
army general).
Most of the line of 47 khans lived inside a fortress - the Kunya Ark -
within the walls, where the harem, the mint and a mosque have been restored.
Finer is the Tash Khauli, or stone palace, commissioned by the 37th khan,
Allakuli, who commanded to be built a palace which still dazzles with its
inventiveness and colour.
In the main courtyard, the rooms for the legal wives lie along one side,
next to the khan's own rooms; opposite, the rooms for the 40 non-lawful
wives. Meok Kasmaodov, a local man who did a fair job as a guide, says that
'because they were on the sunny side, they often grew tired and sometimes
sick - at which the khan would throw them out'.
There is little sign of a religious revival, though madrasas are being
brought into new service at a great rate everywhere and Islam is close to a
state religion. One of the largest madrasas has been re-cast as a hotel. The
manager looks very much like Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi, and tries to
charge Dollars 50 for a badly converted cell with a tap and a broken toilet.
In the restaurant next door, the tables were taken up with an
Algerian-Russian-Uzbek crew leisurely filming what was said to be a
promotional film. They stayed up much of the night for a union meeting in
the hotel's forecourt, complaining of bad conditions and low pay. A bar in a
vault sells western drinks and cigarettes. On the stools, two young Uzbeks
sat and swayed delicately to the Russian and Uzbek pop music, eyes shut.
The local children were voracious for gum or money, and threw stones at one
companion who parted with neither. But a wedding procession in the midday
heat was a showcase for a marvellous dance from an elderly man, pirouetting
gravely before a young couple who walked slowly down the main street, the
bride with grim face, the groom sniggering with his best man.
A little bus to get us to Bokhara bounced through the gathering dusk across
the southern edge of the Kizyl Kum desert. Bokhara also has an ark
(citadel), which juts up out of a leafy square, and inside is a museum of
exquisitely made Korans and the apartments and courts of the caliphs whose
arrogance caused all supplicants and ambassadors to approach on all fours
and walk out backwards.
On the wall, a little pie chart shows that 'before the revolution, the
richest families in the city controlled 87 per cent of the land; the
peasants, 13 per cent'. The Bokhara bug-pit housed two British officers,
Lt-Col Charles Stoddart and Capt Arthur Connolly, in the early 1840s. They
were executed when the latter refused to convert to Islam.
Our guide was a russified Uzbek woman named Zinai Ashurova who, in Bokhara's
oven-like temperatures, had the fondest memories of her time in a college in
Novokuznetsk, a - to my senses - industrial hell-hole of a town in southern
Siberia built round a vast steel plant. 'The people there are so warm, so
welcoming,' she said. In the grounds of the Ark, most other sight-seers were
girls from outlying villages in loose dresses of brightly-coloured silk,
giggly and silly before the western strangers.
Ashurova proposed an excursion to a little museum she knew 'where you can
try on clothes'. It was, of course, a softening-up course for shopping, but
more or less worth it. The museum was in a private house, preserved; Shurova
described it as a millionaire's house. In fact, as I was later told, it
belonged to the family of Kodja Oghli, or Kojaev, a man of wealthy family
who turned communist and who in 1920 assisted the Bolsheviks to expel the
emir and the bourgeoisie. Later he became first secretary of Uzbekistan, and
was executed in the late 1930s by Stalin.
We sat in the house of the class traitor and were served green tea and
sweets. After some time, the curator of the museum came in and showed us
clothes, inviting us to try them on so that we were dressed as Uzbeks of
property. Her husband, a handsome, languid man, assisted (only men can dress
men in Moslem custom). The rooms were splendid. In one, a vast old
gramophone declared it to have been the chamber where the women of the house
danced together of an afternoon.
Taken for Jews in the street, we were led to the town's synagogue by its
caretaker. It was two medium-sized rooms in a sagging house, with the
prayers in large letters on the walls and the raised pulpit in the middle of
the room. The tables were covered with tea bowls and little teapots. The
caretaker said that 400 Jews only remained from a community of many
thousands. Later, in the market, a trader who introduced himself as Jewish,
said there were 2,000 Jews, 'but leaving fast' - as from everywhere in the
former Soviet Union.
In the local art gallery, a young artist named Rachman Avezov sold me an
illustration, and himself guided us to the large Kalyan Mosque, and to some
of the fine - but deserted - old madrasas. An Uzbek, he studied in Leningrad
(as it then was) and married a Russian. His wife found Bokhara provincial
and hot, and left him with their son to live in Norilsk in the Arctic
circle; he remarried.
He fears that a revival of religion will narrow the freedom artists enjoy in
a still largely secular if (comparatively) mildly despotic state. 'Art has
no boundaries,' he said, showing me a book of avant garde art he had just
bought, in which Uzbek and Russian artists were displayed together.
('Mildly despotic' deserves an explanation. The country is run by a
president, Islam Karimov, the former Communist Party first secretary, who
routinely throws opposition leaders into jail. He recently sent the editor
of an opposition newspaper, a man in his late 50s, to hard labour in gold
mines for five years. Diplomats in Tashkent credit Karimov with being
hard-working and concerned for the future of his country.)
Another 300-plus kilometres of bad road, and there is Samarkand, where the
mausoleum of Tamberlaine - Gur Emir, the Rulers' Tomb - is being restored by
lethargic workers and the guard, for about Dollars 4, took us to the real
burial vault of the tyrant under the false one he built to deter disturbers.
He told us the well-worn tale of the Russian anthropologist, Mikhail
Gerasimov, who - defying the curse laid upon grave-openers - exhumed the
body on the night of June 22 1941, to be told within minutes of doing so
that Hitler, goaded to fury by the insult to his fellow mass murderer, had
invaded the Soviet Union.
But the glory of Samarkand and of the road is the Registan: a square formed
on three sides by the soaring arches of madrasas, of a form and colouring
(mostly restored) which define space in a way not found in Europe. Behind
the vast arches of the entrances are the ribbed domes of the mosques splayed
out from the central apex like tensed muscles. Inside are some of the
loveliest rooms in the world, some restored and well preserved, others
neglected. In the yards, lounging young men entice you to their stall by
shouting, and play the awful local pop on portable tape machines.
One last bone rattle to Tashkent. Uzbekistan's capital was wholly destroyed
by a series of earthquakes in 1966 and rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It is
green, with more working fountains than others of its kind, but dull, too,
with no fine buildings.
In the squalid airport, men and women humped huge sacks of fruit and
vegetables; merchants with low-price tickets were taking produce on a 3 1/2
 hour flight to Moscow. Theft from gardens is now common because of the high
prices which the produce commands in the Russian markets.
In the main museum we saw a jumble of paintings, many in the Soviet realist
style: strapping Uzbek cotton workers and soldiers, patient old men's faces,
wooden still lives. The handicrafts, by contrast, are marvellous:
embroidered kholats (men's gowns) which took five years of a woman's working
life, covered in intricate designs in gold thread.
In the Hotel Uzbekistan, we found another wedding. The young women danced
gracefully to the raucous din from the loudspeakers; the men pay them, and
they give the money to the bride. To our table came a drunken waitress. A
few moments before she had rudely refused to sell us tea on the obviously
false grounds that there were no teapots. She sat and burst into tears,
speaking a very broken German. She claimed she was ethnic German (there are
many still in central Asia) and that her brother had gone to Germany while
she was stuck here.
She remembered her mother, and cried. She tried to insist that we were
German, anxious to claim a kinship. But, perhaps suddenly struck that she
was a middle-aged waitress, drunk but well short of oblivion, in a shabby
hotel bar where the Germans whose understanding she was trying to gain were
barely civil and were anyway not German - she rose with a grunt and flopped
off back behind her counter.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Hemingway did drink martinis here - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES and GILES MACDONAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When rich and famous, Salvador Dali, the surrealist artist, walked the
salons at Madrid's Palace Hotel leading an ocelot and surrounded by
admirers.
Writer Ernest Hemingway drank his famous martinis there and film stars Orson
Welles, Ava Gardner and the spy Mata Hari are among the celebrities who have
slept, eaten, drunk or made love there during its 80 years.
Bullfighters would leave the front door of the Palace dressed in full
costume ready for the fray. Belmonte, El Gallo Manolete . . . the great
names of the corrida were cheered from its portals.
I did not glimpse an ocelot or a matador when visiting earlier this summer
but, by way of drab compensation, the hotel was packed with Americans,
Japanese and Italians in town for the festival of Madrid's patron saint, San
Isidro.
It was nearly impossible to get a table in La Cupola, the hotel's Italian
restaurant, currently one of the most popular places in town for being seen.
Curiously, for such a public venue, it is also where Spanish politicians
meet to plot. The atmosphere is refined yet intimate and the impression is
of more than lamb chops being cooked up there.
The Palace plans to host chefs for four to six-month periods from different
areas of Italy to cook with Paco Rubio, the hotel's executive chef. And
although it may seem odd to eat Italian food in the Spanish capital, food is
available there from almost every country in the world - in addition to
every Spanish region.
When in Madrid it is usually advisable to order fish - some of the freshest
and the best finds its way to the capital - and the poached fillets of sole
with a salsa capricciosa were elegantly presented and competently cooked.
Milk-fed lamb and veal are especially recommended and desserts include
tiramisu, carrot cake with cinnamon ice-cream, apple tart with poppy seeds
and blancmange with fresh fruit coulis.
The average price of a three-course meal is Pta6,000 (Pounds 30) to
Pta6,500, plus tax. If that sounds too high a price then opt for breakfast.
Anyone who is anyone can be seen power-broking over the yellow tablecloths
between 7.15am and 10am.
There are splendid croissants, breads, fruits, cold meats, smoked salmon,
and compotes available and two chefs will cook, in the dining room, almost
anything to order - even bacon and scrambled eggs. You can enjoy a glass of
cava if you can face sparkling wine before 10am in the morning - and, it
seems, many can. Breakfast costs from Pta2,150.
Information: The Palace Hotel, Plaza de las Cortes, 28014 Madrid, is a
member of Leading Hotels of the World. Reservations can be made in the UK by
dialling 0800 181 123 toll free.
The dowdy, buy-it-once-a-year-for-the-in-laws-at-Christ mas image which
sherry has in Britain is in stark contrast to the way it is seen in Spain.
Dry fino sherries, served well chilled, are immensely popular with the
moneyed Spanish young who appreciate the wine's adaptability, especially
with tapas.
For a characteristic bone-dry fino, try Lustau's Puerto Fino, around Pounds
7.25 from Gateway, Oddbins or Thresher; or the ever-popular Tio Pepe which
is sold for about Pounds 7.50 from most off-licences and supermarkets.
An alternative to fino is manzanilla, which is basically the same dry sherry
which has been aged near the sea at Sanlucar de Barrameda. To be authentic,
manzanilla should have a sea-salt tang coupled with the dryness of green
olives. Barbadillo, Pounds 4.99 from branches of Arthur Rackham and The
Vintner, is a good example.
Amontillado is old fino. As it gets older it gets increasingly nutty in
flavour. Naturally, amontillado is bone-dry, dark from age and higher in
alcoholic strength than fino. It used to be the tradition to sweeten up
amontillados for the British market and Harvey's 1796 is a monument to this
old style. If you want to try an uncompromising old amontillado try
Valdespino's Coloseo (Lea &amp; Sandeman, 071-376 4767, Pounds 19.95).
Anyone looking for something a little less intense might prefer Alcazar from
Bobadilla (Pounds 7.25 from Moreno Wines of Paddington 071-723 6897).
Olorosos are generally softer than amontillados. Oloroso means fragrant and
the wines are marked by a more immediately appealing, sweet, nutty bouquet.
A superb unadulterated oloroso is Apostoles from Gonzalez Byass (Pounds
15.99 from Oddbins). The best oloroso I have drunk is the finest dry oloroso
vintage 1963 from Gonzalez Byass, which costs a hefty Pounds 65 at Harrods
and Selfridges.
A bold attempt to bring Madrid chic to a world familiar only with tapas is
the restaurant Albero and Grana at 89 Sloane Avenue, London, SW3. (Tel:
071-225 1048/9). Sadly, only the tapas wing of the enterprise seems to
flourish and the few diners in the restaurant are obliged to put up with the
booming bass of the music from the bar. Albero &amp; Grana is well worth a look,
not least for its lasagna of black pudding; olla gitana (stew in the
gipsy-style); veal liver and kidney with black olive sauce; and milk-fed
lamb. Assume about Pounds 40 a head.
Finally, a little book to help you sort out your bocadillos from your platos
combinados. The Traveller's Food and Wine Guide to Spain and Portugal, by
Christine Boyle and Chris Nawrat, costs Pounds 6.95 from Carbery Press. Tel:
0264-860368.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The great north-west seafood pilgrimage - An
endless variety of fish makes Galicia Spain's seafood locker. Nicholas
Woodsworth eats his way around
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good meal is more than just good food. Its enjoyment derives from many
other things - the surroundings, the occasion, the company, our own mood on
sitting down before a table. There are technically accomplished dinners I
have had that I scarcely remember. On the other hand there are many
less-than-accomplished meals - some drunken, some last-minute, some
downright bad - that I recall with intense pleasure. In the end, cooking is
a relative thing the success of which depends as much on the diner as on the
dined on.
This is by way of introducing an account of some meals I had in travelling
through Galicia in north-western Spain. More than anywhere else I have eaten
recently, this is a place where, together, food and surroundings combine to
produce meals of strong and unforgettable flavour.
Galicia - isolated, rural, and battered by Atlantic weather - has a cuisine
all its own. Peasant farming in the green valleys produces a limited range
of crops - untypically 'northern' for Spain - such as cabbage and turnips.
By contrast, the waters off the rocky and indented shoreline of its rias, or
drowned river valleys, produce a wealth of ocean produce.
Scallops, mussels, crayfish, crabs, eels, oysters, squid, shrimp, octopus
and an endless variety of fish make Galicia Spain's seafood locker. Every
night special trains and fleets of trucks leave Galician ports so that next
morning fresh seafood deliveries will show up everywhere from chic Madrid
tapas bars to tiny Andalucian villages. Some critics rate Galicia's rias as
the source of the best seafood in Europe.
But Galicia itself is no centre of culinary cultural refinement - in my
drive from Santiago northwards through a dozen fishing ports I did not once
see a restaurant that might be termed sophisticated. Wet weather puts off
tourists and local underdevelopment discourages any kind of pretension. I
ate on paper tablecoths in simple restaurants, often to the accompaniment of
a blaring television. So much the better. What counts here is the freshness
of the food and a chance to watch ordinary Galicians go their everyday way.
THE SANTIAGO MARKET
Santiago de Compostela has been the site of Europe's greatest religious
pilgrimage for more than 1,000 years. Its medieval covered market is also a
good place to begin a culinary pilgrimage. It is like a large shopping
centre straight from the middle ages - long, stone-paved alleys and row
after row of arcades mimic the aisles of a modern supermarket.
But there is nothing modern here. Whole animals hang from hooks. Skinned
sheep's heads stare at you. Squat, head-scarved Galician farmers' wives work
with thick, field-roughened fingers to arrange bunches of chives into
precise piles on wickerwork baskets. Plastic wrapping, polystyrene, and
clerks in white jackets might never have existed.
All the aisles were piled high with produce from the surrounding
countryside, but my favourite was the cheese aisle, where each cheese rested
softly on straw-covered wooden racks. I bought a queso San Simon from a
toothless, grey-haired granny in black widow's weeds. It was a wonderful
cheese - creamy coloured, large, and conical in shape. Such cheeses are much
prized in Galicia - when I told the old woman that I was taking my cheese
home with me I received 10 minutes of instruction on its care.
What did not last more than five minutes, though, was the fresh tuna and
sweet red pepper empanada I also bought. Empanadas are the Iberian version
of Cornish pasties, and very popular. Downed with a glass of cool Galician
apple cider, they make a delicious market-morning snack.
EL BOMBERO
There is nothing fancy about El Bombero, a small upstairs restaurant
overlooking a narrow Santiago street. From my table I could watch three
generations of family members at work in the kitchen. A small child, getting
in everyone's way, played about the floor on hands and knees.
But homely restaurants make homely food, and a caldo gallego was just what I
needed to ward off the raw air and the Atlantic rain pelting down outside. A
caldo is the simplest of peasant fare, a thick soup of cabbage, potatoes,
white beans and turnips in a meat broth. Its popularity is attested by the
dark green cabbages seen growing high on thick stalks outside every rural
house in Galicia.
The merluza a la cazuela or hake stew which followed is just as humble a
dish, and just as delicious. Prepared in a small terracotta bowl that came
to the table bubbling hot, it is a hearty marriage of Galician products from
sea and shore: thick slices of hake baked in a fresh tomato sauce with peas,
potatoes, onions and savory chunks of cured serrano ham. I walked out of El
Bombero ready to take on any kind of weather.
SAN FRANCISCO
The roadside San Francisco restaurant, near the coastal village of Lauro,
has a vast collection of key chains mounted in glass cases on the walls. It
is one of the more arcane branches of collecting, and I would have preferred
to see a menu. But no. The lady of the house asks you if you would like
such-and-such a dish. If you would, you get it. If you would not, you get it
anyway.
Did I want lenguado, she asked. I had never heard of it, and shook my head.
Did I want a pitcher of Ribeiro? I had never heard of that either, and shook
my head again. Lenguado and Ribeiro were duly produced, and in this way I
enjoyed a delicious meal of sole and the local wine, a refreshing change
from the heavier wines grown in hotter, sunnier parts of Spain.
PLAYA DE BALEO
It does not much matter what you take on a picnic to the Galician seaside.
It is all so beautifully wild and deserted you cannot help enjoying the
simplest of food. Crusty Spanish bread, savoury chorizo sausage, cheese,
tomatoes, a bottle of Ribeiro; in these surroundings what more could you
want? I am afraid, though, that after half-a-dozen picnics on half-a-dozen
glorious Galician seashores, I have become seriously addicted to
anchovy-stuffed olives. They are difficult to find in London.
CAMARINAS
There are dozens of fishing boats in the port at Camarinas. But when I
arrived a heavy three-day blow meant there was nothing left in O Meu Lar,
the little fish restaurant decorated with photos of the local football team
and its cups and trophies.
Off then, to the local hamburgueseria, a place so unassuming that this was
the only name marked on the sign outside. But so many Galicians have
emigrated to Argentina and then returned home that Argentine meat-eating
habits are well established here - you will find the same grill houses in
rural Galicia as you will in downtown Buenos Aires. Hamburgers be damned,
said I. Humming a tango, I feasted instead on sticks of pinchos morunos,
grilled marinated pork doused in a fiery, garlic-based hot sauce.
The wind dropped, the boats went out, O Meu Lar was back in business, and so
was I. To a television-roaring of Zaragoza playing Vigo, a Galician team,
for the national football championship, I tucked into fat orange ria mussels
in escabeche sauce. By half time I had moved on to calamar salad and a bowl
of chipirones, small stuffed squid swimming in a sauce of their own ink. To
great howls of despair, Vigo finally lost on sudden-death penalties.
Everyone else in O Meu Lar was destroyed. Rather ashamed, I walked out
feeling like a winner.
MALPICA
All Malpica, once a busy Spanish whaling port, is mad about the ocean.
Elderly men and children - those too old or too young to be out on the sea -
clamber about on the rocks at low tide. They poke around with nets and
hammers and sticks, looking for octopus, moray eels, mussels, bait worms,
nasty-looking but highly tasty clumps of goose barnacles, and the spiny
little rock fish that make such good soup.
Down at the harbour, young men set out daily on the high tide, heading for
the fishing grounds in little wooden boats. And when the Ave Marina, the
Flor de Espana, the Maria Mercedes, the Jesus Miguel and the rest of the
fleet returns home, squads of short, heavy-set women await them on the quay.
With rubber boots squelching and the arms of their jerseys shoved up to the
elbow, they heave and haul at boxes of fish and tubs of squid.
You can dine on vast plates of caldeira in O Burato, a restaurant not far
from the harbour where the walls are covered with pictures of Christ and the
Virgin framed in scallop shells. And if there is a little spare time between
courses, you will see the three elderly waitresses who work there gather in
the kitchen to recite their Hail Marys.
Even more uplifting is to sit at twilight by a window in O Pescador, the
fisherman's bar perched over the port, and order a tapa of grilled shrimps
or fried octopus. Inside, in a blue fug of cigarette smoke, the conversation
is loud, the laughter raucous, the sound of dominoes being slapped down on
tables by groups of whiskery fishermen pistol-sharp. Outside, seagulls
scream, boats bob, and ocean waves surge over the rocks. There could be no
better place to finish a seafood pilgrimage.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The threat on France's doorstep - The Spanish
wine bargains available
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Which country do French wine producers see as their greatest threat?
The average British wine drinker might think Australia. Her (yes, she is
female) American counterpart might think north, or even south, America. But
the answer is Spain.
Spain is right on France's doorstep and not only has 20 times more vineyard
than Australia, and five times more than the US, but half as much again as
France. Only its water shortage keeps Spain in third place as a wine
producer behind France and Italy. But imagine if New World thinking were
ever to prevail within Europe and allow widespread irrigation . . .
There is certainly no shortage of Spanish wine bargains available in
Britain, although there tends to be a curious polarisation of supply: either
dirt cheap liquids carefully designed to meet British taste and price points
(sic), or intensely ambitious wines which set their cap at Madrid's
connoisseur class.
Ribera del Duero has provided the Madrilenos with Spain's most fashionable,
concentrated, well-structured reds. Vega Sicila (Laymont &amp; Shaw, of Truro,
Cornwall) and Pesquera (John Armit of London W11) have been the standard
bearers, but producers such as Sanz's Dehesa de los Canonigos are putting on
the pressure.
British wine drinkers are now being treated to a much wider variety of names
from this promising wine region at less exalted prices (and, it has to be
said, slightly less exalted quality).
Senorio de Nava's good value wines are relatively widely available - the
harmonious and powerful 1987 is Pounds 5.69 at Asda and Pounds 5.99 at
Fullers wine shops, while it is possible to find the still slightly tough
1989 reduced from Pounds 5.69 to Pounds 4.99 until today at some branches of
the Co-op.
The Wine Society, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has the rich and powerful
Callejo 1989 at Pounds 6.95. Its Spanish selection is looking particularly
interesting at the moment. Marques de Alella Clasico 1993 at Pounds 4.95 is
a lively, super-tingly, lemony, dry white also made just outside Barcelona,
which would make a refreshing and genuinely interesting aperitif and could
withstand fierce chilling for a picnic.
The society's classically rustic Masia Barril Tipico 1991 Priorato at Pounds
5.75, on the other hand, is just the job for those with fond memories of
blockbusting, old-fashioned, sun-drenched red Chateauneuf-du-Pape. The
typical Priorato red should theoretically have 13.75 per cent alcohol. This
one has 15.
In many ways the rugged, slatey slopes of Priorat(o) constitute Spain's most
fascinating red wine appellation at the moment. A series of small-scale
investors in Clos This and Clos That have made ambitious, long-term red
wines which combine Catalan heritage with recognition of what the
international wine collector seeks. Moreno Wines of London W2 and W9 have
Clos Mogador in their exceptionally interesting Spanish range (see also
their Guilbenzu reds from Navarra from Pounds 4.99), but it is Pounds 17.49.
Clos Mogador probably ought not to be broached until the next century, but
Clos Dofi 1990, not to my knowledge available in the UK, manages to combine
the promise with current pleasure, albeit in no more than 2,500 bottles,
filled from some absolutely top quality barrels.
Clos Dofi is made by a refugee from Rioja, but Rioja has woken up from its
dream of first-growth prices and can now offer the odd genuinely interesting
bargain, such as Oddbins' Puelles Rioja. At Pounds 3.75 this scented, full,
fruity red wine is one of those new riojas that has nothing whatever to do
with the archetype, being juicy rather than oaky.
Oddbins also has the more serious Palacio de la Vega Cabernet Sauvignon 1991
Navarra at Pounds 6.99. It is full, deep, with lots of oak, but very well
put together. Strike before prices rise.
Today is the last day of the Co-op's offer of the appley dry and perfectly
acceptable light white Galician Valle de Monterrey at Pounds 1.99, although
even at the usual Pounds 2.49 it is a good buy.

FT  16 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Spectacles to put fashion freaks in the
shade - Sunglasses which protect and look good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chic Simple's handbook* on spectacles is in no doubt about what is the most
important thing about them - 'remembering where you left them last'. True,
true. Even now I am lamenting my cool blue Calvin Klein shades - they sum up
everything that this year's sunglasses should be - and I have not the
faintest idea where I last left them.
The second most important thing is not, you may be dismayed to learn, the
shape of the frames, but how much protection they offer to the eyes. In
these ozone-depleted days most of us are only too aware of what excessive
sunlight can do to the skin but few of us are aware of just how much damage
we risk to the eyes.
Eye cancer, age-related cataract, age-related macular degeneration, ageing
and cancer of the circumocular skin, pterygium, photokeratitis - this is the
gloomy roll-call of eye problems that those who flirt dangerously with
strong sunlight might expect.
If this sounds a bit alarmist let me refer you to the work of optical
company Fabris Lane International.
'Damage to the eyes,' its eminent researchers, among them Professor Richard
Young of the University of California, conclude, 'is cumulative and
therefore it is better to wear protective sunglasses from an early age and
to continue through life to wear them whenever subject to bright sunlight
for extended periods.'
While UVA, B and C rays are harmful, the real baddie in the solar spectrum
is ultraviolet light and it is all the more dangerous for being invisible.
Cheap sunglasses bought off market stalls and in some chain stores are
little more than fashion accessories - but highly dangerous ones - for some
of the lenses are simply tinted and offer no protection.
Fortunately, it is usually very easy to check which glasses offer proper
protection and which do not - there is now a British Standard (2724), which
means that, at the very least, the eye will have basic protection.
Within that standard there are three different levels of protection - if for
use just as a fashion accessory (sashaying into Joseph, lunching in Le
Caprice, at Academy Awards, that sort of thing) then the lenses should
transmit between 29 per cent and 100 per cent of light (meaning that the
lens will get paler as the light gets darker).
Then there are sunglasses which transmit between 8 per cent and 29 per cent
of daylight and these are suitable for driving in strong sunlight.
Most protection of all is offered by those which transmit only between 3 per
cent and 8 per cent of light and these are not suitable for driving but are
intended for skiers, mountaineers and sailors.
Ray-Bans seem to survive the ups and downs of fashion's fickle favours. If
you own and wear a much loved pair you will clearly not be at the
cutting-edge of fashion but you will be able to rest assured that you are
wearing a classic. They have the enduring cachet of pearls and Chanel.
Last year's oblong frames, most fashionably done by Cutler &amp; Gross, are this
summer, says my style-adviser, very, very square. (Sod's law being what it
is, these will, of course, be the ones you have failed to lose.)
This year's look centres on thin metal frames, gently oval in shape which,
coincidentally and happily, seem to flatter most faces. Clip-ons (even for
those with 20/20 vision - they wear clip-ons over frames with plain glass)
are what the really cool set is wearing.
This is one of those splendid turns of the wheel of fashion - when clip-ons
first came in they were strictly for the geriatric set, a reminder of the
passing of time and the withering of age.
Now what once was naff has become big business with even some of those who
normally wear contact lenses abandoning them for the summer in favour of
prescription lenses and clip-ons.
Calvin Klein does clip-ons with different coloured lenses - normally Pounds
140 for the frame (currently Pounds 105 in Selfridge's summer sale) and
Pounds 40 for the clip-ons. Emporio Armani, too, is rushing in vast
quantities of its little metal frames and clip-on attachments.
Anglo-American is one of the great names in what the trade calls 'eye-wear'.
Initially famous for its horn-rimmed glasses, made from zylonite and
cellulose nitrate in imitation tortoise-shell, and given clout among the
glamour set when Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton took to wearing them, they
have long been established as one of the first places of call for those who
would be both safe and fashionable.
Anglo-American has added proper optically-sophisticated sunglasses,
including Grade 1 optical quality plastic lenses and impact resistant
organic glass, to a wide range of frames.
It has some 10 different frames with clip-ons which exactly match the frame
in metal and four in acetate. Frames start at Pounds 60 and its clip-ons are
Pounds 45 to Pounds 49.
If your summer is going to include lots of energetic sporting activities
then you should look out for Fabris Lane's Etalia Sports range which uses
polycarbonate safety lenses of great strength.
Fabris Lane also offers other specialist lenses - Advanced Graphite Driving
lenses (blocks ultra-violet light completely) yet retains good visibility
and polarised lenses which eliminate up to 90 per cent of the glare
reflected from flat surfaces such as the sea, snow and wet roads.
Those who are unaccustomed to the kind of prices designer frames tend to
attract might like to look at the Mazzucchelli range. It does for sunglasses
what Warehouse and Miss Selfridge do for fashion - delivers the latest
designer look at a fraction of the designer price.
For just Pounds 22.50 there is pair of the slightly oval, thin metal-framed
frames with good protective lenses which have all this summer's fashionable
hallmarks.
*Thames and Hudson, Pounds 6.95.

FT  16 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Hot clothes for men
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the hottest week London has seen for many a year, British men are still
going about their business the way they have since time immemorial - swathed
in dark woollen suits.
As the hot weather goes on it is worth knowing that there are some splendid
bargains to be found in the sales. For instance, a few pieces from Marks and
Spencer's splendid pale beige and stone summer collection will be on sale in
some of the larger stores.
Look for the fashionable ingredients of the male wardrobe - the collarless
baggy linen shirts (Pounds 25 upwards), the loose waistcoat (Pounds 30), the
unstructured casual jacket (Pounds 75), the light linen/wool suits (Pounds
160) and the linen/cotton beige jeans (Pounds 25).
Christopher Brown's drawings show how the basic elements can be combined to
produce a summer wardrobe that can go from the boardroom (far left and
right) to the most casual weekend picnics.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Fashion: Why Soho can suit the smart set - It is not just
Savile Row tailors who can cut a dash in the world of top-class menswear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jack Nicholson has been in London. Between dining at San Lorenzo, dancing at
Tramp and sleeping at The Connaught, the actor has been stocking up on a few
conversation-piece suits. Nicholson is not to be found on Savile Row but in
Soho, giving his high-profile custom to John Pearse of Meard Street.
Pearse must be a very successful man, for he does not regard politeness as a
tool of his trade. One imagines the sparring that takes place over the tape
measure as he calculates the jib of Nicholson and fellow celebrities Mick
Jagger, Tom Cruise, Malcolm McClaren, Nicole Kidman and Mariella Fostrupp,
for he subscribes to the tiresome 'it's-cool-to-be-rude' style of badinage
with customers, for fear, perhaps, that they will mistake his work for a
service.
His tailoring style is 'laddish'. While he can offer the full gamut of
classics - grey flannel, Prince of Wales check and Harris tweed - since his
days at 'Granny Takes a Trip' in the 1960s, he leans towards more
attention-seeking tailoring, such as changeant velvet, Hendrix suits,
pony-skin print shirts, horizontal pinstripes, and bookmaker checks.
But he finds today's rich rock stars of a certain age prefer his more
conventional offerings. 'You can get bored of being a fashion plate, and so
you dress down in a neutral uniform.' The greatest compliment that Pearse
can pay a customer is that 'I don't recognise one of my own suits on them,
it becomes part of them'. He has cited Richard Ingrams as a pleasing example
of this, in his signature, bashed-up corduroy suits.
While most of Pearse's clients fall into the 'performing arts and their
hangers-on' category, he also caters for the business community. So if you
can afford at least Pounds 700 for a suit, and like verbal jousting, Pearse
will oblige.
A similar counter-culture is served by the talented young tailor Oswald
Boateng. But, while cutting the sharpest suit in the trade, he will ply you
with old world courtesies. A tall, athletic client is best suited to the
Boateng treatment for he cuts suits with fork-prong narrow trousers and
high-waisted coats. Both his male and female customers emerge from his
Portabello Road studio looking like gloriously-coloured Daddy Longlegs.
David Chambers, a jovial tailor based in Hertfordshire, will come to your
home or office for fittings, and lists singer Bryan Ferry, designer Sir
Terence Conran, artist Patrick Hughes and gallery owner Tim Jeffries, among
his clients. Chambers has a keen eye and a sure hand. He is also flexible,
taking full advantage of the bartering school of business. Hamish McAlpine,
the film distributor, swopped his much-coveted Ferrari for 28 Chambers
suits. Prices start at Pounds 500.
Mark Powell, another Soho-based tailor, specialises in
nostalgically-inspired suits, such as the new Edwardian, four- button coat
favoured by musician Jools Holland and comedian Vic Reeves. He is not only
patronised by stars but also by stage companies requiring period costume.
His imposing frame, shaved head and Michael-Caine-in-Alfie manner belie a
courteous temperament.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Fashion: Slipping in and out of style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To Ireland this week for an 'in-depth' look at the world of Lycra in the
company of a bevy of lissom fashion assistants. The fashion assistant is a
breed unto herself. Paid a pittance, she nevertheless manages to make your
very expensive designer suit look like last year's leftovers.
She spends much of her life in cupboards, sorting through some of the
world's most expensive clothes and this has taught her a thing or three.
It means she can spot the provenance of anything sartorial, from a designer
suit to a handkerchief, with all the devastating accuracy of a cruise
missile. Thought you had picked a bargain in Surbiton? Felt pleased with
your understated buy from Tesco? You will not fool her. Her laserbeam eyes
tell you that she knows just where you bought it and exactly how much you
paid.
If there is one thing she knows it is what is in and what is out. While you
are still working out how to put together this year's understated, natural
look (all white and floaty) she has moved on and is into glamour. Her heels
are high, her lipstick red, her hair piled high.
This is no new-age mystic searching for inner truth (that was last year):
this year's model is the dangerously bad and wicked vamp. She has come in
out of the flower-filled fields and night-clubs, preferably gay, are now her
natural habitat.
All that sorting through of fashion cupboards (not to mention the odd chic
gift from grateful fashion houses) has given her a confidence that belies
her years. If she has a credo it is this - if in doubt wear black. Gathering
for dinner in one of Dublin's jolly eateries (La Stampa, very much to be
recommended) we looked much like a widows' coven - nothing but black as far
as the eye could see (except for my six-year-old New York number. 'Oh, how
lovely that you are wearing a print,' said one).
For those of you who are more than 17 years old, whose stomachs are less
than washboard flat and who have been wondering just how you wear this
year's tiny slip-dress, I will pass on to you the fashion assistants'
secret.
Firstly, buy it in black. Secondly, get one of Hue's Total Body-Shapers
(Pounds 18.95 a time from House of Fraser stores). Made from nylon and Lycra
Spandex this gives what in the trade is called 'total body control' -
everything from the top of the bosom down to the ankle.
It is no good protesting that this poses serious physical challenges for
that is not the point - if you want to look good in a slip dress then, as
one of the more voluptuous assistants pointed out, you just have to cope
with the inconvenience. If you are exceptionally young and exceptionally
thin you can wear it with long stay-up stockings (Marks and Spencer's
stockings have the most staying power).
For those who are aged over 30 it may be more instructive to observe what
fashion assistants do when they graduate to being editors. Then they wear
their flirty slip dresses in layers (black, bien sur). The dress goes over a
longer tube-like skirt, and over the dress goes a loose top and they add
bright red lipstick and sexy, high-heeled, strappy shoes. That is this
week's news. By the time you read it the fashion assistants may well have
moved on.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Fashion: Clothes' sexual challenge - Katrina Blandy on
cross-dressing since Adam and Eve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA BLANDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Adam and Eve clothed themselves in fig leaves, cross-dressing
between the sexes has been a topic which is both risque and overplayed. The
clothes you wear define not only the type of person you are, but also your
sexuality.
To give his female characters freedom, Shakespeare would disguise them as
men and let them loose on stage. But while Ganymede-Rosalind thinks she has
the upper hand, Shakespeare's audiences would be laughing at her. A boy
actor dressed as a girl, then disguised as a boy to dupe her beloved was a
popular and effective way of challenging apparent sexuality as defined by
costume.
With the arrival of the Japanese show Takarazuka at London's Coliseum, the
challenge to clothes as definitive of sexuality has taken a much more modern
turn. Members of the all-female cast train for years to earn a place in the
company, but only the most successful are chosen to play men. They
immediately develop the distinctive Takarazuka quiff, and in doing so mark
themselves out as men who are women.
Here is the opposite to the Shakespearean joke, and, considering the
Japanese patriarchal society, one that is tolerated remarkably openly.
Except here, the raison d'etre of this particular sex change is to increase
the women's understanding of the role of men and thus to make the women into
better wives, so that the dangerous joke is rendered harmless.
This summer's prevailing look of soft pyjama trousers sharply offsets the
earlier sharp-edged city suit. Women in the 1980s who wore bold, distinctive
suits to the boardroom were issuing a definite challenge to their male
colleagues. These primitive distinctions between the sexes have now blurred,
so that fashion of the 1990s is more about the person you are, rather than
the sex you are.
However, the challenge of cross-dressing remains. At the Central Saint
Martin's 1994 graduate show, Juliet Gatto showed a collection of humanoid
invaders. Aliens are usually asexual, but Gatto was careful to mark out the
sex of her model by making him promenade with a large penis on the front of
his clothes. However tacky this may seem to some, it had a deeper purpose in
explicitly flaunting what humans since Adam and Eve have been trying to
hide.
Visually, the point she was making is obvious: everybody knows that beneath
their clothes they are either male or female. What Gatto achieved was not
subtle but it was effective, because it focused on the symbiotic
relationship between clothes and sexuality. Here, the issue of sexuality was
unambiguously displayed on the outside of the clothes rather than hidden
beneath.
The child in the fairytale of the Emperor's New Clothes points out that the
Emperor is naked. The child's eye sees and acknowledges what adults all
around fear to do. Naked, the essence of the Emperor as a man is all the
more on view. Yet the crowds around still believe him to be dressed until
they are told otherwise.
What clothes seem to do for sexuality or personality is to refract and
direct a certain attitude or posture. Women wearing suits or men wearing
kilts are all making - or trying to make - a statement about themselves. The
question is whether the wearer is in control, or the designer. If a designer
clothes you, rather than you wearing the clothes, then the passer-by - much
like Shakespeare's audience or the child in the fairytale - is having the

FT  16 JUL 94 / Spreadsheet simplicity: Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not assume that spreadsheets are only for serious number-crunchers: they
are the simplest type of personal database available. Once you understand
how a spreadsheet package works you will find it useful for all sorts of
tasks.
Invoices and statements. For accounting, the spreadsheet will make all the
calculations automatically, including 17.5 per cent VAT.
Quotations for jobs. If you issue quotations you can produce them on a
spreadsheet, then amend them into an invoice once the job is done. A sales
or purchases daybook. Your spreadsheet can also be used to analyse invoices
into total, VAT, stock, telephone, fax, rent etc, automatically adding up
and cross-casting the columns.
Cashflow and Sales forecast. Spreadsheets are handy for forecasting cash and
profitability. Type anticipated weekly or monthly cash receipts and expenses
into a cashflow forecast and the spreadsheet will automatically calculate
the running balance on a bank account - or enter the number of units you
expect to sell and the spreadsheet will calculate monthly income and gross
profit.
Of my own 200-odd spreadsheets, the great majority are simple lists, all of
which can easily be amended and a fresh copy printed. The main benefit of
these lists is that they pull together a large amount of information into
one place. Virtually every one is in condensed print, so I can fit 132
characters across the page.
Contacts list. In such a spreadsheet, the column headings might be 'company
name', 'contact', 'phone no', and 'comments'. With about 60 lines per
computer page I can get 60 contacts and telephone numbers into a single page
of printout. Product price list. Perhaps the most important list for any
company. Record on your spreadsheet the part number, description, cost price
and selling price of each product you sell. It is easy to keep the price
list up to date as prices and products change. When stocktaking, type in the
quantity counted of each product, then multiply by the cost price field for
an instant year-end stock valuation.
Foreign currency. For example, if your base prices are in sterling and you
need to convert to D-Marks, the spreadsheet will automatically apply the
latest exchange rate.
Importing / Property / Portfolio valuation. A spreadsheet is ideal in
importing, for converting prices into sterling and working out the landed
cost. In the property business, multiply the square footage of each building
by the latest insurance or rental rates per square foot to calculate annual
insurance cost or rental income. If you own shares, enter the name of each
security and the number held into a spreadsheet, then enter the share price
each week to calculate your current portfolio valuation. Then enter the
Inland Revenue's latest indexation factor to work out capital gains tax
liability.
Retail businesses. Shop owners unsure how to use a conventional sales ledger
such as Sage, should forget sales ledgers which deal in credit sales.
Instead, they should use a spreadsheet to reconcile cash takings with the
till roll each day. Add up the totals each month, then divide the till roll
total by 1.175 to work out VAT. Then post as a single journal direct to the
nominal ledger.
Daily till roll sales by department. Another retail application. The columns
of the spreadsheet would be the days of the week; the rows would be the
departments ('food', 'confectionery', etc). Enter the departmental totals
each day from the till roll and the spreadsheet will add up the total weekly
sales by department. With a conventional spreadsheet package you would
create separate spreadsheets for each week and would end up with 52 by the
year end.
Three dimensional spreadsheets. A 3-D spreadsheet can consolidate all 52
into one spreadsheet, tucking them in one behind the other and allowing you
to flip quickly from viewing one week's sales to the next.
Which spreadsheet do you buy? You may find that the Excel or Lotus 1-2-3,
are more than you will ever use and that an integrated package such as
MicroSoft Works is more suitable (Pounds 84 by mail order from Guardian
Computing, 0753-516959, Dos or Windows).
For retailers, the best 3-D spreadsheet package is Borland's Quattro Pro 5.0
for Dos (Pounds 38, also from Guardian). Its manual (page 48) contains an
excellent tutorial showing how to set up a daily expenses analysis.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A family keen to get ahead - The
recession-beating strategy of a hat-making company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rather than growing too big for their boots they have had to avoid letting
success go to their heads at Olney Headwear, the only manufacturer of men's
hats in Luton, a traditional hat-making town.
After 75 years making panama hats and a handful of other styles, including
uniform hats, the company made its first takeovers in the late 1980s. The
recession years have been excellent for business - sales have risen 60 per
cent in five years.
'Although we are making 42,000 men's straw hats a year, nearly all of which
are panamas, we now have only 60 per cent of the UK market in these
fashionable styles, which is a decrease in market share,' said managing
director Michael Olney, 54.
'When the panama boom started in the late 1980s, a number of other
manufacturers took up the challenge. Many found they weren't up to the job,
but a few have stayed.
'However we are still the country's biggest manufacturer of genuine panama
hats, using hand-woven torquilla fibre imported from Ecuador, and in the
meantime the two takeovers have meant we have increased our total range of
headwear to 500 different styles.'
Michael and his brother Nicholas head the family company, which has 60
employees, and which manufactures 12 styles of ladies' hat, mainly for Laura
Ashley and other large retailers. Ladies' hats comprise 17 per cent of the
company's Pounds 2.5m turnover - about the same percentage as panamas.
Workwear hats - mainly for the food and laboratory industries - make up 27
per cent, and gents' tweed caps and hats another 20 per cent.
'We try to make our range a mix of classics and fashion items,' said
marketing manager Paul Offord.
'Although the panama has been made by Olney for many of the company's 80
years and is now an established classic it would be foolish to assume it
will always remain as fashionable as it has been for the past five years.
'Michael and Nicholas were very wise to buy a small Luton gents' tweed
hatmaker in 1988, and in 1989 they consolidated this by buying a Glasgow cap
specialist from the receiver for Pounds 12,500 in late 1989, just before I
joined the company. The two acquisitions broadened the Olney range of
expertise and almost doubled the range of products.'
The recent purchase of 5,000 sq ft of extra space adjoining the Luton
factory at a price of Pounds 90,000 was financed by a 10-year loan from
NatWest.
Apart from that, the only borrowings are on overdraft. This arrangement is
vital because of the seasonal nature of the hat trade, and also because
cashflow is very unpredictable, particularly with suppliers in Ecuador and
China, from which Olney buys all its straw.
All the overseas buying is done by letters of credit, but getting the money
in from the retail trade in this country is frequently a headache, said
Offord. That and the other financial aspects of the business are the
preserve of Michael's son David, 28, the company accountant. He and his
brother Andrew, 31, who is production manager, are the fourth generation of
the family in the business.
In 1989 - a notable year for the company - the brothers also changed the
name from AE Olney (their grandfather Albert Edward founded the company in
Luton in 1914) and poached Offord from a competitor to implement their new
policy of selling direct to the high street.
'For nearly 75 years we had sold to the trade, but for a variety of reasons
we decided to cut out all wholesalers and go direct to the retailers,' said
Michael Olney. 'Paul's initial task, together with my brother Nicholas and
three agents, was to make this strategy work. A new leaflet was produced
detailing the entire range of panamas, cottons and straws, workwear hats,
tweeds and caps and gents' felt hats, and Paul took to the road.
'We thought it would be difficult opening up 500 accounts in shops all over
the country,' said Offord. 'In fact, we received a very good reception in
the retail sector. After 75 years in the trade we were pleased to find we
were pretty well-known. A lot of our customers had been buying our hats
under different names without realising it. It was hard work legging it all
over the country, but well worth the effort. It was very good strategy on
the part of Michael and Nicholas - and the move came at just the right time
to counteract the effects of the recession.'
The company's turnover is Pounds 2.5m. Rates of profit on different lines
are a well-kept secret in such a competitive business, but the company seeks
a net profit of 25 per cent.
The main financial obstacle is one Olney is well used to dealing with: the
necessity to carry a large stock.
'Hats are very light, but bulky. Much of the newly-acquired building will be
used for warehousing,' Michael Olney said. 'At the beginning of July we had
nearly 4,000 hats, valued at approximately Pounds 150,000 in storage. Many
have gone out now - but we need the space in anticipation of the increased
numbers of tweed hats and caps we are making for autumn.'
Despite the prestige of its own-name hats in the high street, the company
tries not to forget that the biggest single sector in its business is
industrial headwear, of which it make 5,000 units a week.
Michael said: 'Many of these products require far less skill than goes into
making a panama that retails at up to Pounds 80. But in many ways they are
the lifeblood of the company.
'The other vital element in our success is our workforce. A lot of processes
in hat-making will always be carried out by hand. At the top end it is still
a craft-based industry.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where I can get impartial advice about my investments? The majority are
investments for growth and produce a low income. But I am in my late 60s
(with no dependants) and find I am in need of more income. I have not been
satisfied with previous advice from my bank.
It is a little difficult to advise you as we do not know the amount of your
investments. But investment advice can be had from solicitors authorised by
the Law Society and accountants authorised by the Institute of Accountants.
It could also be worth getting quotes and suggestions from two or three
independent financial advisers so that you have a choice of approach and
advice.
Publications such as Planned Savings and Money Management, obtainable from
newsagents, contain details of most of the major players in this market.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exemption from tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am a British citizen who has moved to Monaco for one full tax year. I have
a few investments that I would like to realise while overseas. The main ones
are offshore roll-up money market funds and zero coupon or deep discount
bonds. It was my understanding when I bought these that my liability would
be to income tax when I sold them (assuming that I was resident in the UK).
Are these taxable, bearing in mind my non-resident status?
Write to the Inland Revenue, Financial Intermediaries and Claims Office
(International), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB,
(or to your last UK tax office) and ask for a copy of the free booklet IR 20
(Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK).
You will see from the booklet that if you are outside the UK for the whole
of the 1994-95, you will be exempt from income tax on income (including
capital gains treated as income) from sources outside the UK for this year.

retain tax papers for seven years if there are likely to be any queries or
reclaims involved. (Murray Johnstone).

FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tenants and tax: a new view
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In your issue of July 2/3, you published a letter headlined 'Tenants and the
Revenue'. This dealt with the taxation position of a limited company formed
by tenants to run their flat block. The tenants pointed out that the company
did not generate a 'profit' and asked why the Inland Revenue produced
assessments for tax.
Your reply said, in part, that 'the expenditure actually incurred in each
year is deducted from the rents and service charges due from the tenants in
the year. and any balance is chargeable to corporation tax'. So also was any
income from surplus funds put on deposit or invested.
May I disagree with your reply? For nearly 40 years, I was in the Revenue -
most of them in a senior technical post - and am now treasurer of a mutual
flat-owners' management company. Our leases, which are probably typical of
general usage, permit the company to demand from us only as much as it
spends on maintenance, management and repair.
Anything collected over and above is, strictly speaking, beyond its legal
entitlement - although it is accepted by members in order to have a working
fund because we cannot budget in advance for every penny.
Rents under the leases are chargeable under Schedule A, but are negligible
in relation to the total annual budget. Any further sums collected are
indeed under the lease - but only to the extent strictly permitted by the
lease as explained above.
It should follow that (as the company is not trading) the only sums
chargeable finally to corporation tax will be investment income such as bank
interest, as no Schedule A surplus can arise.
My official practice (at my personal discretion only) was to tell such
companies not to bother me unless their interest exceeded Pounds 100 in the
year. As treasurer, however, I have found that our auditors prefer for their
protection to have the accounts submitted to the Revenue so that it can
correctly certify a nil tax provision.
The trouble is that, once you do this, the machinery of review will usually
produce an estimated tax assessment before the normal due date for
corporation tax payment.
The reader whose question appeared (in edited form) on July 2 asked a
specific question, which we answered. It related to an existing situation,
so we did not deal with what arrangements might have been made instead. We
referred the reader explicitly to the company's auditor because we hope
there will be a shareholders' meeting with the auditor to discuss
modifications of the existing arrangements.
There are inherent limitations to a free advisory service, and we always try
to get readers to take advantage of professional advisers who are already
available to them. A brief suggestion of possible alternative arrangements,
based upon limited data, can sometimes do more harm than good - particularly
in a case like this one, where fellow tenants may have confliction ideas.
Our replies are tailor-made for each reader's particular circumstances, so
far as we can deduce them, and should not be taken to be of universal
application.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Traps for incautious taxpayers - The
Revenue can make mistakes and you should always check its figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW RADICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax returns are flowing into the Inland Revenue, most for the 1993/94 tax
year. But since the Revenue admits it makes mistakes, you should always
check the contents of the brown envelope.
You can easily get four separate assessments for one year's income:
self-employed earnings, employed earnings, untaxed income and tax income -
not to mention capital gains. While each assessment follows the same logical
outline, here are some points to watch for.
Income
Normally, this presents no problems for Schedule E (pay as you earn)
taxpayers as employers provide them with details of salary and benefits. But
all other sources should be checked carefully.
Allowances
Often, these are wrong. Ask yourself the following questions:
1. Does your assessment include your personal allowance (Pounds 3,445)?
2. If you are married, either you or your spouse should benefit from the
married couple's allowance (MCA). Does one of you have it? For 1993/94, it
is Pounds 1,720 for those under 65, Pounds 2,465 where the elder spouse is
under 75, and Pounds 2,505 where the elder spouse is 75 or over.
3. If you are over 65, you have a higher personal allowance (even higher if
you are 75 or more) provided that your total income is Pounds 14,200 or
less. Is this shown on your assessment?
4. Did you pay personal pension contributions or additional voluntary
contributions (AVCs) in the tax year? If you are self-employed, you should
get relief in the allowances section of your assessment. If you are an
employee, you will have had basic-rate tax relief when you paid
contributions, so you will be due further relief only if you are a 40 per
cent taxpayer.
If you are self-employed, half of your class 4 national insurance
contribution (NIC) - which is calculated separately at the bottom of the
page - is given as an allowance. But there can be errors. There is no Class
4 NIC on profits below Pounds 6,340 for 1993/94, so an assessment showing a
lower limit of nil is wrong.
Even if the line 'Amount chargeable to tax' is correct, you need to check
that the tax rates are right. For 1993/94, the first Pounds 2,500 is charged
at 20 per cent, the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent, and 40 per cent
thereafter.
The fun starts if you have dividends. There is no more to pay if you do not
fall into the 40 per cent band, but there are complications if your dividend
income straddles the 25 and 40 per cent bands. Your capital gains are
treated as the top slice of your income.
The bottom box on the assessment, 'Allocation of allowance and rates of tax'
can be confusing. You, the taxpayer, have the right to choose the way in
which you set your personal allowances against your income.
It will usually be to your advantage to set them off against the income
which is taxed earliest. If you are an employee, the Revenue normally will
do this for your through the Paye system. But in order not to raise
assessments for trifling sums, the Revenue usually will restrict your
allowances instead.
If, say, you are a married man with a salary of Pounds 40,000 in 1993/94,
taxed interest of Pounds 1,500 (net), untaxed income of Pounds 150, and a
deed of covenant in favour of your parish church for Pounds 100 a year, your
allowances total Pounds 5,165.
The Revenue probably will not assess the Pounds 150 but, instead, will
restrict the allowance on your Schedule E assessment to Pounds 5,015. This
will show up both in the 'Allowances etc' section and the 'Allocation'
section.
Gift aid
You can make donations to charities by deed of covenant or under the Gift
Aid scheme; these are allowable against your higher-rate tax bill. But
relief for a charitable deed of covenant is slightly complicated. You make
your gift net of basic rate of tax of 25 per cent. For tax purposes you have
paid Pounds 133, from which you have deducted Pounds 33 tax. If you pay
higher-rate tax, you get relief for your donation by having your 25 per cent
band increased by Pounds 133. So, your basic-rate band of Pounds 21,200 will
be increased to Pounds 21,333.
The effect of this is that you will pay tax at 25 per cent on Pounds 133 of
your income which otherwise would have been taxed at 40 per cent.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A business built on benchmarks - The
Professionals / Seeing how the experts look after their clients' money gives
an insight into managing your own better. That's the theory behind Joanna
Slaughter's series on private client investment managers. Today: Kleinwort
Benson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alastair Begg, chief investment officer of Kleinwort Benson Investment
Management, is not one for false modesty. 'We have one of the most
disciplined approaches to asset allocation for private clients that there
is,' he claims.
That approach has been refined and rationalised recently. In January, KBIM
produced three benchmark portfolios for private clients, adjusting the
weightings to reflect the needs of those seeking income, capital growth, or
a balance of the two.
The benchmarks were built around certain assumptions, says KBIM director
Andrew Gregory. These are:
That the minimum requirement for most private clients is maintaining their
assets in real terms.
That equities will perform better than bonds in the long term.
That the risk of a portfolio should be spread both geographically and
industrially.
Begg adds: 'The benchmarks are the rocks to which we hold fast. We make our
decisions around them.'
Take the benchmark portfolio for a 'balanced' private client. It has 15 per
cent in index-linked gilts, 10 per cent in conventional gilts, 45 per cent
in UK equities and 30 per cent in overseas equities, with the international
exposure weighted equally between Europe, Japan, the Far East and America.
Yet, KBlM's present market weightings for a balanced portfolio have far less
money invested in bonds (just over 7 per cent), a 60 per cent exposure to UK
equities, and a smaller exposure to Japan.
The KBIM policy committee has regular global strategy meetings. The last
policy decision it took was to sell some of its Japanese investments and
place them into the Far East. Such a policy shift is reflected within 72
hours in the portfolios of discretionary clients and the 10 per cent of
clients who are non-discretionary are alerted, too. Begg says this cannot be
done in 24 hours because each client portfolio has to be studied to see if a
capital gains tax liability will be triggered. For the same reason, there is
a similar time frame when changes are made to KBlM's list of approved
shares.
The list, based on recommendations by the firm's 12-member research group,
features 50 to 60 global shares and 25 to 30 in the UK. Interpreting it on
behalf of clients is the task of the 25 portfolio managers.
There is also a black-list of shares; this includes companies with opaque
accounts. Begg says: 'We never hold the shares if we can't work out what is
going on in the company because we can't research it.'
Although KBIM sometimes invests directly overseas on behalf of the very
wealthy - recently, it bought Philippines Long Distance Telephone for
private clients - Gregory says portfolio managers 'would not make that kind
of investment without putting in a basic fund first. If you want to invest
in emerging markets, or somewhere like Japan, the best way to do it is
through a collective scheme'.
KBlM is an enthusiast for emerging markets and uses its own offshore fund or
investment trust to give private clients exposure to this sector. Instead of
investing according to an index, the firm weights each of the 24 emerging
markets equally, on the ground that there is little or no correlation
between the performance of the individual markets.
When a market outperforms by a certain amount, the managers are forced
sellers; when it underperforms, they are forced buyers. Begg says the
strategy is unique to Kleinwort's emerging market funds and that the
diversity reduces risk.
KBlM's asset allocation and stock-picking disciplines do not mean that each
private client is dealt the same hand of cards. Begg says: 'You can't put
people into boxes, and there is no answer that is likely to be right for
more than one client. Where I think the value is really added is by
portfolio managers who have been here for a long time, who have known their
clients for a long time, and who listen to them and translate what they say
into a portfolio.' He adds: 'Death is our greatest source of client loss, by
quite a long way.'
Where appropriate, KBlM's portfolio managers use derivatives such as futures
and options. Gregory believes derivatives will become an increasingly
acceptable way of managing portfolios although he concedes that, as yet, 'it
is not something that a number of clients are very comfortable with'.
Although there is no hard rule about the acceptable size of portfolios, the
minimum annual management fee of Pounds 1,500 largely dictates the level.
Clients with less than Pounds 200,000 will be steered towards the firm's
unit and investment trust service.
Unlike many competitors, KBIM offsets fees against the commission generated
during the charging period. No fee is payable on holdings of Kleinwort
Benson unit trusts, offshore trusts and investment trusts.
Clients also can benefit from KBlM's unusual status as a bank in its own
right. It is regulated by both Imro and the Bank of England, and the
services of Kleinwort Benson Private Bank have been designed specifically
for clients with investment portfolios. Gregory points out: 'Clients can
place deposits and borrow from KBIM, so the quality of the service we can
offer is genuinely integrated. It gives us a very quick response to any
requirement that clients may have.'
KBIM is anxious also to emphasise that it is not interested only in the
super-rich. Gregory says: 'There is a common misconception in the outside
world that you cannot come through the door here without Pounds 10m. That is
not so.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Axe for bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some fixed-rate bonds, issued in recent weeks by building societies and
offering good returns, have now been withdrawn.
Chelsea building society withdrew its five-year fixed rate of 9 per cent
gross this week. Skipton has withdrawn its four-year fixed rate of 8.75 per
cent after only 12 days.
The term of the Newcastle Growth bond has been reduced from five years to
three, with rates starting at 7 per cent in the first year and rising to 7.5
in the second and 8.5 in the third.
Although these five-year fixed rates have been withdrawn, the societies
still have very good products to match National Savings. Britannia has a
one-year bond at 6.5 per cent to beat FIRST Option bonds.
A recent survey by Moneyfacts shows that an investment of Pounds 10,000 made
in building society fixed-rate products on July 1 would all pay out more
monthly interest that the Pensioners Guaranteed Income bond by the end of
the term. The leaders are Woolwich BS on the monthly option of its
Guaranteed Growth bond, and Halifax with its Stepped Income Reserve.
The Woolwich bond requires a minimum deposit of Pounds 1,000. This pays
monthly interest of 7.05 per cent in year one, 7.5 in year two, 7.95 in year
three, 9.3 in year four and 11.05 in the final year.
Guaranteed income bond rates have also held. These are of interest to
taxpayers as they are automatically paid net of basic-rate tax, which cannot
be reclaimed.
The top rate on a five-year bond at the moment pays 7.75 per cent net,
equivalent to 10.33 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Australia's star rises again - They
used to call it the 'lucky country' before recession struck and unemployment
soared. Now, though, recovery seems well under way. Inflation is low, the
growth rate is relatively high, the political climate is stable - and
prospects for overseas investors appear to be good

Never mind Australia's endless beaches and cuddly koalas. With a 5 per cent
growth rate, low inflation, and a stable political climate, interest is
turning towards Australia as a good investment prospect. So isn't the
country equally appealing in stock market terms? And shouldn't private
investors, looking to diversify funds overseas, take note ?
The answer probably is yes - but only with some big provisos. The first of
these relates directly to the economic situation. While the numbers look
good at present, there is much debate within Australia about the quality and
sustainability of the recovery.
This argument centres mainly on whether the nation is headed for a repeat of
the boom and bust cycles seen in the past, or whether a decade of economic
restructuring - including the continuing reduction in tariff barriers, some
deregulation of the labour market, and a major effort to introduce
competition into key sectors - has wrought fundamental changes.
The optimists - who include Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer - think
it has. Government forecasts say the economy should grow at more than 4 per
cent for the next four years; the budget deficit should reduce steadily from
ADollars 13.6bn this year to virtually nothing by the late 1990s; and the
underlying inflation rate should be pegged at around 2 per cent, at least in
the immediate future.
According to this scenario, a greater export focus by Australian companies
should allow the nation to piggy-back on the growing economies of south-east
Asia, while the successful outcome to last December's Gatt talks could boost
the farm sector significantly. By the time the provisions of the Uruguay
Round are implemented fully, the annual export benefit could be ADollars
1bn-plus.
The pessimists paint a very different picture. They note that the economy's
strength stems from a strong recovery in consumer demand. Business
investment, by contrast, remains weak, and actually dipped last quarter
while the household savings ratio is painfully low, too. All this, they say,
is potentially destabilising.
They feel that if capacity constraints are reached and investment surges all
at once, balance of payments problems could emerge. These would be doubly
serious because of the domestic savings shortage. The government could then
be forced into interest rate increases, tax rises  - or both.
Don Mercer, head of the ANZ - one of the country's leading commercial banks
 -says: 'My fear is that we are going to blow it again. Achieving a durable
economic upturn hinges on a substantial lift in investment, exports, and in
national saving.'
In the short term, perhaps, this debate need not worry a prospective
investor too much. Most analysts forecast strong profits growth in the
financial year that ended in June, and again in 1994/95 as restructuring
moves taken during the recession augment the upturn in demand.
John Baynos, strategist for stockbroker McIntosh Baring, thinks listed
companies could achieve an average 13.3 per cent return over the next 12
months; with inflation at such low ebb, this suggests a double-digit real
return.
Merv Peacock, head of marketable securities at the AMP insurance giant, says
he is looking at a 15 per cent annual growth in earnings per share for the
next two years. Nevertheless, the possibility of a 'blow-out' scenario down
the track does suggest that any investment funds committed to the Australian
market should not be left unattended.
A second, more technical, point is that the Australian stock market has
enjoyed a very strong run already. This began late in 1992 and continued
until early this year when the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates.
It is true that the Australian All-Ordinaries index has fallen by about 14
per cent since then. But the long period of unbroken progress means that the
historic price/earnings ratio on the index has climbed to around 17-18
times. This looks wildly out of line with the 1970s and 1980s when the
market p/e rarely exceeded 10-11 times, and was sometimes as little as 6-7.
Yet, as statisticians at the Australian Stock Exchange point out,
comparisons with the 1960s (a low-inflation era) are much more favourable.
Then, the market p/e stood at around 15-16 times earnings. In short, if you
want to believe the Australian market offers value, you probably need also
to believe that an era of modest price increases is here to stay.
For those investors undeterred by such caveats, some fund managers do think
the market's post-February weakness presents a good buying opportunity.
Offshore investors, moreover, may have the added opportunity of a currency
play. Australia remains weighted heavily towards the resources sector and
tends to see a close relationship between commodity prices and its currency,
with a rise in the former usually boosting the dollar.
Although commodity prices have moved off their recent lows - and have surged
in recent days - most forecasters see further improvements ahead as more
economies pull out of recession. 'I know some investors are playing the
Australian market largely because of the foreign exchange factor,' says one
fund manager.
So, as long as you are persuaded that this adds up to a plausible case,
where should you shop? A number of fund managers and analysts say they see
more value in the industrial sectors than the resources stocks, simply
because the climb so far has been most marked in the latter area. (Many
major resource companies, like Western Mining Corporation, saw their share
prices double between late 1992 and early 1994).
Baynos likes Australia's media sector because of such factors as its
exposure to the surging domestic economy and the potential for increased
advertising. He also likes the engineering sector and sees some selective
value left among resource stocks.
Peacock tends to concur on this point. 'Resource stocks run hard when they
run, and it would be a brave man who says that they won't run further,' he
says. But John Murray, head of equities at Perpetual Funds Management,
thinks that 'a fair bit of the resources game is over'. He reckons that some
of larger industrial conglomerates have been overlooked in recent months and
recommends the likes of BTR Nylex and Pacific Dunlop, both of which are
listed in London.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Where pensioners can find the most
for their money - The investment options for those over 65
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 160,000 people have put Pounds 1.39bn into National Savings
guaranteed income bonds for pensioners since the scheme's launch in January.
Holders over 65 get a 7 per cent annual return, paid gross (but taxable)
each month over five years, on deposits between Pounds 500 and Pounds
20,000. But those who cash in before the end of the five years must give 60
days' notice and they will lose 60 days' interest as a consequence.
Is this the best that pensioners can do?
Building societies
The table shows how the bond compares with some of the top-rated, five-year
building society bonds.
Escalator bonds, with interest rates rising each year, usually impose a
Pounds 2,000 minimum if interest is to be paid monthly but have a higher
upper limit than the pensioners' bonds - Pounds 500,000 or, occasionally,
Pounds 1m. Penalties for early redemption can be steep, however. The
Halifax's escalator bond has interest rates stepped from 6.95 to 10.95 per
cent, averaging 8.49 per cent over the five years.
Withdrawals are allowed only after two years, when the penalty is six days'
loss of interest for each full month left. But there is a maximum penalty of
Pounds 326 on a Pounds 10,000 investment.
After tax, the NS bond's 7 per cent is worth 5.25 per cent to a 25 per cent
taxpayer or 4.2 per cent to those on higher-rate tax. This compares with the
top-paying escalator bond - at present, from the Woolwich building society -
at 6.42 and 5.14 per cent net.
Guaranteed income bonds
These bonds are issued by insurance companies and pay out income at an
agreed rate - either annually or monthly, over terms ranging from one to
five years - on a minimum investment of (usually) Pounds 5,000.
Chase de Vere's Moneyline this week quoted five-year Gibs paying monthly
income at rates ranging from 6.54 per cent on Pounds 5,000 to 7.14 per cent
on Pounds 50,000.
The rates are better than the National Savings pensioners' bond, but
investors who cash in guaranteed income bonds before the full term can
expect to lose up to around 4 per cent of the initial investment as a
penalty.
Rates are quoted net of 25 per cent tax, which cannot be reclaimed by
non-taxpayers. Higher-rate taxpayers face an additional 15 per cent to bring
their rate up to 40 per cent, but this is based only on the net amount and
not on a grossed-up figure, as with building society interest paid net.
Some tax on the bonds is, effectively, deferred: investors can withdraw the
equivalent of 5 per cent of the initial investment each year 'tax free' but
this is adjusted at the end of the term.
Mark Bolland, of fee-based financial adviser Chamberlain de Broe, says that
this makes the bonds thoroughly tax-efficient for those expecting to drop
into a lower tax bracket by then.
Gilts
Gilts, or government fixed-interest securities, deliver a specific return if
held to maturity and pay income twice a year. But if you want to pull out
before they reach maturity, you could well make a capital loss.
Some index-linked gilts will pay a better return than the National Savings
pensioners' bond. Martin Riley, of stockbroker Henderson Crosthwaite, picks
out two:
2 1/2 per cent 2001s at a market price of Pounds 164 3/4 , against the
indexed value of Pounds 180.9, implying a real redemption yield over
inflation at 3.2 per cent to a 25 per cent taxpayer and 2.8 per cent to a 40
per cent taxpayer.
2 per cent 2006s at Pounds 167 against an indexed value of Pounds 203.8,
implying real redemption yields of 3.3 per cent and 3.0 per cent to 25 and
40 per cent taxpayers respectively - that is, 5.9 and 5.6 net at June's
inflation rate of 2.6 per cent.
A conventional (non index-linked) gilt, Treasury 6 3/4 1995-1998 priced at
Pounds 96, is yielding 6.24 per cent or 5.21 per cent, depending on the tax
rate, but there is no inflation-proofing.

<TEXT>
Australia is forecast by broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd to produce one of the
highest equity returns of any geographical area over the next 12 months. BZW
expects returns of more than 22 per cent in local currency terms over the
period.
It does, moreover, see the Australian dollar recovering from being one of
the cheapest currencies around relative to the pound - thus, the return
equates to about 38 per cent in sterling terms. This return projection is
bettered only by Canada.
BZW believes the industrial sector is particularly attractive and estimates
that it is 15 per cent below valuation.
For those wanting exposure to Australia, the choice among UK single country
funds is limited. There are only three unit trusts: Barclays Unicorn
Australia, M&amp;G Australasian and General, and NM Australia. Last December, NM
also launched a Smaller Australian Companies investment trust; this is
trading at a premium to its net asset value, reflecting a high degree of
demand.
NM was the UK arm of the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia
until it was bought by Friends Provident at the end of last year. NM
Australian is the largest of the three trusts, with about Pounds 36m under
management, and is top of the Australasian sector over five, seven and 10
years to July 1. But it has slipped more recently to second position over
three years, according to HSW (offer to bid, net income re-invested). Growth
over 10 years is 455 per cent and 85 per cent over five years.
It is the only one of the three trusts to be included in the Unit Trust
Analysis Guide produced by Fund Research. This measures the performance of
funds in terms of consistency and fund management experience, as well as
quantitatively. Unit Trust Analysis selects consistently high-performing
funds for the guide.
The NM unit trust contains 40 to 50 stocks, with the top 20 holdings
accounting for about 75 to 80 per cent of the investment. The fund manager,
Victor de Lorenzo, also manages the NM Gold fund and the NM Smaller
Australian Companies trust, as well as NM's Australian retail trusts.
Another way of gaining exposure to the Australian market is to invest in a
commodities fund, which will have exposure not only to Australia but also to
other mineral-rich countries, such as South Africa. But the spread across
continents does not mean these are any less volatile than a single country
fund - which means that it is not a good idea to have much more than 5 per
cent of your overall growth portfolio in these funds.
Mercury's Gold &amp; General unit trust has a consistently high performance
record in the commodity and energy sector over five years to July 1 (source:
HSW); about 30 per cent of the portfolio is invested in Australia. Waverley
Australasian Gold is a fund that is targeted more regionally; but while it
would have turned Pounds 100 invested two years ago into Pounds 315 today,
the same amount invested seven years ago would be worth only Pounds 57 now.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions - Body
Shop's big deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest transaction of the week was recorded at the Body Shop Group.
Started by Anita Roddick, and now run by her and her husband, Gordon, it has
seen its share price recover somewhat over the past 12 months.
The couple sold 3.5m shares to fund two projects they have underwritten. One
is to help research into the common cold and hay fever, the other a film.
But the Roddicks remain the largest shareholders and, even after the sale,
they retain a stake of more than 25 per cent.
Field Group supplies packaging for a host of brand leaders including
Cadbury, Chanel, McVities and Silk Cut.
The company came to market in July 1993 at 250p. The share price then rose
but has fallen back to its present 228p. Directors in the company all held
(and still do) considerable quantities of stock when dealing began last
year.
At that time, they undertook not to sell any of their shares until after
releasing the company's first full-year results. These were announced on
June 9; the shares were sold a month later.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors face hefty bills if they
pay late for shares - Norma Cohen previews rolling settlement, the new
dealing system which starts on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a year ago, the Bank of England announced the end of the two- and
three-week account settlement period for share deals. From Monday, private
investors will have to come to terms with the brave new world of 10-day
rolling settlement.
This means that each deal to buy or sell shares will have to be settled  -
either in cash or share certificates delivered - 10 business days later. And
make no mistake about it - being late will cost you money.
Private client stockbroker Capel-Cure Myers has taken to heart the
admonition of securities regulators to spell out in plain English the
additional costs investors will incur as a result of lateness.
In a pamphlet called 'How to Buy and Sell Shares Under Rolling Settlement',
the firm tells clients: 'If your money does not reach us by the settlement
due date, you will be charged interest on the outstanding balance, together
with a Pounds 20 administration charge.'
Moreover: 'Interest may be charged on all outstanding debit balances - for
example, rights, calls, fees and interest. It will be calculated on a daily
basis at UK base rate plus 3 per cent. We will advise you of any change in
the method of calculation.'
Capel-Cure's brochure might be a model of clarity but its charges are fairly
standard, as a quick telephone survey of stockbrokers found.
Killik and Co also will charge interest at 3 per cent over UK bank base
rates, although there will be no administrative charges. Senior partner Paul
Killik said that as long as the firm had the cheque in hand physically on
settlement date, it would not charge interest, even if the cheque did not
clear until a few days later. Killik noted, however, that 'we are not
advertising this fact' the firm is keen to encourage its clients to pay on
time.
Wise Speke, a Newcastle-based broker, will charge clients either 4 per cent
over UK base rates or Pounds 10, whichever is the greater. Albert E. Sharp,
a Birmingham-based broker, will levy clients 3 per cent above the base rate
charged by Bank of Scotland, where it holds clients' accounts.
Barclays Stockbrokers, meanwhile, has a different approach. 'If you are late
in paying, we simply debit your account,' says Justin Urquhart-Stuart, the
marketing director. The interest rate will depend on the overdraft rate you
negotiate with your branch manager.
The alternative for many clients, as brokers have pointed out, is to
establish a nominee account. This will certainly make life easier although
it is by no means 'free'. Wise Speke, for instance, will allow individual
clients to negotiate the cost with the account executive. Over the past
year, the firm has seen the number of its clients in nominee accounts
roughly double.
At Killiks, there is no charge at present for a nominee account although the
firm is considering levying Pounds 1.20 for each dividend collection
exercise.
At Albert E. Sharp, clients who do their own stock selection but wish to
have a nominee will need to have their shares organised into a portfolio.
There is a Pounds 200 annual fee for this and an additional charge equal to
0.1 per cent of the assets per year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham reports six-month results to June 30 on Tuesday and
analysts are expecting pre-tax profits for the second quarter of between
Pounds 272m and Pounds 282m. But particular attention will given to the
plight of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug; this used to be the group's biggest
product but its patents in the United States expired on May 17.
Wellcome, another pharmaceuticals group, reports four-month figures to June
30 on Thursday. The company is changing its year-end from August to December
so analysts have no comparable figure for last year. But sales of Zovirax,
Wellcome's biggest product, have been disappointing and analysts will also
be looking for signs that the sales decline in Retrovir, the HIV and Aids
treatment, could be bottoming out. Waste Management International, the
environmental services group, reports second-quarter figures on Monday.
These are expected to show continued growth despite the impact of the
recession in continental Europe. Analysts are looking for a rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 37m in the same period last year to between Pounds 40m
and Pounds 44m. There should be a good contribution from Wessex Waste
Management, a joint venture with Wessex Water.
David S. Smith, the paper, packaging and office supplies group, is expected
to report a continued recovery in profits when it announces annual figures
on Wednesday. Although first-half profits were down, analysts are
forecasting a full-year, pre-tax figure up from Pounds 27.1m to between
Pounds 33m and Pounds 35m. But earnings per share will show little change,
reflecting the Pounds 90m issue last year to pay for office products
wholesaler Spicers.
First Technology reports full-year results to April on Thursday. The group,
which designs and makes crash dummies and safety sensors for the car
industry, is expected to report profits of around Pounds 4m, up from Pounds
2.34m.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed-rate loans yield to cash-back
incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months ago, fixed-rate loans accounted for 80 per cent of new mortgage
business at the Halifax building society, which has 19 per cent of the UK
mortgage market. Today, the figure is around 5 per cent. While the change is
extraordinary, it is not hard to explain, writes Joanna Slaughter.
Long-term, fixed-rate mortgages virtually sold themselves earlier this year
because borrowers were paying less for a fixed-rate loan over three or five
years than they were for a standard variable rate. But upheavals in the
money markets have reversed this situation.
The borrower who wants a five-year fixed rate now has to pay a premium of
around 1.5 percentage points over the variable mortgage rate. As a result
long-term, fixed-rate mortgages have all but vanished.
Instead, cash-back incentives show every sign of becoming the mortgage
innovation of 1994. Dick Spelman, Halifax general manager, says: 'Cash-backs
are marginally more attractive to lenders than discounts. They are still a
good deal for the customer.'
Cash incentives - which are calculated as a percentage of the mortgage loan
 -were relatively modest, initially. But building societies are adept at
playing commercial leapfrog and it is now possible to get cash-backs of over
Pounds 7,000.
More generally, a welcome development is that mortgage lenders are moving
away from tying borrowers to an endowment policy or to a personal pension
plan and are allowing them an unrestricted choice of repayment vehicle.
Similarly, fewer lenders now make their own buildings and contents insurance
a non-negotiable part of a mortgage offer.
It is still possible to get 100 per cent advances. These can prove a
lifeline for house-owners who need to move but remain caught in the negative
equity trap. The Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland provide them
and others, such as the Household Mortgage Corporation and Skipton building
society, have 100 per cent schemes specifically for negative equity victims.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Cash in on mortgages - Lenders are
putting out some tasty bait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People often move house in spring, but recent building society lending
figures showed even fewer did so this year than last. As a result, societies
are waving wads of cash in front of potential customers. Depending on your
circumstances, these could make it worth switching to another lender - even
if you do not intend to move house.
Fixed rates
The table shows a selection by mortgage broker John Charcol of the better
deals on the market. Try to avoid compulsory buildings or contents insurance
unless you cannot get a better deal elsewhere. All fixed rates carry a fee
along with early redemption penalties; the latter make the cost of switching
to another lender very high and deter early capital repayments. Against
these disadvantages, you can balance the security of knowing how much
payments will be over a given period.
Variable rate: discount
The lender gives you a fixed discount on its standard variable rate for a
limited period. The largest discounts are for shorter periods.
Discounts are very attractive, so what is the catch? Most lenders will
charge early redemption penalties which exceed the discount period, so make
sure that their standard variable rate is competitive.
Charcol has just launched a mortgage combining fixed and discount rates.
Interest is fixed at 6.75 per cent until January 1 1996, followed by a one
percentage point discount on Britannia's variable rate until January 1 2000.
The fee is Pounds 299.
Variable: cash-back
If you need cash, lenders are offering it. But the Inland Revenue is still
deciding whether to tax such payments. In general, you should be able to
save more with a discounted rate than a cash-back but it depends on the
amount being borrowed and the cash-back limits.
Both discounts and cash-backs are so attractive that it is worth considering
re-mortgaging to get one or the other. Ask the lender how much it would
charge you to re-mortgage to see if the savings are significant. If you have
a fixed rate, though, the early redemption penalties make any savings
unlikely.
Pep mortgages
One of the most flexible and tax-efficient ways of saving to repay the
capital on an interest-only mortgage is through a personal equity plan,
which is free of income and capital gains tax. Some lenders are reluctant to
grant a Pep mortgage, but another way into one is through a Pep provider.
Some unit trust groups, including Fidelity and Prolific, have made
arrangements with lenders so that funds are available if you select one of
their Peps.
Consider investment performance and charges when you make your choice.
Large borrowers
High earners may want more flexible borrowing facilities than available on
the high street. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson has a mortgage management
account which offers a draw-down facility charged at the mortgage rate, and
a cheque book for minimum withdrawals of Pounds 1,000.
Interest on money withdrawn by cheque is charged at 1 percentage point above
the bank's variable mortgage rate of 7.25 per cent. The cash borrowed,
together with the mortgage amount, must not exceed 80 per cent of the value
of the home and the minimum salary requirement is Pounds 35,000.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: BES hits a snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dangers of property investment are highlighted this week in a letter
received by 3,900 investors in Johnson Fry's SCAT (Smaller Company Assured
Tenancy) business expansion scheme.
The BES gave investors generous tax breaks for investment in private rented
accommodation. Johnson Fry was the largest BES sponsor, and its SCAT scheme
carried the added attraction of insurance, provided by Eagle Star, against a
fall in the value of the property.
The investors went into the scheme in spring 1989 - just before the property
market collapsed. Johnson Fry estimates that the value of the fund's
property has fallen by about 25 per cent. But investors were covered only
for a drop in the property's cost and not for their full investment, of
which 10 per cent went into expenses.
Many investors now are keen to take the insurance and get out, but they
cannot do so until the properties are all sold. The prospectus says
disposals can take place between years four and six (1993-1995) but the
insurance policy document, which the investors, would not have seen, gives
March 1996 as the deadline.
Investors had to borrow their Pounds 10,000 investment to receive tax relief
of up to 40 per cent. Interest on the loans, provided by the Bank of
Scotland has been at 2 percentage points above base rates - 13 per cent at
the time - but subject to an 8.5 per cent minimum.
Those in a hurry to get out will soon be offered an escape route to cut
their losses with a limited offer from Eagle Star of about 84p for their
shares, leaving them to make up the shortfall on the loan. Others can choose
to hang on if Johnson Fry agrees some sort of claim settlement with Eagle
Star on a basis which will allow any future rise in property prices to
benefit investors.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Smaller companies sluggish - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smaller company shares responded sluggishly to the general recovery in the
UK stockmarket. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (capital gains
version) was 0.6 per cent higher at 1616.38 over the week ending July 14.
Over the same period the FT-SE-A All Share Index has risen 2.6 per cent. But
smaller companies have still held up better over the year to date.

Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society has decided not to appeal against
the recent High Court veto of the original plan to distribute the Pounds
1.8bn offered by Lloyds bank, which wants to take over the society. It is
confident that it can make an alternative proposal which will conform with
legal restrictions on which C &amp; G customers can receive sweeteners. This
plan is expected in mid-August.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Big boost for UK government bonds -
At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a slight set-back in late trading yesterday, UK government bonds
made strong gains this week as a more positive mood returned to European
government bond markets. The yield on the 10-year benchmark gilt fell back
by about  1/2 percentage point as prices rose by about three points.
During the week, the weakness of the US dollar encouraged some investors to
shift out of US Treasuries into European bonds. Gilts were also bolstered by
data pointing to steady UK economic growth with low inflation.
The Bank of England's successful sale of three new tranches of existing
gilts helped market confidence. Its next auction, on July 19, will be of
medium- to long-dated conventional gilts.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: Why the City is off its food - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most quoted company chief executives believe their share prices are too low.
But when Greg Hutchings bemoans Tomkins' modest rating he has a point.
The acquisitive conglomerate's record over the past ten years has been
exceptional, outperforming the pack in both good times and bad.
Since 1984 Tomkins has produced average annual growth in earnings per share
of 36 per cent, compared with the UK average of just 6 per cent. Dividends
have grown three times as fast. Yet its share rating is well below the
market average.
In part Tomkins is a victim of changing investor fashions. In the
buccaneering 1980s the dealmakers were king and investors were unconcerned
if all the acquisitions resulted in groups with widely disparate interests.
But these days investors are keener on companies with a clear business focus
and many conglomerates have been slimming to appeal to the new taste.
Tomkins is more focused than some of its peers - concentrating largely on
low technology manufacturing - and has a better recent record than the likes
of Hanson, BTR and Williams. Yet its shares trade at a discount even to
them.
The problem is simply that the City has gone off its food. Britain's
supermarkets are waging a bitter price war and sharing the pain with their
suppliers. Food manufacturers have seen their margins squeezed and watched
their share prices sag as a result.
Tomkins walked straight into the war zone 18 months ago when it paid Pounds
990m for Ranks Hovis McDougall. Suddenly, half Tomkins' sales were in food
and it was right in the middle of the bloodiest battlefield of all - bread.
The City took fright. RHM, which had been a poor performer for years, was
seen as a handful for anyone at the best of times. But for a company with no
experience of the food industry in the middle of a price war the deal was
regarded as extremely risky. Even more alarming, Tomkins was paying a price
that Hanson, Hutchings' former employer, considered over the top.
Mr Hutchings argued that Tomkins' expertise was in managing industrial
businesses not in making particular products. After all, it had known
nothing about handguns when it bought Smith &amp; Wesson or lawnmowers when it
acquired Murray Ohio but had made a success of both.
But the City was not convinced and since the RHM deal was first announced
Tomkins' shares have lagged the market by over a quarter.
Yet Tomkins has so far delivered everything it promised. In spite of the
bread price war and a disappointing performance from the Mr Kipling and
Cadburys cake operation, the RHM businesses contributed profits of Pounds
102.5m in the year to April. Of the healthy 14 per cent increase in group
earnings per share more than 4 points were thanks to the RHM acquisition.
And with the rationalisation programme only half completed there should be
more to come.
Tomkins' existing businesses also performed well helped by the buoyant US
economy, which provides half group profits, and tentative recovery in the
UK, which accounts for most of the rest.
With last week's figures Tomkins provided reassurance on another of the
City's worries - the impact of the fall in the dollar. The company revealed
that it has hedged this year's dollar profits at a rate of Dollars 1.48,
almost 7 per cent better than last year.
It also displayed a healthy balance sheet with net cash of Pounds 156m and
total shareholders' funds of almost Pounds 900m. While its poor share rating
precludes further acquisitions financed by share issues that balance sheet
could support a large deal funded by debt, though not on the scale of RHM.
Meanwhile analysts believe profits could rise from Pounds 257m to Pounds
300m this year putting the shares at 224p on only 12 1/2 times earnings.
Tomkins argues that the pricing pressure in food is no worse than it has
faced for many years in its other businesses. But it now looks unlikely that
the shares will be re-rated in the short-term until conditions start to
improve. When that happens the shares will have a lot of ground to make up.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: Foreigners return in force - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buy in July and hope they stay high was the equity motto of the week,
emboldening a nervous market and turning an old aphorism on its head.
Encouraged by rallying European bond markets, investors, particularly
foreigners, returned in force to London equities for the first time since
February. The FT-SE 100 index gained 112.4 points, or 3.8 per cent, on the
week to close at 3,074.8.
Playing by the old rule of sell in May and stay away cautious investors had
captured a good chunk of each year's gains over the past decade except last
year.
Last year the market rose 23 per cent from its July trough to its December
peak. This year, anyone rash enough to sell in May would be in just as much
trouble. They would have crystallised a loss of 18 per cent since the market
peaked in February if their portfolios tracked the FT-SE 100 index. They
would also be missing out on the recovery that appears to be underway.
The trigger was a switch by global investors out of dollar bonds into
European bonds. They were seeking some haven from the dollar which continued
to fall after the Group of Seven summit last weekend failed to offer it
support.
Gilts had a particularly good rally. They rose six days in a row up to
Thursday's close, their longest continuous improvement since their rout had
begun in February. The run stalled yesterday, however, when the Bank of
England announced it would sell long-dated gilts at its next auction. This
would appear to signal that the authorities believe yields will fall no
further, having reached a level appropriate to economic conditions.
In spite of yesterday's hiccup, optimism is running high in bond markets.
'False dawns have been seen regularly but this rally has a more positive
feel,' says the bond team at NatWest Capital Markets. 'Although still
regarded with suspicion, the much vaunted decoupling between US and European
markets has been seen.'
The optimism was reinforced by this week's UK economic data. June's headline
annual inflation rate was unchanged at 2.6 per cent and, minus mortgages, it
slipped to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent in May. Unemployment fell in June
for the fifth consecutive month and manufacturing employment rose for the
seventh time in 12 months. Construction orders in May hit a four-year high.
Spurred by the gilts rally and the economic outlook, equities enjoyed four
strong sessions through the week with the Footsie index gaining more than 40
points two days in a row. The keenest buying appeared to come, however, from
foreign rather than domestic investors. One London brokerage house said an
unusually high proportion of its commissions this week had come from the
Continent.
British institutions could still be cautious for several reasons: they have
remained well invested in equities through the first-half slide; they are
still feeling nervous about financial markets after suffering hefty bond
losses; index-linked gilts are still offering a high return relative to
dividend yields. These investors are unlikely to return with conviction to
equities until this key relationship tilts in equities' favour and markets
show some durable stability.
Continental investors have a different perspective, however, argues Ian
Harnett, chief economist and strategist at Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull. Valuations of the UK market look attractive relative to their home
markets. The prospective price/earnings multiple for the UK market is, for
example, the lowest of any major market; the yield relative between gilts
and equities is well below its five-year average, unlike in the US or other
European markets; the outlook for UK growth and inflation is positive;
sterling's recent fall against the DM and rise against the dollar will
increase the competitiveness of UK exports while helping to keep down
imported inflation.
German investors, in particular, appear to have been big buyers this past
week. All the positive factors about UK equities are true for them, with the
currency factor playing a big role. Many had exited from UK equities in
February when the market and DM/sterling exchange rate peaked. They had
liquidated their UK portfolios when the pound was close to DM2.60. Now the
pound is down to DM2.40, the Footise index looks as attractive to them as it
would to UK institutions at 2,700, Harnett argues.
A keenly-priced cross-border deal was also one of the main stories of the
week on the corporate scene. Tesco made an agreed Pounds 200m bid for
William Low, the Scottish supermarket chain. The purchase would boost the
English chain's share of the Scottish market from 7.1 per cent and fourth
place to 13.7 per cent and second place. J Sainsbury, the leading UK chain,
could spoil the deal with a counter-bid but such a move would be
uncharacteristic. Low became vulnerable to a takeover after discount chains
began to expose the high overhead it was trying to carry on a narrow
geographic base.
While the Tesco bid was driven by commercial logic, it could also indicate
that the stock market is again offering attractive enough values for a
resumption of bids. While the stock market rallied strongly from last July
to this February, many acquisitive companies complained valuations were too
rich to make takeovers practical.
One conglomerateur who could boast of success this week was Greg Hutchings,
head of Tomkins. His October 1992 purchase of Rank Hovis McDougall, the
baker and foods group, was much criticised by the market but in the year to
April results reported this week, RHM contributed at least four percentage
points to the 14 per cent rise in earnings per share. The only thing
Hutchings laments is that investors are still reluctant to buy Tomkins
shares in the hopes they will stay high.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: First the rethink, then the squabble - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester savers and borrowers have another nail-biting month
ahead of them. The society has abandoned its original scheme for dividing up
Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn. The scheme was vetoed in the High Court in June,
and C &amp; G has decided not to appeal.
It is, however, confident that it can produce a new scheme which will be
acceptable to members and lawyers alike. Details and a timetable are
expected in mid August. (See Section I of today's paper.)
All those scheduled originally to benefit from the division of the spoils
should keep their fingers crossed. Those who have most to hope and least to
fear are the savers with qualifying accounts who have held them for more
than two years.
Those with cause to worry are savers with less than two years' service and
borrowers. Their strength is that they account for roughly a quarter of the
votes, so C &amp; G is eager to have them on-side. But even if it would like to
find other ways of getting money into their pockets, its options are limited
 -particularly for rewarding borrowers. (See Section I for some
possibilities.)
Whatever the new plan, the danger is of a wrangle between voting members
with different interests; this could scupper the plan. As in some Victorian
melodrama, both legitimate heirs and illegitimate ones are waiting to see
who gets what from the overall estate. Once C &amp; G's last will and testament
is known, the squabble can begin.
Anyone unaware that rolling settlement starts on Monday must be blind, deaf
and dumb. Advent calenders pop out of every financial newspaper. But rather
less has been heard about margin trading - buying shares on borrowed money,
with only a small down-payment.
There are two reasons why it becomes an issue automatically after the death
of the old account system, which netted out all deals within a two week
account period.
First, the average period between dealing and paying will be shorter. So,
many investors may find it hard to settle on time.
Second, account traders - speculators who buy and sell within the account -
will have to find a new game. Under the old system, they hoped to make money
without putting any up in the first place.
The obvious alternatives under the new system are either switching to
futures and options, or trading equities on margin. But both types of
investment are relatively high-risk because they involve 'gearing' -
evocatively known as 'leverage' in the US, where both are common.
You put up only a small percentage of the value of the deal initially (the
margin), and hope to make a profit before the date on which full settlement
is due.
Like someone buying a house with a mortgage, you benefit disproportionately
if the price rises and suffer disproportionately if it falls.
British investors wanting to trade on margin may find the present situation
confusing, however. For, although the Securities and Futures Authority has
rules designed to protect investors, there are no rules telling brokers how
to handle the commercial side of margin trading.
For example: what interest rate to charge; what percentage margin to demand;
what securities to accept as collateral; how to value the collateral for
margin purposes; and what to do if a client breaches margin requirements.
Some brokers are avoiding the problem by suggesting that account traders
simply roll over a deal from one settlement day to the next. The official
line seems to be that a margin of around 70 per cent would normally be about
right.
One of the more aggressive brokers is offering minimum margins of 30 per
cent already. Others are still dithering at the starting post. A bit of a
good British bungle, what?
If you want a good example of gearing at work, look no further than the
coffee market. The price has moved from under Dollars 1,200 a tonne to more
than Dollars 4,000 this year. Most of the rise has occurred since late May
because frosts have damaged the crop in Brazil.
This is the kind of market about which commodity speculators dream. In their
dreams they are, of course, always on the right side of the trade. In real
life, though, not everyone can be on the right side of a trade. Here is what
might have happened to a couple of speculators.
First, the background. The price reached a temporary peak of Dollars 2,430 a
tonne on May 24, fell back to Dollars 1,875 on May 27 - just three days
later - and then began the long climb up to Dollars 4,000.
On May 24, the value of one futures contract (five tonnes) would have been
Dollars 12,150. A typical margin would have been around Dollars 2,500,
roughly 20 per cent.
Anyone who sold on May 24 and closed out the contract on May 27 would have
made a profit of Dollars 2,775. So, within four days, he would have made a
profit of more than 100 per cent on his actual investment. Anyone who had
bought at the top and sold at the bottom would have made a similar loss over
the same few days.
Now assume both our speculators had stuck with their original investment
until this week. The bull would have made a profit of Dollars 8,275, the
bear a similar loss. Gearing is a double-edged machete.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: A month is a long time in soccer - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Call it the World Cup Effect. Since the week the tournament kicked off on US
turf (real, not artificial) US shares have been on the slide. Now, with the
end finally in sight, stock prices have clawed their back to almost exactly
their level of four weeks ago. For stock market watchers, as for soccer
fans, a month can seem like a very long time.
The Soccer Cycle, to be fair, has coincided neatly with recent swings in
sentiment in the US over the outlook for interest rates. The fortunes of
their football teams may have influenced some Latin American countries'
financial markets, but the sport has not yet put down real market-moving
roots in the US.
A month ago, the dollar's plunge sparked a bond market retreat amid concern
that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to defend the currency.
The dollar may not have bounced back - it touched a new low against the
Japanese yen at the start of this week - but the relative stability in
currency markets of recent days and some promising economic data have set
the stage for a modest rally for both stocks and bonds.
The good news for the financial markets trickled out during the week. On
Tuesday, June's producer price index turned out to be better than expected:
the index remained flat during the month, compared with a general belief
that it would rise modestly (higher producer prices feed through eventually
into higher consumer prices, which leads to inflation and higher interest
rates).
On Wednesday, the producer price index for June matched expectations with a
small rise, while June's retail sales and the latest week's jobless figures,
released on Thursday, were generally seen as positive.
With this data out of the way, there is little on the immediate horizon to
trouble the markets (the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy-making
committee next meets in mid-August, but nothing seen in recent days is
likely to force it to shift its stance). And that has allowed US traders and
investors to focus instead on how the US corporate sector is faring, rather
the bigger macro-economic picture.
Two corporate events have set the tone. First, something to set Wall
Street's pulse racing: the promise of multi-billion dollar takeover battle
(or perhaps even two.) When CBS, the television network, agreed a takeover
of home shopping cable TV group QVC 10 days ago, both companies' shares
jumped. Last week, a rival bidder cable television bidder - Comcast -
stepped in to claim QVC.
The result: both QVC and CBS shares jumped again. There could be other
bidders for QVC. Also, CBS's attempt at a deal had revealed its own
weaknesses (both in its lack of cable TV interests and in management,)
exposing it as another potential takeover candidate. CBS shares were trading
at Dollars 312 at midday yesterday, up from Dollars 300 earlier in the week,
while QVC stood at Dollars 44.
Meanwhile, the reshaping of the healthcare industry continued apace. Eli
Lilly, the drugs company, agreed to pay Dollars 4bn for distribution company
PCS, while Kendall International, a medical supplies company, is to be
acquired by manufacturing group Tyco International for Dollars 1.4bn.
The second big moment of the week was the release of second-quarter earnings
from Chrysler. Coming at the very beginning of the latest US earnings
season, the car company's record post-tax profits of nearly Dollars 1bn (40
per cent up on a year before) appeared to confirm analysts' confident
predictions for across-the-board earnings advances. Chrysler's shares jumped
Dollars 1 3/8 on the news, to Dollars 51 1/4 , though by yesterday they had
retreated to Dollars 49 1/8 on profit-taking. Further strong earnings
reports in the coming days could do much to calm Wall Street's frayed nerves
of recent weeks.
Will it set the stage, finally, for the summer rally of which US investors
have been dreaming? A jump in share prices during the summer is a
traditional part of the US investment scene. Perhaps not surprisingly, talk
of a summer rally, which began in May, has resurfaced. The Dow Jones
industrial average yesterday lunchtime had retraced lost ground to 3736.98 -
just five points shy of where it was when the World Cup got into full swing,
and more than 100 points above its low of a fortnight ago.
All the same conditions are in place for shares to stage some impressive
gains as a month ago: no immediate fears over interest rates, a rebound in
corporate earnings, and the prospect of more big takeovers in the telecoms,
media, finance and healthcare sectors. Only, as the Soccer Cycle has proved,
it does not always work out that way.

FT  16 JUL 94 / The Long View: Jumping Jupiter]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the week of the end of the world, Freddie seemed surprisingly cheerful.
'My coffee futures positions are up 200 per cent this year,' he boasted.
'Never thought I would enjoy a bracing hard frost quite so much]' I should
have known better than to accept an invitation to the annual Candlestick
Charts Convention.
Scarcely had I emerged blinking from the session on combining candlesticks
with stochastic oscillators than inevitably (it seemed) Fringe Freddie was
there with the rasping voice, the gleam in the eyes and the overwhelming
enthusiasm for the latest esoteric investment pursuit. I was trapped. If
only I had a mobile phone that might conveniently ring . . .
'Stop writing all that rubbish about paper securities. Fill your boots with
commodities, dear boy,' he thundered. 'Bonds are fraudulent, equities are
dead.
'Mind you, when the fragments of Jupiter hit us we may be dead too, like the
dinosaurs 65m years ago when the comet came here. But just think what two
years with the sun blotted out would do to the prices of softs. Worst case
scenario, of course - but not priced into the markets at all.' Freddie
grinned happily at the prospect.
Presumably, I replied, he was referring to the imminent collision of
fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet with the planet Jupiter. More than
20 pieces of the broken-up comet would slam into the planet at a speed of
60km a second over a period of a few days, starting this weekend. But surely
scientists were predicting that the impacts would be unobservable from the
Earth, however uncomfortable they might be for any aliens who happened to be
domiciled on the wrong part of Jupiter.
Hardly had I said this, than I realised I was simply providing raw material
input for Freddie's conspiracy theory tendency. 'But what are the scientists
privately telling the world's leaders?' Freddie said. 'What we see in the
conventional media is a typical cover-up to prevent a global panic. Fact is,
there's a 50-50 chance that the outer layers of Jupiter will be blown off to
create a dust cloud that could reach as far as the Earth's orbit, cutting
sunlight levels by half for up to two years, and incidentally disrupting
other cometary paths. It's all been set out in the Astro-financial Letter,
but of course the establishment papers have been told to keep quiet. So buy
agricultural commodities, and while you're about it, short suntan cream
shares too.'
There was no stopping Freddie now. 'Haven't you wondered why they did
nothing at the global summit in Naples last weekend about the collapse of
the dollar? The answer's simple, they knew they didn't need to. When Jupiter
blows, the big agricultural producers like the US will hold the rest of the
world to ransom. The yen will be dead meat.'
Hold on, I said impatiently, Freddie should know he has a tendency for fads
and fashions to get the better of him. Last time we met he was heavily into
gold at, if I remembered correctly, about Dollars 380 an ounce. But it had
gone nowhere. Whatever happened to his theories about inflation and monetary
collapse?
'Only a matter of time,' said Freddie. 'The gold market has been rigged.
Haven't you also wondered why the bullion price has been so unnaturally
steady recently? There's been a secret deal between the Americans and the
Saudis: if the Saudis dump gold and help to hold the price down the
Americans will push the crude oil price up by buying for their strategic
reserve. Neat, eh?' But this was just another wild, unproven idea, I
protested. There had been so many in the past. What was it he had said on a
previous meeting about the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and the cloud of dust
which would cool the globe? But the temperature in London had hit 920 this
week. Now, it appeared, he was importing a cloud of dust from Jupiter to
replace the unreliable terrestrial volcanic variety.
'Jupiter is the icing on the cake, old boy,' he rasped. 'It's all happening
to commodities already. It only takes a cold front or two over Minas Gerais
state in southern Brazil to send the coffee price up threefold. Western
consumers have become complacent about commodity prices but they're on a
knife-edge. Coffee is still only half the price it reached in the 1970s. The
Third World is going to hit back.'
Don't bet on it, I said. The coffee bubble was a completely artificial
creation of the US commodity and hedge funds which had created a one-way
market. They were in league with greedy Brazilian farmers amd merchants
phoning in uncorroborated scare stories of killer frosts.
In any case, only half the Minas Gerais crop could be affected at maximum.
That was only 5 per cent of the global coffee crop. How could that possibly
justify a trebled price? Nestle and Maxwell House would not fall for such a
basic trick. In any case, just wait until the hedge funds started to rotate
into something else.
Freddie looked at me pityingly. 'This is just the start of the dash into
real assets,' he said. 'No one's woken up to just what the politicians are
doing. The Germans have given up controlling the money supply. Their M3 is
rising at 15 per cent a year and the Bundesbank is just laughing. Meanwhile
the Americans are hell-bent on devaluing the dollar to sustain the US
economy long enough to get Clinton re-elected in 1996. Gullible investors
are being stuffed with trillions in global bonds which the politicians plan
to repay in Micky Mouse money. I'd rather own Euro Disney shares, myself.'
Er, fascinating stuff, I said unconvincingly, but it was time for the
presentation on candlesticks and Elliott Waves. Perhaps we could meet later
for coffee?
'I can't afford to drink the stuff any more,' said Freddie. 'Much too
expensive. I've switched to tea instead.'

FT  16 JUL 94 / Confessions of a temporary sports writer: Jurek Martin, US
Editor, has spent a month covering the World Cup. The task, he admits, has
had a 'curiously restorative effect'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Unless encased in a time capsule, you know that the World Cup of soccer
stages its final tomorrow in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, near Los Angeles.
You will also know who it is between (Italy and Brazil), how they got there
and who their star players are.
You will also have got the impression that the whole tournament, held for
the first time in the US, has been quite a hit, on the field and off it. All
this you will know, even if you do not care too much, because the World Cup
has been inescapable for a month. As much as half the population of the
world may watch the final on television, which is more than can be said for
any other event, political, military or cultural, though the Apocalypse
might get good ratings if properly previewed.
What you cannot know, because it has never before been revealed other than
to a select few, is its impact on one person. If all politics is local, all
sports is personal, so here is a confession. I like sports. I watch quite a
lot of them and play quite a few of them, with degrees of competence ranging
from the sub-par (sadly not in the golfing sense) to the sub-human. But I
know an oshi-dashi when I see one; I recognise when the in-field fly rule
applies; and I have a well-thumbed collection of the very best sports
writing from Lardner through Angell to Boswell.
But soccer has never been kind to me, at least not since I was 10 and the
second highest goalscorer on the RGS Worcester prep school team (whatever
happened to Barry Dinsdale?). It has given me a broken nose and a metal pin
which even now runs through the medial epicondyle of my left elbow, an
impediment to the promising career of a slow bowler. For this and other
metaphysical reasons I have not kicked a ball in anger or design for 30
years.
Soccer had also begun to bore. The English game seemed brutal and the
international game, as in the last World Cup, tactically sterile. The
English stadiums were Victorian, the crowds ugly and the edge of
partisanship, local and national, unpleasant.
I found I did not care who won the FA Cup, the League Cup or the Nissan
Chocolate Coloured Peanut Cup. I once saw Gazza in the flesh - he was played
off the Highbury field in London in an under-21 international by someone
called Cantona but compensated by head-butting another Frenchman - and could
not understand what all the fuss was about.
So my heart did not initially soar like a hawk when it was suggested by the
power-that-be that because I was known to have sporting interests, and
because the World Cup was coming my way, I might like to take it on. It did
not exactly sink like a lead waistcoat, either, because a break from trade
wars and 'gates' beyond number had its charms, but the mental jury was still
out.
For a start, if you are going to cover anything, from goldfish racing to the
White House, homework is necessary, which is not easy to do in a country
where soccer has not necessarily outdrawn goldfish racing since Pele
retired. Of course, the game is played extensively, but not in places easily
accessible without a guide to suburban schools and public parks and not at
an instructive level, unless 'swarm soccer' (the term needs no explanation)
by six-year-old girls is the wave of the future.
Most countries are very insular about their sporting passions, none more so
than the US, though Sports Illustrated, the bible, did devote a page and a
picture to Brian Lara a few weeks back. Baseball has a 'World Series', but
only teams from North America are eligible and only two years ago did a
Canadian side actually win it (directly leading to the obliteration of the
conservative government in Ottawa).
There is no serious international competition for the US in American
football and none in basketball, either. When the US hoops team lost to the
Soviet Union in the 1972 Olympics, a hot war nearly ensued, only resolved in
the Gorbachev era when the best US professionals were allowed to win gold
medals by beating up teams from Senegal, or possibly the Ivory Coast.
So, as seen from the western side of the Atlantic in the months preceding
the Cup, the earnestness of the US organisational build-up was not much
help. Apart from Diego Maradona, Lothar Matthaus and Roberto Baggio - all
dutifully profiled - the players seemed indistinguishable, with the
exception of the US team, which was profiled to death.
In spite of this, the US did OK, making the second round and only losing by
a goal to Brazil. But any sane person's appetite for profiles over the last
month has been sated by those that accompanied the murder charges against OJ
Simpson, the former gridiron great, all of which tended to prove that the
qualities that make a fine football player do not necessarily relate,
whatever the image-makers may try on, to real life. So what if Baggio is a
Buddhist?
There were, of course, engaging diversions. But the technical challenges of
growing live grass in the enclosed Superdome in Pontiac, Michigan, can only
have seriously fascinated ardent horticulturalists. Equally, there was an
instant surge in the demand for computer and graphic designers able to
depict how to trap, head and pass a ball, but that I knew already from dim
memory.
Occasional controversy bubbled out of the organisation. Journalists were
asked to put down a Dollars 500 deposit for accreditation, which seemed
un-American. Worse, we were asked to agree to security checks into our
backgrounds, which seemed illegal. This requirement was only withdrawn in
the face of the sort of US media opposition that could have resulted in no
domestic coverage at all.
Then, although the dreaded British fans were not coming, fear of Norwegians
rendered crazy by reindeer meat past its sell-by date and of Koreans high on
kimchee prompted the announcement that security fences would be placed
around the perimeter of several venues, including RFK Stadium in Washington.
Local opinion was outraged. Why not heads on stakes or a moat filled with
piranhas, wrote Tony Kornheiser, the Washington Post's very funny columnist.
Meanwhile, in the real world of the baseball diamond, Ripken was closing in
on Gehrig's record for durability, Griffey was on a home-run pace to beat
Maris, and there were rumours, finally confirmed, that the great Valenzuela
would again be lured out of his Mexican fastness. No, life did not look
promising for me, the World Cup or the power-that-be.
Then it started. It began just a month ago in Soldier Field, Chicago, with
Germany playing Bolivia, an unpromising match-up if ever there was one, but
it was not half bad. Then it escalated - two, three, four games a day, a
cornucopia. Games could be caught in the flesh, on the box, in English and
Spanish (much better in Spanish, no language lessons necessary - the average
length of commentator Andreas Cantor's shout of 'Goal]]]]]]]' was computed
at 6.7 seconds).
There was drama, there was bathos, high play and low play, upsets and routs,
Maradona and the murder of a Colombian, red and yellow cards like confetti,
orange crushes and cold beers, heat beyond all belief, happy fans and sad
fans, painted fans and near naked fans but no violent ones, Arab princes in
robes and Armanis and Dutchmen in horns presumably borrowed from elks or
Norwegians.
And there was no need to go to the office: the stadium - or the couch - was
the office.
It has, in fact, been enjoyable - so much so that it is pointless to ponder
truly profound questions derived from the experience: such as whether
professional soccer can take root in the US (maybe, but it will still take
time); when Alan Rothenberg, the US organiser of the World Cup, runs for the
senate from California as a Democrat (he probably will not have the time);
or if a class action suit against adidas is possible for offences to fashion
(goalkeeping jerseys are now universally disgusting. At least Jorge Campos,
the Mexican macaw, designs his own).
Some gentler observations are possible. One will be heretical to supporters
of all the 24 qualifying teams and may even be antithetical to the whole
ethos of all sports, but it was passed on by one veteran English soccer
writer in a quiet passage of the Norway-Mexico game (ie, the first 85
minutes).
To avoid being lynched on his return, his identity must be protected, but
what he said was something like: 'It's wonderful England aren't playing. I
don't have to write about the bloody players, I don't have to write about
the bloody fans, I can sit back and enjoy the game and then I can write
about what I actually saw.' (One of his colleagues, he said, was assigned to
Ireland, the Anglo substitute.)
He is right. Having only the most marginal of stakes in the outcome (how
could anyone not root for an underdog, except possibly Greece, and then only
because of the political banners sported by their supporters?) helps one
appreciate the game.
A Moroccan or Belgian is obliged to think that Mohammed Al Deayea of Saudi
Arabia is the jammiest goalkeeper on earth, much as Brian Clough long ago
dismissed Jan Tomaszewski of Poland.
But the more-or-less neutral observer is free to conclude that no last line
of defence leaps higher, faster and wider, or has better hands.
Swedes must say that Romario's goal was not a patch on Kennet Anderssen's
lovely one in their 1-1 draw, but the eunuch may see that only the Brazilian
striker had the speed, balance and confidence to score in the way he did -
and would do so again.
Whole teams can be viewed either with dispassion or through the filter of
presumed national characteristics, or a bit of both.
There seems a joyful instinctiveness to close order Brazilian passing that
is as rhythmic as a samba but is offset by an anarchic disregard for
authority. There is a fierceness about the Bulgarian Stoichkov and the
Romanian Hagi that reflects their Balkan heritage, but also a creativity and
leadership that bespeak hope, unfortunately still rather confined to the
football field.
There was an ultimate sadness to the performances of Nigeria and Cameroon -
so much talent, so little direction, that cannot entirely be divorced in the
mind's eye from Africa's consuming problems. And if the Irish were just
honest plodders, what else is new?
But there have been moments of individual brilliance transcending the merely
national or the analytical. Saeed Owairan's goal for Saudi Arabia against
Belgium was story-book stuff for the ages, a few seconds of pure inspiration
to be compared with anything wrought by Pele and Maradona at their most
magical, or Bobby Thomson's immortal homer of 1953, or Desert Orchid's last
great race.
Like a birdie on the 18th hole after a round of rubbish, it was the sort of
moment that keeps you wanting to play or watch again and again, even a third
division match on a wet Wednesday in Preston.
Honesty also requires a final confession: there is something about this
sports writing which is a bit of a giggle. You can get away with free
association, cliches and flights of fancy, all of which are ruthlessly - and
usually correctly - excised from just about every other form of newspaper
reporting (apart from restaurant reviews).
You even dream about making Pseud's Corner in Private Eye, secure in the
knowledge that you will never qualify any other way. Not, as the
power-that-be should know, that it is anything other than a temporary
addiction.
Two forms of journalism probably constitute hell on earth - covering the
White House full time and only writing about sports - but an intermittent
binge on one or the other has a curiously restorative effect.
So, if you want me after Pasadena, I'll be in Camden Yards in Baltimore
watching Cal and the Orioles, or around the White House observing Bill and
Hills fend off, or not, sliding tackles from mean Bob and the God squad's
back four. For this alone, the World Cup deserves thanks.
You know the rest, or will by tomorrow night.

FT  16 JUL 94 / Blair targets Lords in pledge on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the runaway favourite to succeed the late John Smith as
Labour leader, committed the party yesterday to a sweeping constitutional
shake-up, including parliamentary reform, devolution and human rights
legislation.
In the last of six speeches aimed at the 4.5m voters in the leadership
election, Mr Blair promised 'a new constitutional settlement' in the first
term of a Labour government.
He also wanted to see the abolition of the right of hereditary peers to sit
in parliament.
He sought to exploit continuing concerns about the probity of the
Conservative government by pledging that he would insist on 'the highest
standards' of honesty and integrity from ministers and party officials.
Mr Blair's comments reflect confidence among his advisers that he will win
by a substantial margin when the results are announced at a special
conference in London on Thursday.
Friends say that Mr Blair has already begun to think about changes to the
opposition front bench team, although he has decided to delay a shake-up
until the autumn.
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, is increasingly confident
of victory in the race for the deputy leadership, which is also being
contested by Mrs Margaret Beckett.
Mrs Beckett, who was Mr Smith's deputy from 1992 until his death in May,
told the Financial Times in an interview that it was 'perfectly possible'
she might fail to win either of the leadership posts.
'I am used to going into elections that I might not win, and having to make
my case and abide by the judgment of the electorate,' she said.
Mr Blair said in Cardiff that government under both parties had become
centralised, bureaucratic and indifferent to the fundamental rights of
citizens.
He also sought to raise public concern about the impact of quangos (quasi
autonomous non-governmental organisations) by linking constitutional issues
directly to economic prosperity.
'People care that vast amounts of their money are being swallowed up by
quangos, to be spent on projects they know nothing about, by Tories they
have never voted for,' he said.
Mr Blair wants a long list of constitutional changes, including devolution
for Scotland, Wales and the English regions; greater powers for local
government; incorporation into domestic law of the European Convention on
Human Rights; and a Freedom of Information Act.

FT  16 JUL 94 / C&amp;G looks to bypass legal obstacles to Lloyds' merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society said yesterday it was confident of
devising a scheme that would enable the agreed takeover bid by Lloyds Bank
to proceed, without having to appeal against last month's High Court
judgment.
While C&amp;G believes the deal, heralded as overcoming the obstacles for banks
in taking over building societies, can go ahead, it also signalled that
there could be a delay in the timetable.
A restructured plan for distributing the Pounds 1.8bn offered by Lloyds and
a new timetable for getting the agreement of C&amp;G's 1.4m members, are now
expected to be announced in mid-August.
Yesterday's statement, which came a few days before the deadline for
deciding whether to seek an expedited appeal, is a sign that C&amp;G already has
an outline revision of the original scheme.
C&amp;G's task is to devise a lawful scheme giving the greatest possible overlap
between members who can vote and members who are eligible for cash payments.
The smaller number of those qualifying for payments means that the payments
themselves should be higher than originally intended.
Lloyds Bank shares rose yesterday after C&amp;G's statement to close 21p up at
557p, as the bank's strategy of expanding its share of the retail financial
services market appeared to be back on track. If approved, the bid would
create the fourth largest mortgage lender in the UK, supplying 7 per cent of
the home mortgage market.
The new scheme will have to take account of the decision by Sir Donald
Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, that cash payments could not be made to
investors of less than two years' standing, or to borrowers from the
society.
This confirmed the 1986 Building Societies Act which intended to stop
'speculative flows' between societies, by creating a class of members who
could vote on such an offer without being eligible for any immediate cash
benefit if it proceeded.
The very high voting thresholds required under building society legislation
for members to approve such a deal means that these votes could be critical
to acceptance of the proposal.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, and Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds Bank
chief executive, both expressed confidence in the deal.
The original schedule envisaged the deal being concluded in the second
quarter of next year.

FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: BT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT may retreat into its bunker following a survey showing that several of
its largest shareholders have a poor opinion of its top management. The
company may seek to comfort itself with the notion that the survey,
conducted by its stockbroker Cazenove, was clumsily handled and so not a
true reflection of opinion. Alternatively, it could lambast some
shareholders' comments for being flippant or criticise those interviewed who
did not know the names of top managers as ignorant.
But such a reaction to the survey, which was conducted over the past
fortnight, would be a mistake. BT has long suffered from a fortress
mentality, in part because it is still making the long journey from
state-owned monopoly to private-sector corporation. Indeed, one point made
by some shareholders is that BT is aloof. The right reaction would be to
lower its drawbridge and make a determined effort to address investors'
concerns.
Although the survey's results have not been published, those who took part
have spoken about their views. One message is that some are confused over
who is running the company. Sir Iain Vallance is both chairman and chief
executive, but Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, is seen by some
investors as effectively the chief executive. BT is such a huge organisation
that it will never be possible to say that a single person runs it. But its
vastness is also a reason for allocating responsibilities as clearly as
possible. If investors are confused, BT must enlighten them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any disappointment the market felt about the High Court judgment blocking
Lloyds' bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has proved short lived. C&amp;G's
confident assertion that it could find an alternative means of consumating
its takeover cheered investors yesterday. But the 4 per cent rise in Lloyds'
shares seemed a touch excessive given the market had long assumed the deal
would succeed. HSBC's strong showing and a general bounce in the banking
sector may have been the more influential cause of Lloyds' buoyancy.
As yet, there is little clue how C&amp;G will proceed. But the building society
did stop opening new accounts with voting rights soon after the judgment.
One way to get around the judgment would simply be to wait until all members
qualified to vote by having their accounts open for two years. But the talk
of concluding a deal by mid-August suggests that C&amp;G may have devised a more
elegant solution.
The details of the deal will make little difference to Lloyds. It has put
Pounds 1.8bn on the table and is only likely to change the form, not the
substance, of its offer. It would perhaps be better to defer payments as
long as possible rather than paying the full amount up-front. But either
way, the differences are marginal. Other banks with designs on building
societies will be keen to learn C&amp;G's secret formula. But whether it makes
sense for them to follow suit is debatable. The remaining targets seem less
attractive than C&amp;G. The take-out prices are likely to be steeper.

FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Share settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neither big investment institutions nor private shareholders have much to
fear from the UK stock market's move to 10-day rolling settlement on Monday.
The fortnightly account system which ended yesterday often demanded that
bargains were settled in less than 10 days. And while investors accustomed
to using the whole account as a period of credit will be inconvenienced,
that does not seem an unbearable price. The transition should be smooth so
long as brokers and shareholders of all sizes have their administration up
to scratch.
Yet 10-day settlement is not meant to be more than an interim stage. Early
next year, the settlement period will be halved. Whether the current
paper-based system can be compressed still further without causing
disruption is a moot point. Many institutions fear a sharp increase in the
number of failed trades and want the same stock borrowing privileges as
market-makers enjoy as a safeguard.
Life will be harder for private investors. The extended settlement periods
now being offered by some private client stockbrokers are helpful. But it is
difficult to believe these will endure. Most private investors will find
that opening a nominee account and depositing cash with a broker are the
only practical answers to five-day settlement. Other than the obvious issue
of cost, it would be a shame if nominee accounts spoiled the direct link
between companies and small shareholders. One can only hope that market
forces will bring about nominee services as slick and efficient as the
promised system of settlement.

FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Rebounding with bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market has had an impressive week, with the FT-SE 100 index
putting on over 100 points. Since the trough at the end of June, the index
has recouped about a third of the loss it had suffered from the peak in
early February. The big questions are whether current share prices are
sustainable and, indeed, whether the change in mood will be strong enough to
carry the market back to its previous peak.
The main factor behind the market's bounce has been the recovery in European
bond markets. Time and again economic statistics have reinforced the view
that there is so far no sign of inflation. This week's news on UK retail
prices and wage inflation was positive. European markets even took in their
stride the dollar mini-crisis which subsided in mid-week. It was possible to
argue that, with the dollar on a slide, European assets provided a safe
haven. And, following the depreciation of sterling against the D-Mark, UK
assets have started to look particularly cheap to continental investors.
If bonds maintain their poise, equities should have little problem holding
current levels. The market could even regain its previous peak if corporate
earnings shoot ahead when the reporting season begins in the autumn. But
bears see clouds on the horizon. Though inflation has not yet reared its
ugly head, it could just be hiding. Moreover, the dollar's recent recovery
still seems fragile. If its downward slide resumes, European asset markets
might have to review their recent indifference to what happens on the other
side of the Atlantic.

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Late rally enlivens
uninspiring day

Wall Street
In spite of lower bond prices, US share prices ended the week mostly firmer
yesterday, although it took a late rally in blue-chips to drag the market
out of its summer doldrums, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.56 at 3,753.81, at
its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also
rallied late to end up 0.74 at 454.15, while the American Stock Exchange
composite finished up 1.51 at 431.55, and the Nasdaq composite down 0.20 at
721.36. Trading volume on the NYSE was 275m shares.
The market opened in a subdued mood, in large part due to computer problems,
which delayed the start of trading on the Nasdaq market for almost
two-and-a-half hours. Sentiment, however, was affected by early declines in
the bond market and a modest drop in the value of the dollar against the yen
and the D-Mark.
The day's economic news was mixed, with a 0.5 per cent gain in June
industrial production warmly received but a jump in the June capacity
utilisation rate from 83.5 per cent to 83.9 per cent - the highest level
since June 1989 - deepened concern about inflation.
A mid-morning rally in bonds which temporarily pushed the 30-year yield down
below 7.5 per cent, failed to stimulate much interest, and the market
ignored a retreat in bonds later. It was only a last minute rush of demand
for blue-chips that added some respectability at the close of an uninspiring
day.
IBM fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57 as investors began to worry about the
company's second quarter earnings, which are due out next Thursday.
Other big technology stocks were also weaker, with Hewlett-Packard down
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 76, Compaq off Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 34 3/8 , and
Unisys Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 8 7/8 .
Hardest hit was Texas Instruments, which tumbled Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 80
1/4 after a big increase in second quarter net income to Dollars 184m failed
to satisfy investors, who were troubled by the company's forecast of a
likely moderation in the semiconductor market.
The decline in the stock hit other semiconductor issues, with Motorola down
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 49, National Semiconductor off Dollars 1/4 at
Dollars 17 3/4 and Dallas Semiconductor down Dollars 2 at Dollars 16 3/8 .
Altera, quoted on the Nasdaq market, dropped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/2
.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed with little change in moderate trading. The TSE-300
composite index was off 2.33 points, to 4,193.41. Winning issues led losers
today by 404 to 308. Volume was 53.209m shares and trading value was
CDollars 683.5m. Financial services and mining were lower, consumer products
and energy were steady and golds and industrial products were higher.
Brazil
Brazilian stocks pushed up after another poll for the October 3 presidential
election showed former economy minister Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso
cutting the lead of the left-wing candidate.
Growing confidence in his introduction of a new currency at the start of
this month, and the rise on Wall Street also helped the Bovespa index to
close 634 up at 40,799 in heavy turnover of 300m reais (Dollars 317.4m).

Johannesburg held on to strong gains on improved sentiment helped by a
firmer gold price and revised expectations of better corporate results. The

The Nikkei average rose for the third consecutive session helped by
stability in the currency markets, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed up 52.11 at 20,770.15, for a week's gain of 1.2
per cent, after rising to the day's high of 20,877.98 in the morning, before
falling to a low of 20,718.14 on profit-taking and position adjustment ahead
of the weekend.
Volume was 288m shares against 292m. Most investors were reluctant to
accumulate positions ahead of the weekend. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 3.95 to 1,668.47, while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.56 to
303.03. Advances led declines by 579 to 393, with 200 issues remaining
unchanged. In London, the ISE/ Nikkei 50 index was up 2.62 at 1352.88.
Some retail stocks were sought on restructuring efforts and the recent
return in consumer confidence. Sogo, a department store, gained Y70 to Y821.
Analysts said that although department store stocks had gone up
substantially already, there was still room for a rally over the next few
weeks.
'They're good for the short term trader, but for the fundamental investor,
clothing wholesalers are better investments,' said Mr Paul Heaton, retail
analyst at Baring Securities.
Electric cable makers were higher on reports of government investment in
fibre optic projects as a part of the government's information superhighway
development. Furukawa Electric rose Y18 to Y731 and Nippon Hume Pipe gained
Y52 to Y777.
Profit-taking depressed some issues which had rallied on Thursday: Aisin
Seiki lost Y60 to Y1,450 and Sony Y100 to Y5,950.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y6,000 to Y859,000 and East Japan
Railway gained Y5,000 to Y510,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 79.14 to 23,227.55 in volume of 29m shares.
Roundup
The steadier US dollar and interest rate outlook allowed markets in the
region to accentuate the positive.
HONG KONG rose 3.5 per cent on the day and 8.1 per cent on the week, the
Hang Seng index closing 308.74 higher at 9,117.02. Foreign funds poured back
into the market, and turnover rose from HKDollars 3.84bn to HKDollars
5.11bn.
Banks, about to report earnings, saw keen rotational buying interest, HSBC
rising HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 87.50, its Hang Seng Bank unit by
HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 54.50 and Bank of East Asia by HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 33.40. Properties continued their rebound.
SYDNEY noted a a continuing futures rally as the All Ordinaries index closed
50.3, or 2.5 per cent better at 2,058.0, 4.7 per cent up on the week in
turnover of nearly ADollars 600m. In futures, the September share price
index contract rose 58 to 2070 after a gain of 48 points on Thursday.
BANGKOK projected good second quarter finance and bank results and the SET
index jumped 42.80, or 3.3 per cent to 1,344.17, 4.4 per cent better on the
week.
Turnover was Bt15.2bn, its highest since February 1. Thai Farmers Bank
topped the active list, Bt7 to Bt133 after a 56 per cent rise in net
profits.
WELLINGTON ended with the NZSE-40 index 38.41 higher at 2,012.51, up 2.9 per
cent on the week.
TAIPEI saw late buying of financials and electronics push the weighted index
up by 102.89, or 1.6 per cent to a six-month high of 6,407.50 in heavy
trade, 3.5 per cent up on the week, turnover rising to TDollars 88.03bn from
Thursday's TDollars 84.86bn.
MANILA was lifted by the Central Bank's move to trim the level of required
reserves on bank deposits by three percentage points. The composite index
ended 47.07 up at 2,604.90, 0.8 per cent up on the week.
SEOUL, in contrast, fell on local news reports that banks had been told by
the central bank to refrain from stock investment.
The central Bank of Korea (BOK) denied the reports, but selling continued
throughout the afternoon and the composite index closed 8.49 lower at
950.23, almost flat on the week.

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Dow remains resilient in face of weak
dollar - The currency shock waves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every week, stock market strategists at US securities houses and banks send
out reports to clients and journalists outlining their views on the current
state of the financial markets and the economy, and the outlook for both.
Every possible factor that might have an impact on stock prices, bond
prices, and the economic environment is picked up, studied and commented
upon. You name it, they analyse it.
Yet, in the past few weeks, the one factor that has grabbed most of the
headlines, and dominated much of the talk among investors, politicians and
policy-makers - the rapid decline in the value of the dollar - gets
relatively short shrift in the majority of reports. The dollar does receive
a mention every now and then, but you would think from reading the material
that Wall Street's top equity strategists do not care greatly what happens
to the greenback.
In a way, you would be right. Unlike the UK, where the pound is not only a
key influence on the shape and direction of the economy but also a symbol of
national virility, in the US the national currency plays a significantly
less important role in economic life.
However, it has been clear in the last few months that the dollar's decline
has been disturbing the financial markets, especially bonds. Since the end
of March, when the dollar was holding relatively steady at around Y106 and
DM1.68, it has fallen 7.6 per cent against the yen (to a new post-1945 low)
and 9 per cent against the D-Mark.
Over the same period, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped from 6.95 per
cent to 7.67 per cent. Obviously, other factors such as monetary policy and
economic statistics influenced bond prices but the numbers provide a broad
indication of how the dollar can affect the government market.
The direct impact of a falling dollar is almost always greater on bond than
stock prices because investors in bonds fear that the drop in the dollar
will feed through into higher inflation and eventually force the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates to curb inflation and support the US
currency; and that the falling dollar will make US financial assets (that
is, bonds) less attractive to foreign investors.
Stocks do suffer because the price of bonds ultimately determines the
interest rates at which US companies and consumers borrow money, but they
suffer less than bonds because other factors, most notably corporate
profitability, play a bigger role in determining the value of stocks. Thus,
it is no surprise to discover that since late March, when the dollar began
to decline sharply, the Dow has fallen only 3 per cent.
One very good reason for the Dow's resilient performance in the face of
dollar weakness is that a lower US currency is not necessarily bad news for
stocks. When it comes to share prices, there are always good and bad points
about a dollar decline.
First, the good points. A weak dollar makes US products cheaper abroad,
boosting exports and corporate earnings. It also attracts more visitors to
the US, who spend their money on US products and services. Higher exports
and more tourism dollars in turn help to reduce the massive US trade
deficit. A lower dollar is also good for the earnings of US companies with
big overseas sales in Japan and Germany, because when they repatriate those
revenues they get more dollars for every yen and D-Mark spent on their
products.
As for the bad points. A weak dollar makes foreign products more expensive
in the US: this adds to inflation directly, and indirectly, because the
rising cost of foreign-made goods gives competing US producers the cover to
raise their own prices.
Also, a falling dollar is bad news because it deters foreign investors from
wanting to own US-dollar denominated stocks and bonds, something which has
contributed to the recent drop in share prices and the rise in long-term
interest rates as measured by bond yields. Finally, a weaker dollar is often
an indication that foreign investors do not like or trust US economic
policy, which should always be a worry for the stock market.
This is the point that Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers
in New York, believes is the key to understanding the impact of a devalued
dollar on stocks. He says: 'The most important implication of the dollar's
weakness for the stock market is the implied lack of international investor
confidence in US policies, the US economy and US financial markets. Hence,
the juxtaposition of a weakening dollar, weakening bond market and weakening
stock market have together formed the basis for concern.'
Mr Lipsky, however, believes that fears about the impact of the falling
dollar on US inflation have been overplayed, because the dollar has not
declined greatly on a trade-weighted basis.
In other words, in spite of all the headlines about a 'dollar crisis', the
US currency has fallen sharply only against the yen and D-mark, while
actually strengthening against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. And in
the list of US trade partners, Canada and Mexico rank first and third,
respectively, so talk of imported inflation is mostly just that - talk.
