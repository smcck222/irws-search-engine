FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: All eyes on the Federal Reserve - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is abundantly clear this morning that sentiment on Wall Street in the
final week of the third quarter will hinge on the outcome of tomorrow's
Federal Reserve policy session. It is much more difficult to divine how
investors will react to any decision forthcoming from Washington.
But analysts are not expecting stocks to make much progress in the short
term, whether or not Mr Greenspan and company come down in favour of an
immediate move to tighter money.
'The market is facing a lot of head-winds these days,' says James Solloway,
an analyst at Argus Research in New York and one of Wall Street's more
bullish pundits.
'It all comes down to the realisation that whether the Fed raises rates or
not, it's certainly going to raise them sooner or later, and the next time
won't be the last.'
The best hope of most strategists is that share prices can regain their
balance this week after hitting the skids since September 15, when the Dow
Jones Industrial Average came within striking distance of its record high of
3,978.
'The strength of the rally was an illusion, and there is now risk on the
downside,' says Robin Griffiths, technical analyst at James Capel Strategy
in New York.
What if the Fed opts to hold off on the cycle's rate increase, as a somewhat
shaken consensus of economists foresees? Mr Solloway says equity investors
will probably feel a mixture of relief and anxiety, with the latter
dominating.
If there is no action, bonds are likely to tumble. Traders are already
worried that the central bank has fallen behind the inflationary curve.
Though stocks have not moved in step with the Treasury markets in recent
weeks, a downturn in bond prices, and a concurrent increase in long-term
returns, will tip the balance more in the favour of bond investments.
'We are now reaching a point where the increase in bond yields is having a
negative effect on stocks,' says Mr Solloway.
What if the Fed decides to act immediately, as predicted last week by Mr
Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor who now serves as chief economist for
Bear Stearns.
Mr Angell, known for its hawkish stance on moving aggressively against
inflation, says there was a 60 per cent chance that his old colleagues will
vote to lift short-term rates by 50 basis points.
When the Fed acted in a like manner in mid-August, stocks surged, as Wall
Street put the best possible spin on an accompanying statement which said
the rate increase should 'be sufficient, at least for a time'.
A month later, pundits will not be as generous in their interpretations.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Confidence in earnings less secure - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week will not be an easy one for fund managers. It brings the end of
the year's third quarter with the three-month gain already whittled away to
not much more than 100 points; and 100 points is no gain at all in a stock
market which has suffered losses of 40 points-plus on more than one session
in the past fortnight. Also hanging over all fund trustees' meetings will be
awareness that the FT-SE 100 Index has to move quickly in the final quarter
to meet many year-end forecasts.
Chartists see support around 2,960 to 2,970, with some moving the line to
about 3,020. Such worries are tempered by the assurance from Derivative
Securities, the futures market specialist, that 'we now have an extremely
oversold situation'.
Deeper concerns over interest rates and the pace of economic recovery lie
beneath these technical considerations. Interest rate anxiety will be tested
early this week at the meeting of the US Federal Open Markets Committee,
while the Bundesbank stands by to provide further drama on Thursday.
Interest rate worries are reflected in the role of bonds in undermining
equities. European fund managers have been switching out of UK stocks and
into British government bonds, even though the outlook for gilts remains
questionable as long as further rises in base rates seem likely.
BZW points out that the gilt/equity yield ratio is at 2.3 times, underlining
the cheapness of gilts; but Strauss Turnbull notes that this ratio is close
to its 10-year average. Given that UK bonds hold the key to genuine recovery
in equities, and that many analysts believe that impending over-supply of
bonds is the problem, markets will watch Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2bn
10-year gilts with care.
If the interest rate side of the market argument is in doubt, the bull side
 -based on growth in company profits and dividends - has also become less
secure. 'Faith in strong earnings growth runs at least some risk of being
misplaced,' says BZW. And Kleinwort Benson Securities has become the first
UK house to bite the bullet and describe the market's median estimate of
earnings growth of around 14 per cent next year as 'grossly overblown'.
Cutting its 1995 earnings forecasts from 10 to 8 per cent, it says some
analysts are suffering from 'money illusion' and need spectacles tinted a
deep rosy pink.
This week can probably be set aside for window dressing ahead of the end of
the quarter and worrying about the FOMC. But the response to statements from
British Aerospace and Guinness, not to mention hints of downgradings of
Hanson, suggests confidence in earnings growth has been shaken.
If both the interest and the earnings growth side of the UK market equation
are under scrutiny, the year's final quarter could prove difficult.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Richter Gedeon response bodes well for
Budapest - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary last week kicked off what is set to be a busy fourth quarter in its
equity offerings with the privatisation of 33.4 per cent of Richter Gedeon,
the country's biggest pharmaceuticals manufacturer and one of its largest
exporters.
The sale, which is being combined with a capital increase, will net the
company Dollars 52.4m. It is expected to be one of this year's biggest
privatisations. Investment banks in Budapest said the strong foreign
interest in the offering underlined western investors' confidence in
Hungary, despite the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party, the former
communists, in May's general elections.
The international offering, to be followed by a domestic public offer of a
further 3.5 per cent of the company next week, involved the sale of 4.41m
ordinary shares priced at Dollars 12.30. Schroder, the UK merchant bank
which joint lead-managed the private placement with Creditanstalt
Securities, Budapest, said it had placed around 75 per cent with UK
institutions. Shares changed hands at Dollars 13.25 - Dollars 13.75 on
Friday, the first day of trading, the bank said.
The successful offering is good news for the Budapest Stock Exchange, on
which Richter Gedeon plans to become listed in the coming weeks. The
company, which made a gross profit of more than Ft2bn on turnover of
Ft11.2bn (Dollars 114m) in the first half of 1994, is also seeking listings
in Vienna and on the developing markets sector of Seaq.
Local brokers hope Richter Gedeon, which is set to become the BSE's largest
stock by market capitalisation, will inject more liquidity into the market.
Liquidity remains a problem for the exchange although it is improving.
The BSE which also trades government bonds and other securities, averaged
286 deals a day in the first eight months, well up on last year's daily
average of 94. Boosted by several new offerings earlier this year, shares
accounted for 29 per cent of total turnover by the end of August, up from 10
per cent last year.
Exchange officials hope the new issues and those planned for the autumn will
help double the BSE's market capitalisation to around Dollars 2.2bn from
Dollars 1.1bn at the start of the year.
Few companies have announced public offerings or capital increases but local
analysts say several are under preparation.
Janos Bartha, head of CS First Boston's local operation, says that he
expects a number of private Hungarian companies to come to the market in the
next six months.
However, state companies undergoing privatisation are still expected to
provide the majority of new offerings. Until now, trade sales have generally
been Hungary's preferred privatisation method.
Nevertheless, Mr Bartha says there are also state companies which have
restructured enough and which do not necessarily need strategic partners
which are likely to privatise via flotation.
Much will depend on the new government's privatisation policy which is
presently under discussion. The government has promised it will speed up
privatisation and its privatisation agencies say one way of doing this could
be more equity offerings.
In the meantime, the government is moving ahead with privatisation of the
state gas and electricity monopolies, on which it is being advised
respectively by Rothschild and Schroder.
In the first phase, AV Rt, the privatisation body, is planning to hold
tenders for minority stakes in the five regional household gas distribution
companies this autumn. MVM, the electricity company, would follow next year.

Investors will be keeping a wary eye on tomorrow's FOMC meeting, while Japan
could also be an influence, with a possible sell-down of Asian equities
accompanying its half-year end, writes Louise Lucas. Domestically, property
stocks will be in the spotlight as the developers announce their final
results, wrapping up the current reporting season. There is also likely to
be a spate of switching among Hang Seng index constituent stocks as
investors welcome newcomers, announced on Friday, to replace the five
Jardine stocks that are delisting.

The Nikkei index is likely to continue to fluctuate around the 20,000 level
in the week ahead, writes Emiko Terazono.
However, trading volume is expected to rise sharply as a last-minute rush to
realise profits on holdings boosts cross trading, or the selling and buying
back of stocks, ahead of the September book closing. The volume of cross
trades on the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya stock exchanges during the
April-September period is expected to total around 7.5bn shares, the highest
since 1991, with about 80 to 90 per cent of the trading during the latter
half of last week being attributed to cross trading.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Helsinki
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the market is bracing itself for the imminent onset of the
corporate eight-month reporting season, investors are becoming increasingly
cautious ahead of Finland's October 16 referendum on European Union
membership. Support for membership has fallen over Brussels' reluctance to
accept the farming support package.
However, Helsinki remains the best performing stock market in Europe this
year with the Hex index up 17.8 per cent. In dollar terms, the FT-A Finland
index has risen by 40.54 per cent this year compared with a 0.18 per cent
fall in the FT-A Europe index.
Helsinki retains its supporters, including Peter Lawrence at Kleinwort
Benson, who believes that the previous all-time high for the Hex of 2,009.5
is now within reach after five long years.
He says that international factors over the next few months could have a
negative impact on Finland, but thinks that the prudent 1995 budget and
stronger currency should limit the need to raise interest rates in line with
Sweden, for example.
'Our belief in the shorter term is supported by the inflow of funds into
domestic trusts, as well as evidence that foreigners are strong net buyers
of the market,' Mr Lawrence says.

With last week's austerity budget providing no surprises for the market,
attention has switched back to the corporate reporting season, writes John
Pitt. Alcatel Alsthom, due to release interim figures on Wednesday, has seen
its share price lose ground steadily this month. From around FFr600 at the
start of September the shares were trading by the close of trade on Friday
at FFr554, a fall of 7.6 per cent. Most of the selling has come from
international investors, while the telecommunications company has also been
dogged by allegations of corruption made in certain elements of the French
media.

The stock exchange will shrug off nearly 400 years of tradition when it
opens for business on Friday with a Fl 8m (Dollars 4.3m) computerised equity
trading system designed to increase Amsterdam's share of the market in Dutch
stocks, writes Martin Brice.
Currently, between 40 and 60 per cent of trades in Dutch stocks are made in
London.
Central to the development of the new system is a decision to change the
role of Amsterdam's time-honoured system of jobbers or hoekmen. In future,
they will concentrate on retail trades, and new electronic screens will
handle wholesale dealing.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Interest Rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlook for higher interest rates in the US and Germany will dominate
activity this week. James Capel reckons that the strength of the real
economy data over the last month points to a rise in rates at Tuesday's US
Federal Open Market Committee and it reiterates, ahead of Thursday's
Bundesbank meeting, that the underlying strength of German M3 over recent
months has indicated an inflationary risk from 1996 'and we therefore still
think German rates have bottomed'.
Kleinwort Benson rates the chances of a US rates rise after the FOMC as very
high and it expects the strength of the economy will force the Fed to raise
rates to 5 1/2 per cent by the end of this year, and 6 1/2 per cent by the
middle of 1995.
UBS, however, is sceptical about the need for a rise in US rates, saying
that the markets are exaggerating the extent of the US inflation threat, not
least because the tightening of policy seen so far this year has already put
in place influences that will limit the cyclical rise in prices in 1995.
It also expects the Bundesbank to leave official rates unchanged, saying
that policy is on hold until after the Federal election. Thereafter, further
disinflation may yet facilitate one final round of monetary easing.

FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Further decline in bund yields in
prospect - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funding concerns, inflation fears and weak US Treasuries recently propelled
German bond yields to new highs for the year. But last week's comforting
news on supply and inflation helped them recoup some of their losses, and
analysts say more gains are in store.
'We had some good fundamental data this week which challenged some of the
more sceptical prognoses,' says Armin Kayser, German economist at Swiss Bank
Corporation in Frankfurt. 'In view of these fundamentals, 7 3/4 per cent
yields began to make little sense,' he says. SBC expects bund yields to
decline to 7 per cent in the next three months and to fall to 6 1/2 per cent
by September 1995.
Among the good news last week were monetary data confirming continued
deceleration of Germany's M3 money supply growth and regional inflation
numbers below the 3 per cent forecast for September.
The supply spectre, too, began to appear less daunting after the publication
of the Bundesbank's issuance calendar for the final quarter. While another
DM35bn - DM45bn in government and Treuhandanstalt debt is expected this
year, only two long-dated government bonds are slated, with the rest likely
to be issued in medium maturities through tap sales.
All this has lent support to the long end of the German yield curve, causing
the yield on the 10-year benchmark bund to fall to 7.58 per cent on Friday,
from 7.70 per cent at Wednesday's close.
'With the better than feared funding calendar, the first cornerstone of the
expected 'post election/easing supply pressure rally' . . . has fallen into
place,' says Mr Stefan Schneider, chief economist at SG Warburg in
Frankfurt. He expects 10-year yields to fall back to 7 1/4 per cent in the
near term, before returning to 7 1/2 per cent by the first quarter of 1995.
Bunds also gained support from the Bundesbank's announcement that tomorrow's
new bund would take the form of a 10-year floating-rate note pegged to the
three-month Frankfurt Interbank Rate.
The market's reaction to this announcement was mixed. Some argued it
reflected the Bundesbank's problems of placing more supply at the long end
after recent difficult auctions. 'After the difficulties it had in placing 7
1/2 per cent Treuhand bonds in August, the Bundesbank may have wanted to
avoid the risk of offering a bund with an even higher coupon and still
finding no demand,' says Mr Schneider.
But others said the floater would ease the supply burden at the long end,
allowing the yield curve to flatten. Moreover, the issue is expected to see
strong demand from the recently established money market funds, which have
an enormous appetite for liquid, highly-rated money market paper. A further
advantage of issuing a floating-rate bond amid still-fragile market
sentiment is that it will prevent the futures selling that has preceded
previous fixed-rate issues.
'A floater entails lower price risk than a fixed-rate bond, and traders
don't need to sell futures ahead of the issue, which has undermined the
market in the past,' says one trader.
Some observers also say the decision to issue a floater may reflect the
Bundesbank's expectation that long yields have peaked.
'The Bundesbank has an uncanny knack of pinpointing the turning points in
the bund cycle, for example issuing 30-year paper when yields bottomed in
late 1993 and in 1986, and issuing FRNs in 1990 when nominal yields peaked,'
says Mr Troy Bowler, strategist at PaineWebber in London.
However, although the improving inflation outlook and floating-rate issuance
may lend support to bunds near-term, several risks remain: possible setbacks
in the US Treasury market amid continued monetary tightening by the Federal
Reserve; the forthcoming German wage round; and the German federal elections
on October 16.
The latter especially could spring a nasty surprise on a bund market firmly
expecting a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-FDP coalition.
Many market participants seem unaware that the complicated German electoral
system could enable the PDS, the former East German communist party, to
enter the lower house of parliament, even if it doesn't clear the 5 per cent
hurdle normally needed to win parliamentary seats.
Although the leader of the opposition social democrats has said he does not
intend to gain office through the support of the PDS, some feel he could be
swayed by the lure of chancellorship after the elections to establish some
sort of SPD-Green-PDS alignment.
Given these imponderables, those looking for further rate cuts from the
Bundesbank will probably have to wait a little longer. Even the rate for its
weekly securities repurchase agreements is expected to be held fixed at 4.85
per cent until after the elections.
'The Bundesbank is unlikely to cut rates over the next weeks with the
election, further Fed hikes and the upcoming wage round being potentially
destabilising factors,' says Mr Schneider.

The revival in the German economy's status - it is once again, in the
Bundesbank's words, an important motor of European growth - appears still to
be proceeding free of inflationary pressures.
September's preliminary cost of living data published on Friday was in line
with modest expectations. Longer-term price prospects also seem favourable
in the light of the moderate trade union statements in advance of the new
year wages round. The chemicals union, for example, let it be known last
week that its main aim will be to promote job creation rather than claw back
losses in real incomes when it comes to negotiate.
There was also good news on technical factors: above all, a further marked
decline in money supply growth.
All of this appears to consolidate the Bundesbank's relatively comfortable
position, in which it has the scope but no immediate need to cut rates,
least of all at this Thursday's routine central council meeting.
Against this background, German bonds recovered quietly near the end of last
week. Further improvement is expected, but the tendency among foreign
investors to reduce their involvement in the run-up to federal elections,
and nervousness about further monetary tightening in the US are still
preventing any build-up of momentum in the local market.

The main event for the bond market this week is Tuesday's Federal Open
Market Committee Meeting. The market has convinced itself that the Fed will
raise rates by another half point by the year-end. A minority view says it
will happen tomorrow.
There is still no real evidence of inflation at the consumer level. The
worry is rather that the Fed will react to recent rises in producer prices
and capacity utilisation, besides the continuing surge in gold and commodity
prices. The dollar also remains weak, not helped by last week's bad trade
figures.
Since a half point rise in the funds and discount rates is already in the
price, a Fed move this week might even be seen as positive. But the market
has to weather a further set of statistics this week: homes sales today,
consumer confidence on Tuesday, durable goods orders on Wednesday and
personal income figures on Friday.
For close observers of Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony to the Senate Banking
Committee last week, the danger signals may not be confined to the US. The
Fed chairman talked about the strength of global expansion, implying that
inflation pressures may be worldwide in character.
For those in the bond market who cannot quite believe inflation's 25-year
reign is really over, there will always be something to worry about.

FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Volatility puts fundraising on hold -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the UK home loans and banking group, last week became the
latest casualty of this year's sharp fall in world bond markets when it was
forced to postpone its proposed global bond offering due to 'terrible market
conditions'.
The postponement raises an obvious question: How badly has the extreme
volatility in the bond markets this year affected borrowers' funding
programmes?
Many borrowers have simply had to swallow hard and pay the high price of
borrowing in a bear market. Ever since the first rise in US short-term
interest rates in February, investors have been jittery about the prospects
of rising inflation and higher interest rates worldwide. Long bond yields in
the UK, for example, have risen from 6.3 per cent in January to around 9 per
cent.
Other borrowers, however, managed to complete most of their fundraising in
the first part of this year before yields reached their current dizzy
heights. Abbey National, for example, has already raised Dollars 8bn so far
this year.
'A lot of funding was done in the first few months of the year. With
interest rates at historically low levels, many borrowers were eager to get
as much under their belt as possible,' said one syndicate manager.
Other examples include the Province of Ontario, one of the world's biggest
non-sovereign borrowers, which is now 88 per cent of the way through its
CDollars 11.4bn borrowing programme for this year. Similarly, the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development has already managed to raise 80 per
cent of its Ecu1bn borrowing programme for 1994.
These borrowers can now perhaps afford to wait until conditions improve
before they have to tap the bond markets for any substantial amount again.
'We now have the ability to wait out the bad times. This year we were lucky
enough to anticipate some of the volatility,' said Mr Louis de Montpellier,
the EBRD's director of funding.
Other borrowers, particularly in the corporate sector, have simply not
needed to tap the bond markets this year, for two main reasons.
First, many companies have been keen to cut back on the amount of debt they
hold, in part to reduce their exposure to rising interest rates. As a
result, they have borrowed less.
Second, they have been able to find relatively cheap alternative sources of
finance. Put off by the high yields on long-term fixed-rate debt, they have
turned to short-term, private, highly structured means of borrowing, such as
the floating-rate note and syndicated loans market, both of which have seen
an explosion of activity this year.
'There is no doubt that most borrowing has been hampered this year, but what
has been bearish for one market has been bullish for another,' said one
dealer.
Floating-rate notes are a type of short-term debt offering a relatively low
variable rate of interest which moves to reflect changes in money market
interest rates. They therefore represent an obvious refuge for investors in
a rising interest rate environment.
As a result, as US interest rates headed upwards in the first few months of
this year, and as the fixed-rate bond market began to slow, there was a
flood of new FRN issues. Borrowers launched an equivalent of Dollars 34.1bn
in FRNs in the first three months of 1994, compared with a total of Dollars
17.1bn in the first quarter of 1993.
The syndicated loans market has provided companies with an extremely cheap
source of finance in the second half of this year. Having repaired the
damage done to their balance sheets by the bad debts of the late 1980s, and
with loans granted at the end of the last decade now close to maturity, many
banks have become very eager to begin lending again - and have turned
aggressively to syndicated loans.
'Banks are awash with capital and are hungry for new assets,' said one
syndicate manager in London.
Competition among banks for new business has driven the cost of loans down
to remarkably low levels. Over the last year, the spread over Libor on a
syndicated loan to a typical European corporate borrower, with a Single A
credit rating, has dropped from about 45 basis points to around 20 to 22
basis points. Last month, Spain borrowed Ecu6bn over five years at a spread
of just 4 1/2 basis points over Libor.
'Spain would not have been able to borrow such a large amount and at such a
low cost in the bond market,' said one syndicate manager.
This does not mean, however, that volatile conditions in bond markets have
become irrelevant. Many countries, particularly high yielding European
nations which were badly affected by this year's turbulence, still have
large funding programmes to complete. They will be returning to the bond
markets before the end of the year whether conditions have improved or not.
Other borrowers may wait for better conditions to prevail but this may prove
to be a very dangerous game to play.
'There is little chance that bond market conditions are going to improve
with a lot of supply still to come into the market and with European
interest rates heading upwards,' said one trader.
High yields may hurt but if the prospect is for them to move higher still,
it may be better to brave current conditions sooner rather than later.

Japanese government bonds were supported last week by the weakness in the
stock market and were little affected by the turmoil on the US bond market.
Bond prices also failed to react to the government's tax package announced
later in the week, since much of the detail was floated in the press before
hand.
But while last week's second-quarter GDP figures confirmed the expected
slack recovery process, investors have yet to start their trading for the
second half and are expected to remain sidelined this week.
Money market rates also reflect caution over a possible rise in interest
rates. Euroyen futures markets currently indicate that short-term money
market rates will rise from the current level of 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per
cent by the year-end and over 3 per cent by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, bond market participants will focus on the spate of economic
indicators released this week. August industrial output figures to be
announced this Thursday are expected to rise due to the hot summer and high
electricity demand, hence being negative for the bond market.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo expects production to have risen by 2 per
cent in August from a month earlier and a 1.8 per cent year-on-year rise,
the strongest since July 1991.

The key event of the week will be Wednesday's Pounds 2bn auction of stock
yielding 8 1/2 per cent and maturing in 2005.
Both Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International (Europe) and Mr Simon
Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities expect the auction to go well, since the
stock is likely to become a benchmark issue.
Furthermore, Mr Briscoe thinks the Bank of England will be able to launch a
further tranche of the stock at one of the later auctions this year.
A successful auction would come as a great boost to a market battered by the
recent rise in US Treasury bond yields and some poorish UK inflation
statistics. Ten-year yields have been trading around 9 per cent but Mr
Briscoe thinks gilts could now be due for a rebound.
The monthly meeting between Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank and Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has been brought forward to today because of
the latter's commitments to the IMF meeting in Madrid later this week. Few
expect a further base rate rise so soon after September 12's half point
increase.
In the absence of much in the way of UK economic statistics, international
markets will have a substantial influence, with traders watching closely for
the outcomes of meetings of the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank this
week.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazilian markets put faith in Cardoso
reforms - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Latin America's biggest economy goes to the polls next Monday its
financial markets, and especially Sao Paulo's roller coaster stock market,
hope to be toasting Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Brazil's next president.
The market is betting that Mr Cardoso will speed up privatisation and
introduce fiscal reforms to underpin Brazil's current stabilisation plan,
which has brought monthly inflation down from 50 per cent in June to below 5
per cent at present.
Such reforms are likely to lead to strong, perhaps explosive, growth for the
equity market and a big increase in capital raising by Brazilian companies
as economic stabilisation triggers pent-up consumer demand.
If, as polls suggest, Mr Cardoso wins more votes than the other candidates
combined on Monday, a run-off ballot in mid-November will be avoided and Mr
Cardoso would enjoy a strong mandate for change.
But Sao Paulo's volatile stock market, the fastest growing Latin American
market this year, is likely to fall in the short term if the election goes
to a run-off ballot, which would probably pit Mr Cardoso against the
left-wing Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.
Mr Cardoso is leading Mr da Silva by more than 20 points in the polls,
largely due to the success in tackling inflation of Brazil's new currency,
the real, which Mr Cardoso steered through Congress while finance minister.
Market optimism about the real, which is linked to Brazil's foreign exchange
reserves of around Dollars 40bn, led Sao Paulo's main index to climb by 65
per cent in dollar terms in July and August, although it has since
stabilised as investors take profits. Over the year the index is up by about
90 per cent.
One of the spurs to the growth has been growing foreign investment, which
has boosted trading volumes and is expected to increase if Mr Cardoso wins
the election.
Net foreign investment in the stock market this year reached Dollars 5bn by
the end of August compared to Dollars 5.5bn for the whole of 1993 and
Dollars 1.3bn in 1992. Market capitalisation was Dollars 163bn at the end of
August.
Although foreigners account for only about 20-25 per cent of trading
compared to more than half in Mexico, a taste of what may occur under a
Cardoso presidency came last month when there was a record net inflow of
Dollars 1.5bn to the stock market from overseas and volume averaged Dollars
500m a day as a Cardoso victory seemed increasingly likely.
Despite shares' recent appreciation and the fact that many are now trading
at above their book value, the potential for growth is still huge and could
reach 300 per cent under the four years of a Cardoso presidency, according
to some bullish brokers.
They point to Brazil's internal market of 150m consumers, a strong and
competitive private sector and an economy that is operating at well below
capacity.
To tap this potential, say reformers, there needs to be more privatisation
combined with an overhaul of Brazil's precarious public finances, its
unwieldy tax system and a social security programme under serious funding
pressures.
Analysts believe that even though Mr Cardoso's left-of- centre Social
Democrats will not have a majority in Congress, they are expected to pick up
seats there and in state elections. This, combined with Mr Cardoso's
electoral allies in the rightwing Liberal Front party could provide a
platform for change.
Mr Sergio Goldman, an associate director at financial house Bear Stearns'
Sao Paulo office, highlights government-controlled giants like the telecom
company Telebras which could be privatised.
'A privatised Telebras would be expected to make a return on equity of at
least 10 per cent instead of the 3 per cent it will probably show this year.
That would mean an increase in profits from Dollars 500m to over Dollars
1.5bn,' says Mr Goldman.
However, given Brazil's fragmented political system and opposition to
radical change in some areas, such as government-controlled companies,
analysts are unsure about how quickly reforms will occur. Some bankers are
also cautious about equities growth, even if reforms are adopted.
Mr Wayne Perkins, a vice-president at Brazil's Banco Norchem, expects shares
to be bullish but says many of the expected reforms have already been
anticipated by the market, and that equities are now at a record high and
overvalued on several measures, including expected return on equity.
Among the sectors expected to outperform the market, he says, are those in
areas like food, clothing, retail and electrical goods aimed at poorer
consumers who are likely to benefit from increased purchasing power with
lower inflation. Previously these consumers, who did not have savings
accounts, saw their salaries eroded daily by inflation.
But Mr Perkins stresses that stock picking will be the key as many shares in
these sectors have already shot up in value this year in expectation of
stabilisation.
The retail chains Lojas Americanas and Casa Anglo, for example, are now
trading at four times their book value per share, he notes.
Analysts also predict a big increase in share issues by companies looking
for investment capital. Because of Brazil's economic problems and low equity
prices companies have not been increasing share capital. There has actually
been a reduction in the number of listed companies in recent years. But that
scenario should change if the economy is stabilised.
A rising stock market is expected to prove more attractive than the small
local bond market or the international debt markets for companies seeking
capital.
To exploit the promise of underwriting fees for equity issues and initial
public offerings as well as opportunities in the growing American depositary
receipts (ADR) and mergers and acquisitions markets many foreign investment
banks have been opening offices in Sao Paulo.
Those companies are confident that even if Brazil's stabilisation attempt
fails this time round, the country will tackle its economic problems sooner
or later.
According to a New York-based banker, the question is not whether reforms
will happen but when they will happen: 'There's a lot of pressure for change
in Brazil. If the real currency fails there will be a crisis and that will
make the need for reforms even clearer.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch for dollar moves -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Possible interest rate rises and trade negotiations will be the key factors
motivating the markets this week as the dollar comes under scrutiny.
Currency traders will focus on tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open
Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the US Federal Reserve Board, as
speculation mounts that growing fears of inflation could prompt further
monetary tightening.
Although some analysts believe the Fed may hold its fire at tomorrow's
meeting, an earlier rather than later rate rise seems on the cards. Such a
move might lend some support to the dollar, though the US currency could
also follow bond markets, which would not respond well to a rate increase.
The markets will also be increasingly vexed by the trade negotiations
between the US and Japan as the September 30 deadline for sanctions looms
close on the horizon. If the governments can avoid sanctions, it should be
positive for the dollar. Analysts are sceptical, however, that a full
settlement will be reached.
Inflation, unemployment, retail sales and industrial production figures from
Japan could also prejudice market views on the strength of the yen against
the dollar, but traders should focus primarily on trade rather than domestic
issues.
In Germany, the markets will turn their attention to the Bundesbank meeting
on Thursday, although expectations of interest rate movements are subdued in
advance of the October 16 general elections.
Following yesterday's state poll in Bavaria, the markets will be concerned
about the performance of the liberal Free Democratic party, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's junior alliance partner.
The markets will want to gauge the possibility of a coalition between
Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Social Democratic party.
Following last week's relatively strong performance by sterling after a raft
of positive statistics, the markets may lend a softer tone to the pound in
the absence of any notable data releases.
The markets will also be watching Monday's meeting between the UK Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of
England governor, for signs of policy changes.
Investors may also watch for comments from world officials in the run-up to
Saturday's Group of Seven meeting and next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

FT  26 SEP 94 / The Markets: Welfare and the family - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1991 there were some 1.3m one-parent families in the UK, containing 2.2m
dependent children. In that same year, according to the Department of Social
Security, around a million of these parents (overwhelmingly women) were in
receipt of income support. Thus, more than three-quarters of single-parent
households depend on benefits, which supports the proposition advanced two
weeks ago ('Marital economics', September 12 1994), that 'most women cannot
bring up their children unaided'. In the absence of a specific man, the main
body of citizens must take up the burden.
By partially socialising the costs of child-rearing, the welfare state has
made the rapid growth of single-parent families and unstable couples
feasible. This does not mean, as crude conservatives are prone to argue,
that women have children just to obtain benefits, such as housing.
Nevertheless, where once economic realities would have forced an unmarried
girl to give up a child for adoption, now she can try to raise her child on
her own. Strikingly, the rate of teenage conception in England and Wales has
increased, from 57.1 per thousand girls in 1981 to 65.3 per thousand in
1991, notwithstanding provision of contraception and sex education. This is
an example of incentives at work.
Similarly, where once a man who abandoned his family knew they would starve,
now he knows they will survive, if miserably. Insurance changes behaviour.
That is what the phrase 'moral hazard' means.
Men with relatively poor earnings opportunities (of whom there are more now
than 20 years ago) are competing with the state as providers of resources to
the mothers of their children. Many of them come out a poor second. Equally,
the welfare state subsidises serial polygyny. Well-earning men have been
able to leave much of the burden of supporting their first families to the
state, while women also find it easier to dump men who fall short of their
desires.
These developments are not without drawbacks. One is the effect on children,
particularly boys deprived of any model of masculine responsibility. The
feminist view that women can bring children up better on their own seems
peculiarly self-defeating. For what role in life are these mothers preparing
their sons?
Another drawback is the effects on the public budget. In 1992-93 support for
lone parents amounted to Pounds 6.6bn, an increase of 170 per cent in real
terms since 1978-79. At 1 per cent of gross domestic product, this is not a
budget-breaking sum. But it is increasing rapidly. It is also far from
trivial, being as much as the Department for Education spends on higher and
further education in England.
There is also substantial pressure to spend more, largely because the lot of
welfare-supported single-parent households is a decidedly poor one. One such
demand is for 'affordable child-care'. But the provision of subsidised
childcare merely changes the form of the subsidy to lone parents. By tying
the subsidy to work outside the home, it also skews the mother's choice in
that direction. The state would then provide the childcare, which is what
women offered within traditional families, while the working mother would
play the traditional male role.
Greater state support for single-parent families can be encapsulated as a
move towards socialising traditional male roles. But there is an
alternative, embodied in the 1991 Child Support Act. This is to re-privatise
that role, but without the father's presence in the family.
'The assumption that, in broken marriages or partnerships, taxpayers should
assume the financial responsibility for the family is, at long last,
challenged,' wrote the House of Commons Social Security Committee in a
report on the Child Support Agency published at the end of last year.
'In making this change a second fundamental reform is brought about. The
essence of the change was to move from a legal system dealing with child
maintenance on a case by case, discretionary basis to an administrative
system which assesses all maintenance according to the same criteria, with
the aim of achieving higher levels of maintenance.'
It all sounds very sensible. But, in practice, the Child Support Agency has
tripped over three main obstacles: first, men have found to their horror
that the basis on which they had planned their lives has been overturned;
second, subsequent families have found themselves deprived in the interests
of first ones; third, first families benefit only if the increased support
does not substitute for the Treasury's funds, whereupon the latter loses
out.
The underlying problem, however, is that there is simply insufficient money
to go around. The novel patterns of child-rearing would be impossible
without substantial support from taxpayers. Furthermore, since more state
support is the only demand on which those directly affected are bound to
agree, that is also what is likely to happen.
The CSA will probably prove a blip on a curve showing a progressive rise in
the socialisation of the costs of child-rearing. There will also be a
corresponding increase in the net burden on those who stick to traditional
mono-gamy, as the fiscal benefits of marriage decline and the scale of
support for lone parenthood increases. Even if the CSA were to succeed, it
would merely make second families less viable, so increasing the number of
mothers forced to look to the state for their main support.
The long-term social consequences of all this I leave to the reader's
imagination.

FT  26 SEP 94 / The Markets: No hiding place - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The risk that the US economy is not slowing sufficiently in response to
eight months of monetary tightening is the greatest threat to current levels
of US bonds and equities. The markets' anxiety that Federal Reserve open
market committee, meeting tomorrow in Washington, will choose to put up
interest rates again, brought the Dow Jones industrials index down by 100
points last week.
Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, however, it is hard to see
equities progressing much in the short or medium term. If rates do rise
tomorrow, it is possible that bond yields, already at 8 per cent, would not
rise much further. But it is unlikely that bond yields would decline
steadily and stay down until domestic demand has slowed for several
quarters. Even then, the risk remains that the strength of recovery in other
countries will boost US exports and drive commodity prices higher, producing
inflationary pressures in 1995 and 1996 despite the slowing of domestic
consumption.
There are, certainly, reasons why the Fed might want to wait rather than
raise rates again so soon. Recent indications of an upturn in consumer
spending have owed a good part to car purchases; meanwhile, the build up of
inventories has raised fears that demand in some sectors is slowing. But
even if the Fed does not move tomorrow, it is too early for markets to yet
assume that its tightening has finished. Some brokers, such as Goldman
Sachs, have been arguing that fears about the strength of the US economy
have been overstated, and that markets are now set for a 'relief rally'. It
is hard, though, to find grounds yet to think that any such rally will be
prolonged.
European cyclical stocks
US nervousness has spread to European markets, already jittery on
expectations that the European interest rate cycle has turned and that
earnings expectations are too high. Nonetheless, ahead of this week's batch
of half-year results, which includes figures from benchmark European
companies, the markets appear determined to salvage some cyclical stocks
from the implications of rising interest rates.
In periods, such as the present one, where rate rises are triggered by
higher than expected growth in output, cyclical stocks can continue to
generate earnings surprises, so the case goes. The attempts are valiant, but
remain vulnerable to anything but a limited rise in rates.
Fiat
Fiat, which declares half-year figures on Thursday, is a case in point.
Advocates of the Italian automotive and industrial group have caused the
price to outperform the Comit index by 2.5 per cent in the past month, by 8
per cent in the last quarter and by 52 per cent in the last 12 months.
They are right to point out that in the group's recovery from last year's
worst-ever losses, it has restructured and cut costs rapidly. Its balance
sheet is also less vulnerable than that of many Italian companies to a sharp
rise in interest rates. Its capital spending has peaked, while the pickup in
cash generation and its rights issue have brought debt down to some 30 per
cent of shareholders' funds.
However predictions of a rapid and sustained upturn in profits are based on
assumptions about strong growth in sales, particularly of the new Fiat
Punto. Those hopes rest heavily on Fiat's performance in markets outside
Italy which make up 40 per cent of its automotive division.
In its drive for market share, Fiat has benefited from the lira's weakness,
which has helped it fight off domestic competition as well as penetrate
foreign markets. But analysts suspect that this sales drive has squeezed
profit margins. If that is right, Fiat may find it hard to push up prices
while European consumers fear higher interest rates. Moreover, with high
operational gearing, the group remains vulnerable to a sudden slackening of
demand.
Given those factors, the special circumstances of its recovery seem
inadequate to detach it from the fortunes of a volatile and precarious
Italian market.
UK building materials
Similar questions can be posed about the argument that some UK building
materials companies are worth buying because their wide spread of businesses
will prolong their earnings growth beyond the sector's normal cyclical
slowdown.
Half-year results from Tarmac tomorrow and Redland on Thursday are expected
to show that the collapse in demand for building materials between 1989 and
1992 in the US and UK has sharply reversed. But by now, that improvement is
well in the price. If they can do no more than confirm that pattern, their
attractions are limited, and in Redland's case, rest principally on its 6
per cent yield.
However Redland, more than many in the sector, derives its earnings from a
wide spread of countries. These results will help show whether it can keep
its German profits rising fast, and can also drag its French profits back
towards the level it expected when it bought Steetley.
Within those two factors is a plausible story that the company should be
distinguished from the sector. But it is not a robust one if European
interest rates continue to rise for an extended period. The case in favour
of Redland depends - like the arguments in favour of Fiat - on a sustained
upturn in many countries, but one that does not prompt renewed inflationary
pressures. That is a narrow window through which to try to thread an
argument in favour of even the most resilient cyclical stocks.

FT  26 SEP 94 / The Markets: Base metals under scrutiny - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals analysts will be watching early trading at the London Metal
Exchange with particular interest today.
After a week of mixed rises, followed by consolidation, further strong
advances on Friday and, in late trading, widespread though moderate trimming
of gains, they will be anxious to ascertain whether leading contracts are
coiled for a resumption of the run-up or due for a shake-out.
Just before business ended on Friday, figures were released showing that
Russian exports of copper, aluminium and nickel were running well above 1993
levels in the January-August period. It was those data that prompted the
paring back of the week's advance, together with an inevitable element of
profit-taking.
But today's performance should show whether the speculators who returned
late last week to push copper prices to 25-month highs and aluminium prices
to 3 3/4 -year highs are ready to take their profits.
By common consent fundamental supply/demand factors suggest that LME metals
are set for further, in some cases quite substantial, gains. But the
question is: when?
During the present extended uptrend the LME copper price first ventured
above Dollars 2,500 a tonne, for the three-months delivery position, in
July. That was in response to a sudden rush of US investment fund buying,
however, and many analysts were dubious that the line could be held through
the northern hemisphere summer shut-down period. Their doubts were quickly
justified - the price held above Dollars 2,500 for just a few days. A second
attempt a few weeks ago was equally short-lived.
But the price has now been in the Dollars 2,500-plus area for 10 out of the
last 11 trading days, and with the shut-down season over there is less
obvious cause for caution.
Aluminium's position is similar. After a week of Dollars 1,600-plus trading,
and with LME stocks falling at an increasing pace, further gains could well
be on the cards, traders say.

bottling deal

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola is to buy control of a bottling venture in South Africa in
partnership with a group of black South African investors, writes Mark
Suzman in Johannesburg.
Under the deal, the value of which has not been disclosed, Coca-Cola has
established a joint venture with the Kunene family, long-time Coke
distributors in the black townships east of Johannesburg, to purchase
control of Vinto Minerals, one of seven major Coca-Cola bottling plants
countrywide. It has annual turnover of about R50m (Dollars 14m).
Coca-Cola and the Kunenes will each take 50 per cent of a new investment
company, Fortune Investment Holdings, which will purchase Vinto. The Kunenes
will take over management of Vinto.
Coca-Cola withdrew from investment in South Africa in 1986 and announced its
formal return to the country last June when it repurchased Natbev, the
country's biggest Coke bottler and distributor. The company's products
dominate the South African soft drink business, with over 77 per cent of the
domestic market.

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine prompts Hang Seng
shake-up
</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hang Seng Index will receive one of the biggest shake-outs in its recent
history in November with the replacement of four constituent stocks. This
will be followed in February with another round of switching, this time
affecting three shares.
The changes were sparked by the de-listing of the five companies in the
Jardine camp. From March 31, only Jardine International Motors will remain
listed.
The Jardine group is withdrawing its secondary listing over regulatory
concerns which analysts believe mask a deeper fear about the post-1997
administration.
The group is currently the focus of an attack from Beijing, which wants to
see the Jardine consortium ejected from a key container terminal project.
On November 30, Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings
will be withdrawn from the Hang Seng Index, one month before they quit the
exchange.
At the same time, Lai Sun Garment and Winsor Industrial Corporation will be
withdrawn following their under-performance of the market.
The four will be replaced with Amoy Properties, Guangdong Investments, whose
interests span securities, travel and transport, hotels and property,
Johnson Electric Holdings and Oriental Press Group, the newspaper and
publishing group.
On February 28, the remainder of the decamping Jardine companies - Dairy
Farm International Holdings, Hongkong Land Holdings and Mandarin Oriental
International - will be replaced by Shangri-La Asia, the hotel group
controlled by Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok; Sino Land, the property
company chaired by Singaporean Robert Ng; and South China Morning Post
(Holdings), Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper now also under
the control of Mr Kuok.
According to the latest stock exchange figures, the departing stocks are
worth a total HKDollars 161.4bn (USDollars 21m) while the newcomers
represent HKDollars 143bn.

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank mulls UK move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON, NORMA COHEN and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, is on the verge of a decisive
build-up of its equity business in the City of London.
Executives at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell, its UK merchant banking
subsidiary, dismissed reports that a decision on the expansion would be made
as early as this week.
Deutsche Bank said, nevertheless, that it was in regular discussions on the
issue and said: 'Our base for European equities would be London.'
Mr Hilmar Kopper, spokesman for the bank's supervisory board, said: 'It
would have to be expanded, and I do not think it can be expanded out of
Frankfurt.'
The main issue to be resolved is the role that Morgan Grenfell, which
Deutsche Bank purchased in 1990 for Pounds 950m, will play in the German
bank's broader strategy in investment banking.
Morgan Grenfell said it would play a major role in helping to build up
Deutsche's equity business. 'We can assist in the process,' said Mr Michael
Dobson, chief executive of the UK merchant bank. The link would also allow
the two entities to use each other's relationships.
Nevertheless, senior officials at the UK merchant bank are believed to be
jealous of their independence of action and identity. 'Morgan Grenfell is a
fantastic name,' said one executive at the firm. 'What would Deutsche
Grenfell sound like?'
Morgan Grenfell said the success of the existing relationship was attested
to by the merchant bank's financial results. The company made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 235.8m in 1993, an increase of 194 per cent on the
previous year.

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Management changes at Bollore
Technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A management shake-up at Bollore Technologies, the diversified French
industrial group, is due to be confirmed at the group board's meeting later
today, following the news on Friday of a change in chief executive.
Bollore Technologies clarified a leaked report on Friday that Mr Jean-Paul
Parayre would be replaced by Mr Bernard Esambert as its president. However,
the company indicated that the change - likely to be the result of the
former's differences of opinion with Mr Vincent Bollore, chief shareholder
in the group - was relatively amicable.
An industrialist with long experience at Peugeot and Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez, Mr Parayre was only made head of Bollore Technologies in
January.
However, the group statement said that Mr Parayre had been able to carry out
'earlier than foreseen' the necessary restructuring required, among other
things, by January's devaluation of the CFA franc in French Africa, where
the group does much of its business.
Mr Bollore and Mr Parayre therefore agreed the time had come to 'put a new
structure in place'.
Giving credence to this is the fact that Mr Parayre is not quitting the
group, but swapping places with Mr Esambert as manager of Albatros, the
holding company which controls the industrial group.
Mr Parayre is also said to have turned around the group's performance,
putting it into profit in the first half of this year after its FFr357m loss
in 1993 as a whole, and selling assets to reduce its debt to FFr5.8bn.
However, one of Bollore's main bankers is the hard-pressed Credit Lyonnais,
which may be pressing its client in turn for further debt reductions.
It may be thought that Mr Esambert, a banker by trade, will give more weight
to financial considerations that his predecessor.

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Multimedia strategist takes on
Time Warner - Tony Jackson on the appointment of Norman Pearlstine as
editor-in-chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The press release 10 days ago announcing Mr Norman Pearlstine's appointment
as editor-in-chief of the US media giant Time Warner contained one curious
and revealing sentence. The challenge for Mr Pearlstine, it said, was 'to
preside over the explosion of our journalistic creativity . . . into
multimedia forms'.
In more innocent days, the job of presiding over a group of magazines
ranging from Time and Fortune to Sports Illustrated might have been enough
to get on with. It is also one for which Mr Pearlstine, a former editor of
the Wall Street Journal, is eminently qualified. But the clincher, it seems,
is what he has been doing for the past two years: setting up and running his
own multimedia investment company.
His appointment is a clue not only to developments in the magazine world,
but to Time Warner's wider strategy. The company has been in the news lately
for its rumoured interest in buying all or part of the NBC television
network. The link between broadcasting and programme production is at the
currently fashionable end of the multimedia spectrum.
Such a deal would also be very expensive. Since the magazines are less
fashionable but still highly valuable, there had been speculation that they
might be sold. The terms of Mr Pearlstine's appointment plainly suggest
otherwise.
Mr Pearlstine's two years in the investment game do not seem to have been
particularly productive, a fact which he proposes as a lesson in itself.
'I think the most valuable thing I may bring is some caution and scepticism
on where the true opportunities are,' he says. 'I must have looked at 400
opportunities in the past two years, and I didn't see that much to excite
me.'
This caution may partly be a matter of policy. Mr Pearlstine is the first
outsider ever to be appointed as Time's editor-in-chief. Besides, though his
name is already on the door of his new office, he does not take over
officially until January 1. 'I'll never know more about this company than I
do now,' he says. 'The more you learn, the more complicated it gets.'
He has discovered, he says, that each of the magazines in his stable is well
advanced with its own multimedia plans: whether on-line services allowing
Time readers to quarrel with the editor by E-mail, or one-off CD-ROM
publications by Sports Illustrated.
'One thing I have found is that Time Warner is as far along this road as
anyone in America,' he says.
What if Time Warner's rumoured interest in a broadcasting network were to
bear fruit? 'In that case, I can see more readily how (editorial) content
would move back and forward. I can also see how instant polls through TV or
on-line (personal computers) could play into the publications. But I don't
think giving Fortune and Time reporters camcorders and sending them out to
get material for TV would be very useful.'
Beyond that lies a wider problem. The essence of print journalism is getting
the right words and the right stories into a scarce amount of space. The
point about personal computers and the Internet, by contrast, is that it is
theoretically possible to call up everything that is known on any
conceivable topic.
'I haven't seen a good working business model for that yet,' he says. 'How
you work out a model that handles an infinite capacity for information
rather than scarcity hasn't been addressed yet.'
Traditional journalistic skills may prove his main qualification after all.
'As much as I'm fascinated by new media, and as much as it's a plus for an
editor-in-chief to know about it, the bulk of the job is looking after the
print magazines for the foreseeable future.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Minerals side lifts BHP in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian resources group, yesterday
announced a first-quarter profit after tax of ADollars 372.5m (USDollars
275m), compared with ADollars 316.1m in the same period last year. The
result was lifted by a near-50 per cent improvement in profits from its
minerals division.
Total revenues during the period increased by 7.9 per cent, to ADollars
4.48bn, while basic earnings per share rose by 12.7 per cent to 26.7 cents.
Although the figures were in the middle of the range of original market
forecasts, some analysts had upgraded their estimates after BHP released a
strong August production report earlier in the week.
After-tax profits on the minerals side rose to ADollars 227.4m from ADollars
152m. BHP said the improvement reflected the consolidation of the Ok Tedi
mine in Papua New Guinea, where it recently raised its stake by buying out
the Amoco interest, together with higher shipments from the Escondida mine
and higher copper prices. Partly offsetting these benefits were lower US
dollar prices for coal, iron ore and manganese.
Profits from the steel division were little changed at ADollars 139.5m. BHP
said that Australian operations improved their performance but there was a
lower result from BHP New Zealand Steel, due to renovation work.
Petroleum profits rose by ADollars 9.7m to ADollars 143.3, due to better
results for the Hawaiian operations and higher sales volumes, which offset
lower realised oil prices and unfavourable exchange rate movements. Profits
from the service companies fell to ADollars 10.9m from ADollars 18.7m.

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades Daimler Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has downgraded its
long-term debt ratings on Daimler Benz and related entities to AA - from AA,
and has changed the outlook to stable from negative. Some Dollars 5.2bn of
debt is affected.
According to S&amp;P, 'the rating action reflects increasingly difficult
industry fundamentals within the European automotive industry and the
continued weakness within developed world aerospace markets'.
Daimler's two main units are Mercedes-Benz, the motor vehicle manufacturer,
and Dasa, the aerospace group.
Daimler Benz did not seem overly worried by the move. A spokesman told
Reuters news agency that 'debt rated AA - has a very strong capacity to pay
interest and repay principal, and differs from the highest rated debt only
to a small degree'.
Despite a 6.8 per cent increase in European new car registrations during the
first six months of 1994, S&amp;P said it expects long-term demand to slow as
European markets approach saturation.
At the same time, increasing economic unification suggests that automotive
market conditions will be subject to more cyclical fluctuations while
competition among players is intensifying as a result of the elimination of
trade barriers, the agency stated.
Conditions within global aerospace markets also remain weak, S&amp;P said.
However, while long-range conditions in Daimler Benz's core automotive and
aerospace markets will remain challenging, S&amp;P said, it assumes group
operating profitability will improve over the next two to three years in
line with European economic recovery and as a result of recent product
launches and the group's rationalisation and restructuring programmes.
Some analysts felt the rating came at an odd time.
'It seems rather late in the day to be downgrading Daimler, seeing as it
appears to have weathered the storm and is on the mend,' said Mr Roderick
Hinkel, German strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.
Daimler Benz reported operating profits of DM926m (Dollars 600m) for the
first half of this year compared with a loss of DM2.4bn in the same period a
year ago.
The company's chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, recently predicted that 'almost
all' operations should have returned to profit by 1995.
S&amp;P also noted that Daimler Benz is seeking to enhance its competitiveness
through the renewal and expansion of product offerings at Mercedes-Benz and
improvements in operating efficiency across the entire group.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Charles Church refinanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks which led the financial rescue of housebuilder Charles Church three
years ago have agreed to write off a further Pounds 50.7m of debt to aid the
company's recuperation and eventually allow it to be floated.
They have also provided Pounds 10m of new loans to enable the company to buy
land in the home counties and increase its building programme as the housing
market recovers.
In a letter to shareholders Dr John Roberts, chairman, said the independent
directors had been advised by NatWest Markets that 'a future flotation of
Charles Church Group is most likely to maximise returns to shareholders and
subject to favourable economic and market conditions is a realistic
prospect'.
The latest refinancing involves a complex share restructure. Banks which
provided the original rescue package and have agreed the further debt
reduction have increased their stake in the group from 42 to 80 per cent.
Preference shareholders and other banks which provided mezzanine finance in
1989 have had their stake reduced from about 40 per cent to 10 per cent.
Charles Church management have retained their 10 per cent holding.
The continuing high level of Charles Church borrowings meant that the group
recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.5m last year even though it moved back
into the black at operating level. Trading profit was Pounds 332,000
compared with a loss of Pounds 17.67m the previous year.
Mr Stewart Baseley, Charles Church chief executive, said: 'The company's
fortunes have improved significantly and the business is now performing
well. As a consequence our banks did not need to do anything, but based on
our recent track record have demonstrated their confidence and support in
the management by investing further into our profitable growth and
expansion.'
Dr Roberts said that the company had been due to repay banks about Pounds
14.2m of debt and accrued interest in August next year, with similar amounts
due in 1996 and 1997. The independent directors believed it would not be
able to meet these obligations and supported the restructuring as 'the only
way by which shareholders as a whole may achieve any meaningful future value
for their shareholdings'.
Borrowings following the restructuring have been reduced from Pounds 90.7m
to Pounds 50.5m, including the new Pounds 10m loan for land purchases.
Shareholders' funds, which previously were in deficit, are now back in the
black, enabling the company to pay dividends in the future.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Institutions take a longer term view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large institutional shareholders may take a much longer term view of the
prospects of the companies they invest in than is currently believed,
according to a new survey.
The Investor Relations Society, a professional association, studied the
share registers of 10 leading UK companies over a 12-month period.
It concluded, based on analysis of the largest shareholders, that the
average holding in any single company was 8 years and 4 months, far longer
than a holding of between 3.5 and 5 years highlighted in an earlier study by
the London Stock Exchange.
However, at the margin, there is considerable trading in the shares of each
individual company over the course of a year, with the average monthly
turnover at 7.1 per cent.
But for the 10 largest institutions, the average was 6.4 per cent, while for
the 10 smallest, monthly turnover was 7.8 per cent, suggesting that smaller
shareholders may be more volatile holders of stock.
Significantly, the study also found that life and pensions funds - which
tend to be the largest institutional shareholders - are more likely to be
longer term holders of stock than are unit and investment trust mana-gers.
Of the 45 life and pensions shareholders in the study, only one totally
divested itself of a large stake in a single company during the 12-month
period.
The 45 unit and investment trusts in the study included three cases of total
divestment over the same period.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Churchill China plans to raise Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Churchill China is coming to the market next month. It is the third oldest
Staffordshire-based china company to float in the last year, after Royal
Doulton and Denby.
Churchill, founded under the Sampson Bridgwood name 200 years ago, wants to
raise Pounds 15m via a placing.
About Pounds 5m of the proceeds will be used to carry out an investment
programme to improve capacity and quality. The balance will go to the three
brothers whose family have run the company since 1922. After the float, the
Roper family will have about 55 per cent of the enlarged equity.
Mr Stephen Roper, chief executive, says a flotation would also give the
group the flexibility to attract and keep management expertise with
incentives such as share options.
Churchill has three divisions - tableware, hotelware and fine china.
Tableware produces the cheaper earthenware product in traditional floral or
blue willow patterns. Churchill intends to invest about Pounds 800,000 in
this division.
In 1993 hotelware contributed Pounds 1.7m to group profits of Pounds 2.9m.
Churchill would invest about Pounds 5.5m in the division to expand capacity.
The flotation will include a profits forecast. Mr Roper said Churchill would
show an improvement on last year's Pounds 2.9m profit and Pounds 36m in
sales. Hoare Govett is sponsor.
Other companies revealing plans to come to market include Brunner Mond, the
UK's biggest soda ash group, New Look, a womenswear retailer, and Ennemix,
an aggregates company.
Sold by Imperial Chemical Industries in 1991 to Penrice, a management buy-in
company since renamed, Brunner could be valued at about Pounds 250m when it
floats early in 1995.
New Look is to launch a placing and open offer by the end of the year,
valuing the company at Pounds 150m-Pounds 180m and involving some 35 per
cent of the equity.
Founded by deputy chairman, Mr Tom Singh, the company has 221 retail outlets
in the UK and 10 in France. In the year to March 26 last, sales were Pounds
88.4m and profits was Pounds 10.9m.
Ennemix's previous flotation proposal to raise almost Pounds 9m from a
rights issue offered to shareholders of Anglesey Mining for a 15 per cent
stake in the quoted mining group, received insufficient institutional
support. Instead it is planning a placing to raise about Pounds 4.45m.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: News Corp rejects panel as way to settle
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, the publishing group owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, has
rejected an attempt by investors to use the City Disputes Panel to resolve a
long-running dispute over its exchangeable preference shares and convertible
bonds.
Instead, it is taking legal action against merchant bank J Henry Schroder
Wagg, one of the investors who incurred losses in the confusion surrounding
the preference share and convertible bond issues the media group launched in
1989, which were convertible into shares owned by News Corp in Pearson, the
owner of the Financial Times.
When Pearson demerged its Royal Doulton china subsidiary last year,
investors thought that anyone converting the News Corp bonds and shares
would receive Doulton shares, in addition to Pearson shares. A notice
published in the FT in December on behalf of a News Corp subsidiary advised
holders that they were entitled to the Doulton shares as part of the
exchange.
However, in January, News Corp published another notice saying it was
seeking legal advice and in February said that investors would not receive
the Doulton shares.
Without the Royal Doulton shares, the value of the conversion package was
worth less than the redemption value of the bonds. In the confusion
surrounding the terms of the exchange, several investors, including
Schroder, incurred significant losses.
Representing aggrieved investors, including Schroder, City lawyers Slaughter
&amp; May wrote to News Corp recommending the matter be brought before the
disputes panel.
News Corp, however, rejected arbitration 'because it didn't think it was the
most appropriate procedure,' Mr Robert Hunter, a litigation partner at Allen
&amp; Overy, News Corp's lawyers, said yesterday. Instead, the group has started
legal action against Schroder, asking the High Court to rule that the bank
has no grounds for compensation.
Schroder disagrees. 'We felt this was an appropriate dispute for the panel
to hear, and believe it is the right body to consider the dispute,' Mr David
Caruth, Schroder's legal adviser said yesterday. 'We don't think the courts
are the appropriate forum for this dispute,' he added.
News Corp was unavailable for comment, but is expected to make a statement
today.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Benfield proves exception to the rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's insurance and reinsurance brokers have not performed well over the
last couple of years, but Benfield Group, the reinsurance broker which has
announced its full year results, is a notable and striking exception.
Benfield, which is not listed on the stock market, continues to make annual
profits equal to nearly three quarters of its operating income, and its
senior executives are among the best paid in the insurance industry.
The marginal fall in pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 from Pounds
31.2m to Pounds 29.2m, was principally due to falls in interest rates and
currency losses.
Mr Matthew Harding, the chairman, already a multi-millionaire with
substantial interests in Chelsea Football Club, saw his remuneration package
 -excluding pension contribution - fall only slightly to Pounds 2.39m
(Pounds 2.45m). One other director also earned more than Pounds 1m in the
year.
Yet Benfield has significantly increased its financial strength, boosting
shareholders' funds to Pounds 50.7m (Pounds 30.2m). An extra Pounds 12.5m in
equity was raised earlier this year to capitalise a new reinsurance company,
Benfield Re.
Mr Harding is also well known as a fierce critic of the price-driven
approach to broking favoured by many in the market in the 1980s, which
helped depress reinsurance rates to unsustainably low levels.
He has introduced a number of innovative elements into reinsurance
contracts, mainly designed to prevent underwriters being able to underwrite
business while retaining little or no risk on their own accounts.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Norman Hay reduces losses to Pounds 368,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Hay, the engineering group, reduced losses from Pounds 677,000 to
Pounds 368,000 in the first half of 1994.
The result came on the back of a lower turnover of Pounds 3.24m, against
Pounds 3.9m.
Mr Peter Hay, chairman, warned, however, that the company's performance
would be held back by financing costs until the sale of the Heathrow site
was concluded.
Further progress was expected in the second half and prospects 'appear
better than for several years,' he added.
Losses per share for the period amounted to 2.5p, compared with 4.5p.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Novelty of the short-term: Money market funds are catching
on in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When German investors are offered champagne and caviar to tempt them to
bring in new customers, something new must be up in a country where
financial innovation proceeds cautiously rather than swiftly. In Germany,
investors tend to be very much in the safety-first mould.
The novelty is money market funds, now coming steadily on to the German
financial scene since legal barriers to their sale were dropped last month.
About 20 such funds have either been approved or are in the pipeline.
With increased familiarity, investors will become blase about this new - for
Germany - investment medium, offering immediate access to their money at
interest rates higher than on fixed-rate deposits.
To steal a march on its rivals, one big German bank set up two funds in
Luxembourg while awaiting regulatory approval to base them in Germany.
Commerzbank's funds - with minimum deposits of DM20,000 and DM100,000 for
private and professional or corporate investors - have attracted nearly
DM8bn (Pounds 3.2bn). Competitors tend to be disdainful about Commerzbank's
marketing methods, including television advertising as well as its free
champagne and caviar offer for clients introducing new business. But the
bank, whose funds yield just more than 4 per cent against 3.5 per cent for
term deposits, sees them as a way of raising new customers.
Clearly, much of the money going into the funds comes from the bank's own
fixed-rate deposit accounts, but Commerzbank reckons at least a quarter of
the inflows represent new money.
Other countries have had money market funds, which invest in short-term
government, commercial and other paper, for some time. In the US, their
volume totals nearly Dollars 600bn, while French funds have reached Dollars
250bn. In Germany, however, their significance goes beyond their likely
attraction to investors. Their introduction represents an enhancement to the
evolving status of Germany as a financial centre.
'This is more than a small step in the right direction,' says Mr Christian
Strenger, chief executive of DWS, the Deutsche Bank fund management concern.
'This was one of the few elements still missing. It is important to have
money market funds in the range of offerings. All mature financial markets
have them.'
If the Bundesbank had had its way, money market funds would never have seen
the light of day. The central bank was concerned about their potential for
undermining control of the money supply.
To press home its point, the Bundesbank last month withdrew its short-dated
paper (Bulis), saying it did not want to encourage short-termism in
financial markets. This was re-emphasised last week by Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
president of the central bank, who said the federal and state governments
should not turn to short-term issues.
While the removal of Bulis takes some DM25bn of paper out of the market,
fund managers do not see this as a great handicap. 'It's a pity that such a
top quality investment is not available,' says Mr Strenger, but he and
others see plenty of other investment opportunities.
The German funds will obviously encourage more companies to issue commercial
paper. There are about 60 CP programmes in D-Marks, including blue chips
such as Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW. But the winding down of the
Treuhand privatisation agency will remove the biggest programme, worth
DM10bn.
Mr Rudolf Siebel, Frankfurt-based investment fund analyst at the Moody's
rating agency, says fund managers could have to accept more lower-grade
paper from new issuers to offset the lack of government and Treuhand paper.
However, the Bonn government's new 10-year floating rate bond, based on the
three-month Frankfurt interbank rate - the Bundesbank is not too
enthusiastic about this, either - will provide an additional investment.
Mr Rolf Passow, head of DIT, the Dresdner Bank investment offshoot, hopes
the funds will help popularise investment in funds generally as an
alternative to fixed-interest savings.
The next step would be to interest more people in share-based unit trusts.
At present, 68 per cent of the DM325bn invested in German unit trusts is in
bond funds. The potential prize is a big one. Germans have some DM4,000bn in
private financial assets, 44 per cent of these in bank deposits. If more
went into shares and funds, the effect on German financial markets could be
considerable.

FT  26 SEP 94 / NatWest may bid for Irish bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is likely to be allowed to make an IPounds 110m
(Pounds 108m) bid for TSB Bank in the Republic of Ireland as part of an
effort by the Irish government to create a 'third force' in the banking
sector to rival Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.
The government is expected to allow NatWest to bid against National
Australia Bank for TSB. Although the trustees of TSB have agreed to be
acquired by NAB, the government is likely to intervene to ensure that it
receives the highest price for the state-owned bank.
The government is due to receive a report next month prepared jointly by SKC
Corporate Finance, NM Rothschild and William Fry outlining a framework for a
TSB auction. The successful bidder may also be required to buy Industrial
Credit Corporation, the state-controlled finance house.
NatWest has been given the financial data to allow it to make a financial
assessment of TSB, which had IPounds 1.23bn in assets, and capital reserves
of IPounds 57.5m, at the end of 1993. NatWest has said it is willing to make
a higher bid than NAB, which is thought to have offered IPounds 102m.
Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said he believes that NatWest was now
more likely to be allowed to bid for TSB. 'The door is rather more open than
it was because, although NAB had a head start, the position is being looked
at and other options evaluated,' he said.
Lord Alexander said that by combining TSB with Ulster Bank, NatWest would be
able to achieve 'considerable further development' of its Irish banking
operations.
'It would be an even more serious presence, and what might be described as a
true third force,' he said.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Lloyd's agency seeks listing for dedicated fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hiscox Group, the Lloyd's agency, is to seek a stock market listing for its
'Dedicated' investment fund, which provides corporate capital exclusively to
its four syndicates.
The move is designed to pave the way for the eventual creation of an
insurance company which would operate within the Lloyd's regulatory
framework, signalling a further shift in the character of the insurance
market which has traditionally relied on individual Names trading with
unlimited liability for their losses.
Lloyd's raised corporate capital for the first time last year. More than a
dozen listed investment funds now supply some Pounds 800m to syndicates and
account for more than 14 per cent of the market's capacity - the amount of
premiums it can accept.
So far, all listed funds have been investment trusts supporting a range of
agencies - and the syndicates they manage - across the insurance market,
because stock exchange rules have prevented the listing of single agency or
'dedicated' vehicles on the grounds that they do not have a three-year
trading record.
Mr Robert Hiscox, chairman of Hiscox and deputy chairman of the market as a
whole, indicated a relaxation was in prospect. Mr Hiscox, who helped
orchestrate the drive to attract corporate capital last year, said his group
will need to provide audited accounts for syndicate years of account which
still have to be closed, in line with the market's three-year accounting
system.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Events in Japan add to worries
over sector switch - Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So far, 1994 has not been a happy year for Inchcape, the international
motors, marketing and business services group. Its share price has fallen by
a third since January, and analysts will be anxious for reassurance today
when the UK-based group reports results for the six months to June 30.
Currency has been the main bugbear. Inchcape does a lot of its business in
and from the Far East and the strength of Japanese yen against both the
dollar and sterling will adversely depress its results. The Japanese
recession hit the group's marketing activities, which also suffered when the
Chinese authorities last year imposed austerity measures to slow the pace of
development in their southern provinces.
Inchcape has also been rueing its loss last year of a tussle with the FT-SE
Actuaries Industry Classification Committee, which led to the group being
moved from business services sector to vehicle distributors. Following its
acquisition of TKM for Pounds 383m in 1992, Inchcape group makes the bulk of
its operating profits from motors importing, distribution, and retailing.
However, it was concerned over being put in a sector which mainly comprises
UK distributors, when only about 15 per cent of the group's total profits
come from motors in the UK. Sure enough, when news of the disappointing
level of new car registrations in the UK during August hit its new sector
this month, Inchcape was clobbered along with companies which trade only in
the UK.
These concerns have wiped out the premium rating which Inchcape enjoyed in
the early 1990s, when the market saw it as well placed to benefit from
growth in the Pacific Rim and - through Hong Kong - the development of
China. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 115m-Pounds 120m,
compared with Pounds 130m last time, but will be more interested in the
outlook for the second half.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Profitability in view after bumpy
ride - Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday, Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector industrial group, will
publish its half-year results, providing the first concrete indications of
how it is working towards the objective of full-year profits outlined by Mr
Gianni Agnelli, group chairman, at the shareholder meeting in June.
Last year, the group revealed a L966bn (Pounds 393.5m) loss for the first
half - which became a record L1,783bn (Pounds 726.2m) loss in the full year
 -and a complex cash-raising plan worth a total of L5,000bn. The group's
shares fell sharply afterwards.
This year's half-year announcement should be less dramatic. Analysts are
more or less in agreement that the group will show a small pre-tax profit
for the first half.
Fiat cars - which include the Alfa Romeo and Lancia brands - have managed to
increase their market share in Italy, with the help of a competitive
exchange rate which has deterred buyers of rival foreign marques, in
particular Japanese.
Exports should also show strong growth, for the same reasons, with the Fiat
Punto, launched last year, leading the recovery.
The prospect of good results is already in the Fiat share price, according
to analysts, and investors may be more concerned next week by the Italian
government's efforts to push through a 1995 budget.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Lufthansa to cut debt by DM3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German national airline, plans to reduce the group's
long-term net debt by nearly DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) by 1997 as part of its
overall restructuring and financial recovery.
The reduction in net debt will lead to annual interest payment savings of
around DM200m a year by 1997 in addition to the DM500m-DM700m in annual
savings the company is seeking to achieve from its restructuring and
cost-cutting strategy, according to Mr Klaus Schlede, Lufthansa's deputy
chairman and chief financial officer.
Mr Schlede said Lufthansa would use all the proceeds of the DM1.2bn it is
raising from its current rights issue to repay ahead of schedule a DM1.2bn
Euroloan maturing in 2000. During a road-show to promote the issue, which is
an integral part of the airline's privatisation programme, Mr Schlede also
disclosed the airline would retire ahead of schedule another DM500m floating
rate bond in the current quarter.
The airline has already repaid DM250m of the floating rate bond in July and
intends to retire the rest next month. 'By the end of this year we will have
reduced our net debt from DM5.9bn to DM4.2bn,' Mr Schlede said. This DM1.7bn
reduction would lead to annual interest payment savings of DM100m by next
year.
In the next two years, two further bond issues will come to maturity
including DM300m next year and DM750m in 1996. 'We will repay these loans
out of cashflow as we see no need for new indebtedness,' he said.
With the repayment of these further Eurobond issues, the group's long-term
debt will be cut to DM3.15bn by the end of 1996, close to its three-year
target of DM3bn. This will lead to the annual DM200m interest payment
savings the group is seeking.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Kohl's ally wins Bavarian poll: Victory for CSU boosts
German leader's re-election chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bavaria's ruling Christian Social Union (CSU), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
closest ally in the German coalition government, last night won an absolute
majority in the last state election before the federal poll on October 16.
The unexpectedly good CSU result will give a boost to Mr Kohl's re-election
chances. However, the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior partner in Mr
Kohl's government, suffered another setback; preliminary official results
showed the party failing to gain the 5 per cent needed for a place in the
state parliament.
The CSU, the more conservative sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), scored 52.8 per cent, according to the preliminary
results.
Mr Theo Waigel, CSU leader and Bonn finance minister, said: 'I am very
satisfied. We can be very pleased with this result.' Mr Edmund Stoiber, the
Bavarian premier, said: 'This is good support for Kohl and Waigel.'
The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) failed to make the breakthrough
it hoped for, winning 30.1 per cent, but this was a substantial recovery
from the 26 per cent it polled at the last state elections four years ago.
The leftwing Green party will return to the state legislature with 6.1 per
cent, while the FDP fell from 5.2 per cent last time to 2.8 per cent. The
far-right Republican party, which had hoped to get at least 10 per cent,
scored 3.9 per cent, down from 4.9 per cent four years ago.
The result is an endorsement of Mr Stoiber, the Bavarian state premier, who
has had to work hard to breathe life into a party battered by corruption
scandals in the past 18 months. The result is the worst showing for the CSU
in 20 years, but it has nonetheless won an absolute majority in the state
legislature for the ninth time running.
The SPD has improved its position, but will be disappointed at failing to
deny the CSU its absolute majority. The SPD has never won more than 36 per
cent in Bavaria, the most conservative of Germany's 16 Lander.
Although the party began the year with promising results in opinion polls
and Mrs Renate Schmidt, its leader in Bavaria, fought a spirited campaign,
voters returned to old allegiances in a relatively high turnout.
Around 68 per cent of the 8.7m eligible Bavarians voted, about 2 percentage
points more than four years ago, contradicting suggestions that voters had
become apathetic.
The outcome for the Republicans in the German state in which their support
has traditionally been strongest is a severe reverse, and confirms that they
are unlikely to get into the German Bundestag at the forthcoming general
election.
Mr Stoiber said last night the sharp drop in support for the Republicans was
'the second best result of the evening'.
The FDP said the election result had no bearing on its likely performance in
the federal poll, arguing that it had often failed in state elections but
had never lost its Bundestag seats.

FT  26 SEP 94 / US warns Haiti junta to co-operate after 10 die in clash
with marines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officers bluntly warned Haiti's military chiefs yesterday that they must
co-operate with the intervention force, after US marines killed 10 Haitians
in a fierce gun battle at a police station at the weekend.
President Bill Clinton, who will address the UN General Assembly today, said
he regretted the loss of life, but vowed US troops would continue to respond
to hostile action against them.
The outgoing Haitian strongman, General Raoul Cedras, was called,
grim-faced, to an airport meeting with the head of the US-led intervention
force, General Hugh Shelton, to discuss co-operation and flew by helicopter
to the site of the clash in the northern town of Cap Haitien. The US said
other officers would be meeting the Haitian military to 'ensure their
co-operation'.
The clash on Saturday night - the first involving US troops since they
landed a week ago - came after steadily rising tension between marines and
Haitian authorities in the town.
A US officer said pro-democracy demonstrators taunted armed men outside a
police station as marines arrived on patrol. When one of the armed men
raised a sub-machine gun, a marine shot him dead and a gunfight broke out,
the officer said. A US sailor was slightly hurt.
Gen Cedras accused the US of atrocities and demanded the court-martial of a
marine colonel, but the US brushed aside his angry reaction. Hundreds of
jubilant Haitians yesterday ransacked police stations and an army barracks
in the town, as soldiers and police abandoned their posts. The crowd carried
off beds, tables, desks, electric fans and stacks of papers, before US
marines restored order.
A leader of the Haitian paramilitary voiced concern that violence could
spread to the capital, Port-au-Prince. 'Things are getting tense,' he said.
'I feel in danger from the mobs.'
Dozens of demonstrators, emboldened by the presence of US troops in Haiti,
staged an unprecedented mock funeral for Gen Cedras outside the airport in
Port-au-Prince.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the US Senate armed services committee and a
member of former president Jimmy Carter's team that negotiated the Haitian
generals' agreement to leave power, warned there might be more conflict.
'This is the first bad incident we've had involving, directly, American
troops, but it won't be the last,' he said.
In New York, Mr Clinton last night had talks with UN secretary-general Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali on plans for turning over the US mission in Haiti to
UN peacekeepers. The weekend gun battle is likely to increase the pressure
on the Clinton administration to get US troops out of Haiti as quickly as
possible.
The exiled president, Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the US wants restored
to power, declared yesterday he would call the Haitian parliament into
session on Wednesday to consider the plan to grant an amnesty for the
military rulers who ousted him.
The military rulers agreed to step down when an amnesty is passed, and the
exiled president, who is still in the US, clearly hopes to speed their
departure.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A whiff of controversy overhangs telecoms offerings from the Indian
subcontinent. Pakistan Telecom vouchers were offered to international
investors earlier this month despite there being no proper prospectus and
with Jardine Fleming, the global co-ordinator, unable to go through the
normal due diligence process. Even so, Dollars 900m of vouchers were snapped
up.
Now India is wondering whether to revive the sale of shares in VSNL, the
international operator whose Dollars 1bn offering was pulled in May when
investors refused to pay the price the government demanded. Ministers, who
held out for a price set before global equity markets dived in February,
were condemned for failing to understand that prices must be fixed in the
light of market conditions. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson, their
bankers, were also criticised for failing to educate their client
adequately.
Such neglect certainly carries a price. Investors, who have once witnessed
unpredictable behaviour will worry about further political surprises if they
buy VSNL stock. Set against this is the group's undoubted appeal as an
investment. Not only does India - with only eight lines per thousand people
compared with a global average of 100 lines - have great scope to develop
its market; international traffic, over which VSNL has a 10-year monopoly,
is the fastest-growing and most profitable part of the market. Provided
ministers do not try again to over-price the issue, such attractions should
persuade investors that buying shares is worth the risk.

FT  26 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The temptation for BAA to try to replicate its winning UK formula in
overseas markets seems, at first glance, irresistible. BAA's expertise in
the low-cost construction, retail management and controlling of airports is
clearly in demand. Australia's airport privatisation, for which approval at
the Labor party conference this week would clear the way, is unlikely to be
the last programme initiated by a cash-strapped government turning to the
private sector to fund airport infrastructure.
But so far the benefits of BAA's internationalisation have proved elusive.
Its management contract at Pittsburgh has, in just one year, lifted spending
from less than Dollars 4 per passenger to more than Dollars 6, but the
operation adds little to BAA's bottom line. The danger is that by offering
such consultancy services BAA sells off its blue-prints for success. To make
a good return the company needs to take equity stakes. But there are few
countries willing to cede control of their airports to foreigners.
In any case, BAA does not need to internationalise. The group expects
passenger volumes at its UK airports to increase 4 per cent a year, lifting
passenger numbers at Heathrow alone from 48m presently to 80m by 2016.
Passenger spending can also be raised. In spite of BAA's undoubted skill,
most of its terminals still yield less than Singapore's Changi or
Amsterdam's Schiphol. The group is busy expanding retail space by 80 per
cent. The first stage, at Heathrow's terminal four, raised spending per
passenger by 30 per cent. Given such opportunities at home, the rewards
overseas will have to be alluring to make them worth the distraction.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US biotechnology business has hit a cash crunch. The median quoted
biotech group has insufficient capital to survive beyond the next 25 months,
compared with 34 months a year ago. The industry is used to waves of
investment interest and disenchantment, but this time the sector seems to be
suffering a more significant malaise. Between 20 and 30 per cent of the
quoted sector is in serious financial difficulties.
The reasons for the cash shortage are various. Investors were
over-enthusiastic during the 1980s; although biotech groups were supposed to
reduce the risks of developing new medicines through their greater
understanding of science, many investors did not realise the risk of failure
nevertheless remained high. Then the Clintons' proposals for healthcare
reform and the separate deceleration in growth of the world drugs market
have cast a general pall over the industry. Since 1991, biotech stocks have
underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by nearly 50 per cent.
This does not mean the death of the US biotech industry, but it heralds
rationalisation. Costs can be cut and ambitions reined in. For those making
good scientific progress, alternative sources of funds are available,
particularly from the drugs industry. Those incapable of raising additional
money must merge. The sector's long-term future remains bright. Healthcare
providers remain willing to prescribe expensive novel treatments if they
reduce overall costs. The rewards for those successfully developing
innovative drugs have never been greater.

FT  26 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Waiting for the Fed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The need for a rise in US interest rates is becoming increasingly apparent.
The bond market's continuing anxiety about inflation appears justified by
the most recent data on capacity utilisation and industrial production.
While inventory adjustments may slow the economy during the current quarter,
growth is likely to rebound to above 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. That
is well above the Fed's 2.5 per cent target. The only factor that might
delay an interest rate rise immediately after the Federal open market
committee's meeting this week is November's Congressional elections. An
increase soon after these would then be inevitable.
The more important questions are how high interest rates need to go to slow
the economy down to the 2.5 per cent growth rate favoured by the Fed and how
much damage such an increase will wreak on the corporate earnings and the
equity market. Economists are divided. Some argue for no increase. Others
believe rates will need to go as high as 7 per cent. This lack of consensus
has been a primary factor in the markets' instability.
The bond market would be more likely to calm down if the Fed decided on a
full percentage point rise. A half point rise would simply leave the market
waiting for more during the spring. As for equities, this year's earnings
would not be affected, but the high levels of corporate and private debt in
the US would undoubtedly lead next year's profits to undershoot
expectations. The price of knocking inflation on the head could be a sharp
correction on Wall Street.

In the financial year ending June 1994, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the commercial lending arm of the World Bank
Group, made net disbursements to developing countries of minus USDollars
731m. Such figures will be meat and drink to its critics. So too will the
fact that administrative expenses have risen 60 per cent over the past six
years, while gross disbursements have stagnated. Inevitably, the Bank is
finding it difficult to convince the public that it knows what it is doing
and is doing it efficiently and effectively.
What makes the task particularly difficult is the changed international
climate. Historically, the Bank had two groups of supporters in industrial
countries: cold-warriors and do-gooders. The first group has now
disappeared, while those who claim to have the interests of developing
countries at heart now condemn the Bank for its stinginess, its
heavy-handedness, its encouragement of environmental despoliation and its
neglect of the cause of the poor.
For all its might, the Bank lacks friends and, lacking friends, is
politically vulnerable. But it will achieve nothing by pretending to be what
it is not. It is a large, international public organisation that must work
with, and through, governments. Its brief is, in essence, to assist
developing countries achieve rapid, poverty-alleviating growth. Again, there
is no huge mystery about how this is to be achieved. East Asian developing
countries have shown the way. The trick - difficult in most places and
hitherto impossible in some, notably in Africa - is to help others follow
the same path.
Economic returns
The Bank must confront its critics. If it is to be blamed for its failures,
it must point to such successes as East Asian development and the green
revolution. It must also reject the notion that its brief is to transfer
resources, something that could be done better by a check-writing machine.
The wasteful use of oil revenues by so many oil-exporting developing
countries demonstrates that the mere availability of money does not ensure
economic development. The question, instead, is whether lending brings
satisfactory economic returns to borrowers.
True, the Bank has made big mistakes: over rural development lending, for
example, the sustainability of the commercial bank lending of the 1970s and
the durability of the 'energy crisis'. It is as important for the Bank to
admit - and learn from - such mistakes as it is to stand up for itself. But
the development record taken as a whole is not so bad. It can, and must, be
defended.
Less bureaucratic
Yet if the Bank is to defend both itself and its core mission, it must also
change. First, it must become leaner and much less bureaucratic. A start has
been made on this. The recent proposal by Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank's
president, to reduce the administrative budget by 6 per cent a year in real
terms, will increase the pressure. Second, it must be more flexible. The one
certainty in its environment is uncertainty. How many, just five years ago,
foresaw the collapse of the former Soviet Union or the torrent of private
capital pouring into middle-income developing countries? Third, it must be
more aggressive with its critics, more aggressive with its clients, and also
more aggressive, when appropriate, on behalf of its clients. The Bank cannot
be all things to all people. If, for example, it believes there ought to be
more generous official debt-relief for Africa, it should say so, loudly and
clearly.
There is much debate inside and outside the Bank about what sort of future
it might have. Some believe the prospect is one of genteel decline, as its
activities are progressively limited to Africa and South Asia. Others
believe it could become an integrator of ideas and money world-wide, even in
countries that do not need its direct financial assistance.
Such choices do not yet have to be made. The challenges of eliminating
extreme poverty and helping to integrate most of humanity within the global
market economy remain huge. Notwithstanding its faults, the Bank represents
a unique - and irreplaceable - repository of experience, skill and financial
resources, dedicated to these tasks. Those assets must be used effectively.
Their appropriate use must also be vigorously defended. These are the twin
challenges confronting Mr Preston.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Wet, wet, wet: Jancis Robinson visits Burgundy where heavy
rains have badly affected the wine harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vineyards are a mire around Meursault in Burgundy. At lunchtime,
low-paid pickers stomp into the village, clad in mud-spattered oilskins and
rubber gloves. The village streets throb with tractors pulling loads of
sodden grapes, all too often tinged brown with rot and covered with
tarpaulins in an attempt to keep at least the last hour's drizzle from
diluting the juice, and therefore the wine.
On backstreets, medieval courtyards are filled with the sound of heavy duty
hoses, desperately trying to keep the wine presses, trailers and hods clean.
The mood is sombre.
The French wine industry badly needs a top quality wine harvest. Wine
consumption in France has been plummeting, and French wine exports have
fallen nearly 20 per cent in the past five years.
International rivals have been increasing their market share and
undercutting French vineyards on prices - Chile, Argentina and South Africa
are proving particularly fierce competitors, according to a recent report on
the wine industry by Insee, the French national statistical office.
Together with the recession, these problems have pushed French winegrowers'
prices steadily down since 1991, says the institute, with high quality vins
d'appellation and champagnes the worst affected. There has been some
improvement this year, says a researcher at Insee: 'There is a strengthening
of demand from French consumers, and a more marked improvement in some
international markets,' he says. 'But there is still a long way to go to get
back to the levels of a few years ago.' Above all, France does not need
another year of declining production. Total production fell by 19 per cent
in 1993, thanks, largely, to bad weather. 'The harvest was greatly affected
by rain,' says Insee.
This year, Burgundy, like the rest of France, enjoyed an unusually hot
summer. At the end of August the grapes were riper and healthier than usual.
It seemed as though this could be just the vintage France needed, but
farmers such as these know better than to bank on the weather.
In the first week of September the rain set in, and continued almost daily
to make this the most miserable vintage since 1984 according to optimists -
and since 1947 according to pessimists.
At present, the quality of the eventual wines can only be guessed at.
There will probably be some good white wines, for rot is by no means
disastrous for white grapes and the acidity levels will please those who
like their white wines sharp. The best sites and best kept vineyards, such
as Dominique Lafon's Meursault-Perrieres, can boast tiny relatively healthy
grapes which should yield modest amounts of concentrated wine.
It is the red grapes which will take the strain of all this rain,
particularly where yields are high. Rot destroys pigment; and the skins  -
so necessary to red wine making - can taint the final wine. This will be one
of those (many) vintages about which the wine trade will be able to boast
'the strictest selection is necessary; buy only from a reputable merchant
such as ourselves'.
Those who are already practising 'organic' and even 'biodynamic'
chemical-free vine-growing techniques are boasting of markedly healthier
grapes than their neighbours in such damp conditions.
One prominent example is Lalou Biz-Leroy, 'the queen of Burgundy', whose
vineyards this year were treated not only to ground nettles applied
according to phases of the moon but also to various tisanes applied from a
helicopter.
Her traditional wooden open-topped (computer-controlled) fermentation vats
are full of healthy, small bunches of Pinot Noir grapes which will doubtless
become yet another vintage of Domaine Leroy bottles for the world's
collectors to argue over.
This is little comfort to a bedraggled stream of tourists, cycling through
the vineyards on pre-arranged routes from one three-star hotel to another.
Small groups were last week wheeling disconsolately around the village of
Meursault, mystified that in the frenzy, and gloom, of the picking season,
no one could find the time to sell them a bottle or two of world famous
Burgundy.
But while the tourists trudging around France's wine region in the rain, or
loitering longer than they would choose in their hotel rooms, may have been
miserable, this has only been a damp holiday. For the vignerons the loss
will be in their income, and, in some cases, their reputations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As any self-respecting pigeon knows, Switzerland is not a bad place to fall
sick or get hit. Any bird found injured while overflying the country is
dispatched to the army's pigeon base in Bern, where it is revived, fed and
sent on its way. But not for long.
The Swiss army has decided to send its 30,000 carrier pigeons packing - and
with it the international rescue service.
For 77 years, the birds have rendered solid service in field communications.
They take a mere 10 days to train; they have proved highly reliable in all
weathers and over varied terrain; and they cannot be tapped or jammed.
They are even well camouflaged. Civilians are indistinguishable from
soldiers, the only clue being that the former are sent on mission in pairs.
There has never been a case when at least one has not made its destination.
While the feathered fowl normally made flights between just two command
posts, they had been working up to tackling the greater challenge of
three-way journeys.
Disbanding the troop, meanwhile, saves SFr600,000 a year - which is hardly a
fortune. But technology wins the day. The 266 pigeon trainers will be
immediately redeployed, while the pigeons have a year's respite.
Thereafter a lucky few may just be adopted by the federal civil service.

The Corporation of London, meanwhile, is cock-a-hoop that BZW and its 4,000
employees have been dissuaded from setting up shop in Canary Wharf.
Currently scattered around the City in numerous buildings, the investment
bank had been poised to combine its operations under one roof on the Isle of
Dogs. But a memo was circulated to staff at the end of last week to the
effect that 'the overall economics' of the move would not prove
'sufficiently attractive'.
The Corporation, meanwhile, has worked out that, if an organisation has to
pay its people incentives worth, say, Pounds 2,000 to move to this less than
fashionable part of town, it is effectively spending Pounds 10 more per
square foot in rent. A nifty little calculation that has apparently been
drawn to the attention of BZW's chairman Sir Peter Middleton fairly
recently.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Lenanton, a family-owned timber processor and one of London's oldest
industrial companies, is on the point of abandoning its home of the past 157
years. A few well-chosen words from the chairman will be in order, no doubt?
Not a bit of it. John Lenanton, great grandson of the founder, cannot wait
to exchange the Isle of Dogs in Docklands for a new base in leafy suburban
Berkhamsted. After 44 years with the company, he will 'walk away from the
area and never look back'.
No longer using the Thames to transport its timber, the company is poorly
located as regards the bulk of its customers in the construction industry.
The principal effect of fronting on to the river these days is that the
masonry is in constant need of attention.
Fair enough, but Lenanton adds that he has experienced almost no advantage
from the wave of investment in Docklands, while the locals are dismissed as
a 'load of whingers'.
A lack of sentimentality not presumably applauded by the London Docklands
Development Corporation.

John Major has been accused of many things. But it seems a bit rich that the
UK prime minister should be expected to carry the can over the OECD impasse.
Some frustrated member states claim that America would never be holding out
against a third term for Paye had not Major set a precedent by vetoing
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, for presidency of the European
Commission.
But, as the Japanese can surely testify after suffering months of battery at
the hands of US trade negotiators, the Clinton administration hardly needs
lessons from other countries on how to go into battle to defend its own
economic interests.

Hardly a vote of confidence, one would think, when OECD secretary general
Jean-Claude Paye's chef de cabinet quits just when Paye himself is
struggling to hold on to his own job.
Not a bit of it, apparently. It is with Paye's express blessing that John
Llewellyn leaves the government-owned think-tank in Paris's elegant 16th
arrondisement to become top economic guru in Lehman Brothers' London office.
The embattled boss, it seems, has long felt that the OECD could improve its
analysis of financial flows. The hope is that Llewellyn, now 50, may one day
return to build up the expertise in that area.
It seems pretty unlikely, though, that Paye will be around to witness any
such return himself. With his contract expiring this Friday, he is now
supported for a third term by a slim majority of the OECD's 25 member
countries. But that is of little use when the US shows no sign of changing
its mind over the intention to veto the incumbent's reappointment.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Challengers jostle in the queue: Competition from a 'third
force' could soon disrupt the comfortable ways of Irish banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of unchallenged domination in their home market, Allied Irish
Banks and Bank of Ireland are entering a stressful era. Foreign banks are
queueing up to challenge them; customers are protesting about charges and
the level of financing for small businesses; and rivals such as building
societies are forcing them to lower margins.
There is more to come for the two banks, which between them account for 70
per cent of banking in the Republic of Ireland, and nearly half of financial
services. Next month, advisers are likely to set out how the government
could auction TSB Bank, with assets of IPounds 1.2bn. This may create the
'third force' in Irish banking, called for by the ruling coalition of Labour
and Fianna Fail when it was elected in 1992.
The government originally planned to merge TSB with two small
government-owned finance houses for agriculture and industry. But instead of
this unwieldy state-controlled group, a large and vigorous bank could
emerge. The proposal prompted an approach to TSB earlier this year by
National Australia Bank. It agreed with the TSB's trustees a IPounds 102m
offer to merge it with NAB's National Irish Bank.
This led to a counter-offer from National Westminster Bank's subsidiary,
Ulster Bank. If NatWest wins an auction, it might try to buy National Irish
as well, creating a bank with IPounds 5.5bn of assets. This would be big
enough to challenge AIB and Bank of Ireland. 'If the government wants a real
third force, then we are the right partner,' says Mr Ronnie Kells, Ulster
Bank's chief executive.
Yet even without a third force, Irish banking is entering a period of
stiffer competition and consolidation. The IPounds 183m flotation of the
Irish Permanent Building Society next month will give the society access to
capital markets so that it can make acquisitions. The two big banks are
building up capital after a troubled period. Smaller players, such as the
TSB, are seeking backing from sympathetic acquirers.
Meanwhile, barriers which stopped competition among banks, building
societies and life insurers have broken down, leaving the big banks to
protest that their oligopoly is more apparent than real. 'There is a
falsehood out there that we have got a grip on the market,' says Mr Tom
Mulcahy, chief executive of AIB. 'On the street, we chase each other for
customers,' says Mr Pat Molloy, chief executive of Bank of Ireland.
But there are good reasons for foreign banks' interest in Ireland. Retail
banking remains relatively profitable, with interest margins higher than in
Britain and other European countries. Lehman Brothers, the US investment
bank estimates that return on equity in the domestic retail market is about
40 per cent. This is double the 20 per cent overall return achieved by the
most profitable European banks.
Furthermore, the Irish Republican Army's ceasefire has stimulated the
interest of investors in what Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has
called the 'Celtic Tiger' of European economies. The economy is expected to
grow by at least 5 per cent this year and next year. Inflation is low, and
growth in loan demand has re-emerged after the shock of the European
exchange rate mechanism crisis of 1992.
Ireland remains a tiny economy by European standards - its IPounds 32bn
gross domestic product last year was equivalent to just 5 per cent of the
UK's GDP. Yet the prospect of steady, low-inflation growth, is very
attractive for banks. It lessens the risk that bad debts will compress
interest margins, as they have done in other countries. 'I cannot remember a
time when we have had such a high quality of loans,' says Mr Mulcahy.
These factors have given the two banks a solid, profitable base. They have
needed it in the past few years as they have struggled to clean up costly
errors abroad. Both expanded in Britain in the 1980s too aggressively. Both
have had to work out bad debts on corporate lending, and have now refocused
their businesses on banking for Irish expatriates, and forms of secured
lending such as residential mortgages.
Bank of Ireland's experience in the US (where AIB managed to avoid trouble)
was even worse. It lost a total of IPounds 180m over four years as a result
of the New England real estate crisis, after buying First New Hampshire in
1988. 'Our timing there was especially unfortunate. We bought just before
the bubble burst,' says Mr Molloy. The US subsidiary has now turned the
corner, making a IPounds 13m profit in the year to March.
Irish profits, and recovery overseas, have now prompted the banks to talk of
renewed expansion abroad. AIB has made the loudest noises, talking of both
US acquisitions to reinforce its Baltimore-based subsidiary First Maryland
Bancorp, and perhaps buying a British building society. The banks reason
that they cannot simply remain in Ireland if they are to compete alongside
the emerging pan-European banks.
Yet even with the cash to spend, overseas expansion is not a simple matter.
Both in Britain and the US, banks are bidding around twice the book value of
smaller banks and societies to take them over. This makes it hard to achieve
their required return on investments, even if they avoid pitfalls. 'We will
keep our money in our pockets if we have to. We are not going to make a
purchase at any price,' says Mr Mulcahy.
They may need to husband resources for the battle at home. Signs of this
have emerged in the savings market, where the banks have narrowed margins by
offering depositors higher rates. Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive of Irish
Permanent, says that lending margins are also under pressure. 'The banks are
finding the mortgage market very attractive, and there is a lot more
competition than a year ago,' he says.
The big banks accept that competition will inevitably erode interest
margins. In response, they are trying to boost their earnings from other
sources. An obvious source of added income is fees and charges. These are
state-controlled, although the banks can negotiate increases. Irish banks
gain a lower share of their income from fees than those in countries such as
Britain, despite widespread criticism by consumers.
The other possibility of added income is to sell more to their customers.
The competition in the mortgage market is one sign of this; banks have also
developed life insurance arms. 'We have a very strong base that we have not
always used. If we can market products better to our existing customers, it
will have a powerful effect,' says Mr Brian Wilson, director of AIB's
Ireland division.
Yet banks are unlikely to be able to sustain their returns solely through
adding to income. This will put pressure on them to cut costs, either by
reducing staff and branches, or by taking over others and removing
duplication. Such a process has been taking place in the US and other
European countries. It will be harder to achieve in Ireland, where there is
15 per cent unemployment, and strong resistance to job cuts.
The possibility of cuts has already dogged part of the government's original
proposal for a third force. The staff of Agricultural Credit Corporation -
one of the two finance houses involved - protested at the potential cost of
being merged with the Industrial Credit Corporation. It will also affect the
TSB sale; bidders are likely to have to make pledges on jobs as part of
their offers.
Mr Craig McKinney, chairman of the biggest Irish finance house, Woodchester
Investments, says that a bid for TSB is only attractive if it can be
rationalised. 'To buy it with your hands tied behind your back does not make
sense,' he says. Without such cuts, its new owner may be unable to undercut
the big banks' charges, which would undermine the original rationale for
selling the state banks.
Such considerations are unlikely to hold outsiders back. Lord Alexander,
NatWest's chairman, has stressed his bank's intention to preserve jobs if it
wins an auction. Yet such pledges will not hold indefinitely. By the time
the Irish banking market has consolidated, more than a few politicians and
former bank clerks could be talking with nostalgia about the days before
banks started to compete.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Howard's mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
He - it has not yet been a she - who lives by headlines may perish by
headlines. That is the danger facing Mr Michael Howard. It is partly of the
home secretary's own making. He is aware, or should be, that the rise in
crime that has aroused so much public anxiety is the product of complex
causes, yet he has sought acclaim as the stern enforcer of criminal justice.
He has presented himself as the scourge of criminals, while events have
conspired to enable the media to picture his ministry as soft on prisoners
and careless in its custody of terrorists.
A year ago, at the Conservative conference, Mr Howard presented a '27-point
plan' to tackle crime. He then made every administrative and political
mistake in the book. He distressed his officials, by curtly rejecting their
advice. One by one the client groups under his ministry  - police,
magistrates, judges and all - were alienated. Then, under pressure, this
'tough' minister retreated, as in the case of a recently recommended package
for the reform of police pay and conditions.
The most spectacular defeats came in the House of Lords, where Mr Howard
disdained to reach an understanding with Lord Whitelaw, and thus had to
redraft key clauses of an important bill. This particular home secretary is
not, however, solely to blame for the contents of the criminal justice bill
or indeed the police and magistrate's courts bill. They were in draft form
when his predecessor, now chancellor, left office.
The first bill was designed to correct previous, poorly-drafted,
Conservative legislation, the second to extend central control over the
constabulary and the magistracy. Both had some merit, and many infelicities.
Mr Howard's fault lay in his exuberant pursuit of partisan victories in an
area of governance in which consensus is usually preferable.
Political clumsiness
The political clumsiness he thus displayed may have the serious consequence
of clouding the debate over the merits of the governments' attempts to
reform the management of the country's jails. In theory the Prison Service,
the new agency brought in to do so, should be more than a match for the
Prison Officers' Association, one of Britain's few remaining obstructive
trade unions. Mr Derek Lewis, the director-general of the service, has made
an energetic start. He has introduced clear administrative structures, and
advanced plans for transferring the management of specified prisons to
private contractors.
Lax security
On paper, this should enable the public to see who is to blame when things
go wrong. In practice it does not always work that way, as the POA loses no
opportunity to point out. Was the decision to move convicted IRA terrorists
back to Ulster 'operational' and therefore Mr Lewis's to make or 'policy'
and therefore Mr Howard's responsibility? Who is to blame for the lax
security at Whitemoor prison, where IRA prisoners have received guns,
Semtex, and detonators? Is it the new governor, for inattention to detail,
Mr Lewis for his regulations, or the Home Office for its rules?
The inquiry being conducted by Sir John Woodcock may provide a managerial
answer to these questions, but it is the political reality that counts. The
days when ministers might be expected to resign over any lapse in any corner
of their departments are gone. Yet the creation of arm's-length agencies
does not absolve the politician in charge from a duty of oversight. A good
chairman leaves day-to-day control in the hands of a chief executive, but
keeps antennae out at all times. If the agency system is to work with the
requisite degree of transparency, this principle should be clarified.
It is not axiomatic that the above history requires the sacrifice of Mr
Howard. His presence in the cabinet is partly accounted for by his
association with the Conservative right, and partly by his representation of
Euroscepticism in one of the three high offices of state - the other two,
the treasury and the foreign office, being filled by known pro-Europeans.
Against that, he has presided over the loss of the Tories' advantage over
Labour as the party of law and order. It is the prime minister's task to
decide whether, on balance, Mr Howard's continuation in office is an asset
to the government or a liability to his party.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Record shows mutuality no handicap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR R H RANSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps as the chief executive of the oldest mutual life assurance
society in the world - The Equitable, founded 1762 - I might be permitted to
join the debate on mutuality.
Mr Instone's comments (Letters, September 19) are unsubstantiated. An
inspection of the published tables of the results of with-profits policies
will show a domination by mutual offices. It is ironic that he comments on
the difficulty of devising a voting structure for policyholders of a mutual.
That may be true but at least they do have a voice and are not subordinated
to the interests of proprietors.
The Equitable can offer more than 230 years of living proof of the
successful application of the mutual concept. Our sole aim is, and always
has been, to deliver services and benefits at cost to our policyholders. The
advantages of that dedication are evident from our record. We have the
lowest costs in the industry, we have the most advanced systems, we attract
the highest amounts of annual premium new business, we have the lowest lapse
rate, our 'maturities' are consistently in the top few across all products
and durations, surrender values are 'competitive', etc. All of that has been
achieved without raising a penny from outside sources.
It is fashionable to knock the concept, but a society run on mutual grounds
concentrating wholly on benefits to members and not answerable to outside
interests and influences can be one of the most effective forms of
incorporation. It is far from being the handicap envisaged by Mr Instone.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Setting a sensible nuclear agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MS JANET BLOOMFIELD.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following your excellent coverage of the nuclear Non- Proliferation
Treaty PrepComm in Geneva ('Opposition to nuclear treaty grows', September
16), I was surprised that the FT failed to highlight the significance of the
Liberal Democrats' conference decision to support a limited extension of the
NPT.
By calling for the NPT to be extended initially for a limited period, and
for further extensions of the treaty to be linked to progress on a worldwide
convention to eliminate all nuclear weapons, the Liberal Democrats have
taken on a commonsense agenda for practical measures to break the nuclear
deadlock.
Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, made clear
that the reasoning behind the policy is 'to maintain the pressure on the
nuclear weapon holding powers to meet their obligations under Article VI of
the NPT'.
The NPT has been accused of discrimination and Israel, Pakistan, India and
Ukraine will not sign. Extending it indefinitely, as the government and
Labour party advocate, may mean that the present creeping proliferation
becomes irreversible.
A new global treaty could be universally respected and ratified. CND looks
forward to the Labour and Conservative parties supporting such a positive
move.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Company finances could be hit by
pensions solvency standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TREVOR CROWTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley is quite right to point out that the proposed introduction
of a minimum solvency standard for UK pension funds raises some very far
reaching investment issues ('New benchmark worries UK pension funds',
September 21).
More than that, it has potentially enormous financial implications for
employers. If pension funds switch investment away from equities towards
bonds, based on long-term historical investment returns, the cost of pension
provision will increase substantially. On the other hand, if pension funds
retain their strong equity bias to maximise investment return, there is a
risk that large amounts of additional cash will need to be found in the
future, due to their failing the solvency test.
It is encouraging that some of the implications of the proposed standard are
now beginning to be recognised. However, I do not believe that the
potentially highly damaging impact on the finances of British business has
been considered sufficiently.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Economics without crystal gazing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most hard-nosed financial commentators should have sat up and taken
notice when Prof David Currie, head of the London Business School
forecasting unit, recently suggested a policy objective for nominal GDP as
an improvement on the present UK policy framework, which supposedly targets
inflation and nothing else.
Prof Currie has, in the past, been a Labour adviser whose name has been
mentioned in relation to top official advisory jobs. Of course he is not the
only influence on Labour policy; and the new Labour leader, Tony Blair, is
far from a sure shot for the next election. But it is still surely
worthwhile to take note of Currie's suggestion, as well as of what the bond
market is supposed to 'think'. In fact, the arguments for a nominal GDP
framework speak for themselves, irrespective of politics; and the governor
of the Banque de France, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently used the concept in
discussing economic developments in his own country.
Prof Currie argues that a nominal GDP objective would be a good compromise
between an output objective and one for inflation alone. There are many
other arguments and nuances (some of which were given in my Economic
Viewpoint of September 8). The one that is most relevant now is that it
makes policy a little less dependent on being able to project the course of
the economy for several years ahead than the present Treasury and Bank of
England framework does.
It will be a sign that nominal GDP is taken seriously when analysts go
beyond debating the concept and start looking at the numbers.
The Central Statistical Office gives two versions of nominal GDP - at market
prices and at factor costs. (The latter excludes indirect taxes and
subsidies.) The market price measure shows an increase of 5.8 per cent over
a year ago; the factor cost one of 5.7 per cent - identical for practical
purposes. The more fundamental factor cost estimate breaks down into a 3.8
per cent real rise in output and a 1.8 per cent increase in prices, as
measured by the GDP deflator.
Is a 5 1/2 to 6 per cent annual rate of increase of GDP in cash terms too
fast or too slow? If the policy were starting with output on its trend line
and with minimum inflation, a 5 per cent objective would be appropriate.
There would be room for 2 1/2 per cent output growth and 2 1/2 per cent
measured inflation. (The latter would reflect hidden quality adjustments as
well as acknowledging the difficulty of achieving literally zero inflation
at short notice). But when an economy is still emerging from a severe
recession an annual nominal growth of up to 6 per cent per annum is surely
not too fast.
Unfortunately analysis cannot end here. For the growth of GDP - both nominal
and real - has been swollen by a bulge in the erratically moving output of
the North Sea sector. Indeed, when it suited its book, the Treasury was very
keen to emphasise non-oil GDP. We know from the CSO estimates that real GDP,
excluding oil, rose in real terms not by 3.8 per cent but by 3.2 per cent in
the year to the second quarter of 1994. The CSO does not publish estimates
for nominal GDP excluding oil; do-it-yourself arithmetic suggests that it
rose by just over 5 per cent  - which surely will be slow enough to satisfy
the cautious school.
Even now we are not yet in clear water. The true best objective for a
nominal policy framework is not nominal GDP itself, but a related measure
called domestic expenditure. This is only available at market prices and
includes oil. It has risen less than the GDP measure because it excludes net
exports (that is exports minus imports) which have been on an improving
trend. Indeed, the main reason for focusing on domestic expenditure is that
it leaves room for a balance of payments improvement without making that
improvement an objective of policy.
Thus the more national income figures are examined the more the economy
seems to be on a steady-as-she-goes-path. But it would be far too mechanical
an application of a way of thinking, intended for broad policy guidelines,
to go from here to denounce the recent half per cent rise in base rates.
Looking at the whole world economy, including commodity prices and exchange
rates, the balance of risks favoured a modest increase. If we look at the
CBI monthly trends survey, this shows that, despite the small temporary blip
in September, the rise in output is expected to accelerate and that the
efforts of firms to increase prices are also slightly stronger. Both forces
make a modest acceleration in aggregate spending seem more likely than a
deceleration. In addition, future revisions of GDP growth rates are more
likely to be upwards than downwards.
If the Bank of England wants to avoid excessive reliance on futurology, it
will pause before pressing for further base rate increasses. Instead, it
might try its hand at producing rough trend lines for nominal GDP and
related variables in more timely fashion than the official national income
figures.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Personal View: Trade winds that bode only good - Mexico's
President Carlos Salinas, vying to lead the World Trade Organisation,
outlines its tasks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By President CARLOS SALINAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was with a sense of relief and achievement that ministers and trade
officials from around the world signed the agreements of the Uruguay Round
in Marrakech five months ago. Seven years of difficult and often tense
negotiations were rewarded by a global commitment to protect and continue
nearly 50 years of successful multilateral trade policy.
The stakes were, and remain, huge. Trade has been the most powerful engine
of economic growth since the second world war, driving a global increase in
output and incomes. The resulting unprecedented prosperity - although it
still eludes many in developing countries - has been crucial to maintaining
the longest period of peace known to much of the world.
Trade is a central force in boosting economic activity, employment and
welfare. It is the cornerstone in the increasingly complex economic
interactions among the industrial countries and between these countries and
others.
The states of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have shown courage
in entering upon economic transition. To support their commitment to market
principles, these countries need secure and expanding outlets for their
products. They also need foreign investment which will only materialise if -
and to the extent that - export opportunities are available.
In Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia and the Pacific, countries which
have bravely worked to open their economies know that further progress, and
their potential as thriving markets, depends on further development of an
open, rules-based trading system. The poorest states, the sub-Saharan
countries, also urgently need opportunities to expand trade. Development in
this region is a priority for the world community.
All countries need the open, rules-based trading system that the Gatt has
represented in its half-century of existence. Failing to complete the
Uruguay Round would not merely have meant failure to move ahead on certain
trade issues; it would have shattered confidence in the entire system.
With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay talks, two important tasks lie
ahead. First, the participants who invested so much effort in reaching
agreement must ensure the accord becomes reality by ratifying it before the
end of the year. Otherwise, the Uruguay agreement risks becoming little more
than an historical footnote.
The process of ratification must be treated with the same determination as
the negotiations. To date, most participants - nearly 100 - have not
completed the internal processes necessary for ratification. Although the
deadline is three months away, it is disturbing that the pace appears slow
in a number of capitals. Efforts to solve any outstanding problems they are
experiencing should be intensified.
Second, Uruguay round signatories should start looking carefully at the
needs of the new system to ensure the World Trade Organisation (WTO)
functions effectively from the outset. Past experience has shown that the
effectiveness of the international trading system cannot be taken for
granted.
In this respect, the WTO must meet three basic conditions: it must be
representative, reliable and responsive.
First, membership of the new organisation must be representative of world
trade. Creating Gatt in 1948 with only 23 participants was appropriate,
given the relatively restricted trade flows of that time. But today, the
guiding principle should be universality - long the ideal of Gatt in which
123 countries, in all regions and at all stages of development, now
participate.
More than 20 countries, including Russia and the Ukraine, are currently
seeking admission into the multilateral trading system. Their producers,
traders and trading partners need the clarity, predictability and protection
that Gatt provides. We must all co-operate to ensure these countries are
admitted promptly and satisfactorily.
Second, a solid and successful World Trade Organisation must be a reliable
instrument and forum. In recent years, serious trade tensions have
threatened to erode the reliability - and thus the credibility - of Gatt.
Major improvements in the clarity of Gatt rules, the broadening of its
mandate and reform of its dispute settlement procedures will increase the
reliability of the multilateral trading system and help create a firm
foundation for the WTO.
National governments may sometimes see advantages in not meeting their
international obligations, and be tempted to act accordingly. This
temptation can be overcome only if countries are committed to the system and
realise that they share an interest in maintaining a rules-based regime.
Third, the trading system must be responsive to the evolving needs and
challenges that the international economy will always pose if it is to
retain political support.
This is nothing new: it is precisely through its adaptability that Gatt has
demonstrated its resilience. I refer to the important reinforcement of its
rules (on issues such as control of subsidies) through the Tokyo Round
codes; to the special provisions for developing countries introduced in the
1960s and 1970s; and to agreements reached in the area of agriculture and
textiles which became make-or-break issues in the integrated world economy
of the 1980s and 1990s, but which did not seem remotely possible only a few
years earlier.
Looking ahead, it is impossible to predict future challenges to world trade,
but some issues are clear. Certainly, the relationship between the
environment and trade is a priority. Governments, individually and
collectively, must work to increase environmental protection without
jeopardising the open and rules-based character of the future World Trade
Organisation. Moreover, the increased exposure of our economies to the full
force of international trade winds requires the gradual formulation of rules
and co-operative arrangements between nations on regulation and competition.
Solutions in these and other politically delicate areas will depend on
technical expertise and political engagement. Consensus-building will be a
key element in this process.
The relationships between members of the new World Trade Organisation will
become increasingly complex, as new countries join and existing members
develop into full participants. It is, therefore, imperative that the WTO
itself be effective, both technically and in its relations with members. It
should dedicate itself not to offering solutions - for this is up to member
governments - but to identifying options, to supporting bridge-building
efforts, and in this way facilitating consensus. For this we depend on the
highly qualified and dedicated Gatt staff, and on the legacy that Peter
Sutherland will leave behind.
Only three months remain before the birth of the World Trade Organisation.
Ratification of the Uruguay Round is a complex and delicate political
process that will demand skill and commitment from all participants. Yet
ratification - and I call for ratification now - is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for the success of the new organisation. All countries
must devote the highest possible level of engagement and support to ensuring
the World Trade Organisation functions effectively and successfully from the
outset.
Speaking for my country, Mexico, we are ready to contribute all our efforts
to the successful launch of the next 50 years of the international trading
system.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Industry must highlight abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER R WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Baxter's article ('UK alleges EC procurement malpractice',
September 23) identifies a number of the obstacles to the application of the
EC public procurement rules. However, it also underlines the general lack of
awareness of this area of the internal market rules.
There are now half a dozen public procurement directives (rather than a
single one), the earliest of which, covering the award of public works
contracts, has applied to UK authorities since July 1973, some 20 years
before the date indicated in the article. The latest directive, covering the
award of contracts for services by both public and private utilities, was to
have been implemented by July 1 this year. The UK has not yet done so and is
therefore itself not entirely above criticism.
The rules allow those unfairly excluded from a public tendering procedure to
apply to the national courts for an injunction suspending the procedure and
also provide for an award of damages. At the same time, the Department of
Trade and Industry and the European Commission are usually receptive to
complaints about failure to comply with the rules. It is largely up to
industry to highlight the abuses so that the institutions can act.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Meaning of 'undertaking' must be
clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Workers' rights' (September 21), refers to the real
problem with the operation of the Acquired Rights Directive, namely the
judgments of the European Court of Justice, including what you call the
famous (some would say 'infamous') Schmidt case. However, it reaches the
wrong conclusion.
There is no fundamental reason to scrap the directive - after all, it merely
places employees who are involved in the transfer of an undertaking in which
they work in a similar position to those who are employed by a company, the
ownership of which changes hands. The urgent need is to draw a clear,
unambiguous and, most importantly, European judge-proof boundary to the
meaning of 'undertaking' for these purposes.
The paragraph you have referred to in the revised directive seems unlikely
to achieve this. It is, in my view, necessary to import the concept of the
transfer of a business as a going concern, a concept which should be
relatively easy to translate into all legal systems of European Union
countries.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: The lottery - will it end in tears? / To some it could
mean a golden age, to others extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next year cash from Britain's national lottery will start to feed through to
help the arts and usher in a new cultural golden age. That is the scenario.
The reality could be that the arrival of the lottery will signal the closure
of many arts organisations in the UK, in particular those whose survival
depends upon getting lottery money. If their bids are unsuccessful, they
will see little point in struggling on.
Almost daily, redevelopment plans are announced that are totally dependent
on the lottery. This month alone in London the Riverside Studios launched a
Pounds 3.3m appeal; the ENO a Pounds 40m-plus refurbishment programme; and
the ICA a Pounds 25m drive next year.
These are on top of the Royal Opera House and the British Museum, both of
which are thinking big: Pounds 100m or so; the South Bank, with Pounds 65m;
Albertopolis at Pounds 150m - and on and on. Some of these started out as
millennium projects but they are already hedging their bets and winking at
the Arts Council's lottery department, which is bracing itself to receive up
to 30,000 applications when the floodgate opens on January 1.
In theory, with predictions of Pounds 150m a year for the arts from the
lottery at the start, rising to Pounds 320m, there will be plenty of money
to spread around. In practice, too many arts companies will seek help
immediately, and some will have their plans rejected. It might be better to
delay an application for aid.
One reason why the Arts Council lottery satraps will turn down a supplicant
is that they do not believe in the feasibility of its development plan. In
theory arts companies must find some matching money through their own
efforts: from local authorities, business, and private philanthropists. At
one time the government hoped for 50:50 deals but the likelihood of
conjuring up Pounds 150m a year from friends of the arts is obviously
nonsense.
The Arts Council is already lowering its targets, to 35 per cent
self-generated funds for large organisations, even less for smaller, but it
would still be be remarkable if many arts companies could raise such sums.
Many will fall at this hurdle.
Where will the self-generated money come from? Business is the obvious
answer, but companies will not want to scatter their funds around. Boards
might choose to support just Covent Garden or the National Theatre's modest
Pounds 4m appeal, or that of a local theatre or arts centre. There is also
the real danger that if they do rally round the arts on these capital
projects they will cut back on their sponsorship of performances, on backing
a new opera production or concert tour.
Rather belatedly, other companies are starting to realise that there must be
money to be made from these vast new lottery expenditures. Accountants Moore
Stephens has been quick off the mark in forming an arts and heritage group
under Stephen Clarke which will advise arts companies on how they can best
organise themselves to take advantage of lottery revenues. The Almeida, the
Young Vic and Stratford East have been advised on their management and
financial practices, and Moore Stephens is also helping the Lowry project in
Lancashire come up with a business plan.
The feeling is that the private sector will only help arts companies with
substantially more money if there is some commercial advantage for them. The
government is unlikely to offer tax breaks, so perhaps arts organisations
themselves could come up with some profit-sharing schemes.
The obvious example is brewers weighing in with cash for redevelopment in
return for bar and catering concessions in refurbished buildings. Computer
companies might also help if rewarded with the task of modernising the box
office system. Foreign touring by an arts organisation could interest a
corporate supporter keen to open up contacts in export markets.
Alternatively, companies might be attracted by the idea of debentures (which
famously got the Albert Hall built), or guarantees of free tickets for their
workforces, or having the new building carry a company name (like the
Toshiba link with the ICA announced this week), or space in the theatre or
opera house set aside for corporate use. The new Pounds 42m Royal Armories
in Leeds has attracted money from companies like 3i and Yorkshire
Electricity which feel that the museum, and the surrounding commercial
developments, could be profitable.
No one imagines that the financial return from funding arts regeneration
will be anywhere near usual business targets. But if directors and
shareholders can convince themselves that they are getting something in
return for their cash they might accept their wider responsibilities to the
community and to the cultural life of the nation.
One of Stephen Dorrell's first tasks as heritage minister will be to devise
ways in which the private sector can be encouraged to invest in this great
arts building boom. The alternative is for the guidelines to be ignored and
the lottery cash go to the worthy and the unworthy in the form of almost 100
per cent re-building grants, plus the essential endowment funds. For when
the splendid new buildings do emerge, the cost of staffing them, and filling
them with plays, music, and art worthy of the setting, will have to come
from somewhere.
One thing already seems obvious: the larger organisations will have a head
start over the smaller, not only because they are more commercially
sophisticated but because they can call on more influential names to head
their appeals. One of the incidental joys of the whole process will be to
see how these grandees perform as fund-raisers.
Will that scion of the great and the good, Sir Claus Moser, who heads the
British Museum's ambitious Pounds 100m redevelopment plan (Princess Margaret
is patron) steal a march over ex-Tory party money man Shaun Woodward, who is
master-minding the ENO capital project and is married to a Sainsbury. Now is
the time to nab your mover and shaker.
It could all end in tears. There are some who do not believe that these vast
new sums will emerge from thin air. What if the lottery is a disappointment
and the British public sticks to gambling on the horses and the football
pools? Last week, John Major nailed his colours to the lottery mast. If the
lottery does not provide the anticipated cash, optimists expect the
government to make it work with tax breaks or lavish endowment funding.
Pessimists, however, fear that it might all end in tears.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: Brindisi, 10 years on - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though it has reached its 10th anniversary, the members of the Brindisi
String Quartet are still quite young. Without making any great splash along
the way, it has become known among aficionados of the medium as one of
Britain's best quartets. It played at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday.
Expert, judicious, selflessly intent upon the music and respectful of the
great performing tradition: thus far, one might suspect that the players
listen to other people's recordings more than is good for them. But they
also make a point of playing 20th-century music, often new works, and in the
classics - like Schubert's C major Quintet this time, with Anthony Pleeth as
second cello - their 'standard' readings are lit by the immediate grace and
conviction of their playing, and the lively balance of their collective
sound.
In the Schubert masterpiece, every major point in living, breathing sound
was registered; radical new insights would have been superfluous. Alban
Berg's op. 3 Quartet, however, demands committed individual imagination from
each player, and it got that in full measure, reinforcing my conviction that
this early-ish Berg work is one of the seminal - and most completely
realised - quartets of our century. Even its most consciously outre effects
have an exact expressive sense, which the Brindisi team regularly sought and
found.
It also revived the 1931 Quartet by the American Ruth Crawford Seeger (wife
of Charles, mother of Pete) to bracing effect. Ms Seeger, who died in 1953,
was a rigorous but highly inventive composer before she sacrificed her
career to her husband's musical interests. Her Quartet tingles with spiky
ideas, sharply carried through. In a feminist canon, it deserves a place
alongside Elizabeth MacConchy's and Sofia Gubaidulina's quartets.
The Brindisi's first violin is a woman, as it happens: Jacqueline Shave,
almost the only female leader of any established quartet. She is the ideal
prima inter pares - a democratic part-player among the other three (another
woman and two men), yet she wields quiet musical authority whenever the
score needs a dominant voice. We could do with more like her.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: Mascagni's 'L'amico Fritz' - Opera in Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no prizes for naming the composer of Cavalleria Rusticana. But
what other operas did Pietro Mascagni write? He completed Cav in 1889 at the
age of 26, and spent his remaining 55 years trying to emulate its success.
The comparative failure of his other works has given him the reputation of a
one-opera composer.
Now comes a production of L'amico Fritz which suggests that Mascagni's
talents went further. The Zurich Opera has brought together an
internationally-established tenor and soprano from Italy, Vincenzo La Scola
and Daniela Dessi, and framed their performances in a staging which is
pretty but never sentimental. The result is an evening of pure charm.
Mascagni was aware that some critics ascribed the runaway success of Cav to
the stark realism of its libretto. For his next opera, he deliberately chose
a weak subject - a rustic comedy set in Alsace - in order to highlight his
gifts as a composer. The big surprise of L'amico Fritz is how familiar the
tunes are.
There is an abundance of pastoral atmosphere, enriched by folk melody, an
off-stage chorus and instrumental lines of disarming grace. The whole opera
 -only 90 minutes - has a consistency of inspiration which more than
compensates for the flimsy plot.
Fritz is a wealthy, middle-aged bachelor who offers his vineyard to the
local rabbi as a wager that he will not marry. He promptly falls in love
with Suzel, daughter of one of his tenants. The vineyard is returned as a
wedding present, and all live happily ever after.
The gentle colours and idyllic setting of L'amico Fritz have more in common
with La Sonnambula than verismo and, like the Bellini, it depends on a
first-rate cast, a sensitive stage director and supportive conductor.
The Zurich Opera duly obliged. The production was staged in nearby
Winterthur, as part of a campaign to make the canton of Zurich (rather than
the city) responsible for funding the Zurich Opera House. There was no drop
in standard for the out-of-town venue.
As Fritz, La Scola hit every note confidently and stylishly, without a trace
of false emotion. The Italian tenor's performance was poetic, capturing the
shift in character from misogyny to self-doubt and open-hearted emotion.
He found a radiant partner in Dessi's Suzel. She may not be the bambina of
Fritz's description, but she was comely and demure, and her classic lirico
spinto soprano sounded in peak condition. There was strong support from the
rest of the small cast, particularly Stefania Kaluza in the trouser role of
Beppe.
Grischa Asagaroff's staging, designed by Marouan Dib and Jan Skalicky, was
admirably clear, but too brightly lit.
The Winterthur orchestra thrived on Manfred Honeck's direction. And despite
its modern, concrete appearance, the Theater am Stadtgarten contributed a
pleasantly warm acoustic.

All the television companies are desperately seeking successful new comedy
sitcoms and most of their efforts in recent years have been, frankly,
desperate. Nice Day at the Office (times vary BBC1), has promising
credentials. It stars Timothy Spall, Anna Massey and John Sessions. But
there seems little confidence that this contender, with Spall a computer
whiz-kid stuck in the data department of a big corporation, is going to set
the world alight. Panorama (9.30 BBC1) hits a sensitive nerve with a report
into golden handshakes. Why should senior executives, whose only
contribution to a company has been to create losses, walk away with vast
pay-offs while the workers collect their P40s? Financial probity is
something of a theme this evening. World in Action (8.30 ITV) examines
Knight Williams, the retirement specialists, whose affairs have aroused
criticism. Benny Green's cockney burr is not a voice you expect to hear on
Radio 3 - he is pure Radio 2 nostalgia - but he turns up there at 9.30 with
the first of a series on the London music hall, starting with its early
19th-century origins in eating houses.

FT  26 SEP 94 / People: Homing in on the vulnerable - In moving from Shelter
to the Consumers' Association, Sheila McKechnie tells Diane Summers, she
will still fight for the underdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheila McKechnie is characteristically blunt about the mistakes she made
when she took over nearly 10 years ago as director of Shelter, the British
housing charity.
A warm, noisy and energetic person, the 46-year-old Scot admits that the
restructuring she was forced to carry out might have been less painful if
she had been more experienced and better attuned to other people's
frailties.
'I completely underestimated people's insecurity. I'm a person who sees
change as the essence of life; dealing with people who got defensive in the
face of change was something I just didn't understand,' she says. 'I'm very
strong on strategic management . . . people management is not so strong.'
Her words may cause some hearts to sink at the Consumers' Association, the
organisation which, it has just been announced, McKechnie will take over in
January. More change and conflict will be the last things many of the staff
there will want.
The CA, best known as publisher of the 700,000-circulation consumer magazine
Which?, has had a rough ride recently, with open conflict between staff and
its abrasive current director, John Beishon, as well as public debate about
its role in the age of the increasingly sophisticated consumer.
But McKechnie will tread extremely carefully, especially at first. 'When
you're dealing with a very established organisation, the worst thing you can
do is go in and say everything that's been done in the past is wrong and you
want to change it.' She is respectful of the association's professionalism
and expertise - a sensible stance, since at present she cannot have much
more than an informed outsider's knowledge of many of the issues with which
the association deals.
Lack of technical knowledge will not hold her back for long, and any CA
boffins hoping to blind her with science should beware. McKechnie's
confidence is breathtaking. If she fails to grasp something you have just
said - well, it is likely to be your fault and you had better try again.
A regular on Question Time or Any Questions, she is bound to pop up again
within weeks of starting her new job and to sound utterly convincing in her
new role.
This confidence does not stem from a privileged background. She describes
her family as 'very ordinary Scottish working class'. She was born in
Falkirk (the local newspaper calls her The Battling Bairn) and was head girl
at the high school.
She was the first member of her family to go to university (Edinburgh) and,
after a degree in politics and history, did what many bright,
socially-conscious, vaguely leftwing people did at the time: she went to
work for a trade union. On the way she stopped off for an MA in industrial
relations at Warwick University and a year at Oxford on a research contract.
The union she joined was the tiny Wallpaper Workers' Union (wallpaper
printers, rather than painters and decorators). After a brief spell as a
Workers' Educational Association lecturer, she joined the white-collar
union, ASTMS, with which her smaller union had been in competition. The next
nine years were spent as national health and safety officer there before she
became director of Shelter.
At Shelter she initially earned a bit of a reputation as someone who
occasionally shouted first and asked questions later; there were some
sackings and resignations. Now she commands great respect among
professionals in the charity industry and enormous affection within Shelter,
which she has taken from fewer than 50 staff and a turnover of Pounds 1m to
around 250 staff and a turnover of about Pounds 10m.
Lingering criticism of her style does not bother her unduly. 'Anybody in my
position is going to have people who criticise them and say they're far too
directive and they've got too strong views. But then that's part of the
leadership role,' she says.
And Shelter needed leadership when she took over. 'I very quickly realised
that it was an organisation that had turned in on itself. Employees were
directing a lot of their attention to the inside of the organisation and not
engaging with the issues,' she says. 'There was a very 1960s mentality.'
This held that everyone in the organisation should be highly principled and
compete to be on the left of everyone else. 'You made a statement, then got
into your bunker and pulled down the shutters.'
McKechnie has turned Shelter into a fast-response organisation offering
practical advice and services to homeless people, as well as campaigning on
topics such as repossessions forced on people who get behind with mortgage
payments.
It has also, she says, had to conduct the 'campaign of its life' to defend
existing legislation, which offers at least some protection to the most
vulnerable. The charity is probably more in the public eye than at any time
since the days of founder Des Wilson and the early TV film, Cathy Come Home.
Her successor, she says, will face a tough time. 'Nothing is going to change
substantially in this government's policies. There's also the possibility of
an attack on housing benefit, which could lead to much higher levels of
homelessness. None of the political parties has given housing the priority I
think it should have.'
She particularly objects to what she sees as the government's obsession with
owner-occupation. 'The British level of owner-occupation is incompatible
with a modern, well-functioning economy,' she reckons.
How does all this serious stuff fit in with best-buy pop-up toasters and the
other middle-class preoccupations of the average Which? reader?
McKechnie warms to her new theme. 'We are all consumers. People are having
to make big financial decisions about their future and their children's
future in a context where a lot of people are trying to tell them to do
things which are not in their interest. I feel very shocked about what's
happened in the financial services industry.' Anyway, she says, 'if you're
poor and your kettle breaks down after six months and you need another one,
it could be a financial disaster'.
Some weeks ago, John Beishon, the outgoing CA director, who feels he has
come under attack unfairly for trying to modernise the association, said in
a newspaper interview: 'I have a feeling there will be a terrible pressure
to go back to the way things were and to regard this (my tenure) as a
horrible nightmare.'
With the announcement of McKechnie's appointment, he says these fears have
vanished. CA's ruling council 'clearly resisted that pressure and has made a
very imaginative and bold appointment. The council asked me to give CA a
higher campaigning profile and to put it more in front of people as the
consumer champion - which I think I did. Now she's going to take it further
still and I think that's excellent.' There are those who find the
association already too strident, says Beishon. 'They're living in the past.
In the old days, influencing our society was done by phoning up a minister
because you'd been at school with him - and it always was a him. You had a
quiet lunch at the club and a few words were said. That world has gone.'
The Battling Bairn is the woman for the new one.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lars Thunell became one of Sweden's best travelled businessmen last year as
he scuttled round the world sorting out the problems left by the crisis at
Nordbanken, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
His new job as chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, one of the country's two main
insurers, will also give him opportunities for international troubleshooting
 -starting in the US where Trygg has run into deep problems with its Home
insurance affiliate.
Trygg has suffered big losses through its 64.5 per cent stake in Home, a
much bigger company, and it is anxious to reduce the burden by bringing in a
partner as soon as possible. Resolving this difficulty is probably Thunell's
top priority, although his wider task will be to restore Trygg's tarnished
reputation after the crisis in the Swedish financial sector.
Thunell, 46, is widely admired for his work at Securum, the 'bad bank'
loaded with Nordbanken's problem loans. He made it more than a pure
liquidating company by giving it an active role in maximising value. His
finest hour came last year when he played a vital part in engineering the
SKr16.6bn merger between Nobel Industries - in which Securum held 72.9 per
cent - and the Dutch chemicals group Akzo.
Not surprisingly, then, his new appointment was welcomed by the market,
which marked Trygg's shares higher. Whether it goes down as well with
Trygg's employees is another matter.
'I am good at changes, both at building up and cutting down,' said Thunell
with a slight hint of menace when he met the press last week. He also
suggested that the group should stick to what it does best - keeping its
domestic insurance customers satisfied.

FT  26 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Sweet move for Schapiro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the years, Robert Schapiro has won a reputation for boldness at
Monsanto, writes Richard Waters.
The man behind NutraSweet for most of the 1980s, Schapiro embarked on an
ambitious marketing plan for the artificial sweetener: he persuaded the
makers of food products that contained NutraSweet to carry his product's
logo on their packaging, creating a direct bond with consumers. Sales of the
sweetener soared.
Now 56, Schapiro has just been named the next chairman and chief executive
of the chemicals and drugs group, a job he takes on at the start of next
year. He follows Richard Mahoney who, at the age of 60 and after 12 years at
the top, has decided the time has come to step aside.
Wall Street will be looking for some more boldness from Schapiro in future.
In particular, a growing band of analysts and investors is looking for
Monsanto to sell the Searle drugs business, bought by Monsanto for Dollars
2.5bn in 1985. Without the range of drugs or the economies of scale of its
bigger competitors, Searle is seen as a weak competitor in a market which is
becoming increasingly dominated by big, institutional buyers.
Schapiro, himself a former boss of Searle, has yet to show his hand - though
he has said that the company may consider joint ventures or other alliances
with other drugs companies. Meanwhile, the stock market greeted news of his
promotion with an immediate 5 per cent rise in Monsanto's share price -
partly because it suggested that Mahoney believes this year the company
would reach his target return on equity of 20 per cent.

FT  26 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Llewellyn gives up Paris for
Lehman Bros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers clearly has a liking for talent grown in the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, writes Peter Norman.
It is appointing John Llewellyn, currently head of the private office of
OECD secretary general Jean-Claude Paye, to be its London-based head of
European economic research.
Llewellyn (below) will take up the post of managing director and chief
economist, Europe in January. He will step into shoes vacated by Gerry
Holtham, a former close colleague at the OECD, who moved this summer to head
the Institute of Public Policy Research, a left-of-centre think-tank in
London.
Llewellyn, 50, will manage a team of five economists in London and will
report to Allen Sinai, global chief economist of Lehman Brothers in New
York, and to senior management in London. He will have overall
responsibility for Lehman Brothers' pan-European research and for spreading
the company's economic message to its clients in Europe.
There, the contacts and experience acquired during 17 years at the OECD
should prove invaluable. While Llewellyn has acted as Paye's eminence grise
for the past five years, implementing the secretary general's policy inside
the organisation and liaising with member and non-member countries, the bulk
of his career in Paris has been more directly concerned with economic policy
and analysis.
He was deputy director of the social affairs directorate from 1986 to 1989
and head of the economics prospects division, editing the twice yearly
Economic Outlook, from 1978 to 1986.
Llewellyn, who has UK and New Zealand nationality and was a Cambridge
economics don before going to Paris, said he was drawn to Lehman because 'it
is the most global in outlook of the investment banks'.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Architecture: The tyranny of the few - Colin Amery attacks
the fashion for architectural contests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget any idea you might have had that architecture is something that
concerns people other than just architects. Just as you thought that the
tyranny of the few was being seriously challenged by the thinking majority,
something happens that forces you to think again. Any hope that the
commonsense views of the users of buildings were beginning to have an effect
on decision-makers is once again seen as an illusion.
The recently-announced result of the competition to find an architect for a
new Welsh Opera House in Cardiff is a temporary victory for a minority of
once-fashionable arbiters of taste. The selection of the architect Zaha
Hadid by, in my opinion, a misguided jury shows that the relentless
promotion of once-fashionable ideas continues apace.
Hadid is an archetypal member of that small group of international
architects who perform, largely for each other, as a kind of travelling
circus. The values they represent have little to do with local context, or
practicality.
For a long time they have been playing the part of a faded avant garde with
an attitude that is supposed to make anyone who has different views look
reactionary. The truth is that Hadid and her friends are now the
reactionaries, representing the kind of absurd architectural arrogance that
the public has long learned to distrust.
Her work - it goes without saying that there are practically no built
examples - is a late derivative of early 20th century Russian
Constructivism. Her design for the Opera House in Cardiff might have been
impressive as a student copy of a Constructivist painting, but as a building
it has no reality.
Her sources appear to be two-dimensional, and one can only hope that this
Cardiff Opera House remains that way. There is only a slim chance that it
will be built. It is only one among countless bidders for cash hand-outs
from Britain's soon-to-be-launched national lottery. As a result, it is
highly probable that Hadid's 'winning' entry will join the body of her
unbuilt work.
Her passing victory is itself a warning of the dangers of the fashion for
architectural competitions. As it happens, the public architectural
competition is probably here to stay. Already our masters in Brussels have
decreed that any public project with European funding has to be the subject
of a competition.
There is also talk in the fetid corridors of Britain's own arts bureaucracy
that lottery projects, including those to mark the millennium, will have to
undergo the scrutiny of politically correct architectural juries. It will be
jobs for the boys: fashionable friends of fashionable friends will dictate
architectural taste and the man in the street, or the user of the building,
is unlikely to get a look in.
There is real danger in this fashion for architectural competitions, because
the winner is inevitably determined by the composition of the jury. The
chance of a disinterested jury with adequate representation from people who
are not architects is very slim. It is clear that architect-led juries
attempt to baffle the layman with jargon and pseudo-science.
Juries are also much influenced by famous names and smooth talkers, and
often do not spend much time looking at plans.
There is a tendency for juries to be beguiled by the professional's
conceptual approach which they hope will somehow evolve into a good
building.
It was inevitable that Sir Richard Rogers would win the chance to plan the
revamping of the terrible South Bank, London's ugly arts centre on the
Thames. It was equally inevitable that he would attempt to seduce the jury
with a lot of talk about creating a 'people's palace'. We have already seen
his ideas for the Thames in an exhibition at the Royal Academy when a series
of what looked like oil refineries appeared to have sprouted along the
river's banks. His proposal to dress up the monsters on the South Bank in a
limited high-tech wardrobe looks superficial and unlikely to win that desert
many more friends.
One competition that particularly worries me is the one for the new Tate
Gallery of contemporary art to be housed inside the shell of the old
Bankside power station near London's Southwark Bridge. The names on the
short-list are due to be announced today, but the Tate's director, Nicholas
Serota, has almost certainly chosen his favourite.
Serota is known for his severe taste and his penchant for what is
internationally fashionable. He would like to see the austere Japanese
architect Tadeo Ando bring his abstract concrete vision to London. The risk
attached to the Bankside adventure is that the power station will become a
great unapproachable catafalque for contemporary art.
Unless the planning brief for the architectural competition insists upon a
friendly mix of uses for Bankside power station, it will become an isolated
monument full of arcane and unapproachable art in a part of London that is
miles from its friends upstream at the Tate.
I have no idea how the inevitable committees that will dole out the money to
be generated by Britain's national lottery are to be advised about
architecture. Are they happy to leave crucial decisions to the same old
architectural mafia which largely promotes its close friends? Will the users
be listened to? Or the man in the street?
Judging from recent competition results, I believe that the time has come to
realise that many winning schemes - which are often extremely expensive -
are the architectural equivalent of the emperor's new clothes.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Heart of the next consumer electronics thrust
 -Louise Kehoe reports on C-Cube, developer of the core technology for CD
video players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japan's leading electronics companies launch their consumer video CD
players in Tokyo next week, a small Silicon Valley semiconductor company
will be cheering them on.
JVC, Matsushita, Sony, Sharp and Denon are all customers of C-Cube
Microsystems, developer of the core digital compression technology for this
new generation of home video players, which promises to make the video
cassette (tape) as old hat as LP records.
C-Cube will supply a semiconductor chip that performs the critical task of
decoding or decompressing the digital video data stored on a compact disc.
Until now, such technology has been far more expensive or of lower
performance than that of tapes.
The C-Cube chip 'is the only extra logic device required to transform an
audio CD player into a video CD player,' says Alexandre Balkanski, 34, who
founded C-Cube six years ago. The incremental cost is only about Dollars 50,
he adds.
For the consumer electronics industry, the 'PlayCD' chip presents an
opportunity to revive sagging profits. It is 11 years since the introduction
of the audio CD, the last product to create a consumer electronics 'boom'.
Now the audio CD player market is heavily saturated and prices have declined
to the point where profit margins are thin.
'With just a small increment in technology, they have a whole new product,'
says Balkanski. The Japanese companies are determined to make Video CD a
success, he says, predicting sales of at least 1m units in the first 12
months. 'This is a red-hot product that will transform the home stereo into
a multimedia entertainment system. This is the beginning of a whole new
market.'
Video CD players are designed to be hooked up to a television set, like a
VCR, to play films, music videos or karaoke. The first Video CD players are
expected to sell for about Dollars 250-Dollars 400.
However, these products, which will make their debut in Japan next week, are
aimed primarily at karaoke fans and devotees of music videos. They can be
used to play full-length films, but the discs will each hold only about 70
minutes of video, so two discs are needed for a full-length feature film.
The picture quality will be about the same as a video tape.
It is the second wave of Video CD players, expected in about six months,
that is creating high excitement among multimedia experts. With improved
picture quality and the ability to cram a full-length film on to a single CD
these 'movie players' could seriously challenge video tape players.
Video CD players will not, however, be able to record TV programmes. Tapes
and CDs will probably therefore co-exist for many years, just as today's
audio systems typically include a CD player and cassette tape deck for
recording. Few doubt, however, that the CD will soon become the medium of
choice for pre-recorded video.
'The X-generation will love them,' says Rick Sizemore of Total Research in
Multimedia, an Arizona market research firm. He projects sales of up to 1m
Video CD players next year and 5m in 1996. The launch of the first consumer
oriented Video CD players could rocket C-Cube's sales (Dollars 23.7m last
year, and Dollars 18.6m in the first half of 1994) into a much higher orbit.
The company, which raised Dollars 37.4m from an initial public offering in
April, is beginning to attract Wall Street attention.
Analysts are projecting net earnings per share of about 70 cents for 1995,
on sales approaching Dollars 100m. 'We view C-Cube Microsystems as the
purest and best near-term play on deployment of digital multimedia into many
existing and yet-to-develop end markets,' analyst Alex Brown said in a
recent report on the company.
Currently, C-Cube has little competition in the emerging multimedia chip
market, although the company expects that the 'big boys' of the
semiconductor industry, including Motorola and the in-house chip operations
of Japan's consumer electronics leaders, will soon be nipping at its heels.
C-Cube subcontracts the fabrication of its products to other chip makers,
including Texas Instruments, one of the largest in the US. The company says
that it has no plans to invest in its own chip manufacturing facility,
preferring to concentrate its resources on chip design.
Even if Video CD does not take off as quickly as expected, C-Cube has other
irons in the multimedia fire. The company has developed a video 'encoder'
chip, used to compress video signals for digital satellite TV and cable TV
transmission. It also provides chips for multimedia personal computer add-on
circuit boards.
C-Cube chips are also used in the Panasonic 3DO home video game machine,
widely acclaimed for its superior graphics. The 3DO machines have been slow
to catch on in the US, largely because they are more than twice as expensive
as competing video game players from market leaders Nintendo and Sega.
However, C-Cube's latest chip will significantly reduce the price
difference, says Balkanski, giving manufacturers of 3DO machines an
opportunity to become real challengers in the video game market.
In the longer term, C-Cube hopes to supply chips for use in television 'set
top boxes', the units that will link TVs to future interactive services. In
this potentially very high volume market, C-Cube expects to face severe
competition.
But the company is not waiting for interactive TV to take off. The
multimedia trend has already created big opportunities, Balkanski believes.
'While others are talking about the future potential, we will be printing
money,' he says.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Business lead for caller identification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the hype about video-on-demand and home shopping, on past form it
was always likely that business, rather than residential applications, would
lead the march towards commercial multimedia services. So it is proving,
with the progressive integration of office personal computers with
telecommunications networks.
The video phone is a case in point. Most of those currently on offer are
windows-based systems which convert the PC into a video phone by means of an
appropriate 'card' and camera placed on top of the PC screen.
Another line of development is the rise of 'computer telephony integration'
(CTI) systems, which enable PCs to be used to process telephone calls. CTI
is advancing fast in the sales, marketing and customer support fields, where
there is strong and immediate corporate demand for enhanced methods of
dealing with phone-based business.
The introduction into the UK this autumn of 'calling line identification' -
a new phone facility which passes the number of the calling party to the
person being called before the call is answered - is set to give a
significant boost to computer telephony integration.
For businesses dealing with customers by phone, it will make it possible to
set up systems enabling telephone staff to summon customer records on the PC
screen before answering calls.
The race is on to provide low-cost CTI systems which can take advantage of
calling line identification, and to make them available to small and
medium-sized businesses which have as much to gain from them as those in the
large corporate sector.
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms company, claims to have made a low-cost breakthrough
this month with its 'PassageWay' products, developed jointly with Novell,
the US computer networking software supplier.
AT&amp;T's 'PassageWay Direct Connection' and 'PassageWay Telephony Services'
systems link the PC to the telephone line, making available a range of
windows-based functions. These include the provision of screen 'cards' on
customers, which can be displayed within seconds through calling-line
identification, and the ability to dial directly from the PC using a stored
data base.
The PC keeps a record of incoming and outgoing calls and all functions are
available at the click of a mouse.
The 'PassageWay' software is retailing at Pounds 475 per line.
However, users may also need new hardware to integrate their phone and PC
systems. This is available for less than Pounds 1,000 for a small business
that has less than 16 telephone lines.
A 50-workstation user licence is available for around Pounds 7,000.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Media Futures: France launches faster version of minitel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The minitel, France's teletext system, is getting faster as it gets older.
Tomorrow, France Telecom will unveil its minitel Vitesse Rapide, a system
which is eight times quicker than the 6.5m terminals already installed in
the country's households and businesses.
For the French state-owned telecoms operator it is an important step. 'We
regard it as one of the first moves towards multimedia and an information
superhighway,' says one official at the group.
The new terminals, which will cost less than FFr100 (Dollars 19) per month
to rent, will allow a significant increase in the capabilities of the
minitel network. For the first time, for example, service providers will be
able to send photographs to potential customers.
'If you are looking to buy a car or a house then you can have a photograph
sent immediately,' says a spokesman for France Telecom. Existing services
available on minitel will also be cheaper. By raising the system's speed
from 1,200 bytes per second to 9,600, the time needed for connection will be
sharply reduced.
Initially, the new service is expected to be aimed at business customers. In
time, it should find its place in French households as consumers demand a
broader range of multimedia services.
'There has been a long wait for a faster system,' says one analyst in Paris.
'There should be quite strong interest from corporate clients. But the rate
of penetration will depend on the quality of the system, particularly the
images and the number of new services it attracts.'
The high-speed minitel is not the only element in France Telecom's push
towards multimedia services. Earlier this year the company established a new
multimedia subsidiary, which has subsequently launched a range of services,
including a pay-per-view movie channel. An electronics games channel and an
home shopping channel have also been developed by the new subsidiary.
For minitel, the upgrade represents a new source of growth after 15 years of
service. There are now more than 23,000 services available on the minitel
system, from the basic telephone directory service to reservation facilities
for trains and airlines. But it faces increased competition with
communications and information networks, such as Internet, which operate on
personal computers.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Moscow fares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bus and subway fares in Moscow nearly doubled under a city order that took
effect last Friday.
Despite frequent fare rises, public transport has been one of the most
affordable services in the Russian capital and is used heavily. But the
current increases could bite into the wallets of low-income Muscovites.
A monthly transit pass that cost 10,000 roubles, or about Dollars 4, on
Thursday now costs 30,000 roubles, or about Dollars 13. One subway ride has
gone up from 150 roubles, roughly 6 US cents, to 250 roubles, or 10 US
cents, while a bus token has climbed to the same level from 130 roubles.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heathrow Airport insists there was no risk to the travelling public as a
result of a baggage handler contracting legionnaires' disease.
Low levels of the bacteria which causes the disease were discovered in a
crew restroom at Terminal 4 after KLM employee Chris Chittenden was taken
seriously ill three weeks ago.
Tests were carried out throughout the Heathrow site, but no action was taken
to warn travellers.
An airport spokesman denied there had been a risk to the public.
''It was an isolated incident. It was not detected in any area except a
staff area, so it was determined that there was no risk to passengers and no
need to inform them,' he said.
''We decontaminated the areas and as soon as we were satisfied, and the
Health and Safety Executive were satisfied, it was business as usual.''
A KLM spokeswoman said the rest area was out of bounds to the travelling
public. Its water supply had now been reconnected after decontamination.

International air travellers at Washington's Dulles airport are getting
cleared through customs more rapidly without any let-up in catching drug
smugglers, according to US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
Bentsen says it took an average 35 minutes to clear a passenger through
customs at Dulles in 1992, against five minutes now.
Inspectors are better trained to look for smugglers, he suggests, adding
that airlines are pointing officials towards likely smugglers.
There were nine large seizures of heroin totaling 16lb at the airport two
years ago, compared with 19 that yielded 59lb so far this year.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Virgin name change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Virgin Atlantic is renaming its full-fare economy Mid Class cabin Premium
Economy. An increasing number of passengers were becoming confused and angry
that they were not receiving a comprehensive business-class service when
flying Mid Class, writes Paul Betts.
The airline says research has revealed that some passengers and travel
agents considered Mid Class as the airline's business cabin, rather than a
superior product for passengers paying a full economy fare.
This confusion has left passengers feeling they are not getting their
money's worth. They have compared Mid Class unfavourably with business-class
services of other carriers, says Virgin. 'By giving it an economy tag, we
are signalling exactly what it is - a superior economy product,' says Ruth
Blakemore, Virgin Atlantic's marketing manager.
Mid Class, launched two years ago, offers separate check-in and cabin, more
seat room, free drinks and newspapers.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Price of free tickets - Airlines want to
change the emphasis of air mileage schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air mileage schemes have become something of a headache for the world's
airlines. Most leading airlines now offer a bonus or incentive scheme based
on the number of miles a passenger flies with it: even some of the old
communist bloc carriers have become involved, with Czechoslovak Airlines
running a frequent-flyer scheme, called OK Plus, for the past two years.
However, free tickets are an expensive way to keep the customers happy.
People still refer to a summer when Pan Am, the defunct US airline,
discovered that all its flights to Hawaii were filled by passengers claiming
free mileage awards. As a consequence, airlines are becoming increasingly
careful about the rewards they offer and the ways in which they administer
such schemes.
Swissair, for instance, which runs the Qualiflyer mileage scheme along with
Austrian Airlines and Crossair (and has reciprocal deals with Delta, SAS,
Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines), makes it clear that members claiming
free tickets may not be able to get on heavily booked flights. As a further
dampener, it warns: 'Your point of entry in a country need not be identical
with the airport at which you board your return flight.'
It is also keen to tempt you away from claiming an aircraft ticket of any
description. Instead of a free flight to New York, for example, your 75,000
mileage credits could be spent on an hour in a Swissair flight simulator,
two nights at the Lucknam Park hotel near Bath, or deep-sea diving in Lake
Geneva.
Japan Airlines, with its JAL Mileage Bank scheme, is similarly quick to
suggest that mileage credits can be spent on hotel accommodation, a
'European break', or a seating upgrade, rather than a ticket.
Even American Airlines, which was the first to introduce mileage credits in
1981, is clear that, however many credits you accrue on its AAdvantage
frequent-flyer programme, you cannot insist on any particular free flight in
return.
As the airline puts it: 'We have a sophisticated system to make sure that
flights don't get swamped with AAdvantage flyers.'
British Airways also evidently has this in mind with its Air Miles scheme.
In order to qualify for Air Miles on BA, you must be a member of the
Executive Club - a privilege earned by collecting Travel Points on BA
flights. You can then accrue Air Miles points only on fully flexible fares:
non-discounted, unrestricted, non-Apex tickets, which account for a minority
of tickets sold. The allowances, moreover, are not especially generous - a
one-way flight from London to Rome can net you 80 Air Miles, but it will
cost you 1,900 Air Miles for a free return ticket to the same destination.
And you may not be able to fly when you want to.
Travel Points, however - which entitle you to Executive Club membership,
access to the executive lounges and other benefits - are relatively easy to
pick up. A handful of flights to the US and you could at once become a
Silver Tier Executive Club member. BA wants to take the emphasis off free
flights and turn Air Miles from a something-for-nothing promotional device
into part of a larger strategy to keep customers loyal. As BA puts it: 'It's
more a thank you for travelling with us.'
This is clearly the trend. As an industry spokesman observed: 'In a perfect
world, many airlines wish they weren't in the system. The problem is, it's
here and you have to finds ways to live with it.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Europe's most frequent and hardest-working
trippers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgians make more business trips than anyone else in Europe. The Greeks
make the fewest and, when they do travel, they work the shortest hours when
they arrive at their destination. These are some of the findings of a survey
conducted by Visa International, the payments organisation.
Visa surveyed more than 2,000 travelling readers of Executive Travel and
International Management magazines in 10 countries. The Belgians who
responded had made an average of 19.6 business trips in the past 12 months.
The second most active travellers were the Dutch, who had made 16.7. The
British were in third place, with 15.1 trips. At the other end of the scale,
the Greeks had made only 7.4 trips over the past 12 months. The Norwegians
were the second least active, with 10 trips.
The majority of travellers in the 10 countries - 54 per cent - said they
were now making the same number of business trips as in the previous 12
months. About 27 per cent said they were making more trips, while 19 per
cent said they were taking fewer. Most of the travellers who were making
more trips said the main reason was that their companies' performance had
improved.
While the Germans were not the most frequent travellers, making 15 trips in
12 months, they claimed to work the longest hours when they reached their
destination. On average, German business travellers said they worked 11.6
hours a day. The second most industrious business travellers were the Dutch
and the British, who both said they worked an average of 11.4 hours a day.
The French worked 11.2 hours a day.
Many travellers from the four hardest-working countries said they put in
even longer hours. Twenty per cent of the British, 24 per cent of the Dutch
and French and 25 per cent of the Germans worked more than 14 hours a day.
The most relaxed business travellers were the Greeks, who worked an average
of 9.9 hours a day when they were on business trips. They were followed by
the Spanish, who worked 10.3 hours.

Football. Tuesday, September 27: UEFA Cup, second round, second leg.
Wednesday, September 28: European Cup, Champions' League, round two.
Thursday, September 29: Cup Winners' Cup, second round, second leg. UEFA's
decision to play the three competitions on three separate nights to maximise
television revenue has upset Roman restaurateurs who complain that armchair
fans now only eat out on Mondays and Fridays.
This week's highlight comes on Wednesday when Manchester United revisit
Galatasaray, scene of one of their rare setbacks last season. That match was
followed by unpleasant outbreaks of jingoism on both sides. Will the bad
feelings persist among players, fans, club officials and, most importantly,
the Turkish police?
Ice Hockey. Saturday, October 1. The 78th season of National Hockey League,
north America's top ice hockey competition, is scheduled to start on
Saturday - maybe. The league has struggled for a decade to overcome its
reputation as the country cousin of professional team sports. Now it has
found a way to put itself instantly on a par with baseball. Gary Bettman,
the NHL commissioner, has threatened to lock the players out unless
they sign an agreement by Saturday.
Asian Games. Open Sunday October 2. The Asian sports jamboree in Hiroshima,
Japan, brings together more than 7,200 athletes from 42 countries competing
in 34 sports, and that's not counting politics and capitalism. Ma Junren,
the Chinese running coach, and sundry Taiwanese politicians threaten to
dominate the headlines with their off-field activities.
Chinese women runners coached by Ma broke a string of world records last
year. They will re-emerge for these games along with men coached by Ma and a
sales agent. Ma plans to use the games to market his secret (and
increasingly lucrative) elixirs. Their ingredients include herbs,
caterpillar fungus and turtle blood. They are, says Ma, partly responsible
for his runners' success.
China said it would boycott the games if Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's president,
attended the opening ceremony. The Olympic Council
of Asia solved the problem by deciding not to invite any non-Japanese
politicians. Taiwan has said that its officials will turn up anyway.

If I were Lennox Lewis, I shouldn't mind too much about losing my WBC
heavyweight championship to American Oliver McCall. I should think: I am a
multi-millionaire; I have kept my beauty and my brain intact; I have perhaps
done as well as any man ever did out of this dangerous, destructive sport. I
have simply lost a title, the currency of which is dropping faster than the
pound on Black Wednesday.
Boxing used to impress me more than any other sport. Before a fight I would
go through agonies of vicarious fear, unable to believe that two men were
about to face an unknown, possibly deadly fate.
I would watch the contest in a state of complete tension, willing and
dreading the moment when it would catch fire. In that moment - the sparking
of fists, the flare of energies, the sudden awareness that victory and
defeat had become absolute - the world blazed into life; then the moment
would pass into something vicious and bloody and I would hate what I was
watching.
However, its fascination was still irresistible. 'I'm going to the fight,' I
would say to myself and I would thrill and shudder at the thought at what
may lay within those words.
For the boxers of course, the sport still wields this huge and terrible
power. The second round punch that caused Lennox Lewis to stagger like a
drunk about the ring for about half a minute did, effectively, take away
from him his future and give it to Oliver McCall. But to the spectator - or
at least to me, to the taxi driver who took me to the fight, and to the man
who sat there next to me half asleep - the punch has lost its power.
It is now clear that when the world title split into four - the WBC, the WBA
the WBO and the IBF - it was destroyed. It is hard for spectators to believe
in the absolutes in victory and defeat when they know they are watching only
one quarter of an absolute. And, without that belief, the dignity and
significance of boxing disappears. All that is left is a pornographic
excitement, a power of dollars reaching higher than Don King's hair and the
print-out of a brain scan. An exposed myth, some people would no doubt say,
and they are probably right.
The symbol - and, to an extent, the architect - of what boxing has become is
Chris Eubank. Adopting what some think of as an ironic stance (so that's
what he's doing when he poses in the ring), he conceals a real lack of
ability with a show of honesty. He hates what he does, he tells us. He knows
that it is vicious and exploitative. He is only in it for the money. Thus he
gets his blows in first, forestalling criticism of yet another lacklustre
performance by telling us that he intended it to be lacklustre, that he is
intelligent enough to do only what is necessary in order to win.
And Chris Eubank is a tremendous draw. Crowds flock to his appalling fights.
By turning himself into a pastiche of the idea of a sporting celebrity, he
has become a sporting celebrity. He, and whoever invented his tremendously
clever persona, has given British boxing new life even as they help to
destroy it. At the Lewis-McCall fight, it even seemed to me that the crowd
had become a pastiche of a boxing crowd. Hitherto, whenever I have walked
into a fight arena the atmosphere has breathed out like that from a dragon;
but it failed to do so yesterday morning. I realised then that the images of
boxing, deprived of their dignity and significance, are tired, tired, tired.
The posse of tough men, in leather overcoats and sunglasses, shuffling round
the fighter as he makes his way into the ring - they looked tired. So did
the shrewd-eyed promoter with a fine spray of blood and sweat upon his
dinner jacket. So did the seen-it-all men with broken noses and Reggie Kray
accents. So did the bejewelled women, watching near-naked gladiators as if
they were models displaying the new collection from Chanel. So did Oliver
McCall, spitting like a sabre-toothed tiger, thrusting his victory at the
crowd with an aggression to which there was no possible response. They are
all tired. It is all burlesque, and not very entertaining burlesque at that.
In the minute after his knock out though, Lennox Lewis no longer seemed part
of the show. He stood in the ring, amid the people who had climbed
frantically through the ropes and were now wondering why they had done so.
And he looked a little surprised but entirely calm. No doubt the punch had
blunted his awareness, but his attitude still seemed remarkable for its
self-possession. Meanwhile, McCall, strapping around himself the WBC belt
that Lewis's posse had brought into the ring, looked like a thief who had
hit someone round the head in order to steal their property. It seemed then
as if boxing now confers the greater dignity upon the man who loses, rather
than the one who wins.

Ian Botham is being profiled by the BBC to mark the beginning of another
sponsored walk for leukaemia research, for which he has already raised
Pounds 5m. There is also an autobiography in the offing - no celebrity
agrees to major programmes these days without something to plug. In this
case however the self-promotion is forgivable - apart from the charity work
'Beefy' Botham can claim credit for leading England at 24 and notching up
over 5000 runs, 400 wickets and 100 test matches. Botham (Wednesday,
10.55-11.45pm, BBC1) examines the man's career from boyhood in Yeovil to his
retirement last year, and includes an appraisal of the 1981 series against
Australia and his relationship with 'blood brother' Viv Richards. The
programme doesn't shirk the sex and drug allegations that nearly ruined
Botham's career in 1986. Kathy Botham talks about living with a legend and
Bob Willis pays tribute to her. 'If Ian hadn't got married quite so early,
he would have ended up in prison,' he says.
They were going to call it Dead Belgians Don't Count as an indication of our
chauvinistic news values but it's just as well they changed the name to Drop
The Dead Donkey (Thursday, 10.00-10.30pm, C4) because Belgium now buys the
situation comedy from Channel Four and may not have found the joke so funny.
The writers have deliberately left long gaps between series so, although it
seems to have been around since of Reginald Bosanquet was still behind the
microphone, this is only the fourth series. Set in the newsroom of Globelink
Television, the programmes are recorded the day before transmission to keep
the jokes fresh and the final gags are often added half an hour before
transmission, giving this a topicality that adds to the generally high
laughter quotient.
The series that aims an icepick at icons takes a swing at Aristotle Onassis
and reveals a life that ranged from comedy, in the way he outwitted his
opponents, to Greek tragedy, in the way the House of Onassis has been dogged
by disaster. Reputations (Sunday, 9.30-10.30pm, BBC2) examines the tycoon's
life from his escape from the massacres in Turkey - during which the Onassis
family sufferred losses both of life and lucre - to the final days when he
was bowed by the sudden death of his only son. The love affairs with Eva
Peron, Maria Callas, Gloria Swanson and, most famously, Jackie Kennedy are
mentioned. The real scoop, however, is not the revelation that Onassis was a
wife-beater but that the White House was after him. Robert Maheu, the FBI
man hired to orchestrate the industrial espionage, claims that Richard Nixon
said: 'If you kill this son of a bitch don't do it on American shores.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / FT Guide to Britain's Nuclear Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week is the last for submissions to Britain's review of nuclear power.
What is the background?
Britain's nuclear power industry consists of 13 power stations (11 in
England, two in Scotland), accounting for about 25 per cent of all
UK-generated electricity. (Another two are being decommissioned and a
further one, Sizewell B, is due to come on stream shortly.) Originally the
intention was to privatise them along with the rest of the electricity
industry in 1989. But resistance by investors to the risks of nuclear power
made this impossible. Instead, nuclear power was put into two state-owned
companies, Nuclear Electric, covering England and Wales, and Scottish
Nuclear. The government pledged to review nuclear policy in five years'
time, to determine its future.
What will the review achieve?
The aim is to focus on prospects for nuclear power, examining economic and
commercial viability of new nuclear stations against the background of the
government's energy policy. The review will also examine options for
private-sector finance, and ponder privatisation. A separate review will
examine problems of nuclear waste.
What are the issues?
Capacity: Only one nuclear power station, Sizewell B, is under construction,
so a key question is whether any more should be built. By the end of the
1990s many first-generation Magnox reactors will be reaching their end.
Unless replacements are planned soon, the industry will start to shrink.
Nuclear Electric wants to start building Sizewell C and other stations soon.
Scottish Nuclear will need a new station around 2010. Economics: Since it
was placed on a commercial footing, the industry has boosted performance.
The cost of generating nuclear electricity has fallen sharply, but is still
higher on average than electricity from conventional power stations. Both
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear predict that nuclear power can become
fully commercial later this decade. Provisions: One of the biggest financial
drags is the cost of providing for the disposal of nuclear waste and of
de-commissioning power stations when they are retired from service. When the
two state companies were created, the government placed all these
liabilities with them, but did not provide money. In Nuclear Electric's
case, it set up the nuclear levy which will add about 10 per cent to
electricity bills until 1998; by then, provisions should be adequate,
according to the company. It also provided guarantees for Scottish Nuclear's
provisions, and arranged for it to receive an above-market price for its
electricity for five years. Privatisation cannot occur until this aspect is
dealt with in a way that satisfies investors. One possibility: the
government might assume responsibility for some of the past liabilities,
particularly those created by Magnox stations. Generation: Because nuclear
power stations cannot be started and shut down as easily as coal and
gas-fired, they qualify for base-load running: meeting the country's basic
day-to-day needs. But owing to their huge cost (about Pounds 3bn for
building Sizewell C), they would also need guaranteed supply contracts,
running for as much as 30 years, to satisfy potential backers. This
timescale is far beyond the present capacity of the electricity market, so
the government might have to guarantee such contracts beyond normal
commercial terms (say 15 years) as a condition for privatisation.
Does Britain need more nuclear power?
In capacity terms: no. The UK has a large surplus of power generation,
mainly because of the rapid growth of gas-fired stations. Coal-fired power
stations are also being shut. But the nuclear power industry warns that gas
prices could jump, and that gas could run out early next century. It also
claims a strong environmental case for nuclear.
What are the environmental issues?
With the UK committed by international treaty to cut harmful emissions,
there is a premium on 'clean' power sources. Nuclear stations emit virtually
no gases. The industry also points out that, once its provisions are made,
it will be the only power source paying the full cost of its environmental
impact. The real difficulty with nuclear power lies in waste disposal.
Britain has no lasting solution to this problem, though the government
favours deep burial. For now, waste is either stored in vaults on-site or
sent to Sellafield, in Cumbria, for reprocessing.
Can the nuclear power industry be privatised?
The two nuclear companies want to be privatised in order to escape political
manipulation and to diversify their activities. They also claim they will be
able to operate commercially. However, the City has doubts about viability
and risks. Prospects will depend on whether the government is prepared to
underwrite the industry in order to make it attractive to investors.

Summer is over, school is beginning. But just when you thought it was safe
to stop wondering what to do with the children, we get two 'What to do with
the children?' movies.
Britain and Australia battle for custody of the child-care problem film. But
Ken Loach's Ladybird Ladybird and Rolf De Heer's Bad Boy Bubby, both opening
this week, have as many differences as likenesses.
Homegrown Loach brings a dose of earnest docu-dramatics to his tale of a
multiple unmarried mother (Crissy Rock) fighting to stop her brood being
snatched by social workers. A true story and moments of power-acting; but
too often a tendentious script and overwrought directing.
The Dutch-Australian De Heer - more effectively - pours black comedy over
the surreal tale of a teenager who has spent his whole boyhood penned at
home by a possessive Mum. After a bout of parent-murder he breaks out into
the real world: only to find that reality is in short supply even here. As
well as bringing his own Martian's gaze to 'everyday' events, his air of
dazed innocence is taken as the sign of a Messiah by everyone from the
Salvation Army to a grunge rock band. Funny, satirical, highly inventive.
Having just broken out of another closed world myself - the Venice Film
Festival - I belatedly commend two recent UK openings. Richard Linklater's
Dazed And Confused is a period piece that never drowns in nostalgia. A
gaggle of 1976 American teenagers cope with sex, drugs, flared trousers and
other rites of passage, without ever forfeiting their, or our, rich sense of
an epoch's irony.
Ronald F. Maxwell's Gettysburg, reaching deeper into the epochs, is a 4 1/2
 hour Civil War epic, posted to the big screen from Turner Television. Much
better than most processed history; even if the budget for false beards
seems to have exceeded that for unflinching realism in the battle scenes.
For stay-at-home viewers, the best video releases are a golden oldie and
golden 'newie'. Mr Smith Goes To Washington (1939) is the best Frank Capra
comedy bar none: James Stewart as a rural hick filibustering for democracy
on Capitol Hill. And In The Line Of Fire has Clint Eastwood doing his bit
for Washington, as an ex-Dallas security cop suspensefully caught up in new
Presidential murder bid.

One of the biggest voices in opera tackles one of the most shocking roles in
the repertoire with the release of Jessye Norman's new recording of Richard
Strauss's Salome (Philips). There have been more sensual interpretations,
but few have matched Norman's grandeur, particularly in Salome's final,
blood-curdling address to the head of the Baptist. James Morris provides
solid support as Jochanaan, Seiji Ozawa directs a fluent performance from
the Staatskapelle Dresden.
There are not too many performers from the Woodstock festival who are still
producing fresh material but Carlos Santana, flanked by his brother Jorge
and their nephew Carlos Hermandez, keeps the flag flying with Brothers
(Island). The startling ambition of 'Transmutation/Industrial' soon settles
down into more familiar territory with all three clan members playing some
mean guitar, just like the old days. This latest mutation of Santana support
the album's release with dates in Manchester tonight and at the Labbatts
Apollo in London from September 28-30.
The young Milanese ensemble Il Giardino Armonico, who have helped to pioneer
the use of period instruments in their native country, release a
meticulously-researched version of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons (Teldec), a
performance full of nuance and shading which ranks with the finest.
Art school favourites Robert Fripp and David Sylvian join forces once again
for their third recorded collaboration with Damage (Virgin), a limited
edition (50,000) compact disc of a live performance from their 1993 World
Tour. Production and sound quality are exemplary, but the whole exercise
sounds a little antiseptic.
Massive Attack let all their heavy ammunition off early in Protection (Wild
Bunch). The album's opening and title track, featuring Tracey Thorn on
vocals, is by far the highlight of a set which too quickly settles into a
lazy, directionless groove and ends with a ludicrous live version of 'Light
My Fire'.
Talking of ludicrous, the vogue for opera 'theme' collections reaches new
heights of absurdity with Opera to Die For (Philips), a compilation of
admittedly wonderful arias by characters about to meet their maker. Probably
not one to play too much as the days get shorter.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Elizabeth Esteve-Coll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRIET ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elizabeth Esteve-Coll has been director of the Victoria and Albert, the UK's
national arts and design museum, since 1988, where she has instituted wide
management change. Before starting a career in librarianship and the arts,
she sailed the world with her Spanish-born naval husband.
You're allowed one item of office equipment besides telephone and fax.
I can't function without my Filofax - its popper keeps busting because it's
so full.
How would you cope? Would you still try to run the V&amp;A, or would you leave
the answerphone on?
I'm quite self-sufficient and practical. I would try to keep in touch, but I
would probably settle down to wallowing in peace and quiet. I do ring in to
the V&amp;A nearly every day if I'm away, but I also realise that no one is
indispensable.
You find a footprint in the sand: whose would you hope it was?
Francois Mitterrand has an amazing record of achievement both in the arts
and politics. As French president, he has focused on cultural monuments and
services, for which he will be remembered. He is also a very charming man.
If you couldn't return, what would you regret?
The V&amp;A has 20 1/2 acres of roof. Each year we get a bit done, and I would
like to have got that finished.
If you could retrieve one item from the V&amp;A collections as your ship went
down, what would it be?
Although it is not the most transcendental or beautiful thing in the museum,
I'd like to have the Great Bed of Ware. Said to have held 26 people, it
could be bed, shelter, life raft and even wildlife sanctuary.
What would you miss most?
I would miss staff and colleagues enormously - for their enthusiasm, passion
and commitment. They are world experts and you learn something new every
day.
You can take a film, a book and some music.
I'd take one of those wonderful multi-episode films. I love Marcel Pagnol's
work - his early Marius and Fanny are favourites - or I would take Jewel In
The Crown, as I love India. At last I would have time to finish reading A
Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth, and I would want to listen to a Gregorian chant
 -the Santo Domingo De Silos recording.
What food would you like?
Vast quantities of salad and very good oil, Spanish or Italian.
How would you get about?
On a fat, slow Dales pony. We could amble about the island, and I would get
a good view as well as having a companion.
What scheme would you spend your enforced leisure on?
I could spend the time having great thoughts about French Romanesque
sculpture, hypothesising on how the sculptures came to be where they are and
who made them. I would sneak along my many photographs of sculptures, and
papers on the subject.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Management: Dress codes and how to wear them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hanson does not like to see a speck of dandruff on the shoulders of his
colleagues. At the first sign of a receding hairline or bulging midriff he
sends them off to the in-house trichologist, or to the doctor to have their
cholesterol levels assessed.
This is one of the more interesting revelations in a new book about him by
journalists Alex Brummer and Roger Cowe. On the face of it, Lord Hanson's
feelings about dandruff do not matter one way or another. But what is
shocking in these post-paternalist times is a boss who involves himself
personally in the appearance of his staff.
On closer inspection, however, Hanson may just be doing what other companies
do less explicitly. Most employers do not have such meticulous standards,
yet they do have a dress code that communicates itself informally. Last week
Linklaters &amp; Paines made the headlines for withdrawing its ban on trousers
for its women solicitors. This was only remarkable in that the rules are
laid down; in other firms women - and men for that matter - learn what to
wear by looking at their colleagues.
I remember being outraged when a superior at my first employer, Morgan
Guaranty, took me aside for a word about my appearance. I should blow-dry my
hair, wear some make-up and buy one of those nice Brooks Brothers navy blue
suits, she advised. At the time I took this pep-talk as evidence that I was
working for an uptight American company set on crushing the individuality of
its employees. What I failed to see was that to disregard a company's
uniform is on a par with not getting to work on time.
There is nothing wrong with companies taking an interest in their workers'
wardrobes. After all, their staff are an important part of the corporate
image they are trying so desperately to project. However, it is better for
companies to take a lesson from Hanson and Linklaters and be as clear about
the uniform as possible. A visit to the trichologist or to Brooks Brothers
today is better than a missed promotion tomorrow.
Still on the subject of clothes, did you know that 90 per cent of British
blue-collar workers say there is nothing worse than having to wear a pair of
dirty overalls? I know this because I have just received a press release
from the Liverpool Business School telling me so. Yet I am puzzled. Why are
MBAs researching this sort of thing? On second glance it all becomes clear:
the sponsor for this 'research' was Johnson Group Cleaners.
This sort of pseudo-scientific survey is little more than a (poorly)
disguised means of advertising. Every week a fresh bundle lands in my
in-tray, each with an arresting 'fact' written across the top and a giveaway
sponsor's name across the bottom. Among the latest batch is one from a firm
of caterers claiming that 90 per cent of office workers think morale would
be transformed by a good staff canteen. Another shows that 83 per cent of
secretaries are bored rigid at work - this from a company that runs
secretarial training courses. My favourite is a survey that shows
headhunters are more widely used and give more satisfaction to their clients
than management consultants, accountants and most other advisers you can
think of. No prizes for guessing which profession conducted that survey.
Opinion polls are suspect at the best of times. But those that set out to
prove an often tenuous point are so obviously partial, it is surprising that
companies are optimistic enough to embark on them and that recipients are
naive enough to believe them.
Since I wrote about the tedious management books that sit unread on shelves,
I have received a copy of an Institute of Management survey that puts
managers' disregard of books in context. Less than 5 per cent of CEOs think
management books are a valuable source of ideas, although consultants, the
media, their customers or competitors are also given bottom marks for
inspiration. When CEOs want ideas it seems they depend on managers in their
own company, peers and even junior staff.
I was just getting excited about these findings, and the accompanying
warning that British bosses are urgently in need of external advice, when I
saw that the survey had been sponsored by Mitchell Phoenix, a consultant
specialising in developing chief executives.
In response to that article, I have also received enough management books to
fill a library from authors and publishers protesting that theirs are
anything but dull. Having flipped through some of these I do not feel
repentant, although I have learnt that the verb 'to manage' comes from a
French root referring to dressage exercises for horses. The dictionary says
that this use is obsolete, though I wonder if traces of it still remain at
Hanson.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Management: Taming the beast of H Street - Costs are being
cut at a World Bank critics claim is bloated and bureaucratic.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week Lewis Preston - president of the World Bank Group since 1991  -
dropped a little bombshell into the laps of his staff. Over the next three
years, he proposed, the budget should be cut at an annual rate of some 6 per
cent in real terms. Stringency has come to what its critics argue is a
bloated and over-bureaucratic leviathan. First-class air travel has already
gone. What might come next?
Preston's stringency is the latest element in a programme of internal
management reform progressively introduced since his arrival three years
ago. It goes well, for example, with dollar (or cash) budgeting, under which
senior managers are being given sums with which to achieve agreed
objectives.
The financial squeeze partly reflects Preston's appreciation of the chilly
climate. Some shareholders, notably the US, believe the Bank should share
the pain felt by public sectors everywhere. They note that between the
financial years 1990 (July 1989 to June 1990) and 1995, staff costs of the
Bank Group are expected to rise by 56 per cent to Dollars 878.8m (Pounds
556m), and overall costs to grow by 60 per cent to Dollars 1,420.3m. Total
administrative costs this year are larger than the gross domestic products
of several of the Bank Group's clients, Mozambique being an example.
So large an increase in expenses seems surprising, since lending activities
have stagnated for many years (see chart). Shahid Husain, the Bank's
recently-appointed vice-president for management and personnel services,
explains the rising costs by reference to three developments:
hugely expanded work on eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, little
of which has as yet borne fruit in lending;
expanded lending for the environment, which is relatively labour-intensive;
and
improved project implementation, following the Wapenhans report on that
topic.
These explanations provide a valuable reminder that the Bank's mission is
not to transfer money at minimum cost. But the president obviously feels
that things have gone too far, all the same. The question is how the
proposed squeeze on costs fits into his attempt to remedy the failures of
what he once judged among the most under-managed institutions he had
encountered.
The Bank's problem is not financial. The equity (paid in capital, plus
reserves) of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the
Bank's commercial lending arm, is Dollars 26.6bn, on which shareholder
governments demand no dividends. If the Bank were merely to earn a 5 per
cent real return on its capital, it would be able to support the current
level of administrative costs in perpetuity.
This huge subsidy must, however, be justified by performance. Here lies the
Bank's challenge. 'There has been a broad recognition, led by Preston, that
an institution like the Bank cannot keep on expanding,' says Husain. 'There
is also a consciousness that the Bank has to be managed. You don't simply
manage loans and you don't simply manage economic and sector work, but you
have to manage resources and people. Improvement in efficiency and reduction
of costs have to become an integral part of the work of the Bank.'
The task is made urgent by the criticism of the institution and by the
rapidity with which the world continues to change. The Bank's main long-term
mission is deemed to be the alleviation of poverty, above all in Africa and
South Asia, along with environmentally sustainable development. But around
this core the Bank must be 'tremendously mobile', in Husain's words.
Leviathan must learn to waltz.
Before Preston's arrival, the Bank had suffered two traumatic
re-organisations: one in 1972, the other in 1987. These focused on the
Bank's structure, rather than on its processes and procedures.
Husain says: 'We believe that large traumatic changes of the sort that took
place in 1987 leave behind so much debris that in the long run they are
self-defeating. One disadvantage of such infrequent large changes is that
people do not take change as a normal way of life. What we are trying to
inculcate, however, is the idea that since the world around us is changing
all the time, so must we.'
The other disadvantage, alluded to by Husain, is the effect on staff morale.
The World Bank employs highly qualified staff who believe in what the Bank
does, but dislike the institution itself. This problem of poor morale was
greatly exacerbated by the 1987 upheaval, in which staff were simply told to
scramble for new jobs, as in a giant game of musical chairs.
When Preston came to the Bank he found an organisation still shattered by
that event. This had reduced staff numbers by about 500 and created four
large, self-contained regional offices. The cuts proved to be temporary. The
number of regular staff, at 6,406 last June, can be compared with the 6,095
in June 1986, before reorganisation, and the 5,665 shortly afterwards.
The new structure coped quite well with narrowly regional challenges, such
as structural adjustment in Latin America and the growing involvement with
China. But Husain argues that this decentralised Bank 'could not serve us
well in providing a centrally-driven response to changes in the
international environment. For example, our work on the environment was slow
to take off. Our work on Russia and eastern Europe also took time to take
off. And above all we took a long time to recognise that the wind had
changed and that our constituents both in the developed and developing
countries expected much greater rigour in management and efficiency'.
Preston's initial effort was to strengthen the centre, by creating a
presidential office with three managing directors. He also established three
new central units in the areas of sustainable development, human resources
and promotion of the private sector.
A next stage was to strengthen the Bank's personnel and management function.
Husain says that 'in the course of the 1987 reorganisation there was an
almost total demolition of the central management and personnel capacity.
There was no unit that was concerned with business processes . . . (there
was) very poor capacity on organisation issues, poor capacity for
recruitment for an institution which basically has only one asset, its
people, and inadequate management of training and skills.'
The main emphasis has been on changing processes, but changes in processes
are expected to affect structure as well. This sequence - from process to
structure, rather than the other way around - is novel for the Bank.
It is now looking at specific parts of its organisation, one after the
other, asking first whether what is being done should be done, and second
whether things should be done in the way they are being done.
So far, the spotlight has shone on the East Asian regional office and on the
international economics department. Simultaneously, attention is being paid
to the administrative apparatus and information management. Market-testing
and contracting-out are among the buzz-words here.
The work has already been completed in one department of the East Asia
region. Attention will soon be turned to South Asia and Latin America.
Husain says: 'We hope to complete all this work in the next two years.'
Husain gives a telling example of what is involved by pointing to the Bank's
core function, lending for projects. 'In our old procedure, project officers
would first have preliminary ideas. They would write up these preliminary
ideas, which would be reviewed within the division, with people in support
departments, with the director and with the regional vice-president.
'The second step would be a final project summary, which would go through
the same review process. In the meantime, much project preparation would
take place. After this last review, a mission would be sent to appraise the
project. The mission would come back and would prepare an issues memorandum.
Again people would collect from around the Bank to look at those issues.
'Then the vice-president would give the go-ahead to write the appraisal
report. Thereupon, there would be negotiations with the borrower. When the
negotiations were completed, someone in the vice-president's office would
look at the final negotiated project, which would be sent to the Board for
approval.
'What we are doing in the case of East Asia is to have one simultaneous
review at a very early stage. We are going to do pilot projects on that
basis. The fundamental thesis is this: review things once; do things
simultaneously; do them faster.'
Husain admits that 'this may all seem minor, but every year we approve 250
projects. At any time, the World Bank is working on 1,000 projects. It also
spends massive amounts on economic and sector work. We believe it is through
this detailed re-engineering that we will get to the issue of cost and
efficiency. This will require delegation. It will involve a tremendous
amount of effort in selection of people and in training. It will also
require rationalisation of internal information and technology.'
The Bank is, in short, trying to get things right first time. For what has
effectively been a governmental bureaucracy, these are huge changes, with
radical implications for delegation and training, and for the quality of the
people doing the jobs, as opposed to those who manage the people who do the
jobs.
These efforts at improved internal management do appear significant. But
questions remain: over the effectiveness of the board, for example,
particularly in supervising the Bank's management; and over the effects on
the shaky morale and hunger for security of a staff whose opportunities
elsewhere are limited both by their experience at the Bank and by the G4
visa for foreign members, which prevents them from staying in the US. Husain
insists that forced redundancies should be unnecessary. Will that prove
correct?
Yet there remains a bigger question. How does an organisation whose aims
have included 'institution-building' justify the delay in attending to
itself? If the questions being asked now are the right ones, why were they
never asked before? Senior managers seem convinced that they have to be
answered decisively and effectively if the Bank is to enjoy a secure future.
They may well be right. They must hope that they are not already too late.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Defence workers to target Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A three-month campaign by trade unions over the latest round of defence cuts
will culminate next month when dockyard and naval-base workers will lobby
the Conservative party conference.
This will be followed on October 17 by lobbying of the Commons, when it is
due to debate the cuts.
The campaign started in July after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary,
announced savings of Pounds 750m a year with the loss of 18,000 jobs,
including 7,000 civilian posts, in Front Line First, his defence costs
study. The unions aim to persuade the government to undertake a full defence
review and do more to manage the structural changes in local economies.
Referring to the Commons debate, Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the
TGWU general union, said: 'We unashamedly want to influence the outcome.'
There was 'a sense of betrayal on the part of those we represent. They say
'I've served the nation well. Why am I rewarded by the sack?' '
Mr Dromey was speaking at a conference organised in Plymouth last week by
the south-west region of the Trades Union Congress as part of the campaign.
Workers from Devonport dockyard, where 850 further redundancies were
announced in the summer, were among those who attended. A similar conference
with Rosyth workers will be held by the Scottish TUC in Edinburgh on Friday.
Private meetings are being sought with Conservative MPs whose constituencies
include defence bases.
The unions are capitalising on the fact that the Tories have several
marginal seats in the south-west, regarded as the UK's most
defence-dependent region. Mr Dromey said: 'We want to put on the spot Tory
MPs. They should put constituents before their careers.'
Plymouth Business School estimates that nearly 20,000 defence-related jobs
have disappeared or are under threat in Devon and Cornwall.
Mr Dromey emphasised at the Plymouth conference that the unions did not
defend the status quo. 'Peace means change, but change should follow a
proper defence review to define the country's new role in the international
arena. Instead, the Treasury is calling the tune.'
In the south-west the union campaign has attracted broad support. Mr Robert
Hicks, Conservative MP for Cornwall South-East, told the conference: 'It
embarrasses me at times that we have this Treasury-led approach to defence
and security of the country. No one more than myself resents this price-tag
approach to central issues. I recognise the need for cost-effectiveness, but
you can take that too far.'
Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of Westcountry Development Corporation, a private
and public-sector partnership for regeneration, said the peace dividend had
to be welcomed, but funding had not been forthcoming to cope with the
structural change in Devon and Cornwall.
A study by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed the two counties received
much lower government spending than some other regions.
Mr Dancer said: 'The prime minister is now taking a particular interest and
has personally asked for a further report.'
Mr Paul Noon, deputy general secretary of the IPMS civil service union,
described Front Line First as 'a short-term view on how to achieve Pounds
750m savings on top of all the others in Options for Change (the white paper
on defence requirements).'
The Ministry of Defence admitted that it had not assessed the impact on
regional economies, he said.
Mr David Jamieson, Labour MP for Devonport, reinforced the point. He said:
'The most essential requirement is to have a full defence review.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Magazine avalanche engulfs shops: Newsagents are unhappy
with their wholesale agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Jackie Grafton at Jonathan's newsagents in East Dulwich, south London,
is wondering what to do with magazines such as Boards, Women &amp; Golf, and
Traction.
Although she never ordered them, they and other obscure titles keep
appearing in deliveries from her wholesaler.
She said: 'Every day I get loads of stuff I do not want, and it is just
sitting on my shelf.'
Mrs Grafton is not alone. Mrs Olive Heanue at Lucky News in Ilford, east
London, said: 'I have bundles of magazines that I could never sell. I could
practically open another shop with them.'
Other newsagents have also been complaining about the wholesaler practice of
routinely delivering unsolicited magazines to retailers.
Under terms set by WH Smith, John Menzies, Surridge Dawson and Johnson's,
the UK's four leading magazine wholesalers, retailers have to accept what
are known in the industry as 'box-outs' - new or promoted magazines - with
their regular orders.
The Association of Newspaper and Magazine Wholesalers is working with the
Periodical Publishers Association to develop a code of practice for magazine
sales, which it hopes to present to retailers soon.
Retailers are often required to pay for the magazines as many as three weeks
before they can sell them or are able to return unsold stock. That can
impose cashflow problems on some smaller newsagents.
Many retailers say that the wholesalers are guilty of poor record-keeping,
unpaid credits and bad judgment on the types of magazines they deliver in
the box-outs.
Mr John Rowe, director of wholesaler operations at the National Federation
of Retail Newsagents, said: 'The weight of anecdotal evidence is so
compelling as to demand investigation into the whole-salers' service
competence.'
Mr Ian Locks, chief executive of the PPA, said the magazine code of practice
was being prepared partly in response to a newspaper code which was drawn up
after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that some wholesaler
practices were operating against the public interest.
The newspaper code, which comes into effect in October, guarantees retailers
greater rights of access to newspapers if they meet certain conditions.
Publishers are concerned that a change in practices could endanger magazine
supply.
It is not clear whether the magazine code will address the newsagents'
complaints. Some wholesalers are already trying to increase communications
with their retailers. WH Smith, which supplies 43 per cent of the wholesale
market, is meeting independent retailers in 22 regions to gather opinions in
an initiative called the Independent Retailer Forum.
Both WH Smith and John Menzies, the second-largest wholesaler, with a market
share of 27 per cent, say they operate systems to accommodate retailers'
needs. New magazines are not randomly allocated but are supplied to
retailers based on sales of titles in related categories. If a new women's
fashion magazine were launched, for example, a computer would determine the
number of copies to distribute to a newsagent based on the retailer's
regular sales of magazines such as Elle or Vogue.
Mr Alex van Straubenzee of WH Smith said wholesalers were caught between the
competing interests of publishers and retailers, but admits that 'since 1988
we have been exclusively focused on publishers, so we have adopted an
amended strategy to take more notice of retailers'.
But Mr Shoaib Punjani, owner of Punjani's newsagent in Holland Park, west
London, said: 'The wholesalers do not listen to what we want. They look at
computer projections and assume that the news agent is ignorant. It is sheer
stupidity if they think that they have to hold our hands and tell us what we
want.'
The newsagents are afraid to play David to the wholesaler's Goliath. Mrs
Mina Patel, owner of S &amp; M Newsagents in Streatham, London, said: 'I have
tried to get some newsagents together. But some are afraid that the
wholesalers will stop sending them newspapers.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Energy efficiency 'unlikely to rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's plan to liberalise the domestic gas and electricity markets
later this decade is unlikely to result in greater energy efficiency, says a
report from the Energy Savings Trust and the Gas Consumers Council.
The report's authors found in a survey that consumers and suppliers were
sceptical about the concept of energy services packages, which are meant to
meet customers' needs 'through efficient energy production and supply, and
improved end-use energy efficiency'.
The report concludes: 'Customers are sceptical about energy efficiency or
energy services, or lack an understanding of the concept.'
The survey also found that three-quarters of energy suppliers believed that
competition would be based on prices.
Most dismissed the notion that energy-efficiency packages would be a big
feature of the competitive energy market, at least in the initial stages of
liberalisation.
One independent gas company said: 'Things will change as competition becomes
more fierce and companies look to add value. But this is a long way off. For
now the com-petition is about unit price.'
The report recommends that the government and energy industry regulators
continue to intervene in the market when it is fully opened to competition
in 1998 to ensure that 'energy efficiency is not relegated to the
sidelines'.
It says any measures taken to reduce the market dominance of British Gas or
the regional electricity companies should not hinder the ability of
suppliers to offer a range of services and different energy supplies on a
single contract and charge for them on one bill.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Island gains aid to refloat economy: James Buxton sees signs
of hope in one of Scotland's worst unemployment blackspots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bute, an island in the Firth of Clyde which was once popular with
holidaymakers but is now one of Scotland's worst unemployment blackspots,
has been chosen as a base for a company which provides teleworking services.
Telecom Service Centres will handle telephone inquiries and computer
processing for businesses which deal with customers over the telephone. It
aims to employ 70 people initially, rising to 150 in three years.
TSC's decision to set up in Rothesay, Bute's only town, has been made
possible by an initiative launched in 1989 to give the Highlands and Islands
a digital telecommunications network earlier than most other parts of
Britain.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, under chief executive Mr Iain Robertson,
is providing Pounds 450,000 in assistance to the Pounds 2.5m project and
building an Pounds 800,000 facility to house it.
Winning the project is the first achievement of an Pounds 11.4m programme
aimed at reversing the island's economic decline.
Rothesay's Victorian seafront makes a fine initial impact as the Caledonian
MacBrayne ferry approaches on its 30-minute journey from Wemyss Bay near
Greenock. But ashore the impression is of tackiness and decay.
A row of shops a few dozen yards from the pier is vacant. Many hotels need
refurbishment. A cinema on the front has been shut for 20 years.
There is a pleasant main square and an immaculate putting green with little
palm trees, but not far away are sites where demolition was carried out in
preparation for projects that never materialised.
A taxi driver said: 'People go abroad for their holidays nowadays.'
In the 1950s 400,000 people a year visited Rothesay, some to stay in the
hotels and guest houses, others on day trips 'doon the watter' by steamer
from Glasgow. Now the number is 100,000.
The population has fallen to 7,000 from 12,000 in 1951 and unemployment is
16 per cent. Apart from tourism there is a printed circuit board assembly
plant, a creamery and a small textiles factory.
The three-year development strategy says: 'Business confidence is very low
and is allied to a great deal of scepticism. Potential is constrained by a
negative and pervasive factionalism.'
That strategy, led by the Bute Partnership of local authorities and Argyll
and the Islands Enterprise, involves reinvigorating businesses, creating new
visitor attractions, upgrading hotels and regenerating the centre of
Rothesay.
Mr James McMillan, vice-chairman of Bute Partnership, acknowledged that a
Pounds 30m plan for Bute launched in 1990 had fizzled out. But he added: 'To
those who say this place is done - that is tripe and disheartening.'
Why should TSC, formed by Scottish businessmen with a background in
marketing and information technology, want to go to Bute? One reason is the
ready availability of a well-educated labour force. Another is that Mr
Lennie Moffat, the Paisley-born managing director, is attracted by the
splendid scenery.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Faulty drainage system causing puddles in tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, which operates Channel tunnel services, yesterday confirmed that
small amounts of water had collected in the tunnel because of a faulty
drainage system, Charles Batchelor writes.
The company, which is expected to launch passenger services next week,
denied that the accumulation was serious.
Eurotunnel said the tunnel had been designed to leak slightly and that five
pumping stations had been built to deal with the water. For every kilometre
of tunnel there were 600 joints in the lining of the wall. In four places
the drain designed to take away excess water had become clogged with silt.
The company said: 'We didn't expect the clogging but it is a very minor
issue. We are talking about a bucket or two of water over a matter of
weeks.' Only three of the pumping stations have had to be used.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Late move to win priority for West Coast line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has launched a belated attempt to obtain priority status for
a flagship rail project from the European Union.
Supporters of the project said the initial failure to seek a priority
listing for the Pounds 500m West Coast mainline on the EU's programme of
trans-European networks could cost it European funding.
It could also make it more difficult to raise private-sector finance.
The Ecu220bn (Pounds 170bn) plan for a pan-European network of transport
links was launched last December by the European Commission. Its list of
schemes for priority treatment includes high-speed rail links in France,
Germany and Spain and motorways in Spain and Greece.
Local authorities and business groups along the 550-mile West Coast route
between London and Glasgow are furious about the government's failure to act
sooner and are campaigning vigorously for the project to be accorded
priority status.
Britain will try to persuade European Commission officials to add the
project to the priority list at a meeting planned for October 17. But there
are already 11 schemes on the list and other member states are also expected
to propose additions. Schemes agreed in October will be put to the EU summit
in Essen, Germany, in December.
Mr David Cole, economic director of Cumbria County Council, said: 'There is
a lot of campaigning to do to get it on the list because Spain, Portugal and
Italy also have projects they want included. The British government has not
been pushing vigorously enough.'
Private-sector and local authority backers of the Pounds 500m plan to
modernise the West Coast route are divided over the government's reasons for
failing to put the scheme forward earlier when it first had the chance.
Some said British officials might have been sticking too closely to the
formal eligibility guidelines. Others suggested it reflected the low
priority which the government gave to rail compared with road.
The West Coast rail project is intended to modernise the 30-year-old track
and signalling on the route.
A feasibility study is being carried out by Railtrack and WCML Development,
a private-sector consortium. A construction consortium will be selected by
competitive tender to start work next year.
Mr Tony Bradley, business policy manager at the Birmingham Chamber of
Commerce, said: 'It could have been put on the list earlier. We have been
lobbying for the project for the past three years and the list of
trans-European network schemes was only agreed in June.'
Priority status for the West Coast line would mean the project was eligible
for help with feasibility studies and other EU funding.

FT  26 SEP 94 / BR shuts down Continental freight service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail has closed a subsidiary set up to provide a container service
to continental Europe because it failed to find a buyer in the private
sector.
Haulmark European Transport was established two years ago to provide a
door-to-door service between European destinations. Containers were shipped
by road to a rail terminal or port and then con-tinued their journey by
ferry or through the Channel tunnel.
The company was put up for sale in March but failed to attract an acceptable
bid, either from outside or from its own management.
Industry sources said this was an indication of tough competition in the
transport sector, particularly in the growing field of road-rail transport.
Railfreight Distribution (RfD), the BR subsidiary which runs services to the
Continent, was unable to keep Haulmark going because there would have been a
conflict of interest between its own 'wholesale' activities, running full
trainloads, and Haulmark's operation, selling space on indi-vidual wagons,
the company said.
RfD denied that Haulmark had failed financially although freight industry
sources said the company was understood not to be making money. When it was
put up for sale earlier this year it had turnover of Pounds 12m and employed
19 people at its offices in Woking, Surrey.
Staff numbers have since fallen to 11 and they will be found alternative
employment in RfD.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (30): Fast-growing
sector - Paul Taylor on portable computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of portable computers have been one of the fastest growing segments of
the personal computer market over the past four years. The 'notebook'
computer, in particular, has become an important business tool and the de
facto standard for portable computing in the 1990s.
Advances in technology have enabled PC manufacturers to pack most if not all
of the functionality of a desktop PC into an A4-sized notebook package
priced at Pounds 1,500 or less. Today's notebook PCs weigh about 6lb, are
mostly powered by fast Intel 486 processors and have large hard disks,
colour screens and credit-card sized PCMICA expansion slots.
The main advances in recent years have included 'dual-scan' colour displays
making colour notebook PCs more affordable and easier to use with programmes
such as Microsoft's Windows.
In addition, battery life has been extended through the use of low-power
chips, power-saving features and improved battery technology. For example,
Dell Computer's new Latitude range includes an innovative dual Nickel Metal
Hydride (NiMH) battery option which effectively doubles battery life to a
maximum 13 hours.
However, as Jeffrey Goldberg, a Dataquest consultant, points out, relatively
few portable PC users actually use their machines while on the move and can
therefore usually plug their portables into a wall power outlet making
battery life less of an issue.
There is little doubt that business usage of portable computers is
increasing. When Dataquest asked corporate computer purchasing managers
across Europe whether any of their employees used portable PCs, 70 per cent
replied 'yes' with the UK and Germany showing the highest uptake. The three
largest groups of users were top executives and finance staff; sales and
marketing; and engineering and maintenance.
When respondents were asked whether employees were able to use their
portable PCs or data terminals for communicating with the office while
travelling, 32.5 per cent claimed at least some of their employees made use
of such a facility.
Most of these employees made their connection over the public switched
telephone network although a quarter said they used cellular telephone
connections, 18.5 per cent used private or public mobile radio and a similar
proportion said they used mobile packet data services.
In the study, the most important uses listed for mobile data communications
were sending and receiving electronic mail, sending and receiving
facsimiles, transfering files, accessing purchase and inventory databases
and accessing customer and invoicing databases.
According to Dataquest, portable computer sales in Europe were worth Dollars
3.6bn last year and represented 17.4 per cent of the total European PC
market. In terms of unit shipments, portables represented 14.5 per cent of
the 10.3m PCs shipped in 1993.
Growth of the portable PC market has flattened since the 'boom' years
between 1990 and 1992. Nevertheless, Dataquest predicts that between 1993
and 1998 portable computer sales will grow by a compound annual rate of 23.4
per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent for desktop PCs.
Within the portable PC segment, notebook PC sales represent the lion's share
of the market and sales grew by just over 18 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
Slower growth in the notebook PC market in Europe has led to intensified
competition between manufacturers and to considerable consolidation. In
1991, the top four vendors represented 52.4 per cent of total sales, but by
1993 this had risen to just under 60 per cent.
Shipments of sub-notebook portable PCs  - typically weighing less than 4lb
 -are also growing quickly according to Dataquest, although with continued
miniaturisation the distinction between notebook and sub-notebook PCs is
likely to blur over time. At the other end of the scale, older style lap-top
PCs  - the second generation of portable PCs after 'transportables'  - are
all but defunct. Perhaps the most disappointing segment of the portable PC
market, after an initial flurry, has been the market for organisers,
personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other hand-held computing devices.
Although some expandable organisers, such as Psion's Series 3, have been
well received, Mr Golberg argues that wider acceptance of hand-held PCs is
dependent on the widespread availability of reasonably-priced
communications, in particular wireless networking, and on rationalisation
among the many competing platforms.
In the meantime, however, some hand-held computing devices, particularly
those with wireless communication features built in, have found niches in
vertical markets  - for example, for meter readers, traffic wardens and the
emergency services.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (29): Large-scale
development project - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Large-scale software development projects need especially rigorous project
management. When N. V. Nederlandse Gasunie, the Dutch gas distribution
utility, decided to update its operational control systems in the mid-1980s,
it recognised that it would need expert help.
'The project was about 170 man years and had over 100 people working
together to build the new system,' says Mr Theo Bakker, a principal
consultant at Gasunie.
'Although it is not the most complex system it was a very big project and
needed tight management.'
Gasunie buys and distributes gas throughout the Netherlands and exports it
to other European countries such as Germany and Italy. It uses automated
equipment to monitor and control operations on the national distribution
network.
The monitoring equipment records the temperature, pressure and flow of gas
through the pipelines and passes it to a computer network, controlled from a
central computer in Groningen. The data is passed to a Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which keeps track of the gas network and
issues commands to alter its state.
The new system had to replace both of these systems and bring them together
with two others: a system to monitor and administrate export contracts and
one to simulate the gas network for modelling purposes.
Gasunie turned to software company Logica to help construct the new system
and to use its experience of managing large-scale projects.
'Logica has a good record in project management and this was one of the main
reasons for taking them on. We split the responsibility for the project with
Logica taking about 70 per cent of the load,' says Mr Bakker.
He praises Logica's skills highly:
'They have a very structured approach with good quality assurance procedures
and controls. They have very good reporting mechanisms and always kept us up
to date and showed they know how to manage complex projects with a
technically-high standard. But most of all they have good discipline. I have
worked with many software companies that have the methods and the tools but
they don't have the discipline.'
The new system took over three years to build and was finally commissioned
in December 1992 to the satisfaction of the user. Mr Bakker says the system
is easy to maintain and very flexible:
'We decided to take on the maintenance ourselves. We had four people on the
development project team specifically to build up knowledge of the system
and do maintenance. Logica did it for the first year and now we do it all
ourselves.'
Despite the undoubted success of the Gasunie project, it was not perfect,
however. Mr Bakker notes: 'Logica failed to deliver it in the specified time
 - there was a delay of seven or eight months'.
Mr Martin Ashton, the project leader from Logica, points out that the delay
was at the beginning of the project and that it was known about well in
advance:
'It is such a big system and, although we new the design integration would
require a lot of work, we underestimated how long it would take. We managed
to compensate by delivering some parts of the system earlier than
scheduled,' he says.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (28): Surprises are
inevitable - Good project management still relies on tried and tested
principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building software applications is a little like carpentry, writes Philip
Manchester. Although the principles of shaping wood are universal, every
piece of wood is unique and the craft is in learning how to cope with the
unexpected.
Software development follows the same process and no matter how concise the
development method is, there are bound to be surprises. Modern project
management techniques aim to keep surprises to the minimum and be ready with
contingency plans if something goes wrong.
Over the past 30 years, software developers have found a variety of ways to
manage the construction of software. From the rigorous 'methodologies' and
computer-aided design tools to management and project reporting systems,
there is no shortage of tools for the job. But despite the availability of
the tools, good project management still relies on tried and tested
principles:
'There are plenty of tools around but it is hard to stop people being a
slave to them. We use the tools to gather information and see what works and
what doesn't. But there is no substitute for experience and skills,' says Mr
John Millar, technical director of Logica UK.
'The key to successful project engineering is to improve the literacy of our
staff and instil discipline.'
Logica's approach to managing large-scale projects aims to take the best
management practice and combine it with good automated tools:
'We focus on what we call micro methods. We have a framework which covers
the life-cycle of the project and make use of tools where necessary,' Mr
Millar explains.
However, he is, like many others, sceptical about an overly formal approach
to managing software development projects:
'At the end of the 1980s there was a lot of talk about methodologies solving
development problems. I think of them as the 'Lose fat while sleeping'
approach and I don't believe that it works. Some parts of the methodology
can be useful  - but I think it naive to see a simple way to solve the
problem,' Mr Millar says.
He goes on to say that Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method
(SSADM), one of the more successful methodologies, at least brought the
users of the system into the design approach.
'SSADM showed how important it was to get users involved and it has turned
out to be a useful way to describe systems.'
Other software developers are also finding user input during the project
design phase to be a significant step forward. Mr Keith Turner, a divisional
director software developer for Hoskyns Group, sees this as an inevitable
result of a change in the way software is built:
'Software development is more iterative now. Users have to be involved
because you need some form of open relationship with the customer. The more
you can work as a team, the more likely you are to be successful,' says Mr
Turner.
'Tools and methods can help but they cannot compensate for incompetence. You
must get the people right and the balance of team skills.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (31): Innovative
solution for couriers - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the so-called 'ring of steel' was thrown around the City of London in
1993 to prevent terrorist attacks it made it increasingly difficult for
courier companies to use vehicles for delivery and collection.
Federal Express, a market leader on the busy transatlantic route, came up
with an innovative solution  - it set up a team of 15 City Foot Couriers and
equipped them with the latest data communications hand-held computers from
Psion, operating over the Ram packet-switched mobile data network.
The Psion HC R400 hand-held radio data terminals combine a MS-dos compatible
computer and a radio packet modem in a single rugged battery-powered package
weighing less than 1kg and small enough to fit in a pocket.
The process of delivering and collecting packages is controlled by a
dispatch centre which sends messages to individual couriers. By scrolling
through a series of menus on the hand-held devide, couriers select an
appropriate response, informing the centre that the message has been
received and will be acted upon.
Federal Express has its own private mobile radio system for its fleet-based
operations, but this did not offer the same facility for data transmission
and has limited coverage.
Mr Graham Richie, manager for systems development, explained: 'The dispatch
and delivery system (Dads) we use for vehicle operations is PMR-based and
requires a licence to operate. It is also expensive to maintain.
'A large number of the banks, broking houses and blue chip companies in the
area enclosed by the 'ring of steel' are our customers. To maintain and
improve our service to them we needed a foot courier service with a more
flexible communications operation.
'The expense involved in extending the PMR system was prohibitive; the Ram
Mobile Data solution was the most cost-effective, reliable option and an
important enhancement to our intercontinental service.'
Federal Express tested the mobile data solution over several months using
separate hand-held computers and modems. As soon as the Psion HC R400
integrated unit was available in August, the decision to roll-out was taken.
Because the operations manager can keep tabs on all couriers, he can monitor
workloads and change schedules to maximise the number of deliveries each
individual can make. Federal Express expects to increase productivity with
some couriers making 50-60 drops before midday.
Customers benefit from faster, more accurate information on the status of
their consignments  - once a parcel has been delivered the courier can key
proof of delivery into the Psion which then links to the central system to
update the sender.
Psion and Federal Express worked closely together to integrate the mobile
terminals with the host application using Psion's generic application
programming interface (API), Universal Radio Interface (URI), which handles
the communications over the Ram network.
URI 'talks' to the Dads host from a PC gateway and to the mobile
applications running on the Psion devices. It manages the 'life' of a
message, alerting the dispatcher if customer service is going to fall
outside promised response times.
The success of the City implementation has prompted federal Express to
investigate the possibility of implementing the same system in its London
West End operations, which are experiencing increasing traffic flow
problems.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Road users fearful over report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Road users' organisations are fearful that a Royal Commission report on
transport issues expected in October will come down heavily in favour of
increased curbs on car use and road journeys.
They are concerned that the weight given to the report will increase
pressure on the government to limit roadbuilding and to increase the cost of
journeys.
The report is seen as giving a seal of approval to ideas expressed by the
traditional critics of government transport policy.
The British Road Federation said: 'The report will have a lot of status but
we fear it will not contain a lot of sense. The commission must understand
that roads and road transport are essential to our economy and to people's
quality of life.'
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has been reviewing transport
policy for the past 18 months. Its report is expected to contain more than
100 recommendations, including shifting the balance of spending towards
public transport, raising fuel taxes and charging cars to enter congested
city centres.
The Automobile Association hopes the report will not be unfair to the
motorist. It said: 'The car is necessary for people's freedom and mobility.'
Environmental groups said they would welcome a report which called for a
reduction in car use.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said: 'We anticipate the
report will be reasonably strong. In our evidence to the commission we
called for a proper, integrated transport policy.'
Friends of the Earth said: 'The problem is getting the government to do
something. We don't want a temporary alleviation of the problem. We want a
sea change in government thinking.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Pain localised as NHS moves from central bargaining: Lisa
Wood reports on the problems facing the unions' new breed of health service
pay negotiators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Rosalind Waugh, a hospital radiographer, is one of a new breed of local
union pay negotiators in the National Health Service. It is a role she does
not savour.
She said: 'You are torn. On the one hand, you do not feel you have the time
to do the negotiations properly. On the other, you feel guilty about being
away from your patients.'
Local union negotiators, such as Mrs Waugh, who works at South Tees NHS
Trust in north-east England, are a minority. Only a handful of the 419 new
NHS trusts - which include community and ambulance services as well as
hospitals - conduct comprehensive pay bargaining at local level.
However, the Department of Health signalled in its evidence to the
independent pay review body which recommends the pay of nurses and midwives
that it wants all the trusts to break away from national systems of pay
determination. The department, backed by the Treasury, believes pay rates
that are entirely nationally determined leave NHS employers unable to
respond to local labour markets.
It is an agenda for change that many of the NHS trusts will be hard-pressed
to implement. Mr Ray Mailly, president of the Association of Health Care
Human Resource Managers, said: 'The agenda for trusts is very complex. Local
pay is one item on a list of about 30 priorities within trusts.' The
association told the pay review body that it could take trusts another
couple of years before they all had fully-fledged local pay arrangements.
The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts has told the pay
review body that it wants a two-tier system, with a nationally-based award -
preferably less than inflation - coupled to a second award determined by
local trusts.
But it has been difficult for the trusts, grappling with the NHS internal
market, to introduce local packages based on job evaluation and
performance-related pay for workers.
Mr Arthur Allen, for South Tees Trust, a hospital with 4,000 employees,
said: 'It hasn't been plain sailing. After two years we have only recently
got agreement with the unions.'
Mr Mailly added: 'It takes a lot of work to develop the capacity for local
pay bargaining. It is not just in terms of numbers of personnel dealing with
the issues but also developing information systems and technical support.'
In terms of outcome of local pay bargaining, unions such as Unison and the
Royal College of Nursing, which are the main representative bodies for the
UK's 600,000 nurses, say that their members have generally lost out.
Mr Allen of South Tees said: 'It's a complex picture. Job evaluation, for
example, has resulted in night nursing staff getting less than those on
national conditions while those on day shifts get more.'
Mrs Waugh, district secretary of the Society of Radiographers, said that in
her X-ray department there were winners and losers. 'It's slightly better in
terms of basic salaries for junior staff, but for senior grades there is a
drop with, for example, a reduction in remuneration for working emergency
duties.'
She added: 'The management is rushing headlong into this. But they and the
trade union representatives haven't got the expertise in negotiations. We've
been pitched into this - but we are health workers not full-time
negotiators.'

<TEXT>
Plans for a 100,000 sq ft extension of the Teesside Retail Park, an
out-of-town shopping scheme on the edge of Stockton-on-Tees, have been
rejected by the environment department.
Local authorities in Cleveland welcomed the decision as a significant step
in underlining the recent shift in government thinking towards promoting
town centres for retail investment.
The retail park is a Teesside Development Corporation scheme. Mr Duncan
Hall, the corporation's chief executive, said it was reviewing the situation
but remained confident the land would be developed.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Bank to allow paternity leave
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Co-operative Bank has decided to allow paternity leave for its 1,500
male staff. This will amount to a maximum of three months' unpaid absence
from the bank in line with the new European Union draft directive, which was
vetoed last week by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary.
Mr Terry Thomas, the bank's managing director, said: 'In the future when we
come to determining appropriate conditions of employment for staff we will
be looking more to European co-operative banks than to our rivals in this
country.'
He added that the cost of paternity leave to the bank would be marginal. The
bank will meet the pension contributions of staff on paternity leave and use
contract workers to fill the vacancies.

More people are taking two part-time jobs because they cannot find one
satisfactory full-time one, says the GMB general union.
The union's analysis of the employment department's Labour Force Survey also
found that almost all new jobs being generated are part-time.
Of the 68,354 new jobs in the second quarter of the year 65,219 were
part-time. The majority are in distribution and hotels and catering.
The survey shows there are 1,123,742 people in the workforce with two jobs
of whom 43 per cent are part-time in both jobs.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Pay deals near 4% expected next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average pay settlements next year are likely to rise to between 3 per cent
and 4 per cent, independent pay analyst Incomes Data Services says in its
annual review, David Goodhart writes.
Stronger economic growth is likely to bring with it much higher levels of
staff turnover, deferred from the recession, and the re-emergence of skill
shortages.
The review also says that pay settlements are likely to continue becoming
more complex and differentiated with the spread of profit-related pay,
all-merit reviews and additional performance awards, making it increasingly
difficult to assess how much a settlement is worth.
In the public sector, the government's pay bill freeze has created an
informal norm of pay rises at or around the rate of inflation. But the
report warns that it may be more difficult to achieve such outcomes in the
second year of the pay-bill freeze.
The report says: 'Labour markets are tightening in the south-east at a much
faster rate than in most of the rest of the country'. In areas such as
Cambridge, Bury St Edmunds, Crawley, Newbury and Winchester unemployment
rates are down to or below 5 per cent.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Universities want watchdog for standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
University vice-chancellors are calling for a national body to ensure that
standards of teaching and learning are maintained.
A discussion document prepared for this week's annual conference of the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals says that 'evidence that staff
may be adjusting degree standards to what students can achieve in three
years during which much of their time is in part-time paid work,' suggests
that UK universities have 'already started on the downward slope'.
It adds that the current system, which funds research and teaching
separately, 'unless radically altered, will lead to a gross deterioration in
the quality of the work of universities'.
The report follows criticism of degree classification standards by the
Higher Education Quality Council, the universities' self-regulating body. It
found that standards varied between universities and between faculties.
Its findings demonstrated little consistency and much variation in the
methods used across universities for classifying degrees.
They also showed that universities 'overwhelmingly relied upon individual
departments to draw up assessment and classification schemes without
developing or adopting common marking bands across faculties'.
The quality council raised 'serious concerns' about the adequacy of library
services due 'in the main to the great increases in student numbers'.
Student numbers have doubled as a proportion of the 18-year-old population
in the last five years. In spite of this expansion the proportion of
students gaining first-class honours has increased by 50 per cent.
In a report prepared by Professor Lewis Elton, of the University of Surrey,
vice-chancellors say the creation of a national teaching and learning board
is 'essential'.
Professor Elton says: 'The alternative is that in 20 years our universities
will resemble the worst of what we see, in say, Germany today - vastly
overcrowded lecture halls, no individual attention until a student's third
or fourth year, horrendous drop-out rates, a constant lengthening of course
completion, and a discouraged and despondent staff.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Yeltsin and Major review peacekeeping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIMITRY VOLKOV and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday reviewed a
range of peace-keeping operations, with emphasis on Bosnia.
Russia has aligned with the UK and other European countries in trying to
dissuade the US from seeking to lift the UN arms embargo and increase the
flow of arms to the Bosnian Moslems.
They also discussed next month's state visit by the Queen to Russia.
On the final day of his visit Mr Yeltsin described it as a weekend of
'useful and enjoyable' talks at Chequers, the prime minister's country
retreat.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, held more detailed but equally
informal talks with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, who
will accompany the president on his visit to the UN today.
The UN visit will be followed by a two-day summit in Washington with
President Bill Clinton.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will meet Mr Alexander
Shokin, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of international
economic affairs, in London today.
They will discuss prospects for trade and investment in the oil industry and
other areas.
Mr Major, speaking at Brize Norton military airport before Mr Yeltsin's
departure yesterday, praised the 'restraint and courage' shown by the
Russian leadership in recent months.
Mr Yeltsin replied that Russian peace-keeping efforts, often regarded with
suspicion in the west, were aimed at 'extinguishing fires and inter-ethnic
strife.'
Mr Yeltsin said that he was 'somewhat surprised' that western countries had
not come forward to participate in peace-keeping operations in areas such as
Moldova, Ossetia or Nagorno Karabakh, where Russia was mediating between
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Bosnia and Russian peacekeeping operations in the former soviet states of
the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to loom large in this
week's summit meeting with President Clinton.
But both sides will lay stress on ways of reducing trade barriers and
encouraging private investment, especially in areas of weakness, such as
telecommunications, agriculture and energy.
President Yeltsin will stress that Russian foreign policy is guided by
national interest, not ideology, when he makes his maiden speech at the UN
today.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Sale of Swans' assets speeds up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first shipbuilding-related asset of Swan Hunter to be sold by receivers
Price Waterhouse has been bought by a German shipbuilder.
The intellectual property rights of Swan Hunter Singapore have been acquired
by Lurssen for SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 87,000).
Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said the Singapore IPR package was the
result of a 'tidying up' to split the intellectual property assets of Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, from its Singapore
subsidiary. The Singapore IPR consisted of old designs, he said, but was
useful to Lurssen for its logistic support and supply services in the Far
East.
Swan Hunter's main IPR package has already attracted bidders, believed to
include Lurssen's UK-based rival Vosper Thornycroft. The main IPR package is
certain to command a much higher price than the Singapore deal, especially
if, as seems likely, it includes the Swan Hunter name. If it does, the name
could go abroad, while the 134-year-old company would disappear from
Tyneside.
Until the IPR deal, which was concluded earlier this month but not made
public at the time, the receivers had concentrated on disposal of
non-shipbuilding assets. Their main sale so far has been a large employee
car park at Wallsend, already redeveloped as a Jobcentre and discount
supermarket.
This week marks an acceleration in Swans' rundown and the sale of assets.
Unions expect to hear today of about 200 redundancies, including almost all
the last 100 designers. Their loss ends hopes of a going-concern sale.
Without them, Swans cannot tender for work.
Organisation Management and Survey, based in Manchester, is heading a
consortium hoping to bid for Swans in its entirety, but this would be an
asset sale only, and time is running out.
Mr Horsfield said: 'If we don't get a firm funded offer by the end of the
month we will go ahead with piecemeal sales.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Blair's tax plans face leftwing challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour leftwingers yesterday threatened to disrupt Mr Tony Blair's
leadership honeymoon at next week's annual conference unless he drops plans
to rule out higher taxes.
And as taxation emerged as a key conference issue for both main parties,
rightwing Tories signalled plans to demand tax cuts at the Conservative
conference the following week.
Conservative strategists also expect a rightwing revolt over law and order,
although Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is expected to survive calls for
his resignation.
Labour officials said that Mr Blair and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor,
would 'flesh out' a fresh approach to taxation at an economic conference in
London tomorrow.
Mr Blair will confirm that Labour has no plans for higher taxation, except
for the very rich, who are believed to have benefited unfairly under the
Conservatives.
Labour strategists believe that the party's 'tax and spend' image must be
scrapped if it is to establish credibility among middle-class voters as the
party of economic competence.
However, leftwingers said taxation would be at the top of a list of issues
on which the leadership would be challenged, including minimum wages and the
role of trade unions.
A prominent member of the Campaign group of Labour MPs said: 'I think there
will be a row about what Blair has been saying on taxation.
'There is widespread concern that if he is going down that road, there will
be continued underfunding of health and welfare, and that is unacceptable.'
Shadow ministers say that the revolt will be contained by stressing Labour's
plans to cut the taxation of the lower paid, and cut out 'wasteful' spending
on unemployment.
One shadow minister said: 'I don't think there will be much trouble. People
were critical about Tony Blair's decision to attack the Tories on law and
order because it was seen as their natural territory, but there is now
almost complete agreement that he was right.'
Labour leaders believe that the party has been adequately prepared for a
shift to low taxation since the last general election, which many believe
turned on Labour's plans to raise taxes.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury chief secretary, will today release a
paper identifying scope for big cuts in 'wasteful' public spending which
could ease pressure on Labour's budget calculations.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday sought to head off rightwing
Tory demands for early tax cuts by insisting that the government could win
the next general election only through fiscal prudence.
He said on BBC television: 'When we cut taxes is going to be determined by
when public spending is so controlled and public borrowing is so reduced
that we can afford it. Everybody knows the Labour party could not do that.'
However, Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory
MPs, urged Mr Clarke to start cutting taxes in his November Budget. He said
on GMTV: 'Alas, Ken Clarke appears to have ruled that out. If he sticks with
that judgment, I'm afraid we are in for a bumpy political ride.'

The board, which decides how financial information is presented in the UK,
has issued a draft document for public comment on Financial Reporting
Standard 5.
It is also to allow syndicates of Lloyd's, the insurance market, an
additional two years to implement FRS 5 for existing financial reinsurance.
The standard, published in April, was designed to make company transactions
reflect their substance and not merely accord with legal form. Under the
standard Lloyd's syndicates would have had to change the way they accounted
for financial reinsurance contracts - such as time and distance policies -
used by syndicates to manage their reserves more effectively.
Adoption of the new standard would have caused a one-off loss to syndicates,
the annual joint ventures of Names which underwrite business at the market.
Lloyd's told the board that it planned two big developments - a reinsurance
company, NewCo, and the application of discounting to syndicates'
liabilities - and would welcome a deferment of FRS 5.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Skilled labour shortage 'hampers recruitment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small companies say a shortage of skilled labour is hampering their
recruitment efforts.
A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce and the business finance
specialist Alex Lawrie says as many as 39 per cent claim to be suffering
from a 'skills gap', with two-thirds citing the literacy of recruits as
their main problem. More than half said recruits suffered from poor
numeracy.
The survey included 487 companies, each employing fewer than 50 people.
Just more than a third of respondents said the cost of recruiting and
training staff was a barrier to their company's employment prospects.
Two-thirds said they had trouble in finding staff of the required calibre.
The survey found the single most important barrier to employment was 'low or
unpredictable demand in the economy', with 54 per cent citing this as their
most important difficulty.
Small companies said the most difficult jobs to fill were in
production/engineering (39 per cent), followed by marketing and sales (38
per cent). One in five reported difficulties in recruiting managerial or
secretarial staff.
Mr Richard Brown, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said
yesterday: 'The basic skills base has long been the Achilles heel of
long-term industrial success. If the government is looking to small firms to
hire people - and they are right to do so - it will be seriously
disappointed while so many barriers remain.'
Many small companies complained about the lack of flexibility and
adaptability among their employees as well as 'a scarcity of creativity and
imagination'. Only 13 per cent found that their local training and
enterprise council 'had been useful in identifying and meeting skills
needs'.
More than half the sample said the poverty trap was a barrier to employment,
with recruits being better off living on social security than with the kind
of pay package offered by small employers.
Just under 40 per cent cited direct wage costs as a barrier to job creation.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (26): Maintaining a
Victorian tradition - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The village of Saltaire in Yorkshire was created by Titus Salt  - a
Victorian philanthropic entrepreneur who believed that profit could be
attained without sacrificing good working conditions.
Derek Oliver, design manager at Pace Micro Communications, likes to think
his company maintains the pursuit of success in the tradition of Salt.
Pace is a Pounds 130m turnover company designing and manufacturing satellite
TV signal decoders and computer communications modems. Its headquarters are
in a textile mill built for Salt's empire in 1852. Pace's 150-strong design
team are located here, and a lot of thought has gone into their immediate
surroundings.
Most of these staff are engaged in Computer Aided Design (Cad), and spend
hours working at a terminal. Oliver hopes to get the most out of this time
by eliminating any cause for stress.
'Wherever possible we have installed anti-glare screens. The cheaper variety
only stop reflection, but we've gone for a high specification that shield
the user from radiation.'
Wrist supports may sound flippant, but Oliver is a convert. 'The angle of
the wrist when working on a standard keyboard can be quite steep. That tends
to put the wrist in quite a stressful position. Wrist supports mean it's
just a step up, a gradual run from the desk surface to the keyboard. They
are very very simple, but they have a significant effect.'
All fixed seating has been replaced by adjustable chairs. But according to
Oliver it is an original Victorian feature that does the most to promote a
productive working environment.
'The biggest plus point is the room we work in. It's large, open plan and
has lots of natural daylight. Everybody feels the benefit.' Pace has turned
its back on contemporary office design. 'We could put a lot of screening in
place and lower the ceiling. But we've kept the original dimensions.'
On a superficial basis, this is not an economical policy. 'From a heating
point of view it's not the most efficient way to do things. A purpose-built
office would be cheaper to run. But our workforce are happy with it, and
that cuts away at indirect stress.'
The benefits are difficult to quantify, but Pace has seen a difference. 'We
don't have a great deal of absenteeism on grounds of illness. People do take
less time off.'
Oliver is convinced that watching ergonomic and environmental factors has
kept his company ahead. 'It takes very little cost and effort to improve the
working environment tenfold. For a very small investment you can reap a lot
in terms of attitude to work. That in turn goes into getting a better
product, because everyone is pulling the same way.'
One measure of Pace's success is the fact that it manufactures electronic
goods in the UK for export to the Far East. Exports to Asia contributed to
1.2m satellite decoding systems sold last year. So a well-planned workplace
can contribute to survival in the most competitive of markets.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (27): A pioneer in the
DIY community - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the highly competitive market for do-it-yourself in the UK, retailers are
continually looking to improve customer services while maintaining tight
margins and reducing operational costs.
Wickes, the timber, building materials and home improvement products group,
turned to International Network Services in 1986 for a system which would
enhance its business processes and practices. Since then Wickes has become a
pioneer of EDI in the DIY community.
'EDI was a natural progression for Wickes, complementing sophisticated sales
and order processing applications already in use across the company,' says
Mr Andrew Hennell, financial accounts controller.
'Using INS-Tradernet, trading electronically has now become an essential
element of the company's IT processes.'
He says the benefits of electronic trading were immediate. 'Not only is it
far quicker than traditional paper-based ordering methods, it is also more
accurate. Reduced order lead times mean we can ensure that shelves are
neither empty of popular brands nor overstocked with lines that sell
slowly.'
Working alongside INS, Wickes initially approached several of its larger
volume suppliers to pilot the receipt of electronic orders. This was
followed by a progressive roll-out across the supplier base.
Wickes presently sends more than 10,000 electronic orders a month via the
INS EDI service to more than three-quarters of its suppliers. Order
information from the retail outlets is collected daily and consolidated
centrally on a PC system at Wickes' computer centre. Using INS' PC-based
software, Intercept-Plus, orders are transmitted overnight to suppliers via
INS-Tradernet, ready for collection and processing the next morning.
Using EDI, suppliers can process orders much more quickly and efficiently,
especially if the order data is passed directly into the supplier's sales
order processing system.
By fully integrating EDI with in-house systems, the paper flow is
dramatically reduced and the need to re-key information is eliminated.
Keen to extend its electronic trading, Wickes has also developed an in-house
invoice matching system. Invoice data is received and processed on an IBM
AS-400 system using INS' Intercept-400 software. It is then passed into
Wickes' in-house invoice processing application where it is matched for
errors and finally checked against the original order.
Wickes receives about 60 per cent of its invoices electronically. Mr Hennell
believes electronic trading speeds up the invoice cycle by as much as seven
days compared to traditional methods. Early receipt of invoices means
problems and mismatches can be addressed, saving time and resources and
enabling prompt payment for suppliers.
Recognising that not all suppliers have the resources to integrate EDI with
their in-house systems Wickes commissioned INS to produce a PC-based
application system which enables users to generate invoices simply and
accurately from order data received.
'The hardest part, always, is convincing suppliers that electronic commerce
is a worthwhile investment,' says Mr Hennell. 'On the whole, our suppliers
have been very co-operative. . . however there are still a handful of our
smaller suppliers who remain concerned by the initial commitment.'
In order to make EDI more accessible to the smaller volume and expense
account suppliers  - those who provide services as opposed to resaleable
stock  - INS provided Wickes with a unique trading community called
WickesNet last year which is based on INS-Tradernet but offers suppliers a
low-cost, tailored EDI solution for invoicing and electronic mail.
Wickes has recently linked its internal financial network to the INS-Mail
service, enabling store and head office employees to exchange textual
information, such as order-invoice queries and general memos on a
person-to-person level with customers and suppliers.
'E-Mail brings numerous benefits over traditional communications methods
such as facsimile, post and telephone,' says Mr Hennell. 'It is
instantaneous, cost-effective and since it eliminates the need for paper, is
environmentally friendlier, too.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (25): Raft of EC
regulations - Michael Dempsey reports on health and safety issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The closest most people come to practical ergonomics is a disembodied voice
telling airline passengers to adjust their seat back to the upright
position. But adapting office equipment to suit employees' health is fast
becoming an urgent issue.
The proliferation of computer workstations, demanding visual contact with a
flickering screen and myriad keystrokes, has provoked a raft of EC health
and safety regulations. Roger Wesson is a partner in City of London law firm
Allison &amp; Humphreys. Wesson, specialising in employment law, forsees serious
problems arising from the complacency of UK companies about ergonomics.
'Health and safety is no longer an issue you can leave to the office
administrator. It requires consideration at the board level. The EC display
screen equipment regulations are just as important as the hard hat rules on
a building site. The consequences of non-compliance can be very serious.'
The EC regulations recommend that employers fill out a detailed
questionnaire addressing such areas as screen glare, keyboard height,
adjustable seating and availability of footrests. The form even extends to
the suitability of software in attempting to assess screen displays.
While EC recommendations may seem remote, they are tied to very real
problems. Wesson reels off the successful actions against employers
involving computer-related ailments. Work-related upper limb disorders, more
commonly known as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), harm both sufferer and
employer. The Inland Revenue has paid Pounds 79,000 in an out-of-court
settlement to a female employee. It accepted that she was under pressure to
input data at an hourly rate with insufficient breaks while her desk and
chair were incorrectly positioned. The resulting injury to her arms forced
her to retire.
EC Directive 90/270 sets out minimum safety requirements for display screen
work. For example, screens should be flicker-free and easily adjustable.
These standards must apply to equipment installed after January 1993. For
workstations in use before that date employers have until December 1996 to
implement changes. Sanctions against non-compliance include fines of up to
Pounds 20,000 or imprisonment.
Successful prosecution can mean an individual disqualified from being a
director. One such case in the UK has already seen a director disqualified
for two years and fined Pounds 5,000. There are 6.5m workstations in the UK.
Surely bringing them all up to scratch will be an enormous undertaking?
The Health and Safety Executive claims that meeting these standards will
cost about Pounds 42 per workstation. This price should be offset against a
reduction in sick leave provoked by poor ergonomics.
Mike Lloyd, managing director of Sit Smart, a Guildford-based ergonomics
consultancy, points out that back pain, occasioned by poor seating, is
eating away at productivity. The number of man days lost through back pain
leapt from 62m in 1992 to 83m in 1993. 'The microcomputer is causing massive
back problems', says Lloyd. 'If I can stop a guy being off sick for two
weeks, that will cover the price of new seating.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (24): Benefits fuel
growth - Electronic Data Interchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The integration of the office personal computer with telecommunications
systems over the past decade has begun to make paper-free electronic
trading, or 'electronic commerce,' a real possibility, writes Paul Taylor.
Electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail, both value-added
network services (Vans), provide the basis for electronic commerce. EDI
enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange
business documents such as orders and invoices using standard electronic
forms and their own computers linked via a telecommunications service
provider.
The service provider acts like a central post office, routing the documents
and messages to their destination and handling any 'data translation' needed
between different computers or message standards.
'EDI improves the speed and accuracy of the business process,' says Mr John
Thorpe, managing director of International Network Services (INS) which
claims about 65 per cent of the UK market for EDI. Typically he says a
company introduces EDI because it saves money on stock and administration.
These benefits have fuelled growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it
originated, and more recently Europe. Ovum, the technology consultancy,
estimated last year that the EDI market in Europe, including customer
software and support, will triple in size from just under Ecu200m in 1992 to
about Ecu600m in 1997.
The UK, France and the Netherlands are the most mature EDI markets in Europe
although other nations including Austria, Italy and Spain are begining to
catch up. Germany lags behind in EDI implementation, arguably because of its
highly restrictive telecommunications regime.
Among the service providers in Europe the market leaders are IBM and General
Electric Information Services (Geis) which both have pan-European networks.
Geis, which recently acquired the 50 per cent of INS which it did not
already own, has about 35 per cent of the fragmented European market.
In the UK, standards are not a big issue, but outside Britain most domestic
EDI traffic has been based on industry-specific or proprietary application
protocols. According to one estimate, there are 26 different versions of
standards in the world, including 15 in Japanese. However, most new
user-communities are basing their services on an international standard
called Edifact  - and many existing communities using proprietary
application protocols are moving towards Edifact.
By 1997, Ovum predicts that 90 per cent of EDI traffic in Europe will be
based on the Edifact standard, compared with less than 50 per cent last
year.
In the UK where there are an estimated 10,000 EDI users, the market is
dominated by INS which was jointly owned by Geis and ICL until recently when
Geis bought out its partner  - a move which industry analysts suggest
signals the start of consolidation and internationalisation of the EDI
market. 'We are experiencing very rapid growth in terms of documents,' says
Mr Thorpe.
INS provides three main EDI 'communities,' INS-Tradanet, the main service
for retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and
Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector. The biggest, INS-Tradanet,
handles more than 6m documents a month for customers which include most of
the large high street retailers and their suppliers.
Mr Thorpe says that companies which have implemented an electronic trading
strategy are moving forward in two distinct ways. First, they are adding
additional document types, second they are reaching further and further down
the supply-customer chain.
Nevertheless, there is still plenty of room for growth since research
suggests that even among those companies which have signed up for EDI only a
small percentage are trading with more than 100 companies and many are
trading with fewer than 10.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (21): Progress has
been remarkably slow - Client-servers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Client-server has been a buzzword in the computer industry for several
years, yet progress towards introducing such systems has been remarkably
slow, writes George Black. Meanwhile, a backlash against the client-server
theory has already taken hold.
There are as many plausible definitions of the term as there are suppliers
claiming to be experts. Consultancy Butler Bloor's definition seems as good
as any: 'The splitting of applications between two or more computers, one of
which, the server, serves the others with information interactively.'
Many people use the term 'client-server' interchangeably with the older
'distributed systems', even though the latter would seem to be broader in
scope. 'Co-operative processing', which enjoyed a vogue for a while, is also
very close in meaning. 'Client-server' can be interpreted in many different
ways in practice: technologists use 'fat client, thin server' or 'thin
client, fat server' to describe different ways of dividing the code between
machines.
The client-server structure was intended to deliver a much more economical
use of computing power than the old mainframes and large minicomputers
linked to dumb terminals. These machines were very expensive and often
severely overloaded, while personal computers were cheap and not used for
much of the time. Mainframes could either be converted to database servers
or replaced by smaller machines acting as servers, with PCs taking over much
of the application's processing function.
For more than a decade now, software houses have been developing tools to
enable users to build client-server applications of the same complexity as
those which were running on mainframes. But according to Spikes CaveIl, a
market research company which tracks activities at UK user sites, although
many users are now experimenting in this area few are entrusting their
mission-critical applications to client-server systems.
'Right now, vendors would have you believe the trend is further advanced
than it is,' comments Mr Luke Spikes, managing director. 'These are small
and important developments, but not mainstream ones. If one of these goes
wrong, it will not be a major business issue.'
Many systems managers are still studying the issue and waiting for the
evaluation of pilot projects. They are generally concerned to determine what
type of network structure offers the greatest cost-saving without
jeopardising technical efficiency. Meanwhile, stories of failed
client-server projects and reports that the cost-savings may prove illusory
have been deterring users from major investments.
In some cases, users have found that much more mid-range hardware was
required than they had anticipated; in other cases they could not get the
performance required for lack of adequate software tools. Many managers feel
it is still too risky to embark on a mission-critical client-server system.
Mr Mike Evans, UK managing director of client-server tools developer Gupta,
says that many of the failures have been due to lack of experience in
building large systems, weakness of project management or confusion over
user requirements.
However, he argues that the case for choosing a client-server approach has
strengthened in the past couple of years because of the introduction of much
more powerful server hardware at lower prices. For some, it is the superior
user-friendliness of client-server systems which has persuaded them that the
risk is worth taking.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (22): Obstacles along
the ISO route - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even large users run into difficulties in trying to follow what they are
told are international standards. An example is Trafalgar House Engineering
Division, which includes John Brown Engineering.
It has won a clutch of awards for technological excellence and has been
committed to an open systems strategy for several years, yet it was
perplexed by a string of obstacles along the route prescribed by the ISO.
It set up an international network connecting all the company's 37 offices
in 12 countries, as well as a number of its suppliers and contractors. The
network supports a global database, which can be accessed by its engineers
and designers wherever they may be.
It disposed of 12 Unisys mainframes and substituted some 200 UNIX
workstations. To procure these machines it issued to UNIX vendors a list of
criteria for openness. From the replies it discovered that it could not be
sure of interoperability even though all the vendors claimed to offer open
systems. In the end it standardised on machines from Hewlett Packard and Sun
Microsystems.
To make such a complex network possible it stuck to what it considered to be
industry standards, among them TCP/IP, X400, the SQL database standard and
Microsoft's DOS operating system.
It preferred OSI standards where they existed but was willing to adopt de
facto ones where they did not, or make up its own where neither existed.
'OSI standards are necessary but not sufficient,' concludes Mr Jim Noble,
the division's information technology director.
'We adopted the official standards for ISDN (Integrated Service Digital
Network), X4OO and X21 but we still found that A did not talk to B because
the suppliers had interpreted the standards differently. So we had to knock
heads together.'
In some cases this proved possible  - Trafalgar House succeeded in
persuading BT and its Dutch counterpart to interpret standards in the same
way  - but now it is struggling to do the same in countries where achieving
compatibility is much harder, such as Vietnam, Puerto Rico and Kasakhstan.
Mr Noble says his company, like others, is getting to interoperability by
pragmatic steps. 'OSI was seen as the holy grail but it no longer is. TCP/IP
will do for us for the foreseeable future. We're prepared to set aside
principles in order to get effective solutions. We will look at X/Open
specifications for guidance, but we are not concerned to buy products that
have the X/Open brand.'
The X/Open interoperability brand will therefore be an important milestone,
but is not expected by users to resolve all their problems at once.
Interoperability is likely to preoccupy the industry for at least another
decade.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (20): Invented to meet
a need - George Black reviews developments in interoperability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interoperability is among the ugliest words coined by the computer industry,
but like many of its kind it was invented to meet a need.
It means something more than either compatibility or portability. Systems
can be compatible with each other without working together smoothly.
Software can be ported from one machine to another without allowing
applications to communicate effectively.
UNIX systems, for instance, have gained popularity partly because they are
more portable than the older proprietary systems, but this does not produce
instant interoperability.
XjOpen, the international promoter of open systems, is about to produce a
single specification for UNIX (known as Spec 1170) replacing existing
incompatible versions. This will improve portability, but will leave the
interoperability issue not solved.
The current X/Open brand, displayed by products which incorporate its XPG4
specifications, is a certificate of portability, not of interoperability.
X/Open plans to launch an interoperability brand during 1995, working more
closely than before with the Open Software Foundation consortium, previously
a competitor. The brand is likely to draw heavily on OSF's DCE (Distributed
Computing Environment) software.
For the past few years interoperability has been one of the main goals of
users, vendors and standards bodies alike. At its technical briefing this
summer X/Open stated that it would continue to be one of its main goals for
at least the next three years.
Some industry observers have the impression that interoperability is a
continually receding goal, but XjOpen insists that it is now in sight and
attainable.
Progress is slow because it depends on getting consensus among both vendors
and users. It can take 18 months from agreeing a requirement to publishing a
specification and a lot longer for vendors to market compliant products. The
complexity of testing new products creates a bottleneck and there is a
serious shortage of money to do all the work.
Mr Mike Lambert, chief technical officer of X/Open, defines interoperability
in non-technical terms as 'the ability of two different applications to do
something useful together.'
He says the main problem is not a technical one but concerns the way in
which computer systems are delivered, integrated and supported.
'Banks and government departments have the systems integration skills
in-house to cope with this, but many smaller users do not,' he says.
Interoperability depends on products complying with de jure and de facto
standards. That, however, begs a number of questions, most importantly what
constitutes a standard.
A couple of years ago X/Open intended the Open Systems 1nterconnection (OSI)
model of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to be the basis of
its brand.
It encouraged migration from unofficial protocols such as TCP/IP
(Transmission Control protocol/Internet Protocol) to official OSI standards.
But Mr Lambert acknowledges that the whole industry's emphasis has moved
away from de jure to de facto standards, such as TCP/IP.
Earlier this year, the Brussels-based standards Promotion and Applications
Group (SPAG) was forced to abandon its OSI interoperability testing
programme because demand for OSI products was not enough to finance the
venture. Its work may be taken over by X/Open.
Mr Lambert concedes that at the lower levels of communication OSI has failed
in the market, but argues that at the higher levels affecting
interoperability it has been successful. He cites the X400 messaging
standard as an example.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (23): User-friendly
system for care workers - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One organisation which has been installing a mission-critical client-server
system for its superior user-friendliness is Hampshire County Council's
Social Services Department.
It faced a statutory obligation to mount a new programme of care for people
in need and the council was required to identify all those who should be
covered by the scheme, assess their individual needs, prioritise those needs
and devise plans for services.
It decided to design a client-server system to ensure that all those
involved in providing care would be users of the system.
Its mainframes were mainly used by administrators but not by the
professional social workers themselves. The new system was based on
client-server principles so that it would be much easier for social workers
to use.
The council's servers are IBM and Amdahl mainframes at the Winchester and
Andover head offices, with IBM and Dellpersonal computers acting as local
database servers at 19 area offices.
The client machines are local area networks of PCs, which may be installed
at some 200 other sites around the county.
The mainframes run a single centralised Oracle database, from which data is
downloaded to the area servers running Gupta's SQLBase database. The Oracle
database is updated each night in batch mode.
Applications software was written by the Easams consultancy. The system
started to go live in April and by next spring will be supporting 460 users.
Dr Angela Oakley, the council's senior consultant who was responsible for
setting it up, says the early indications are that it is helping to improve
the efficiency of the service.
'Many social workers have a fear of computers, but within an hour or two of
using this system they are saying that they really like it,' she says.
'They will now spend much less of their time on bureaucracy and more on the
caring part of their work.'
She says that client-server is 'not a cheap, but a cost-effective solution.'
At worst, the new system will prove no more expensive than the centralised
alternative and it is far more powerful and flexible, she says.
She believes there is no other client-server system available for the same
application.
Several other local authorities have expressed an interest in buying the
software from Hampshire.
Dr Oakley says the viability of client-server solutions depends very much on
the type of application involved. 'Client-server is not a panacea for all
circumstances. There are all sorts of pitfalls. You need to understand
whether the application lends itself to this approach. If you need to
support several hundred concurrent users on one local database it probably
won't work.'
The other most important factor, she says, is the range of skills available
to the system's developer.
Mr Spikes confirms this and notes: 'the shortage of skills is one of the
main things which is holding people back now.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Asean members in dispute over free trade zone plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHIANG MAI, THAILAND, BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The six members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations are in
unusual disarray over a proposal to turn the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation group into a free trade zone by the year 2020.
The Asean members had hoped to form a united core within Apec, but that
received a setback at the weekend when their trade ministers admitted they
might not be able to agree on a common response to the free trade proposal,
which could figure prominently in next month's Apec summit in Jakarta.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister for international trade and industry,
undercut Asean reservations when he told Asean economic ministers meeting in
Chiang Mai that 'basically we are able to accept' the free trade proposal by
the so-called Eminent Persons Group of business people and academics
Asean ministers were forced to try to smooth over their differences at a
late-night press conference on Friday. The reference in the original draft
of the press statement that the ministers discussed the free trade report
'at length' was deleted in the final press release.
Thailand - like many Asian countries that have enjoyed relatively easy
access to the important US market - now fears that Washington will use the
proposal to open up Thailand's own increasingly important domestic market.
A senior Thai government official said Asean would need to examine 'the
hidden agenda inside the conditions tied to 2020'. Malaysia, which has long
railed against western domination of international trade, led calls for the
report to be shelved.
'The report is a good reference. . . but we cannot subscribe to very
long-term visions,' said Malaysia's trade and industry minister Rafidah
Aziz. However, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, Singapore's trade and industry minister,
said 'It is important for every organisation to have a vision of where you
want to go and where you want to be ultimately.'
And the Indonesian government argued that 'Asean is now strong enough to
face any liberalisation in this region. The problem is simply how do you
join this (free trade) bandwagon.'
Economic growth in Thailand is expected to accelerate this year and next,
but the government needs to tackle problems such as inadequate
infrastructure and shortages of skilled labour to ensure sustainable growth
in the future, the Thai planning agency said at the weekend, Victor Mallet
reports from Bangkok.
The state-run National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB)
predicted that real gross domestic product would grow 8.4 per cent this year
and 8.5 per cent in 1995, compared with 7.6 per cent in 1992 and 8.1 per
cent in 1993.
Inflation is expected to rise to 5 per cent this year from 3.3 per cent in
1993, but will probably drop slightly in 1995. Exports should rise 16.1 per
cent this year to Bt1,070bn (Pounds 29bn) and imports increase by 15 per
cent to Bt1,315bn.

FT  26 SEP 94 / New Mexican regime to follow old economic programme: Zedillo
will honour pact with business and labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The incoming Mexican government headed by Mr Ernesto Zedillo plans to follow
a conservative economic programme next year, to reduce inflation to 4 per
cent by maintaining the present exchange rate policy and running a balanced
budget.
The economic strategy was announced over the weekend as the current
government renewed the annual pact with business and labour unions that sets
economic policy for the next calender year. The pact was drawn up after long
consultations with Mr Zedillo's campaign team, who say they are in full
agreement with the accord, and intend to comply with it.
Uncertainty over renewal of the pact had led to recent volatility in
Mexico's money and foreign exchange markets, with speculation that Mr
Zedillo's administration would push for a more expansive fiscal policy and
faster depreciation of the currency against the dollar from the current rate
of 5 per cent a year, to boost economic growth. Until rumours of the pact
renewal reached the market on Friday, the peso was trading at 3.40 to the US
dollar, the top of its permitted band.
'The signal of all this is that stability won,' said a senior government
official involved in negotiations over the pact. Mr Zedillo, a former
central banker known for his aversion to fiscal deficits, formally takes
office on December 1, when he will have the opportunity to put some
finishing touches to the plan.
The agreement was signed by the newly independent central bank, whose credit
operations will be directed to achieving the inflation target of 4 per cent
next year. An official said the central bank's pledge, which could lead to
higher interest rates if inflation did not fall from current level of about
7 per cent, was the 'anchor' of the programme.
The Finance Ministry predicted that economic growth would rise to 3.6 per
cent in the second half of this year, industrial sector growth to 4.9 per
cent, and fixed gross investment by about 8 per cent. The unexpectedly
strong economic recovery influenced the decision to push for stability
rather than economic growth, according to officials. The pact aims for
economic growth of about 4 per cent for next year.
The pact allows for an increase in the minimum wage of 4 per cent plus the
average productivity growth in the economy. The lowest-paid workers will
have their take-home pay boosted by another 3 per cent. About 7 per cent of
Mexican workers earn the minimum wage, although the salary is used to set
prices and wages for other better-paid workers.
Unions agreed - under some pressure - to limit contractual wage increases to
4 per cent plus bonuses based on productivity increases achieved at the
plant level. With inflation this year expected to be close to 7 per cent,
and many sceptical that the government will meet its 4 per cent inflation
target, some union representatives complained their workers would be taking
real wage cuts.
The plan also provides for some modest measures to stimulate investment, as
Mr Zedillo had promised on the campaign trail. The measures include: a
reduction in the tax on assets for unprofitable companies from 2 to 1.8 per
cent; a four-year exemption from the tax for new investments; a faster
depreciation allowance for investment in training and anti-pollution
equipment; and an increase in the number of companies that can pay taxes on
a quarterly basis. In addition, the incoming government promised to put
money raised from future privatisations into a special fund to stimulate
private infrastructure spending.

FT  26 SEP 94 / North Korea digs in heels over N-talks: Pyongyang raises new
demands and protests at US military 'provocations'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US negotiators admitted at the weekend that talks with North Korea on its
nuclear facilities were making little headway, as Pyongyang repeated that it
would not accept international inspection of two suspect nuclear sites and
warned that US military exercises were 'provocations'.
The atmosphere at the talks has been further clouded by remarks by the US
Pacific Fleet Commander, Admiral Ronald Zlatoper, that US naval manoeuvres
off the Korean coast sent 'a very strong message' to North Korea comparable
with the pressure on Haiti's military leaders to step aside.
In a predictably angry reaction, North Korea's foreign ministry said the US
naval presence amounted to 'undisguised military provocations' that could
wreck the Geneva negotiations and end the freeze of the country's nuclear
power programme.
Nevertheless, despite the bluster, the two sides met twice over the weekend
at working level and were due to meet again last night or today. The current
negotiating session, which began on Friday, is expected to last about a
week.
The US team had hoped this time to reach a final settlement of the dispute
with North Korea, based on the preliminary accord reached on August 12.
But Pyongyang has since raised new demands and seemingly gone back on
aspects of the earlier agreement.
The two sides agreed in August that, as part of a final settlement,
Pyongyang would freeze its current nuclear programme and accept full
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy
Authority (IAEA). In return, it would be given two light-water atomic
reactors, help with its interim energy needs and the coveted diplomatic
links with Washington.
However, Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's chief negotiator at the Geneva talks,
reaffirmed that Pyongyang would not accept special inspections of two
undeclared sites where the IAEA believes diverted plutonium may be stored.
North Korea is also demanding 'several billion' dollars in compensation for
giving up its graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme. This is in
addition to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) estimated cost of providing the
more 'proliferation-proof' light-water reactors, which produce less
weapons-grade plutonium.
In addition, Pyongyang is refusing to accept South Korean nuclear
technology, saying it wants German or Russian reactors. The US, which is
trying to put together a multinational consortium to meet North Korea's
energy needs, including South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, says this
demand is not practical.
There is also the vexed question of the 8,000 spent fuel rods corroding in a
holding pond at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea says it is willing
to encase them in concrete but the US wants the fuel rods shipped to a third
country such as China.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Hopes for a deal amid the rhetoric: Nancy Dunne reports on
the US-Japan trade talks as Washington's deadline looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and Japanese officials are heading into the final week of trade talks
with at least partial agreement in sight after 15 months of fruitless
negotiations.
With a September 30 deadline for agreement looming, the rhetoric on both
sides has been tough. President Bill Clinton last week warned Mr Yohei Kono,
Japan's foreign minister, of sanctions. Japanese officials have advised the
US not to count on last-minute climb-downs.
But an important obstacle to agreement was cleared off the table last week
when Tokyo announced a stimulative tax cut package. The US has been pushing
for such a move since the signing of a broad trade framework agreement in
July 1993 by Mr Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
Agreement is likely on other fronts. In disputes over procurement of
telecommunications and medical equipment and on Japan's insurance market,
agreement has been close since last February's Washington summit, when Mr
Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to reach a compromise
and the markets reacted violently.
There is also hope for agreement on flat glass, a dispute added to the
agenda along the way. Japan flew a special negotiator in to work on glass
last week, and US officials on Friday gave the Japanese negotiators a
proposed draft text to be studied over the weekend.
A stumbling block remains in talks covering vehicles and parts. Even though
the sector comprises some 60 per cent of the Dollars 60bn (Pounds 38bn) US
trade deficit with Japan, the urgency for its resolution has abated. All US
car companies are enjoying healthy sales and profits. Exports to Japan are
rising rapidly, though starting from a minuscule base.
The concern now is vehicle parts, which involves more companies, many of
them hit hard by competition from Japanese transplants. US car makers have
been lobbying for a tough line, in anticipation of pressure from Wall Street
for a deal at any cost.
Although these 'results-oriented' trade talks were supposed to show a sharp
departure from past efforts to open the Japanese market and sound a tougher
note, the similarities are more apparent than the differences, said Mr Fred
Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics and one of the
trade specialists the Clinton administration is consulting as the talks
progress.
The talks, moving product-by-product, represent 'a hard slog to unearth and
deal with specific Japanese practices' which discourage imports, Mr Bergsten
said.
Although the US has sought benchmarks - 'objective indicators' - to measure
progress, it has from the first insisted that failing to meet those targets
would not subject Japan to trade retaliation.
In the flat glass talks, for example, foreign glass manufacturers have for
years sought to break into a market dominated by three Japanese producers,
whose market share rarely varies and whose wholesalers are discouraged from
buying imports by 'strong-armed pressure tactics', according to the US
industry.
Mr Steve Farrar, director of international business for Guardian Glass, said
the US companies were looking for assurances that the links between
suppliers and wholesalers would be broken. 'We are working to get public
statements from the wholesalers and manufacturers and a commitment from the
ministry of trade and industry that they will monitor the implementation of
these statements,' he said.
By September 30, the US administration must also decide whether to cite
Japan and others for trade practices which raise barriers to exports. Mr
Bergsten is counselling against such a move now that strong multilateral
trade rules, agreed in the Uruguay Round, offer a viable alternative to
unilateral action.

<TEXT>
Legislation intended to increase the pressure on foreign governments to open
their financial markets to US banks is expected to come to a vote in the US
House of Representatives tomorrow, George Graham writes from Washington.
But the bill, now called the National Treatment in Banking bill, is a pale
shadow of an earlier measure which drew fierce opposition from free traders
and foreign governments.
The new bill has been much more narrowly drawn to cover only banks, and not
other areas of the financial services industry. It also abandons measures
that would have given the US Treasury the power to impose sanctions on
countries which do not treat US financial businesses equally. Instead, it
simply requires the Treasury to publish a list of countries which deny
national treatment to US banks.

FT  26 SEP 94 / US court reverses ban on nuclear waste ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A potentially embarrassing setback for US nuclear non-proliferation policy
was averted late on Friday when a federal appeals court reversed a lower
court's injunction blocking the arrival in South Carolina of a shipment of
spent nuclear fuel from European research reactors.
The earlier injunction, issued after a Danish freighter had set sail
carrying casks of highly enriched uranium from research reactors in Denmark
and Sweden, had prompted some nuclear proliferation experts to raise the
spectre of a radioactive Flying Dutchman, barred from docking at its
intended destination but forbidden also to return to its home port.
The injunction had also jeopardised the US's credibility in the Geneva
negotiations over the extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
because it was seen by some countries as further evidence of the US's
inability to live up to its side of the bargain implicit in the treaty.
The spent fuel, which is much closer to bomb-grade uranium than the less
enriched fuel used in power generation reactors, and therefore much more of
a proliferation threat, is the product of the US's 30-year-old off-site fuel
programme.
Under this programme, the US agreed to accept spent fuel from participating
foreign reactor plants. In return, they committed themselves to switch to
less dangerous low enriched fuel.
This shipment is part of an emergency programme to relieve the urgent
storage problems experienced by some research reactors as a result of the
US's five-year suspension of the programme.
The US is now working on an environmental impact statement to allow the
programme to be fully restored.
However, the Department of Energy is still a long way from settling on a
long-term solution to the problem of storing spent nuclear fuel, including
the much larger quantities of less enriched but still highly radioactive
waste from US commercial reactors.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (13): Waiting for the
clincher - Multimedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'killer application' that will turn multimedia from a gimmick into a
business necessity hasn't happened yet, writes Claire Gooding.
It was Visicalc spreadsheet software that turned microcomputers into
business machines, and its successor Lotus 1-2-3 that sold 80 per cent of
IBM PCs. But the average PC buyer, both commercial and home consumer, is
still waiting for the irresistible multimedia application: the clincher that
convinces them to spend the extra on CD-ROM drive and supporting technology.
Some point to long-distance videoconferencing  - and the price of air
tickets  - as the incentive, others to the games and home market for
selective film viewing known as video-on-demand. As for applications, there
are an increasing number of samples outside the traditional areas of
training and education. These are being promoted as 'real live commercial
applications' for multimedia, but they are still pioneers.
In fact, the market can not take off before three factors are settled:
reliability, ease of use, and the 'critical mass' factor. Previous waves of
technology have proved this pattern in everything from cars to cameras,
faxes and video tape recorders. There's not much point being the first user
of the telephone or fax if your peer group isn't similarly equipped.
In the US, says multimedia consultant Jeffrey Goldberg of Dataquest, things
are more advanced. 'For the average US home buyer, buying patterns prove
that the CD-ROM is more important than having the fastest possible speed of
processor' he says. 'Even though the software itself is still in short
supply, they want the capability there.'
He notes that in the IT industry, software suppliers are seizing on the
technology as an alternative to using unwieldy bundles of discs for the
distribution of products and upgrades. 'There has to be a return on
investment and a commercial incentive, because the technology isn't cheap'.
Reliability is another delimiter, according to Anne Perlman, vice-president
of the multimedia division of Tandem Computers of Cupertino, which
specialises in 'non-stop' fail-safe computers.
'The focus has to be on business applications for multimedia, because it
will be three to five years before networks are sufficiently upgraded to
serve home consumers,' she says.
'Reliability is critical if a business is on line 24 hours a day across
different time zones: users have to be able to take it for granted that the
service will be working when they need it, much as we do for TV or
electricity supply.'
Multimedia is simply a consolidation of many technologies we have come to
take for granted, including computing, telecommunications, computer graphics
and text, fax, video and photography. The so-called 'information
superhighway' allows the computer user to tap into online databases and
other remote sources. This is already possible with current electronic mail
and messaging systems, but much enhanced by the used of graphics and live
pictures as used in videoconferencing.
This accessibility still depends on a chain of skills and commodities, and
the development of multimedia is characterised by partnerships and
consortia.
Large suppliers such as Sony are already providing the hardware, but smaller
suppliers provide for specialist areas: Micropolis' new video-on-demand
server, for example, or VideoLogic's Vesa Media Channel for PC/video
integration.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (19): PC Express
provides analysis tool - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bulmers decided to change its focus from being a volume-driven business
to a profit-oriented company, it realised that it would need new analysis
tools.
It wanted its 40 national account managers to be able to get up-to-date
information on profitability by customer (for example, Tesco, Asda,
Sainsbury) and by brand. And it wanted its 12 brand managers-planners to be
able to look at the make-up of a brand and all its associated costs
including marketing, packaging and distribution.
Two years ago, the company began to look for a suitable product.
Today it is using PC Express, a multi-dimensional Olap database from
US-based Information Resources (IRI). The database  - used in conjunction
with IRI's Financial Management System (financial planning software)  -
helps the company analyse its data from many different perspectives (or
dimensions).
Dr Martin Wynn, head of information technology at Bulmers, says 'previously
we could get data on sales volume and value, but not profitability.'
The PC Express database sits on a pentium server (a powerful PC) and is
updated every 24-hours with the latest information from the company's
existing Oracle database. PC Express indexes the data it receives by all
conceivable dimensions, such as by customer, by product and by date. Because
the data is already indexed, PC users can get fast replies to any ad hoc
queries that occur to them.
The project to introduce a new system began two years ago. At present the
system has three Bulmers users. But, in the next six to nine months, it will
be given to its national-account and brand managers, and to a handful of its
financial controllers and directors.
Including hardware, software and staff time, the project has cost almost
Pounds 1m. It is expected to yield hard benefits of Pounds 450,000 a year
and another Pounds 200,000-Pounds 250,000 in soft benefits.
Tim Furse, the company's commercial director, believes the hard benefits
will include cost savings. 'We will be able to track the effectiveness of
our spend whether it be on distribution, packaging, promotion or producing
our products,' he says. 'We can then take out cost where necessary, for
example, in packaging.'
The system is also expected to improve profitability. The plan is that
Bulmer's account managers will be able to take into account the full costs
of dealing with a particular customer. They will also be able to look at the
mix of brands sold to each account, noting those which are most profitable
for the company.
Using the financial management software, account managers will be able to
produce monthly forecasts of the profit contributions of their accounts  -
and brand managers will be able to predict the likely progress of their
brands.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (14): Running costs
cut by two thirds - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Provident Personal Credit knows all about right-sizing: this financial
services company has done it twice in the past six years. In that time it
has cut costs while confirming that simply moving from big computers to
small ones is only part of the job.
In the late 1980s, Provident Personal Credit started running down its Unisys
central mainframe computer and installing Digital Equipment Vax machines in
business departments. The computing staff, too, were moved out to work
alongside their end-users.
'We had the traditional problem of a central mainframe department,
semi-detached from the rest of the organisation and never really meeting
business needs,' says Mr David Chan, information technology director 'The
costs of the operation were not reflected in business benefits.'
Installing local computers gave business departments control of their own
computing, helped by their own computing specialists. However, by 1992 the
company saw the need for a compromise between central and departmental
systems.
'We found there was a need for certain centralised systems and information,
for example a corporate customer database,' says Mr Chan. 'So we have
functionality in the departments but control and strategic systems back at
the centre again.
'In addition, having central computing staff is more efficient than giving
each department its own team.' The company has switched to Unix computers
from Hewlett-Packard and to database and system development products from
Sybase.
Running costs have been cut by two thirds and the number of system
development staff has been halved. Meanwhile business departments have the
systems, the information and the service they need.
Such changes have not been simple. Indeed, Chan puts much of the success
down to the fact that he called in human consultants early on.
'We were a mainframe shop with a traditional command hierarchy, like an
old-fashioned army,' he says. 'We needed a new culture, where the emphasis
was on delivering service, generating ideas and working together.'
Work was done not only on setting up appraisal schemes and training but also
on personal motivation: 'opening the possibility of individual fulfilment
through work', as David Chan puts it.
Team skills were also built up to fit a new department structure. This led
to greater trust between staff.
'In a traditional hierarchy you refer decisions upwards and watch your
back,' Mr Chan says. 'But our people now trust each other and are open to
suggestions. They're not constantly worrying about failure.
Three people were identified as potential opponents to the changes: they
have all left the company.
'Technical training was important but we could not have succeeded without
the human development work,' says Chan. 'We went from a low-delivery,
inefficient, classic programming shop to an open, high-delivery, successful
and innovative department in a year  - and all with the same people.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (16): New dimensions
favoured - Joia Shillingford on enterprise networking and databases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As PC users are increasingly linked into enterprise networks, they are
starting to become more demanding. They know that information vital to their
work sits in other computers on the network. And they ask, not unreasonably,
why they cannot get it out in the form they want.
The answer is that a lot of this information is probably stored in
relational databases. According to David Carew-Jones, international
marketing manager of US-based Pilot Software: 'Relational databases are
really good at presenting the same type of information in the same form each
month. But they aren't so good in areas like sales and marketing where
what's needed is a quick response to ad hoc queries requiring complex
analysis.'
He and many other executive information system (EIS) suppliers believe that
multidimensional databases are much better for on-line analytical processing
(Olap) by users.
This is because relational databases are best for transactions which require
access to parts of the database that are closely related. By contrast,
detailed marketing analysis may require looking for connections and patterns
in parts of the database which are not closely related.
In a multidimensional database designed for Olap, data is organised into
dimensions. For example, a four-dimensional entry might include a geography
dimension (eg sales regions), a price dimension, a time dimension (eg when
sold) and a product dimension. Users can interrogate the database quickly
using any combination of dimensions.
Olap's cause prospered when Ted Codd, the father of the relational database,
wrote a paper on the subject (commissioned by US Olap company Arbor). He
agreed that multidimensional databases were better for some types of
analysis and defined 12 Olap rules to which they should conform.
Nevertheless Codd says that Olap databases are 'not a substitute for
relational databases and should be used in conjunction with them, or with
files from legacy (old) systems.'
Olap databases usually take a copy of the information on the company's main
database at regular intervals  - every 24 hours, for example  - and re-index
it by dimensions.
Codd has evaluated two Olap databases which conform to most of his rules.
They are Arbor's Essbase, on which Comshare's Commander Olap is based, and
TM1 from US-based Sinper.
However, he has not evaluated all the Olap products on the market and there
are many other products which claim to conform.
Other suppliers include Pilot, IRI and Kenan.
He says that when selecting an Olap database, users should:
Decide how much concurrent working is needed between the analysis activity
and the company's main operational database.
Make sure that the analysis activity doesn't interfere with the day-to-day
running of the operational database. For this reason an Olap product which
can operate in a client-server environment, with operational and Olap
databases on different server computers may be best.
Try out different systems to see which provide the level of performance
required both in terms of computer power and in terms of usability.
However, Codd warns that once an Olap database is in place, the pressure to
make use of it can become intense.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (18): Building society
conundrum - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The National &amp; Provincial Building Society, the UK's 12th largest, has been
undergoing a radical transformation since 1990 when Mr David O'Brien,
formerly managing director of Rank Xerox in the UK, joined as chief
executive.
Mr O'Brien describes what he has been doing at N&amp;P as process design rather
than process re-engineering. His starting point was the building society
conundrum: where should the balance be struck between a profit and meeting
the needs of the customers?
The decision was taken to focus on becoming a true bank assurer: the kind of
organisation a customer can approach easily for advice and guidance about
his or her unique financial circumstances.
Mr O'Brien, drawing on his experience with Rank Xerox and in particular with
its Japanese ally Fuji-Xerox, decided to start from scratch. The business of
process design involved new ways of thinking. Some 18 processes within the
bank were reduced to 10. New names reflect new approaches. There is no
longer a marketing department; instead, there is a customer requirement
process. There is no sales department. It has been replaced by a customer
engagement process.
'Our staff no longer have jobs, they have roles. They do not have job
descriptions, they have responsibilities', says Mr O'Brien .
Mr O'Brien believes that that process design encompasses a whole range of
activities which are often described as discrete activities. So empowerment,
de-layering and total quality management are all elements in his design
process rather than ends in themselves.
Note that the systems are the final part of the operation. They are mapped
onto the new structure rather than being used to automate existing
processes. The society is working with Unisys, the US computer manufacturer,
on hardware and software as it moves from mainframe-based systems to a
modern client-server approach.
The aim is to design the entire operation around object-orientated systems,
the rapidly evolving software technique where real life objects are modelled
in software. Such designs can be adapted more rapidly to changes in the
business environment than conventional mainframe or mini computer systems.
Mr O'Brien describes the organisation as consisting of three kinds of
objects: process objects, system objects and people objects.
Now four years into the programme, Mr O'Brien believes he is about
two-thirds of the way through the transformation.
He measures several parameters to test how successfully the new structure is
working. A key measure is the strength of the society's relationship with
its customers. Put simply, the society draws up a profile of the financial
services each customer could benefit from, and compares it with the services
they actually use.
Mr O'Brien says there are now no obsolete, low-interest accounts where
neither society nor customer benefits.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (15): Customer is in
the driving seat - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The second-hand car salesman as characterised in street mythology is a man
not to be trusted. 'The retail trade is not held in high esteem,' says John
Bacon, an executive director of Camden Motors.
Research has made Bacon painfully aware of how the public views the process
of buying a car. He is determined to change things in his industry, with the
help of a multimedia project part-funded by the European software
development programme Esprit.
Bacon's research established that until the actual hand-over of a new car
'the buyers are often unsure that they're getting what they want.'
There are, in his opinion, too many variables for the average car-buying
customer, who feels that the sales person is in charge of the process. The
customer's ignorance of the many different variables - discounts, value of
part-exchange, catalogue data and so on  - puts them at a disadvantage.
'Add to those variables the process of trading used cars, finance and loans,
and it becomes bewildering for the buyer,' he says. He argues that the sales
role has concentrated on dealing skills  - the much-caricatured hard-sell
patter  - and not enough on really helping the customer through the maze of
choices.
The multimedia system is designed to put the customer in the driving seat,
both metaphorically and literally. It is already working in a test
environment at Camden Motors' headquarters in Leighton Buzzard.
The system uses information from a variety of sources, presented in text and
video. By picking a route through a maze of options on such issues as
finance (probably the most daunting topic for the average buyer), users can
arm themselves with very specific information. This typically includes
valuation of the present car for trade-in, options for finance, and new
models in which they are interested, which users can ascertain before coming
face-to-face with anyone on the sales floor.
Improving the process of buying a car is a critical issue for Camden Motors,
which buys and sells countless vehicles every year for large commercial
clients. Established in 1932, Camden Motors ranks as the fifth-largest
supplier of new cars and the third-largest seller of used cars in the UK in
1994.
Corporate clients include its parent, Barclays Bank, and Alamo Rent A Car,
to whom it is supplying 65,000 cars up to the end of December 2000.
Barclays' own heavy involvement with multimedia gave Bacon the chance to
improve upon a touch-screen pre-sales 'car shopping' system which had
already proved successful. In 1991, Camden Motors won funding of Pounds 3m
from Esprit, in a consortium including Barclays and multimedia developer
Olivetti.
From the 174 applications for funding, the Camden Motors project became one
of the 17 endorsed applications: it has matched the investment with Pounds
312,000 of its own, spent on setting up the IT infrastructure, including a
486-based computer and ISDN network, and extensive staff training.
'People have asked me if this is IT looking for a function. In fact there's
a real need,' says Bacon. 'The challenge of multimedia is to address the
business problems of motor retail. I'm no techie, I wouldn't be interested
if it wasn't a solid commercial problem being solved.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (17): No guarantee of
success - Business process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everybody is doing it. . . well, almost everybody. In the two years since Mr
Michael Hammer popularised the notion of business process re-engineering in
the Harvard Business Review, it has been embraced by many of the world's
largest organisations, writes Alan Cane.
Separate studies carried out earlier this year by the Cranfield School of
Management and Price Waterhouse suggest that up to 70 per cent of large
companies in the UK have undertaken or are about to undertake BPR. It would
be a surprisingly high figure for any management technique, even one
currently as fashionable. But BPR can be risky, involves comprehensive
planning and carries no guarantee of success.
On the other hand, the economic climate of the past few years has favoured
measures which promote efficiency, effectiveness and cost-cutting. Most of
the companies questioned by Cranfield said they were primarily interested in
potential savings.
BPR, as defined by Mr Hammer, involves a fundamental reassessment of the way
a company does its business, identifying and simplifying the basic processes
to achieve maximum operational efficiencies. BPR cuts across traditional
functions; layers of management are frequently found to be redundant during
the analysis.
This reassessment is driven by the needs of the business, not information
technology. But once the basic processes have been defined, IT can be used
to find greater efficiencies through automation.
It is not an entirely new concept. Mr Geoff Elliott and Mr Robin Holland,
senior consultants at Computer Management Group, note: 'BPR is clearly an
attention-grabbing headline but we believe, at the fundamental level, that
there is no difference between BPR, total quality management, change
management and organisational development. The real difference is the extent
and speed of the change that firms are being forced to address by the
markets'.
Elliott and Holland's conclusion has the benefit of rendering redundant
sematic arguments about BPR. The technique itself has a reputation for a
high failure rate, prompting one executive to sniff: 'For my taste, BPR is
too dramatic a technique'.
This attitude is attacked by Mr Hammer and his colleague Steven Stanton in a
recent paper: 'Re-engineering failure is not caused by bad luck, cosmic rays
or other factors beyond a company's control. On the contrary, success or
failure at re-engineering is determined by a company's understanding of
re-engineering, its ability at executing it and the commitment of its
executives to do it.'
Hammer and Stanton suggest there are two reasons companies fail at
re-engineering. First, because they do not know what they are doing and
therefore commit classic errors such as wasting time on the analysis of
existing processes. ('Virtually, everything learned in such an exercise is
destined for the rubbish heap,' they warn.)
Second, there is inadequate commitment and leadership from the top. 'No one
need fail at re-engineering' they write. 'Indeed, we are hard pressed to
cite a re-engineering failure among organisations who have gone about it in
a sound fashion.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (12): Belated switch
of emphasis - John Kavanagh examines developments in right-sizing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer right-sizing used to be simple.
You looked at the central mainframe computer costing possibly millions of
pounds, the end-users' display terminals with their fixed-format inquiry
screens in black and white, and the army of expensive specialists taking
months to write the simplest programs, and compared it with cheap, friendly,
colour PCs apparently allowing business people to do anything they wanted,
whenever they wanted.
No contest. Indeed, a survey by computer supplier Sequent shows that almost
two-thirds of completed right-sizing projects were carried out to cut costs.
The second main reason, mentioned by 30 per cent of companies, was the
related issue of replacing an obsolete computer, typically a central
mainframe.
But since the early 1990s this 'simplistic downsizing', as Computer
Technology Research Group calls it, has been severely questioned by analyses
of costs and by a perhaps surprisingly belated switch of emphasis to
business issues.
Several studies by independent research groups now question whether cost
savings are possible from moving to PC networks or client-server systems,
which typically combine PCs and more powerful local computers. One survey by
Xephon has found that mainframe systems are the cheapest, per end-user, with
minicomputer systems 50 per cent more expensive and PC networks more than
twice the cost.
These studies highlight the fact that mainframe costs are quite well
defined: equipment, software, maintenance and central staff. But PC networks
and distributed minicomputers have hidden costs of duplicated work,
security, maintenance, hardware and software failures and, most of all,
support  - not only by central specialists but also by local office staff
who spend their time running PCs instead of doing their proper jobs.
In addition, there are shortages of the skills needed to move from
mainframes to PC or Unix minicomputer systems. The Sequent survey found this
to be a problem among three-quarters of companies questioned  - including
system suppliers themselves.
'Cost reductions must not be the key incentive for moving to client-server,'
says Mr Per Andersen, a director of research firm IDC. 'The cost structure
of using information technology changes dramatically. Instead of hardware
and software making up most of the costs, staffing and support constitute
more than half the costs in most cases.'
Cost savings are possible, but only if companies look beyond 'simplistic
downsizing' and match their computing to business needs. Indeed, our case
study shows a company moving back towards a central set-up as the need for
certain corporate systems and databases emerged. This is not uncommon.
Research firm Gartner Group says: 'We believe the central function will have
a resurgence as end-users realise the true costs and complexity of
mission-critical computing.'
So the starting point for right-sizing must be business needs, not computing
costs. Computers and networks can now match company structures, and reviews
of computing set-ups should be led by reviews of business organisation.
Steve Wanless, product manager at Sequent, says: 'Right-sizing is all about
selecting hardware which will provide the computing infrastructure and
systems flexibility to match the business,' he says. 'This does not
necessarily mean ditching all existing systems and proprietary hardware.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Rabin and Arafat in accord on poll talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organisation
chairman Yassir Arafat held a remarkably good natured meeting yesterday,
agreeing that negotiators from each side would meet in Cairo next week to
plan the details of Palestinian elections.
In marked contrast to the tense, ill-natured atmosphere that has
characterised previous talks between them, Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat emerged
from their meeting at the Erez crossing point between Israel and Gaza
smiling and conversing easily with each other, and then held a joint press
conference in which they both played down the differences that are delaying
implementation of the next stages of the Palestinian autonomy accord.
The main conflict is over proposals for elections throughout the occupied
territories, with Israel insisting that only a cabinet-style administrative
body be voted into office to run the Palestinian self rule areas, and the
PLO demanding that a legislative parliament be elected, with about 100
members.
Mr Arafat says he wants to hold the vote on November 1. Mr Rabin says so
early a date is unrealistic.
Negotiators will try to resolve the issue when they meet in Cairo next week.
Separate teams of negotiators, the two men agreed yesterday, will also meet
in Cairo to discuss various security issues.
The key to the unusually pleasant atmosphere at yesterday's meeting probably
lies in Mr Arafat's ready agreement 'to take all measures' to prevent
attacks on Israeli targets by Palestinian extremists opposed to the autonomy
process.
Israel's Central Bank yesterday raised interest rates by 1.5 percentage
points to 15.5 per cent in a renewed effort to curb inflation, writes David
Horovitz.
The governor of the Bank of Israel, Professor Jacob Frenkel, said the sharp
rise was designed to rein in a boom in personal consumption, which is
driving up imports and contributing to a worsening balance of payments
deficit.
Combined with a package of anti-inflationary measures agreed by the cabinet
this month, Prof Frenkel said the rise should help the government meet its
8-11 per cent target for inflation in 1995. Inflation for 1994 is currently
running at 14.5 per cent, double the government's original target.

The South African Reserve Bank will raise its bank rate by a full percentage
point today to 13 per cent, the first rise in South African interest rates
since 1991, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
The decision has been criticised by several prominent businessmen who claim
that the bank has acted prematurely and may damage the current economic
upturn. The South African Chamber of Business has also warned that the move
could damage the government's reconstruction and development programme.
However Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank governor, who has been warning for
several weeks that a rise in rates was imminent, said the move was necessary
to stave off rising inflation.

China stepped up its efforts to isolate Taiwan yesterday when it issued a
stern rebuke to Japan for its invitation to a senior Taiwanese official to
attend the forthcoming Asian games in Hiroshima, writes Simon Holberton in
Beijing.
A prominent commentary in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's
ruling Communist party, warned Tokyo that if it persisted in inviting Mr Hsu
Li-Teh, vice-president of Taiwan's executive yuan (cabinet), then it would
be solely responsibly for unspecified 'serious consequences' in
Sino-Japanese relations.
The commentary, which amounts to a demand that Japan immediately withdraw
its invitation to Mr Hsu, represents an escalation in Beijing's
determination to isolate the government in Taipei.

International Monetary Fund officials are confident that they will be able

package of measures intended to boost the financial resources of the former
communist economies and other less prosperous countries.
A senior IMF official said negotiations were still continuing, but some form
of deal would be reached, including an allocation of special drawing rights,
the IMF's own reserve asset, an increase in the amounts member governments
can borrow, and an extension of the Systemic Transformation Facility, which
lends money to countries making the shift from communism to the market
economy with fewer of the IMF's traditional conditions.
'On all of that there are still brackets in our documents and a lot of
uncertainties, except for one thing: there is a very strong wish to come to
a constructive agreement in Madrid,' the official said.
But there is still a wide gulf between the proposal of Mr Michel Camdessus,
the IMF's managing director, for a general distribution of SDR36bn to all
members, and a plan by the UK and the US for a more limited allocation of
between SDR12bn and SDR16bn targeted at countries from eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union who have no SDRs because they joined the IMF since
its last allocation in 1981. IMF officials said a SDR36bn allocation would
mean Dollars 1bn more for Russia than the smaller allocation proposed by the
UK and the US.
Mr Camdessus argues that the larger distribution is needed to finance the
rapid expansion of the world trading system and make the SDR a significant
reserve currency. But some of the industrialised countries, especially
Germany, have argued that there is no shortage of liquidity and that a large
injection of SDRs into the world monetary system could fuel inflation.
A senior IMF official said the US-UK proposal 'goes a great distance in the
right direction' but said that a SDR16bn allocation would still leave the
SDR's role among the world's reserve assets in decline. In addition, a
targeted allocation would need a change in the IMF's articles. This would
require ratification by national parliaments, and could hold up the
distribution for two or three years.
IMF officials said they expected the Interim Committee, a grouping of
finance ministers that sets the IMF's policy direction, to direct a rethink
of the way costs are divided. Because the administrative budget comes out of
income from loans, the cost is entirely borne by borrower countries.

FT  26 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Sunshine journalism - all news
is good news / South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since President Mandela's inauguration, most of South Africa's mainstream
newspapers have become skilled practioners of 'sunshine journalism.' This is
a resolute determination to focus on good news - the ongoing spirit of
reconciliation between blacks and whites and South Africa's new
international respectability coming top of the list - while ignoring or
playing down political and economic problems.
Last week, the local press was girding itself for just such a bout of
self-congratulation as UK prime minister John Major arrived for a short
visit, the first such trip by a British leader since Harold Macmillan
clashed with his Afrikaner hosts in 1960. Journalists and editors were quite
unprepared for the announcement by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini that he was
cancelling Shaka Day, the most important Zulu national holiday, and breaking
off relations with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who as well as being home
affairs minister and leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, is the king's
uncle.
Caught between the obligation to report on the monarch's apparent political
swing towards the ruling African National Congress and the desire to
highlight Mr Major's message of fraternal fellowship, newspapers seemed to
weight their stories according to geographic distance from the Zulu
heartland.
Thus, in relatively insulated Cape Town the Cape Times, a slender but
respectable publication, noted the onset of the Zulu rift, but restricted
its editorial comment to praising Mr Major's parliamentary address and
examining its implications for South Africa.
Similarly, in Johannesburg both Business Day and the Star, the country's two
most influential dailies, provided detailed analyses of the origins of the
Buthelezi-Goodwill feud but offered little serious comment other than to
express hope that a resolution could be reached without bloodshed. 'South
Africa has not yet sufficiently recovered from the conflict of the past 10
years to make light of the politics of ethnicity,' warned the former.
The KwaZulu/Natal newspapers by contrast reported liberally on the affair,
but diplomatically refused to take sides. Instead both the Natal Witness and
Natal Mercury called for speedy negotiations to resolve the monarch's
constitutional position once and for all.
Even following Saturday's Shaka Day celebrations, which Chief Buthelezi went
ahead with despite the king's non-participation, the Sunday Times, the
country's biggest newspaper, chose to focus on Prince Edward's flying
meeting with Mr Mandela and the government's planned reconstruction and
development plans rather than wading too deeply into the Zulu morass.
Meanwhile, Rapport, the most prominent Afrikaans-language paper, seemed of
the opinion that the election of the second consecutive black Miss South
Africa was of far more import than the labyrinthine world of Zulu royal
politics.
But while the establishment press has been slow to tackle the Zulu issue,
the small but rapidly growing group of black newspapers, whose readership
has been more affected by the violence that IFP-ANC faction fighting has
caused, showed no such restraint. Reflecting its relatively mainstream
politics, The Sowetan, the country's biggest daily, set the tone, lambasting
Chief Buthelezi as an irascible, thin-skinned man who sees slights to his
character where none exist.
Indeed, the only voice raised in the minister's defence was that of the
bi-weekly Umafrika, which accused the ANC of 'degrading the monarchy.'
Meanwhile the previously anti-royalist City Press, the biggest black Sunday
paper, was even more vituperative, charging: 'When we now stone our kings
and force them to flee their homes, we are not only blemishing our history,
rotten as it is already, we advance the process of dehumanising ourselves.'
Having rediscovered a common humanity so recently, however, most South
Africans could be forgiven for hoping that the current crisis will soon be
resolved. After so many years of misery, more sunshine journalism would not
go seriously amiss.

FT  26 SEP 94 / UK relief plan goes for gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British chancellors of the exchequer have become infrequent participants in
the yearly conferences of Commonwealth finance ministers that precede the
annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. But when
they do make the effort, they usually have an initiative tucked away in
their briefcases.
That was the case when Mr John Major, as chancellor, launched the 'Trinidad
Terms' for easing the burden of government-to-government debt owed by the
poorest developing countries at the 1990 Commonwealth conference in Port of
Spain, Trinidad.
It will be the case when Mr Kenneth Clarke, who flies today to this year's
Commonwealth meeting in Malta, discloses plans to help a small group of
heavily indebted countries unable to benefit from the Trinidad Terms because
their debts are owed to institutions such as the IMF and World Bank.
The UK initiative is carefully structured in an attempt to gain the
necessary 85 per cent support of the IMF membership. It owes a great deal to
ideas put forward by Oxfam, the UK-based charity, of which his wife,
Gillian, is an enthusiastic supporter.
Mr Clarke will propose that the IMF sell part of its holding of 103.4m fine
ounces of gold and invest the proceeds. The income from the investment
(which would be retained by the IMF in its reserves) would be used to
subsidise the interest payments and ease the repayment schedules of the
developing countries that are burdened with excessive borrowings from the
Fund.
The countries named by Mr Clarke are Uganda, Honduras, Mozambique, Burundi,
Kenya, Sierra Leone, Guyana and Laos. Other possible beneficiaries include
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Nicaragua and Tanzania.
The British plan envisages that the debts owed by these countries to the IMF
should be serviced and paid on terms similar to those granted to developing
countries through the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF),
a soft loan facility that has extended finance on concessional terms to 22
countries reforming their economies in line with IMF programmes.
With ESAF, debtor countries pay only 0.5 per cent interest on their
borrowings, with repayment in 10 years with a 5 1/2 year grace period. The
chancellor will propose a longer term concessional window of perhaps 20
years for the countries in difficulty with their multilateral debts.
This would ease their burden greatly. A recent Oxfam report calculated that
debt repayments to multilateral creditors such as the IMF by 19 severely
indebted, low income countries account for 30 per cent of their debt service
payments. Payments to the IMF, the report said, had outstripped the
provision of new finance by some Dollars 2bn since the mid-1980s.
The UK proposal is designed to overcome many taboos that have so far
prevented the provision of debt relief to borrowers from the IMF. The
chancellor will not be calling for the write-off or rescheduling of
multilateral debt. He will also stress his proposals should only apply to
countries that have followed a sustained programme of economic reform under
the IMF. Because the scheme would be financed by IMF gold sales, it would
not be a burden on IMF member countries' budgets.
Nonetheless, the idea of the IMF selling some of its gold is controversial.
The UK does not expect immediate acceptance of the scheme, believing it
could take about two years to win the necessary support.
Gold sales, if they adversely affected the price on world markets, would
hurt two leading producers - Russia and South Africa - which Britain is also
very keen to help. But the Treasury believes that the IMF would need to sell
less than 10 per cent of its gold to finance the plan. Such sales, worth
about Dollars 4bn at current market prices, would be spread over several
years.
It is unclear how much support the UK plan will command. The Group of Seven
leading industrial nations began to discuss such matters at their July
summit in Naples. In their communique, they issued a call 'to explore ways
to mobilise more effectively the existing resources of the international
financial institutions to respond to the special needs of the. . . poorest
most indebted countries.'
However, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor's predecessor, and US
administrations at various times in recent years have drafted plans for IMF
gold sales only to see them go nowhere. The IMF sold some of its gold in
1976 when the proceeds were used to set up a trust fund for developing
countries that was the precursor of ESAF.
But the present IMF management has been hostile to further gold sales for
fear that they would weaken the Fund's creditworthiness. Mr Michel
Camdessus, IMF managing director, once described the IMF's gold as 'the
jewel of the family'. Earlier this month, an IMF official, on a visit to
London to prepare for next week's IMF annual meeting in Madrid, said that
IMF gold sales 'were not an issue'.

FT  26 SEP 94 / SDR initiative to help poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joint UK-US plans to end a long dispute halting issue of new reserve assets
by the International Monetary Fund will be designed to help poor developing
nations as well as Russia and other former communist countries, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, UK chancellor, said.
Mr Clarke, giving the first official confirmation of last Monday's Financial
Times report of a UK-US initiative to allow the IMF to boost the official
reserves of its member countries, said London and Washington would put
forward plans for an 'equity' allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) at
next week's IMF annual meeting in Madrid. This proposal, designed to
strengthen the finances of 37 IMF members which have joined the fund since
the last SDR issue in 1981, would be of particular benefit to Russia and
many other former eastern bloc states.
The chancellor said Britain also wanted the poorest developing countries to
benefit from the package. He said the US and UK did not agree with proposals
from Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, for a general allocation of
SDRs to all IMF members but they were prepared to suggest a 'pro rata'
allocation alongside an equity issue of SDRs.
This, it is hoped, would help secure the necessary 85 per cent support of
the IMF membership for a change in the fund articles that would allow an
equity allocation.
The pro rata allocation would give 'reasonable allocations to some of the
poorest countries', Mr Clarke said. It would lift IMF members' SDR holdings
to 'an agreed benchmark level, subject to every IMF member receiving a
prescribed minimum allocation' as a percentage of the individual country's
quota or shareholding in the fund.
The plans will be discussed by Group of Seven finance ministers on Saturday,
where Germany, long an opponent of new SDRs, can be expected to give them an
especially critical scrutiny.

FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bank to boost new lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank expects to boost its new lending commitments to between
Dollars 23bn and Dollars 25bn in its current financial year to the end of
June 1995 after reporting a drop in its loans last year.
The drop in the combined commitments of the bank's two main divisions to
Dollars 20.84bn in 1993/94 from Dollars 23.7bn the previous financial year
reflected a shift in priorities, according to the bank's annual report
published yesterday.
The bank provided fewer large scale 'adjustment' loans in support of
economic policy reform, instead switching efforts to lending for specific
investments and sectors and raising the quality of its portfolio.
The bank disclosed that its main operating arm, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) which finances lending to developing
countries from borrowings on the world capital markets, experienced a net
inflow of funds from borrowers last year.
The switch from net disbursements of Dollars 2.33bn in 1992/93 to a net
inflow of Dollars 731m in 1993/94 reflected repayments of bank loans by
several middle income developing countries.
The International Development Association, the bank's soft loan agency which
grants loans on concessional terms to poor developing countries, raised net
disbursements to Dollars 5.11bn from Dollars 4.58bn in 1992/93. Its
commitments fell slightly, however, to Dollars 6.59bn from Dollars 6.75bn.
The World Bank's net income dropped to Dollars 1.05bn in the year to June
1994 from Dollars 1.13bn the previous year.
The news that IBRD net disbursements were negative last year is unlikely to
please the bank's many critics. But Mr Geoffrey Lamb, the bank's London
representative, said it was a consequence of the long term financial flows
in the bank's business.
Presenting the report, he said the bank was putting greater emphasis on the
implementation of programmes and the quality of its projects. 'The pressure
to lend in the bank has gone,' he said.
China was the bank's biggest client in 1993/94 with approved borrowings of
Dollars 3.07bn. It headed the list of borrowers from the IBRD and IDA.
Mexico and Russia were the next biggest borrowers from the IBRD, while India
and Bangladesh were the second and third biggest IDA borrowers.
The agricultural sector accounted for 18.8 per cent of new commitments by
the Bank in the past fiscal year, followed by trans-portation infrastructure
with 15.8 per cent. Lending for human resources development, which covers
education, health, population, nutrition and social programmes, accounted
for 15 per cent of loans and credits approved in the year, down from about
16 per cent the previous year.
The approval of fast disbursing loans in support of policy reform, dropped
to 12 per cent of lending in fiscal 1994 from 17 per cent the previous year.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (11): Sabotage
incidents most costly - National survey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not surprisingly, companies are reluctant to talk about their security
problems. It is acutely embarrassing and makes them vulnerable to further
breaches.
This reluctance is reflected in the National Computing Centre (NCC) survey
published in July. Of the 850 UK companies who replied to the survey, only
74 were prepared to talk further about specific security breaches. The NCC
interviewed 25 companies which generated 31 case studies. These studies,
together with seven further NCC studies are published in the survey.
The NCC notes that the majority of the incidents dealt with viruses (16),
theft of equipment (11) and unauthorised access (8). A few sabotage
incidents were also reported.
The incidents of virus infection' range from the relatively trivial to the
very serious. One small company encountered problems from someone
accidentally introducing the so-called 'Michelangelo' virus via a golf
program. It cost about Pounds 2,000 to put right and caused no real
problems.
A large food and drink company quoted in the survey was faced with a more
serious virus problem following 34 redundancies in its information systems
department. A virus called Form, which destroys data, was accidentally
introduced into a local area network of 40 personal computers:
'A PC user took a blank disk from a box and formatted it on her PC. She then
copied a file to the disk and took it to another PC to make use of the laser
printing facilities. Unknown to the user, the 'blank' disk had been infected
with a version of Form then replaced in the box.'
The incident cost the company Pounds 50,000 in time and effort to put right
and it has since introduced vetting procedures on all incoming disks.
Sabotage incidents of this type  - although rare  - are the most costly. It
cost a large company in the information technology sector an estimated
Pounds 33,000 to recover from damage done by a disgruntled student. The
student managed to 'hack' into the company network using a dial-up modem and
an unauthorised account number. Files were deleted and derogatory messages
were sent through the electronic mail system.
The student was later charged and convicted under the Computer Misuse Act,
receiving a six-month suspended sentence.
Even relatively trivial incidents can mean significant costs in the long
term. A government department notes that, although it cost only Pounds 500
to get rid of a virus in its network of 250 PCs, there is an overhead
associated with monitoring for further incidents:
'There is a continuous background cost of perhaps Pounds 6,000 a year to
provide basic facilities to enable detection of this type of event.'
The British Standards Institute has published a Code of Practice for
Information Security Management based on the best practice and experiences
of a wide range of companies. The NCC includes an analysis of this in the
1994 survey together with recommendations as to how it can be improved. The
NCC can be contacted on 061 228 6333.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (8): The walls have
come down - Philip Manchester on security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Breaches of security in computer networks are not only embarrassing  - they
are also costly. A survey of UK companies conducted by the National
Computing Centre (NCC) this year put the average cost of a security breach
at more than Pounds 9,000. The survey also revealed that four out of five
companies had reported security breaches in the past two years.
The NCC survey describes a wide range of security problems and highlights
how important the issue has become  - especially since the spread of
computer networks and powerful desktop computers.
Malicious network hackers, 'virus' software, criminals and even staff with a
grudge are just some of the possible security threats which are the
inevitable result of opening up computer networks and distributing computer
power.
'With today's networks, security is an architectural issue. As we move to
distributed computing by replacing the central mainframe with networks of
PCs, it makes systems more vulnerable,' says Mr Gordon Eubanks, chief
executive of US security software specialist Symantec.
'It is a bit like the change from guarding a house with one entrance to
guarding a house with 10  - it is not an insoluble problem but it needs
companies to take action,' Mr Eubanks continues.
Mr Chris Hook, a managing consultant at the NCC who specialises in security,
says: 'The walls around the system have come down and control has shifted to
end users. They do not know how dangerous it is not to take precautions
because they have not been trained.'
He says staff training is one of the keys to making computer network more
secure and that there is room for improvement. In the NCC survey, companies
were asked if they trained their staff to follow security procedures and
most said that they did. But when asked if the procedures were actually
followed, the picture was very different. 'Only 27 per cent were following
the procedures in practice. This shows that companies think they have
trained their staff when in fact they need to explain why the procedures are
needed,' Mr Hook observes.
In addition to proper training, Mr Hook also recommends that companies must
plan both for preventative security and for coping with breaches.
'You have to think through the implications of a security breach on the
business and identify the important threats,' says Mr Keith Dunnicliffe, a
security consultant at Group Bull in the UK.
'There is a danger that people get carried away with technology and pour a
lot of money into anti-virus programs, log-in systems and the like. But you
must step back and look at the simple things  - the company procedures; who
has access to the system; and so on. Then you can see the risks and the
costs of coping with them in a business context.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (10): Tool will aid
team working - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants Ernst &amp; Young are using Lotus Notes to support a move to a
flatter organisational structure. They wanted a tool which would aid team
working and provide better information on which to base decisions.
Notes software serves three functions:
It makes it easier for teams of workers to share information even if they
are not at the same site.
It simplifies the task of extracting information from the company's central
systems, or adding it.
It is being used to build a number of new databases.
The system is partly implemented and Ernst &amp; Young is in the process of
rolling it out to 2,000 of its partner-managers. Within the UK, people in
Glasgow can see the same information as people in London.
The firm is also beginning to use Notes internationally  - for example, in
the US.
'There is a lot of opportunity to share information on clients across
offices,' according to Mark Bushell, Lotus Notes Project Manager at Ernst &amp;
Young. For example, staff must add meeting minutes to Notes, and these can
be looked at by others in their team. Action points can be included in the
meeting notes but these can only be seen by the people who are meant to
carry them out.
When any team members who have not attended a particular meeting next go
into Notes, they will see a small meetings symbol (or icon). This will have
a number on it to show them how many new documents there are in the database
that they have not read. But if they are pressed for time, they can ask just
to see the action points relating to themselves. 'The whole system is geared
towards telling you what's new and telling you how to find it,' says
Bushell.
He believes the key to success is to make Notes part of users' daily
routine. However, Notes can fail if a central department simply asks people
to add information that is of no benefit to them.
Notes can also be used to disguise the difficulty of other systems. Ernst &amp;
Young has a big Oracle database containing client and contact information.
'It's not very easy to get data out of it, so we're providing access via
Notes,' says Bushell.
Users can update the database through Notes or even add additional comments
directly into Notes. The new Oracle data and the comments in Notes can then
be viewed together as if they were stored in one place.
Lotus Notes can cost as little as Dollars 230 per person for volume
purchases in the US, according to Bushell. But he says it usually costs a
bit more in Britain. In addition, Ernst &amp; Young is using Infopump software
from US-based Trinzic to link Notes to its existing databases. This costs
about Dollars 20,000 a pump and a large organisation will probably need
several.
Achieving a return on this investment can take some time. Bushell says: 'It
can take anything from two to six months before people get used to Notes.
Once they do, they come to depend on it and benefits can include fewer
meetings and better management of projects that involve several sites.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (9): For collaborators
 -Joia Shillingford takes a look at groupware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The personal computer caused people to go off and work on their own. What
companies now want are products which will enable groups of workers to
collaborate more effectively.' So says Michael Skok, chairman and chief
executive of European Software Publishing (ESP).
A growing number of these products  - often referred to as groupware  - are
becoming available. The research consultancy Ovum divides groupware into
four categories:
Workflow products, which control the flow of work between users. These
include Staffware, from the UK-based company of the same name and the Action
Workflow Management System from US company Action Technologies.
Intelligent messaging products, such as BeyondMail, distributed by UK-based
ESP. BeyondMail can filter messages and distribute information according to
certain rules  - for example, all mail from the boss goes to the top of the
queue. It also provides some workflow-like features.
Niche groupware applications, such as group scheduling and meeting support.
Videoconferencing is sometimes regarded as a form of groupware  - especially
if video images can be displayed in a window on the user's PC.
Groupware suites (for example, Lotus Notes) which integrate a variety of
groupware functions, such as information-sharing and conferencing. Ovum
believes that groupware suites will become the dominant area of the
groupware market, replacing office automation systems.
Notes dominates the groupware market, with Lotus claiming sales of about 1m
copies. Microsoft is planning to introduce a rival product next year called
Exchange Server, which will run under its Windows NT operating system. This
will give users on PC networks access to scheduling, document management,
electronic mail, electronic forms, directories, voice mail and faxes.
Lotus and Novell, which has acquired WordPerfect, also plans to introduce
new messaging-based groupware products next year. Other players in this
market include office automation suppliers, such as AT&amp;T GIS, ICL, Digital
Equipment and Uniplex, who are adding collaborative features to their
products.
Ovum says the total market for all types of local-area network-based
groupware is already about Dollars 700m in the US and Europe and it expects
this to grow to Dollars 2.2bn by 1998. It predicts that growth rates will be
high until 1995, after which more moderate rates of 15 per cent a year can
be expected.
The benefits of groupware can include reduced meeting times, improved
information sharing, and the speeding up of routine processes. But it is all
too easy to waste money on it.
One problem is that users are not always willing to share information.
Senior managers, in particular, like to hoard information, according to a
Reuters survey on Information Misers.
This means that it is very important to monitor the level of usage new
systems are getting after they have been introduced. If usage is low, then
something can be done about it.
Roger Whitehead, consultant and editor of the Groupware News newsletter,
warns that: 'Groupware is no more able to influence group behaviour than a
keyboard unless it is implemented as part of a willingness to change.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Kohl beams from on high: 'Feelgood' chancellor radiates poll
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Chancellor's coming,' the posters proclaim, and the faithful are
gathered in eager expectation in their spanking modern tennis stadium in
Halle, Westphalia, modelled on the Centre Court at Wimbledon. Three brass
bands take it in turns to warm up the crowd.
Suddenly he's there, surging up the aisle surrounded by a phalanx of
sober-suited young men, to the thoroughly inappropriate martial strains of
'Prussia's Glory'. Mr Helmut Kohl, the beefy provincial politician from the
west German Rhineland-Palatinate is a decidedly un-Prussian figure.
Here is the man who is both messenger and message of the ruling German
coalition and his own Christian Democratic Union (CDU). His very bulk and
reputation are the issues at stake in the forthcoming general election on
October 16.
All his party posters have his beaming picture, radiating security and
stability, with the slogan: 'Germany is the issue,' blatantly exploiting his
image as the personification of material well-being, solid citizenship and
German unification.
Mr Kohl is the ultimate exponent of the 'feelgood factor', displaying
confidence in the future, with a good dose of stern statesmanship to temper
it. Only nine months after the polls wrote him off in public popularity, the
Chancellor is back on a roll which looks likely to carry him to a fourth
term in government.
He no longer really needs to attack his opponents in the Social Democratic
party (SPD), Mr Rudolf Scharping and his lieutenants, Mr Oskar Lafontaine
and Mr Gerhard Schroder. Yet his political instincts are too acute to resist
it.
In this heartland of west German prosperity, where the tennis stadium itself
has been built merely to satisfy the whim of a local industrialist who
wanted a Wimbledon in his home town, his top theme goes down well. He is
determined to tar the SPD with the brush of being soft on Communism, in
spite of the end of the Cold War. His target is the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS), reformed rump of the former East German communist party,
which he denounces as 'red-painted fascists'. And the message is that the
SPD can only hope to unseat him in Bonn with the tacit support of those
communists.
As for Social Democrats, they are a 'joyless bunch', he declares. 'You don't
have to sneak off to the cellar to have a good laugh.' This is the man of
the people who made it, the international statesman from Oggersheim who
strides the world stage with the likes of Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin and
yet whose homely rhetoric still belongs to the provinces.
But the real message is about the broad sweep of history, not the minor
details of party politics. It is about German unification, and his leading
part in achieving it, about the need today to unite the country economically
and psychologically, rather than simply geographically.
It is also about Germany's role in the international community and his
passionate commitment to an integrated, united Europe as the essential
counterpart to German unification. It is a theme which might not prove too
popular to Germans who worry about the future loss of the D-Mark in a single
European currency, but this is Chancellor Kohl the statesman: he puts the
European Union right up front in his vision of the world.
And it is about German competitiveness, and the need to carry on
belt-tightening in the German economy to face up to the new competitors, not
just in Asia, but just over the border in Czechoslovakia.
It is a speech that runs to 90 minutes, without a note, and he's delivered
it three times since noon, but electioneering is what Helmut Kohl does best:
he thrives on the buzz of the auditorium and glad-handing in the crowd. He
knows there are still a tough three weeks ahead, but he senses the tide is
with him. He can afford to play the world statesman and leave party
politicking to the rest.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Ukraine 'needs Dollars 1bn in aid to implement reforms'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Ukraine will need nearly Dollars 1bn in foreign assistance this year to
implement radical economic reforms, according to senior Ukrainian officials.
A high-level Ukrainian delegation, including possibly President Leonid
Kuchma, is expected to attend the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
meeting in Madrid this week to plead Ukraine's case.
On Friday, Ukrainian officials reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF
on an economic reform programme which they say is the first step in a
comprehensive package of reforms to be announced early next month. The
agreement, the first since Ukraine announced its independence three years
ago, and the economic programme being prepared by the government have helped
convince western observers that Ukraine is on the verge of attempting its
first serious leap into market reforms.
But Mr Roman Shpek, minister for the economy and leader of the Ukrainian
side in negotiations with the IMF, said at the weekend that Ukraine will
require Dollars 960m aid before the end of the year if it is to meet the IMF
target of a budget deficit no higher than 10 per cent of GDP.
'Of course, the Ukrainian side must take the first step in market reforms,
but we are ready to do so, and we hope that the west will respond,' Mr Shpek
said. 'Now that we are ready to launch our reform programme, we are looking
for a non-inflationary way to cover our budget deficit and this is where we
hope that the west will help us.'
Mr Shpek said Ukrainian leaders would ask the US to convert Dollars 200m
earmarked for technical assistance projects in Ukraine into direct financial
aid. He said another source of immediate financial assistance could be the
IMF, which, if the Ukrainian deal is signed as expected this week, could
provide a first tranche of Dollars 365m to Kiev soon.
Mr Shpek said Ukraine would turn to the Group of Seven industrial nations
and Russia for an additional Dollars 400m.
He said the reform programme included radical price liberalisation, although
some controls would remain on bread prices. The state-controlled exchange
rate was to be unified with the free market rate, trade policy would be
liberalised, the confiscatory tax regime overhauled and privatisation
accelerated.
Mr Shpek predicted that the programme would cause inflation to jump to about
50 per cent a month, but it would then fall to 5 per cent a month.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Jubilation in Serbia as UN lifts some sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is a happy man.
The UN decision to suspend some sanctions against his country has absolved
him from the status of international pariah, and it may also have cleared
the way for a final showdown with his erstwhile proteges, the Bosnian Serbs.
The 100-day moratorium on some of the UN's punitive measures does not mean
that life will improve quickly for the ordinary Serbs, yet the jubilation in
official circles is unmistakeable.
Belgrade's closely guided press proclaimed yesterday that 'the world has
changed its mind about Yugoslavia.' 'The blockade has broken,' read a
headline in Vecernje Novosti, the biggest circulation daily.
The immediate effect of the UN decision is to suspend the bans on direct
flights, sporting and cultural exchanges with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
remaining constituents of the Yugoslav federation.
The UN move was approved as part of a twin strategy of tightening pressure
on the Bosnian Serbs and rewarding Serbia for its apparent severance of
links with its Bosnian cousins. In practice, few Serbs can afford air
tickets, and formal culture virtually collapsed with the old Yugoslav state.
As for sport, Yugoslavia is probably too late for the European football
championship.
The most draconian sanctions - including the freezing of foreign bank
accounts - remain in force, and the entire set of punitive measures could be
reimposed if Yugoslavia openly resumes supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
But the optimism in Belgrade reflects a feeling that in practice, the
sanctions regime will be very difficult to reconstruct once the
international community has started to dismantle it.
Russia is impatient for commercial links with Yugoslavia, as soon as the
opportunity arises.
The Yugoslav national carrier JAT expects the first direct flights to link
Belgrade to Russia and then Greece - both staunch friends of Serbia. Within
weeks, there could be air links with a host of European cities. The lifting
of sanctions was bitterly opposed by the Bosnian government, which insists
that Serbia is still supplying Bosnian Serbs.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Liberation tries to break free of revenue decline: John
Ridding examines the spate of relaunches in the French press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French newspaper vendors will have to clear some extra space and strengthen
their stalls this morning. Liberation, the left-leaning daily, is launching
a radical redesign, with a new typeface, a separate metro section, colour
illustrations, and approximately double its usual 40 or so pages.
Libe III, as it has been dubbed in reference to the newspaper's third
redesign since its first edition in 1973, has ambitious objectives. 'It is a
sort of a revolution as far as the French press is concerned,' claims a
spokesman for the paper. 'The aim is to broaden the appeal of the newspaper
and increase the number of readers.'
Liberation is not alone. Its redesign is part of a broader upheaval in the
French newspaper industry. The staid Le Monde is preparing an ambitious
redesign, to be unveiled at the beginning of next year, as is Infomatin, the
jazzy tabloid which heralded the upheaval with its cut-price, colourful
format when launched in January. Regional newspapers such as Ouest-France
have also been back to the drawing board this year to sharpen their
presentation.
In some cases, such as Le Monde, the redesigns coincide with the 50th
anniversaries of their formation, which often followed the liberation of
Paris in the second world war. For all, however, the motivation lies in a
need to respond to the increased competition in the industry, depressed
sales and reduced advertising revenue.
Sales of national dailies have contracted by more than 15 per cent over the
past three years, while advertising income has suffered an even sharper
decline. As a result, many newspapers have gone into the red. Le Monde
suffered a loss of FFr44m (Pounds 5.3m) last year, compared with a profit of
FFr6m in 1992, while Infomatin expects a deficit of about FFr40m this year.
Others have fared still worse. Le Quotidien, for example, went into
receivership this year. Liberation has remained in profit, but admits its
sales have stagnated over the past few years at about 170,000 copies a day.
Economic recovery promises some improvement in revenues, but the industry
remains beset by deeper problems. A reform of the advertising laws under the
previous Socialist government prompted a shift towards television. As a
spokesman for Liberation points out, daily newspapers must also contend with
a raft of weekly news magazines. 'In France, these magazines are much more
widely read than in other countries. It limits the readership for dailies.'
He said sales of Le Figaro, Le Monde and Liberation, the principal national
newspapers, were less than 1m copies.
Hence the relaunches. 'What Liberation and the others are trying to do is to
create a new readership, to expand their market and break a vicious circle
of declining readership and advertising expenditure,' says a media analyst
at a French merchant bank. He sees a trend towards more accessible
presentation, broader coverage and the introduction of separate sections, as
in the British press. At Le Monde, for example, Mr Jean Marie Colombani, the
editor, promises a new format with easier access, and more contemporary and
international coverage.
Such overhauls, however, are not cheap. Liberation plans to invest more than
FFr200m, of which it has so far raised about FFr75m. Although the national
dailies have largely escaped a price war, the new formats amount to
something similar. Libe III will cost the same FFr6 for twice as many pages.
It is a gamble which raises the survival stakes across the industry.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (2): In the hands of
the experts - Outsourcing / Advantages / Budgets are fixed in advance, and
the supplier has to worry about any unforeseen expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The concept of outsourcing is not an invention of the computer age. Any
company that hires external cleaners, or relies on a local caterer to supply
board meetings with sandwiches is in the business of outsourcing.
The established practice of contracting out necessary services and the
complex world of managing IT systems collided with a vengeance when
companies began to evaluate computing costs. By the late 1980s it was all
too evident that IT projects were prone to run over budget and suck in extra
staff.
In the financial world some institutions found that a disturbing proportion
of their workforce was employed in the IT function. This triggered political
frictions and prompted a movement aimed at putting IT firmly back in its
place, as a critical but subordinate function of the core business.
Here lies the real attraction of outsourcing. Pick a supplier and hand over
the entire responsibility for running IT within an organisation. Budgets are
fixed in advance, and the supplier has to worry about any unforeseen
expense. Recruiting specialist staff is left to the outside contractor, who
may take over the customer's own IT department.
The key to any outsourcing deal is the Service Level Contract (SLC). As long
as the lawyers have done their job, the SLC should be watertight. A
well-drafted SLC embraces the question of handing over the contract to
another contractor or returning it to the customer.
In practice, the business of outsourcing cannot afford disgruntled users.
Any leading outsourcer will co-operate in handing over business to a rival
with a smile, however forced.
Some law firms have fastened on the world of outsourcing as a lucrative new
field. Legal specialists in the outsourcing area are not common, but hiring
a lawyer with the right experience is essential in order to get the most out
of the contract.
The IT sector loves jargon, so a variety of terms have been adopted to
describe aspects of outsourcing. Systems Integration is a project-based
approach, aimed at getting one defined system up and running. Facilities
Management is a common term to cover outsourced computer operations, while
Third Party Maintenance (TPM) can involve hiving off parts of the technology
mandate to qualified contractors.
Whatever the terminology, outsourcing is big business. When Computer
Sciences Corporation clinched a comprehensive outsourcing deal with British
Aerospace (BAe) last year, the contract was valued at Pounds 1bn over a
10-year period. CSC is taking 1,450 BAe employees under its corporate wing,
and will develop and maintain critical computer resources right across BAe's
civil and military business units. Computer maker Bull has won Pounds 35m
worth of contracts since it set up Athesa, a separate outsourcing division,
in January.
All of these contracts allow the user to benefit from the supplier's
accumulated experience. As the outsourcing supplier wins more business it
acquires greater technical wisdom.
It should not concern the user that his outsourcing company also works for a
commercial rival. The point is that the daunting but vital function of IT is
in the hands of the experts. And the computer budget has been tamed at last

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (5): Pragmatic
approach to defeat - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union is a financial services group that decided to move into
private healthcare in 1990. Norwich Union Healthcare (NUH) started life with
25 staff and a business plan aimed at creating the third-largest private
healthcare company in the UK.
With an urgent need to get relevant systems functioning, NUH decided to turn
to an outside supplier. The existing Norwich Union organisation possessed
formidable computing skills, but NUH wanted to buy in expertise in the
specific area of private healthcare. It turned to Electronic Data Systems
(EDS) to recruit key knowledge.
EDS is the US company that made its name in outsourcing before the term had
been invented. Across the Atlantic, healthcare had been a staple of its
business. NUH called in EDS to supply a bag of healthcare programs.
Mike North joined NUH as IT manager in April 1992. His immediate task was to
oversee the transfer of the IT function back to the organisation, while the
FM provider relinquished responsibility.
Why did the contract enjoy such a brief life? 'We employed EDS to get the
business off the ground,' says North. 'But we always said we'd renew the
contract each year.'
This rigorous scrutiny may have made life insecure for the external
supplier, but it allowed the company's own IT experts to sell their skills.
'EDS had to compete against the in-house resources. The internal competition
proved cheaper.'
EDS had given NUH a vital kick-start. It had provided the security and
knowledge to get the business working, according to North. But NUH was smart
enough not to become reliant on one outside contractor. When the internal
management services division won a review in December 1991, the third party
had to hand over the reins of power.
North admits that the return of IT operations to the core company was not
totally trouble-free. 'We use a job-scheduling language, a program whose
purpose is to tell the computer when to run other programs. EDS don't run
this language. So all of that system had to be rewritten and tested.'
Nevertheless, North praises EDS for their pragmatic approach to defeat at
the hands of the customer's IT experts. 'They recognised that their job was
essentially a short-term one.'
What really drove NUH to abandon reliance on an outside source? Money is the
key.
'We could do it cheaper in-house, and it was a better long-term investment
in terms of the commitment of the IT staff.'
North discloses an important drawback to outsourcing: 'We get a better
commitment from people to the company when they're with the company.'
He is not hostile to outsourcing but he believes that it is best used under
particular circumstances. 'If you've got a skills shortage, then this is a
good opportunity to get the expense of running IT out of your hair.'
As things stand, NUH now employs more than 500 staff, with an annual IT
budget of Pounds 1.3m. It can lay claim to 7 per cent of the total private
medical insurance market, with 528,000 customers.
North adds; 'I wouldn't rule out going back to EDS, if they came up with a
good business solution.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (3): A clear exit
route is vital - Outsourcing / Disadvantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to view outsourcing as a panacea, the means to shrug off the
tiresome responsibility of running an IT operation parallel to the core
business. But hiving off a critical business function can have serious
drawbacks, writes Michael Dempsey.
Data is an important asset and the value of this asset often depends on
confidentiality. Virgin Airways discovered to its cost that a third party
cannot always be trusted to play by the book. British Airways maintained
Virgin's computer booking system and BA staff accessed the Virgin data to
poach customers and analyse sensitive information on route profitability.
Then there is the risk of over-reliance. It is absolutely vital to ensure
that any outsourcing or facilities management (FM) contract contains a clear
exit route. This should be one that suits the customer, not the supplier.
Lawyers practising in the area recommend regular review periods and caution
against contracts that lock the customer in for five or 10 years.
Jane Rawlings is a solicitor specialising in computer law at City law firm
Charles Russell. She wrote the FM contract that retail giant Next used to
employ IBM. She is adamant that outsourcing contracts only make sense if the
customer enters into the deal with his eyes open.
'You must set up exit plans; describe the responsibilities of the
outsourcing provider.'
Employees are a potential pitfall. If the IT operation is taken back
in-house, the customer can wind up gaining staff it never wanted in the
first place. 'If you can't use them, then you've got to make them redundant,
and that involves more costs.'
Rawlings notes that some outsourcing companies insist on the transfer of
software licences. Getting the legal licence to use commercial software
reassigned when the outsourcing contract ends can be a nightmare. 'You
should be reluctant to assign software licences to a third party.
'Most software licences prohibit sub-licencing.'
PA Consulting has questioned a large number of businesses on their views
about outsourcing. The companies responding to the IT Sourcing Survey, due
to be published in October, represent Pounds 500m of outsourcing contracts.
It emerges that worries about the impact on personnel who are transferred
from the customer to the outsourcing client abound. Of the respondents, 43
per cent are very concerned about possible damage to staff morale. This
dilemma has eclipsed the question of over-dependence on the supplier.
Maintaining the quality of the service came next, with 38 per cent of
respondents citing this as a negative factor in the outsourcing equation.
Then there is lack of flexibility.
John Little, an IT partner at PA who compiled the survey, notes that among
the 25 per cent of companies who are determined to reject outsourcing and
bring IT back in-house, one lesson was clear.
'The message coming out is that companies are willing to consider abandoning
outsourcing because suppliers are failing to deliver on the partnership.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (7): Systems for the
digital age - Into the future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two pioneering companies in the DTP world  - Aldus and Adobe  - announced
their merger in March this year with the aim of providing systems to meet
the new demands for distributing information in the digital age.
Both companies have for long set world DTP standards.
Adobe, founded in 1982, developed its high-level PostScript page description
which allows users to output text to printers such as the Apple LaserWriter.
Last year, Adobe launched the Acrobat family of software products to capture
type, images, colour and lay-outs and make them transmissible between
computers that have nothing in common  - except Adobe Acrobat.
Aldus, founded in 1984, developed Aldus PageMaker, which allows people to
design, edit and produce printed communications electronically.
More than 2.5m copies of PageMaker have been sold.
For Macintosh and Windows users, PageMaker is the pioneering program for
turning the computer screen into an integrated paste-up board, complete with
professional design aids.
Both companies are innovators in creating what they call 'the desktop
broadcasting revolution' with non-linear digital video editing and digital
post-production production.
Furthermore, a number of repro houses are moving towards the Power Macintosh
 - 'by having this extra speed, it gives me another week's work in year,'
argues one publisher.
Speed and compatibility between desktop computers are important to users  -
'there is also a clear move toward cross-compatibility, enabling, for
example, Macs to 'talk' to Compaq machines,' says Martin Hollis, an analyst
with the Ashdown research group.
Among the innovative pre-press products coming to the market is Kodak's CD
portfolio software.
This is the latest addition to the company's range of software that allows
desktop computer users to create their own Photo CD discs for developing
interactive sound and picture presentations.
Meanwhile, basic DTP system prices have fallen dramatically, particularly at
the lower end. 'At Pounds 50 to Pounds 100, almost anyone can afford a DTP
software package for home or small business use,' comments Peter Foster, a
consultant for International Data Corporation. Training was once a
bottleneck for new DTP entrants, but basic packages are now far more
'intuitive' and user-friendly.
Thus, for the novice, learning the basics of DTP has never been easier.
Microsoft's 'Publisher' has proved to be one of the most popular programs
for beginners.
New software allows non-professional users to easily drop graphics and
images into business documents, creating stunning forms, flow-charts and
reports.
As prices of equipment fall, especially at the lower end of DTP, users are
spoiled for choice. A typical system includes a personal computer, a high
resolution monitor, a 'mouse' or hand-controlled digitiser for positioning
text and graphics, plus software for word-processing, graphics and page
composition, and a laser printer.
Colour is increasingly significant at all levels of DTP. QMS have recently
launched the Magicolour desktop laser printer, priced at about Pounds
10,000, offering colour output significantly higher than colour thermal
transfer and high-end colour laser copiers or printers.
The financial sector leads the way in business applications for DTP with the
production of rapid and attractive overnight reports for investors. For
example, Smith Newcourt, the international stock brokers, have used DTP for
years; the firm is now developing its DTP system as an integral part of an
internal communications system. At the heart is the software package Adobe
PageMaker 5.0 which the company runs worldwide on both PC and Macintosh
platforms.
Mike Frost, publishing systems analyst at Smith Newcourt in London, says the
aim is to make the system even faster to include up-to-the-minute
information-sharing on a worldwide basis.
Linked to the company's electronic mail system, its reports can be published
simultaneously in London, New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (4): Olivetti wins
five-year Pounds 11m deal - Case study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Huw Medcraft is head of technical services at Maidenhead-based airline
reservations giant Galileo. Galileo is a leading player in the highly
competitive world of Computerised Reservations Systems (CRS), servicing UK
travel agencies.
IT is at the heart of Galileo's operations. Including peripheral devices
such as printers, Medcraft is responsible for 24,000 high-technology items
attached to Galileo's UK network.
He has just assigned the role of keeping those machines up and running to a
third party, Olivetti, in a five-year Pounds 11m deal.
Medcraft explains that his organisation already outsourced a number of
services. But IT was different.
'Outsourcing only becomes a big issue when your own staff are performing the
task that is going to be contracted out.' With an annual IT spend in the
region of Pounds 20m, the IT operation is certainly a significant item on
Galileo's balance sheet. But it doesn't make sense to take care of every
detail on an in-house basis.
'In an organisation of our size, it's not cost-effective to support all
those workstations.' Olivetti's outsourcing task is restricted to
engineering support, including software maintenance.
Galileo has decided to retain control of the network that binds some 2,400
travel agents to Galileo.
If Medcraft is committed to the idea of outsourcing, why not go the whole
way? 'We have always seen the network as a source of competitive advantage.
It is the ability to deliver airline tickets that is core to our business.'
Specifically, Medcraft believes there is nothing to gain and everything to
lose by outsourcing this function. 'We wouldn't save money and we could lose
control of the strategic elements of our business.'
Galileo expects to make real savings on those aspects of its work that have
been outsourced. Despite initial charges, such as the termination of
property leases, Medcraft reckons the outsourcing contract will produce a
saving of Pounds 2m over the five years.
The handover date was August 1 this year. But the 52 engineers were told
that they were going to a new employer at the beginning of May. 'We want to
keep those skills on our side even though the people will be working for
Olivetti. We provided a clear opportunity for the staff to talk the deal
through with their new employer.'
Medcraft believes that keeping staff happy is an integral part of successful
outsourcing. And Galileo has kept its grip on its business objectives.
'Outsourcing has not allowed us to relieve ourselves of any obligations. We
still deliver the same services, but now our managers can focus on improving
the product for the end customer.'
And the attraction of outsourcing is mutual. Galileo has just lost Graham
Harrison, its commercial director, to outsourcing giant EDS. Harrison has
been appointed managing director of the EDS financial services division.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (6): Buzzing with
prospects - Michael Wiltshire highlights advances in desktop publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advancing technology is rapidly changing the definition of basic desktop
publishing  - or DTP, as it is called  - since almost all media material can
now be processed on today's powerful desktop computers.
While many users in the past decade have thought of DTP merely as a way of
producing printed documents, the industry is buzzing with prospects of the
new electronic infrastructure that goes far beyond putting ink on paper.
Today's powerful desktop computer systems can also help turn a brochure or
book into a compact disc (CD-ROM), or bring its contents on-line, delivered
through a computer.
Publishing on electronic media, particularly Internet, which links 2.2m
computers and 25m users in 137 countries, was a key topic at this month's
Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco.
'In no way is publishing just getting 'ink on paper,' although that will
surely remain at the core for many years to come,' comments David Heath of
Apple Computer  - the largest single computer vendor to the publishing
industry.
There are several key DTP markets. At the the lower-end, there is the
personal or 'office DTP' sector, which includes in-house publishing for the
promotion of products or services.
Then, at the higher end, there is professional DTP, described by Apple as
'Publishing for profit.' This includes graphic art services and pre-press
work for advertising and publishing of newspapers, books and magazines.
In the past four years, the complex DTP market has further fragmented.
Apart from increasing applications for electronic lay-out tools by designers
and advertising agencies, corporate publishers are producing long,
'content-driven' technical documents and reports which may range from, say,
100 to 3,000 pages.
In this sector, personal computers with Windows packages are increasingly
evident.
In a third development, feature-rich word processing packages are infringing
on the traditional DTP market.
Increasingly, businesses, educators, governments and individual computer
users need systems to author, access and work with the emerging electronic
base of information. This aggressive focus on emerging technologies for what
is called 'information authoring,' is also leading to mergers in the DTP
software industry.
Speed of use, cost-cutting, advanced software and colour-management for
paper documents are among the hot issues at the higher end of DTP. Another
important topic is the ability to view information on-line, using electronic
distribution of documents. Publishing is seldom the product of just one or
two people.
While increasingly powerful PCs are coming to the market, the Apple Mac is
still dominant in the pre-press process, both for graphics, advertising and
design agencies.
Apple has now introduced the Power Macintosh, a new 'platform' based on the
PowerPC, developed jointly by IBM, Apple and Motorola. The Power Mac is
claimed to offer from two to 10 times the performance of current Mac and
Windows-based computers. This speed permits faster use of graphics packages,
allowing designers more time to explore varying approaches.
For example, the intricate process of picture colour-matching can now be
achieved in a fraction of the time it took in the past. Publishers can
therefore cut costs while handling more complex documents, while also
expanding into new media beyond ink on paper, eventually integrating sound,
video, animation, text and still images.
For users of DTP systems, the information explosion via the desktop computer
is also leading to increasing demands for document and data management,
allowing rapid levels of access before the final document is assembled.
'There's no need to send reams of printed information around companies now,'
suggests Fiona O'Carroll, European marketing manager of Frame Technology,
the US document publishing group. 'Users can rapidly view well-laid-out
documents on-line or via CD-Rom disc. A lot of libraries, for example, are
using this system.'

<TEXT>
A weekend meeting between European Union and east European ministers
highlighted German ambitions to advance the cause of EU enlargement to the
east during its six-month presidency of the union. While ministers from
Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria remained
enthusiastic about preparations for inclusion in the single market, they
also outlined the difficulties of bringing their economies into line with
richer neighbours.
The challenge facing the six countries with associate membership is to set
up appropriate legal and institutional frameworks and to harmonise
legislation on competition and state aid. The commission plans to produce a
White Paper next year establishing a programme for the associated countries
to follow for adjusting their economies to the obligations of the internal
market. The east European ministers said the greatest difficulties lay in
competition policy. Harmonisation of rules on intellectual property rights
was also singled out along with the introduction of technical standards on
food, health products and the environment.

<TEXT>
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy minister, said he was not expecting any
additional revenue from privatisations before the end of the year, due to
market conditions. However, the minister has budgeted for income totalling
Pta300bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in 1995 through the disposal of government-held
equity. Mr Solbes' disclosures suggests that Repsol, the
government-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group, is now likely to
postpone for several months an international share offering which it had
planned for the last quarter of this year. Repsol, which is 41 per cent
government-owned and has a broad international investor base, said it would
consult its advisers, Goldman Sachs of the US, and Spain's Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya. The two banks co-ordinated an offer of 13 per cent of the
government's equity in the energy group last year which realised Dollars
866m. Repsol said in May that it hoped to raise between Dollars 1.4bn and
Dollars 2.2bn in a further offering before the end of this year.

Russia is enjoying an upturn in foreign investment attracted by shares in
Russian companies, according to Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's deputy prime
minister for privatisation. He said share prices were soaring following the
end of the voucher auctions in June. The second phase of privatisation - the
selling of company stock for cash, with fewer privileges for the workers -
is now under way. Mr Chubais forecast that foreign investment would be
running at Dollars 1bn a month by the end of this year and would continue to
grow in 1995. It had totalled over Dollars 2bn in the first six months of
the year, and was growing by around 40 per cent a month. Brokers have also
reported a growth in portfolio investments in Russia this year.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of France's ruling RPR Gaullist party, has invited
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to run as number two on his presidential
ticket next year, in an attempt to avoid fratricide between the two
Gaullists. With no vice-presidential slot in France, Mr Balladur would be
designated as prime minister again if Mr Chirac won the presidency. Mr
Chirac said at the weekend that the idea of such a Chirac-Balladur ticket
had been 'imagined some time ago' and would still 'not necessarily be the
worst solution'. But Mr Balladur appears to have no intention of playing
second fiddle to his party leader. According to an IFOP poll in yesterday's
Journal du Dimanche, Mr Balladur's popularity has dropped sharply, with 52
per cent of French declaring themselves satisfied with his government,
compared with 63 per cent in August. But even 52 per cent is a high rating
for a French prime minister, and Mr Balladur continues to do much better
than Mr Chirac in surveys.

<TEXT>
The upper house of Germany's parliament has passed a law to compensate
former property owners in eastern Germany. The law, which will speed up
investment decisions in the five eastern states, follows three years of
wrangling over terms and funding. Under the unification treaty, former
owners are entitled to full compensation or restitution for property
confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by communists between 1949
and 1990.
The law provides compensation based on the valuation of land dating back to
1935. However, assessment will depend on the type of property and whether it
was owned or leased, and a different system will apply for land. For
example, those who had owned family houses and small businesses will receive
compensation, but the 1935 land valuation will be multiplied by seven, the
valuation for those who had rented property will be multiplied by 4.8, while
the valuation for those who owned land will be multiplied 20-fold. The
former owners will receive bonds redeemable in 2004.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Giorgio Armani accused of bribing taxman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As the Italian press has been rubbing home this weekend, the famous names of
fashion are having to get used to a new style - the style of justice.
The name of Giorgio Armani has now been added to a growing list of fashion
designers who have fallen foul of an inquiry by Milan anti-corruption
magistrates into pay-offs to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police.
A total of 14 designers are believed to be under investigation for paying
L1bn (Pounds 407,000) in order to ensure 'friendly' tax inspections of their
accounts. Those involved include the Versace group, Krizia (designer
Mariuccia Mandelli), and Gianfranco Ferre.
The investigation has extended from its initial focus on Milanese
industrialists and comes at an embarrassing moment for Italy's fashion
business, with the annual autumn shows due to start in Milan at the
beginning of October.
On Saturday Mr Giorgio Armani, who has just celebrated his 60th birthday,
was briefly interrogated by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best known of the
anti-corruption magistrates. Mr Oreste Dominioni, his lawyer, subsequently
told journalists Mr Armani had paid L100m during a tax inspection in 1990 to
members of the financial police.
The payment was made under duress, Mr Dominioni said. This is the same
defence employed by every businessman caught up in this investigation - from
steel magnate Alberto Falck to Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the prime minister's
brother.
Mr Armani's appearance before Mr Di Pietro was quickly followed by
Gianfranco Ferre, the architect turned designer. He declined to comment on
his interrogation; but judicial sources said he admitted paying over L300m
also in 1990 at the time of a tax inspection.
Both Giorgio Armani and Gianfranco Ferre are among the most successful of
the Italian designers. Armani's 1993 worldwide turnover was L856bn; while
that of Gianfranco Ferre, who designed the Italian world cup football team's
outfit, was close to L900bn.
The problem now is less the damage to the image of Italy's profitable and
dynamic fashion business and much more where will the magistrates turn their
attention next. More than 50 members of the Guardia di Finanza have been
arrested, including a general and an official working with Mr Di Pietro.
Three have committed suicide over the past three months. Most of these
officials are now co-operating under plea bargaining deals.
'Why pick on the designers and not say the cake-makers?' commented satirist
Mr Philippe Daverio. It would seem that the magistrates are determined to
remind the public with these easily identifiable figures that
anti-corruption investigations have restarted with vigour after the summer
break.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Berlusconi set for showdown talks with unions on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government will today make a third and possibly final attempt to
convince the sceptical trade union movement to accept proposals for pension
reform.
The proposals, already watered down last week to meet union objections, are
central in the preparation of the 1995 budget, which has to be presented to
parliament by Friday.
The centre-right coalition government's credibility with financial markets
hangs on the final form of the budget.
The lira has been under pressure since early August because of fears that Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, will lack the leadership to push
through a convincing austerity package.
Before meeting trade union leaders, Mr Berlusconi has scheduled a summit of
his coalition partners.
This is intended to co-ordinate the government's final position; but Mr
Berlusconi must also resolve the increasingly thorny problem of the future
of the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation.
Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League, is committed
to introducing legislation to overturn recent government appointments to the
new management and editorial control of the RAI.
The League has forged an alliance with the opposition, which is worried that
the government now controls both public and commercial television.
A League-opposition alliance would have a parliamentary majority and the
government could be completely humiliated.
Over the weekend Pres-ident Oscar Luigi Scalfaro gave implicit backing to
the League and opposition protests, and warned that television must be run
with an even hand in the interest of all Italians.
This continued guerr-illa activity against Mr Berlusconi from among his own
coalition partners risks impinging on the preparation of the budget.
Matters are further complicated by a report, which is due out this week, by
three legal experts whom Mr Berlusconi has asked to draw up proposals to
avoid a conflict of interest between his ownership of his Fininvest media
empire and his role as prime minister.
For the 1995 budget, the government is seeking to find up to L50,000bn
(Pounds 20.3bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts to hold the public
sector deficit in 1995 to below 9 per cent of gross domestic product.
Under pressure from the trade unions, the government has reduced its
emphasis on spending cuts and placed more importance on revenues.
But the precise amount to be found from cuts in pension benefits still has
to be negotiated.
The treasury originally sought L8,000bn but last week this figure appeared
increasingly unrealistic.
The unions are threatening a general strike if the government is unable to
bridge the gap in their positions.
On Saturday, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the head of Fiat and recognised spokesman
for Italian business opinion, hosted an informal dinner for Mr Berlusconi
and industrialists.
Though the occasion was reportedly amicable, it was nevertheless a clear
indication of the industrialists' growing impatience at the series of
own-goals committed by the five month-old Berlusconi government.
Mr Agnelli is understood to have conveyed the industrialists' fears if the
budget fails to convince financial markets.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (1): A bewildering
variety of options - Corporate data processing is going through some of the
most radical changes since electronic computers were first used in business
in the 1950s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The confusion and uncertainty which has characterised the computer industry
over the past five years is mirrored among its customers. There has never
been a greater need for sound consultancy and advice as technological
advances provide a bewildering variety of options for companies looking for
greater economies and better information.
At the same time, a new and technologically-aware cadre of managers is
beginning to make its presence felt in many companies.
According to the Price Waterhouse Information Technology Review, which
monitors change in the data processing business: 'The good news is that the
days when IT directors joined the board for a title and little else may be
gone. They are now in the inner sanctum of policy makers. . . It is the
rumoured convergence of the IT director and the chief executive officer that
is the really exciting idea'.
Well, perhaps. The fact remains that corporate data processing is going
through some of the most radical changes since electronic computers were
first used in business in the 1950s.
To some extent this is the result of developments in computer technology
which are making possible new ways of doing business. But it is also a
consequence of a disaffection among customers with the high-handed attitude
during the 1980s of computer manufacturers who attempted to dictate data
processing strategies to their customers.
As a consequence, data processing was one of the first capital spending
areas to be cut back when recession hit both in the US and Europe.
International Data Corporation, the business consultancy says: 'Both
corporate results and market trends confirm that 1993 was the worst year in
the history of information technology in Europe, with a growth of only 2 per
cent following five consecutive years of decline.'
It adds: 'The information technology business is starting to bottom out from
this negative cycle with signs that recovery is finally on its way.' IDC
estimates that growth across Europe is likely to be about 4 per cent this
year.
What sort of data processing business is likely to emerge, however? The
apparent recovery begs a number of important questions. First, are suppliers
of data processing equipment truly listening to their customers'
requirements or are they still intent merely on selling the latest
technology, relevant or not?
The shift from mainframes to networks of personal computers and mid-range
computers (client-server systems) is a case in point. The basic proposition
is simple: because microprocessor-based, distributed systems cost less than
central mainframes it makes economic sense to move from mainframes to client
server networks.
A result has been a steady decline in mainframe revenues which has hurt all
the large computer manufacturers while generating business for PC and
workstation makers.
According to an Economist research report: 'An extraordinary feature of the
recession of the early 1990s has been the propensity for European customers
to keep buying (personal) computers. There have been cut-backs, budget
freezes and huge numbers of bankruptcies and redundancies yet the PC market
has grown by 12.5 per cent in units terms in 1992 and by around 14 per cent
in 1993. Projections for 1994 are that demand will continued to rise and
that unit growth could increase by more than 20 per cent on 1993.'
But purchase of machinery does not automatically translate into savings. An
important point is that client-server computing is different in kind to
traditional data processing. It seeks to spread computing power throughout
the organisation, giving a broader range of personnel access to information
and processing power.
One indication of this is the way the expression 'executive information
system'  - a way of extracting and consolidating essential information from
a company's database  - has fallen into disuse. Today, the aim is to provide
the appropriate information to people at all levels in a company.
There is a cost associated with all this. According to the Gartner Group,
which assesses business data processing strategies, client server systems
are expensive and labour consuming. For a hypothetical large organisation it
estimated a total cost of ownership over five years at Dollars 241.8m of
which less than 20 per cent was the cost of hardware.
An analysis published by International Business Machines, which has a vested
interest in mainframe sales, suggests that the cost per user per year of a
PC network is Dollars 6,445 while the comparable cost for a mainframe user
is only Dollars 2,282. It goes on to suggest the average cost per
transaction for a PC network is 43 cents but only three cents for a
mainframe-based system.
What cannot yet be factored into the equation is the business benefits of
either approach. In general, client-server computing would seem to offer
greater flexibility and applicability than mainframe systems but it is still
in an early state in its development. The pros and cons of moving to
client-server computing need to be weighed carefully.
A second question concerns business process re-engineering (BPR), an
essentially simple idea which has established itself quickly in the canon of
management jargon. BPR involves changing the way a company carries out its
business operations to make them more effective rather than automating what
already exists. It is a little like redesigning an aircraft in flight. Great
skill is required to prevent a crash before the process is complete.
Nevertheless, a majority of the world's largest companies claim to be
re-engineering all or part of their business as they move from the large,
centralised operations with hierarchical chains of command focused on
products which were typical of the 1980s to dispersed partnerships
conferring local autonomy on their managers with a sensitivity to consumer
requirements. The Price Waterhouse review notes that there are now two
distinct types of BPR. First, where a business process is transformed, but
the business remains the same. It gives as an example a chemicals company
which eliminated 42 kinds of invoice and its order office by switching to
electronic data interchange.
Second, where the business itself is transformed with new objectives and a
new organisational structure. A building society, for example, reconstituted
its branches as customer service centres staffed by salespeople with
automated cash machines for deposit and dispensing. The key is that
technology is used to implement change rather than the other way about. Mr
Thomas Davenport of Ernst &amp; Young in his book Process Innovation makes the
need for continuous development plain: 'A company that does not institute
continuous improvement after implementing process innovation is likely to
revert to old ways of doing business'.
A third question about the new data processing environment concerns
outsourcing. Many large companies are beginning to treat data processing as
if it were a commodity such as gas or electricity, contracting with a third
party for its supply at an agreed service level for an agreed price.
The UK government's 'market testing' programme for services including tax
and vehicle registration has highlighted what is for many companies a
controversial area. Outsourcing can be seen alternatively as giving away the
company's crown jewels or giving up a non-core activity. The key is the
quality of the deal.
Business Intelligence, a marketing consultancy, noted earlier this year that
many companies have been tempted by substantial apparent cost savings into
poorly thought out contracts that may cost them more than maintaining their
data processing in-house.
This survey deals in depth with these and other issues vital to companies as
they move into the new era of business data processing. The indications are
that they must remain on their guard. Suppliers may pay lip service to
customer power but may have little intention of letting them exercise it.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Salinas campaigns tolead world trade body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico today launches his public campaign to
become head of the proposed World Trade Organisation with a call for
governments to intensify efforts to ratify the Uruguay Round trade
agreement.
Mr Salinas is one of two leading candidates to head the WTO, which is
expected to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade early next
year.
The appointee will be chosen by consensus later in the autumn. The other
main candidate is Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, who
is being backed by the EU.
Mr Salinas, who is expected to receive US support, says the new organisation
has to be:
Representative of world trade. The 20 countries, including Russia and the
Ukraine, seeking admission to the world trading system should be admitted
promptly;
A reliable institution for its members, which requires that all governments
be committed to its rules and be engaged in the WTO at the highest level;
Responsive to the evolving needs of the international economy.

FT  26 SEP 94 / Union optimistic over rail deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both sides in the rail dispute were last night edging closer to a deal that
could bring an end to nearly three months of disruption on the network.
After more than 40 hours of talks over five days at the conciliation service
Acas, RMT transport union officials believe a package of measures linking
higher pay to improved efficiency is close to completion. Negotiations are
expected to continue at Acas today.
Last night, union officials said the talks were unlikely to produce an
immediate settlement that could be approved by both the union and Railtrack,
the state-owned company responsible for maintaining the network's
infrastructure.
They said it was more likely the RMT would acknowledge publicly that the
best deal achievable in the circumstances had been negotiated and there was
no possibility of further improvement.
Any deal would have to be put to the union's executive before going to
ballot. The 4,600 signal workers who have staged 19 days of strikes would
have the final say on whether to accept any proposed pay and efficiency
package.
The union executive could decide whether to recommend acceptance or
rejection of the offer but it could not exercise any power of veto. The RMT
could hold a ballot this week if a settlement is reached soon.
Union officials said the RMT would be likely to give some ground to secure a
deal, although it would not give in to all management demands. 'It will be a
typical compromise after a long dispute,' one senior RMT member said.

FT  26 SEP 94 / European neighbours fall out over garden gnomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanislaw Sawicki says he no longer understands the meaning of free
trade.
'All I want to do is to sell my garden gnomes. But the Germans will not
allow them into the country,' he said outside his small factory. 'If the
European Union means anything at all, it should be about free trade. Our
gnomes represent many of the things that are wrong with the EU.'
Two years ago, Mr Sawicki, like other budding entrepreneurs in Nowa Sol, a
small Polish town 80km from the border, decided to start manufacturing
garden gnomes for the German market.
'The Germans loved our gnomes,' he said. 'They were just like the German
ones, and they were much, much cheaper. Here was a real chance for
competition.'
Business was brisk. Mr Sawicki and his staff of six were making 4,800
plaster and 2,000 plastic gnomes a month. 'We would just go across the
border and sell them . . . We were selling the big gypsum gnomes, which are
75cm high, for about DM13 (Pounds 5.30), and the plastic ones for about
DM24. Normally, the German-made gnomes cost over DM100.'
Then things started to go wrong. 'One day, the German customs officials
would not let my gnomes cross the border. They said we were, well, I suppose
pirating the German design,' said Mr Sawicki. 'But what is it all about?
Business is business. The German gnome manufacturers are just afraid of
competition.'
German customs officials, who since unification spend a great deal of time
trying to prevent counterfeit goods entering the country from eastern
Europe, say they are simply applying the law to the Polish gnomes.
Mr Gerd Grau, a senior federal customs official responsible for the eastern
German state of Brandenburg which adjoins Poland, said his staff were trying
to stem the smuggling of pirated goods into Germany.
'German designs, and other labels, whether they relate to clothes,
sportwear, perfume, or tape cassettes, are being copied and produced very
cheaply in eastern Europe and making their way into Germany - garden gnomes
included. I'll show you what I mean,' he said.
Mr Grau took out a large file containing photographs of garden gnomes. 'You
see these gnomes. These are authentic German gnomes. If any Pole tries to
bring an exact replica of any of these designs across the border, we cannot
allow them into the country.'
Polish gnome manufacturers can apply for the licence to copy and produce a
German garden gnome. Mr Franz Sikora, an official at the patent office,
said: 'The Poles could pay a symbolic price for the licence by seeking
permission from those German firms who hold the copyright. And then they
would be free to sell their gnomes here in Germany.'
German gnome manufacturers, however, are not keen on selling their
copyright. Heissner, one of Germany's oldest companies specialising in
garden gnomes, believes it is a question of preserving quality.
'We have been making and painting our gnomes by hand ever since we started
back in 1880,' said Ms Helga Naueckert, for Heissner. 'We sell about 700,000
garden gnomes each year. Our gnomes are expensive. The 70cm-high ceramic
gnomes cost DM269 and the plastic ones cost between DM100-DM140. But people
pay for quality. I am not so sure this quality can be sold to the Poles.'
Ms Naueckert admitted, however, that the Poles were attempting to introduce
some competition into the market. 'Of course it is a question about
protecting our copyright. But it is also about the market being exposed to
more competition.'
Some Polish gnome manufacturers have tried to get around the obstacle by
selling their gnomes on the Polish side of the border crossing.
'I cannot get my gnomes into Germany any more. So I sell them on the
roadside,' said Mr Roman Olba, a gnome exporter who buys his gnomes from the
Nowa gnome enterprise in Nowa Sol.
German day trippers are held crucial in helping to correct Poland's trade
gap - Dollars 2bn in 1992.
'If we can't sell the gnomes in Germany, the Germans will come to Poland to
buy them,' said Mr Jacek Szlachta, deputy director of Poland's central
planning office. 'Over 40m Germans crossed into Poland last year. I reckon
they each spend an average of DM50. This has already helped reduce our
negative trade balance to Dollars 100m last year.'
That is little comfort to Mr Olba. 'I can't live off selling the gnomes on
the Polish roadside . . . I now have to drive to the Czech Republic and make
my way over to Austria and Switzerland where I can earn hard currency. But
that's a long drive.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / PepsiCo plans to centralise buying to save Dollars 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PepsiCo, the US beverage, snacks and restaurant business, hopes to save
Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) a year in its rapidly expanding European
operations by centralising the purchase of services and materials, including
television advertising, sugar, flour and packaging.
Heads of Pepsi-Cola, Pizza Hut, KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) and
the company's snack food division have been meeting over the past year to
identify which items they purchase in common. The company is hoping that the
savings, which would carve about 5 per cent off PepsiCo's Dollars 2bn costs
in Europe, will be in place in a year.
As part of the same exercise, the company has launched a drive to persuade
its trade customers, including leisure park operators and cinema chains, to
buy the full range of PepsiCo products and services. It recently flew 600
trade customers from eastern and western Europe to Club Med in Ibiza for a
weekend of presentations and lavish entertainment.
The company wants the different PepsiCo businesses, particularly in newly
developing eastern European markets, to share distribution costs, office
overheads and staff training. It might even put differently branded
restaurants on adjoining sites.
Mr Peter Hearl, European head of KFC, said that if PepsiCo's efforts in
Europe were successful then 'other parts of the PepsiCo world', including
businesses in north and south America, and Asia Pacific, could follow suit.
Europe is becoming an increasingly important market for PepsiCo. About 80
per cent of the company's profits are generated in the US at present, but it
hopes to reduce this to about 50 per cent over the next six years.
Arch-rival Coca-Cola is dependent on the US for just 20 per cent of its
profits - a fact which has helped to shield it from the effects of stiff
competition in the home market.
The company's different businesses have had a history of separate
development, said Mr Wayne Mailloux, president of Pepsi-Cola Europe: 'We
tend to operate with very autonomous, decentralised divisions, so much so
that our customers do not really know us for all of the various dimensions
that we represent.'
He dismissed the idea that increased centralisation might dampen the
commercial zeal of individual divisional heads. 'We're never going to allow
ourselves to become a government bureaucracy. We will always put
entrepreneurial drive first.'

FT  26 SEP 94 / Clarke proposes IMF gold sale to help poor nations: UK plan
aims to boost economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold reserves to
finance a plan to help poor countries, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of
the exchequer, will propose tomorrow.
Mr Clarke will tell the Commonwealth countries' finance ministers at their
meeting in Malta that his plan would benefit heavily indebted countries that
are trying to reform their economies.
His plan goes further than the so-called Trinidad terms, which were intended
to reduce the burden of debts owed by poor countries to other governments.
The new proposals would help those countries that owe large sums to
international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. Such debt is not
covered by the Trinidad terms.
Mr Clarke's suggestion that the IMF should sell part of its gold reserves to
finance the scheme is likely to prove controversial.
His plan would benefit indebted countries which are complying with IMF
programmes for the 'structural adjustment' of their economies. The countries
which Mr Clarke thinks are most likely to benefit include Guyana, Honduras,
Kenya, Laos, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Uganda.
Mr Clarke will call for the IMF to increase its enhanced structural
adjustment facility, which provides concessional loans to poor countries,
and improve the terms on which such concessional loans are made. The World
Bank would also extend its concessional lending programme. The aim would be
to reduce interest payments on debt to a low level and extend the period
required for repayment.
The UK believes the IMF would need to sell less than 10 per cent of its gold
reserves, currently worth about Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.3bn), to finance the
scheme. Sales would be spread out over several years and could be managed so
as not to disrupt the gold market.
Persuading the IMF to sell part of its gold might prove difficult, but the
UK feels that too much of the fund's reserves are held in gold, which pays
no income. The UK argues the proceeds from the gold sales could be
reinvested in income-earning assets. The assets could still be held as
reserves with the income from them devoted to the debt plan.
Mr Clarke acknowledges that his plan could only be accepted after extensive
negotiations. The Trinidad terms, first proposed in 1990 by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, but then chancellor, are still not fully accepted by all
countries concerned. Nevertheless, nearly Dollars 3bn of debts have been
written off under the terms to date, with 22 countries having benefited.
The new scheme would require approval by 85 per cent of IMF members, but
would not involve a change in the fund's articles and thus would not require
legislative action in member countries.
Following the Commonwealth finance ministers' meeting, Mr Clarke will go
straight to the IMF annual meeting in Madrid, where the UK and the US will
be pressing for a special allocation of special drawing rights (the IMF's
reserve currency) to help poorer nations.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Spelling out the risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following publication in April of disclosure proposals for life assurance
products, the Personal Investment Authority - the new regulator to protect
the private investor - this week published proposals for unit trust
disclosure.
As with life assurance disclosure, the basic format is a simple, four-page
leaflet. This sets out the aims of the fund, the commitment asked from the
investor, the risk factors involved and, most importantly, the effect of the
charges on the value of the investment.
For unit trusts, providing clear details of a product's aims always have
been an essential part of disclosure although, compared with any long-term,
front-end loaded insurance product, the amount of commitment involved in a
unit trust investment is minimal. Risk factors and the effect of charges are
more difficult.
On risk, the PIA goes well beyond the hallowed formula about fluctuating
values - 'the price of units and the income from them can go down as well as
up' - to include all the factors which might have an adverse effect on
performance or are otherwise relevant to a decision to invest.
The most controversial proposals will undoubtedly be those on the effect of
charges. These have been rising steadily since they stopped being regulated
in 1979. Before then, the initial charge and the annual charge added
together could not exceed 13.25 percentage points over 20 years (say, 3.25
per cent initially and 0.5 per cent a year).
Today, the typical unit trust charges 6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent
a year. This adds up to 36 percentage points over 20 years - nearly three
times what used to be permitted.
The unit trust movement is, rightly, proud of the fact that charges always
have been stated clearly. The problem has been that the effect of those
charges is never set out. And while the numbers seem very small, they have a
big impact.
After all, a 1.5 per cent charge will reduce the returns from a growth rate
of 7.5 per cent by 20 per cent, and from a 5 per cent growth rate by 30 per
cent. The PIA proposals shy away from explaining this.
The clearest way of showing the effect of charges is to give the value of an
investment at a fixed growth rate, assuming no charges, and to compare it
with the value after making allowance for charges. This could be done in a
simple two-column table using a standard Pounds 1,000 investment, periods of
0, 1, 5, 10 and 25 years, and a sensible growth rate of perhaps 5 per cent.
The proposals reject the idea of showing these two growing values side by
side. Instead, they set out a table of charges (see column two) extracted
from a Pounds 1,000 investment over 1, 3, 5 and 10 years assuming no growth,
and a similar table showing growth at the optimistic rate of 7.5 per cent
(or 9 per cent for personal equity plans).
Dangling the effect of charges in this way begs the question: effect on
what? And the useful addition of showing the effect of any spread with
returns at 0 years is rejected on the ground that very few people ever sell
their investment on the day they buy it.
True. But few people sell their new car as they drive out of the showroom -
yet no one thinks it odd to show its immediate depreciation in that way.

FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Building societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's UK Treasury document on building societies smacks of regulatory
capture. Though the aim is to solicit opinion about future regulation, the
tone suggests support for further liberalisation with only token gestures on
accountability. The paper is quick to point, for example, to the need to bar
'obstructive' member-nominated directors. Doubtless society boards would
like freedom without more responsibility, but one must also ask why the
debate about deregulation has arisen in the first place.
The market in which societies operate is no longer just concerned with
housing finance. What was once their main activity has been subsumed into a
broader retail financial services industry in which the societies compete
with banks. In the interest of fair competition it would make sense for all
players to come under the same regulatory framework. That might involve
lifting restrictions on building societies, so that they can make syndicated
loans to housing associations. But it then becomes hard to justify a
corporate structure which exempts them from paying dividends to their owners
and makes them almost immune to outside takeover.
One step towards improved accountability would be to require society boards
to be elected by a general meeting with members' votes weighted by size of
deposit and length of association. Another would be to insist that hostile
takeovers are communicated to members immediately, not simply 'at the next
general meeting' as the government is proposing. Alliance &amp; Leicester
already owns a bank. It would be unsatisfactory if Lloyds Bank proved with
its bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester that banks are in effect barred from
owning a society.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Brussels may act to curb bank charges for money transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union banks may face increased pressure to limit double charging
and hidden costs on internal cross-border payments and speed up the rate at
which they are carried out.
Such pressure, from the European Commission, might take the form of an EU
directive. It would be aimed at easing the costs on consumers and small
businesses that rely on banks to make transfer payments within the EU, and
would remove an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the single market.
Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirasi, commissioner responsible for the single
market, told ministers at a meeting in eastern Germany that the pressure on
banks to stop double charging - imposing fees at the sending and receiving
end of a transfer - had to be stepped up.
However, he sought to allay bank fears by emphasising that any legislation
would not be 'heavy or intrusive' but the minimum necessary to improve the
current situation.
The need for action follows a survey, ordered by the Commission, which found
that many banks were not complying with EU targets, set at the end of last
year, on double charging, transparency and the time taken to complete a
transfer.
The targets decreed that cross-border transfers should not attract double
charging and that banks had to provide clients with complete written
information on the costs involved in payments. An initial report last year
said charges were duplicated in 43 per cent of transactions. It found found
that 'on average a 100 ecu cross-border transaction cost 20 ecus'.
Banks were also required to complete the cross-border transaction on the
first working day after receiving the request.
Mr Vanni D'Archirasi's inclination to take legislative action is likely to
lead to a row in the Commission. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner
responsible for consumer affairs, believes a voluntary code of conduct for
banks would be more appropriate.
The banking lobby has also mounted an effective campaign against
legislation, arguing that regulation might result in banks withdrawing their
services altogether. They argue that tough requirements on speed might cause
banks to refuse to execute payments to EU countries with less efficient
payment systems.
The European Community Banking Federation wrote to Mr Vanni D'Archirasi in
the summer urging pragmatic joint action between banks and the Commission
and objecting to a draft plan on cross-border payments. On double charging,
the federation argued that the Commission should recognise the merits of
offering customers a choice of charging arrangements.
However, not all banks oppose legislation. Some believe that the present
arrangements discriminate against banks that stick to the guidelines. They
would like legislation to make standards conform.

FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden signs merger agreement
with KKR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the beleaguered US food group, formally gave up its independence
yesterday by signing a definitive merger agreement with buy-out specialists
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR).
KKR's Dollars 2bn bid for Borden, announced two weeks ago, had been
criticised by some shareholders as inadequate.
Mr Frank Tasco, Borden chairman, said 'while the restructuring plan Borden
has pursued since January was progressing, it is clear that Borden requires
substantial further restructuring which would significantly increase the
risks and financial burdens on the company'.
An alternative takeover plan for Borden had been put forward by the investor
Mr Paul Kazarian. The plan involved cash, whereas KKR will pay for Borden
with shares in the food and tobacco group RJR Nabisco. A Borden spokesman
said yesterday Mr Kazarian was free to pursue his offer. Mr Kazarian, whose
ability to raise the money has been doubted in some quarters, was
unavailable for comment.
Mr Tasco said: 'We concluded the benefits of this transaction with KKR -
providing an immediate premium and the opportunity to participate in the
future of RJR Nabisco - represent the clear, best outcome for Borden
shareholders.'
KKR expects to gain control of Borden by the year-end.

FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: London's buses stay red says buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of London's double-decker red buses, a symbol of the capital from New
Delhi to New York, changed owners yesterday. But the buyer has pledged to
keep the fleet 'predominantly red'.
The government promised this year that the double-decker bus, a
once-in-a-lifetime ride for many tourists, would retain its traditional
livery after the 10 London bus companies were sold to the private sector.
But some new bus operators have introduced multi-coloured vehicles on their
routes and Londoners fear the loss of a well-loved friend.
The sale of the London Central bus company to the Go-Ahead Group for nearly
Pounds 24m means that four London bus companies have been privatised with
the rest to follow shortly.
Mr Trevor Shears, Go-Ahead finance director, said: 'We have buses in other
parts of the country in nearly every colour you can think of but we will be
keeping the London buses predominantly red as required in our agreement with
London Transport.'
Go-Ahead will also keep the 100 Routemasters, which carry a conductor as
well as a driver, on its busiest routes. London Central operates nearly 500
buses on routes in south-east London as well as in the city centre.
Go-Ahead, based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, has been expanding rapidly,
acquiring bus companies in Brighton and Oxford in recent months.
The sale of Central means that London Buses has made Pounds 87m from the
sale of the four companies, indicating that it will far exceed its initial
estimate of about Pounds 100m from the privatisation programme.
Go-Ahead is paying Pounds 20m cash for London Central and will also repay
Pounds 3.8m of the company's loans. The purchase will be funded by a Pounds
25m secured loan facility.
London Central achieved revenues of Pounds 40.6m in the year to March 1994,
and Go-Ahead hopes to reduce costs to improve on the Pounds 2.54m operating
profits.

Small companies remain confident about growth prospects, in spite of
inflationary pressures and impending tax increases.
A survey of 405 senior executives around the country showed 57 per cent were
more optimistic than just three months ago.
The survey involved more than 1000 executives at companies with market
values of less than Pounds 320m. It was the second six-monthly survey by the
investment bank, SG Warburg, and wascarried out in August and September.
Warburgs says small companies were expecting strong growth in exports and 46
per cent reported order books bet-ween 1 and 10 per cent ahead of just three
months ago.

FT  24 SEP 94 / White House press chief keeps her job: Clinton overrules
plan to replace Dee Dee Myers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has overruled his chief of staff's recommendation to
replace Ms Dee Dee Myers as White House press secretary. A personal appeal
from Ms Myers to the president on Thursday evening appears to have been
instrumental in his decision.
Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of staff, announced an extensive reshuffling of
duties in the White House yesterday afternoon, designed, he said, 'to
establish clear lines of authority'. He added that 'good judgment' had not
always been exercised in the past, a reference to a number of embarrassing
controversies ranging from the travel office to Whitewater-related matters.
Two of Mr Clinton's closest aides, both previously with virtually unimpeded
access to the Oval Office, are given more specified duties. Mr George
Stephanopoulos is to be executive assistant for policy in Mr Panetta's
office, while Mr Bruce Lindsey moves to become a deputy White House legal
counsel. Mr Harold Ickes also gains more power as deputy chief of staff for
policy and political affairs.
But the immediate impact of his changes was diluted by the resolution of Ms
Myers's status. Although Mr Panetta said it was 'not true' he wanted someone
else as press secretary, there seems little doubt that Mr Clinton did
overrule the former congressman and budget director.
His plan, widely circulated in the capital on Thursday, would have had Ms
Myers replaced as press secretary by Mr Mike McCurry, currently the state
department's chief spokesman. She would have been given unspecified broader
responsibilities in the White House communications network.
This prompted Ms Myers to appeal directly to Mr Clinton in what was
described as an 'emotional' session in which she may have threatened to
resign. Mr Clinton, not unaccustomed to making up his mind at the last
minute, decided not only to retain her as press secretary but to give her
greater access to senior policy-makers, including himself.
Ms Myers is the first female press secretary and one of the most visible
women on the team. Her departure under protest would not have looked good,
especially since Mr Panetta's reshuffle also involved two other senior
female staff members. Ms Joan Baggett remains political director but must
now report to Mr Ickes, while Ms Ricki Seidman, in charge of presidential
scheduling, is leaving the government.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Ex-Yugoslavia sanctions eased: UN Security Council rewards

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Security Council early this morning eased sanctions
against the rump Yugoslav state to reward Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic for cutting off supplies to Bosnian Serbs and accepting
international monitors on his border, Reuter reports from the UN.
The vote was 11 in favour, two against and two abstentions. Voting against
were Pakistan and Djibouti. Abstaining were Nigeria and Rwanda. The
resolution was sponsored by the US, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Spain.
At the same time the council imposed new travel and economic curbs on the
Bosnian Serbs, with China abstaining because of its general opposition to
sanctions. A third resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, condemns ethnic
cleansing in Banja Luka and elsewhere and demands access for UN personnel to
these areas.
The controversial resolution on easing the embargo against the Yugoslav
states of Serbia and Montenegro suspends for 100 days bans on passenger
flights to Belgrade and cultural and sports exchanges. It will also allow
ferry service between the Montengran port of Bar and Bari in Italy.
The measures go into force a day after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary general, receives a report from the border monitors that Serbia is
banning all but humanitarian supplies from crossing into Bosnia. The strict
trade embargo against Yugoslavia remains in effect.
Sanctions would return if Mr Boutros Ghali reported that Belgrade was again
shipping proscribed goods across the Bosnian border
The resolution had faced a storm of protests from Islamic member states. In
an official statement they termed it 'nothing less than rewarding the
aggressor, undermining the peace process and sacrificing the principles
enshrined in the UN Charter'.
The US, which joined Russia, Britain, France and Germany in drafting the
proposal, had wanted to delay a vote pending talks that President Bill
Clinton is due to have in New York tomorrow with Bosnian Moslem leaders, but
relented after private consultations with the other members.
Without timely Council action, there were fears that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic would go back on the agreement.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Trade union setback for Norwegian EU hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's Labour government suffered a setback yesterday in its struggle to
win approval for Norwegian membership of the European Union when the LO
blue-collar trade union confederation recommended that its members vote No
in the referendum on November 28.
The LO, whose 780,000 members represent a large chunk of the electorate,
voted by 156-149 at a special congress to recommend a No vote, defying the
pro-EU line of the Labour party to which the LO is closely tied.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, has worked hard to keep the
Labour party, by far the country's largest political party, committed to a
Yes vote despite a significant anti-EU stream within its ranks.
She was hoping the LO would do likewise to ensure the entire labour movement
leadership was united behind the Yes campaign.
Instead, the LO vote - and the acrimonious debate that preceded it -
underscored the divisions within the movement which Mrs Brundtland had
hitherto managed to disguise.
The No camp, which holds a strong lead in the opinion polls, hailed the LO
vote as a significant development. 'Psychologically it is very important
that the country's largest wage-earner organisation has said No,' commented
Mr Hallvard Bakke, leader of the anti-EU faction within the Labour party.
An opinion poll earlier this week in the newspaper Aftenposten showed 50 per
cent of Norwegians intended to vote No, with 28 per cent in favour and 22
per cent undecided, a slight strengthening of the No side since August.
The poll also showed the No lead strengthening even if Finland and Sweden,
which vote first, supported entry. In those circumstances 47 per cent would
vote against and 39 per cent for, compared with a No lead of just 43-42 in
August.

FT  24 SEP 94 / A warm autumn breeze blows from Moscow: Interview - Anthony
Robinson meets Russia's new - and friendly - ambassador to the court of St
James
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anatoly Adamishin, Russia's new ambassador to the court of St James, slipped
quietly into London last week and tackled his first task - smoothing the way
for President Boris Yeltsin, who arrives today for talks with prime minister
John Major.
His next job will be to ensure that all goes well next month when the Queen
pays a state visit to Russia - the first British monarch ever to do so.
Relations between Britain and Russia have not been as warm or as close for
decades. Adamishin, a career diplomat, who has been increasingly influential
in shaping Russian foreign policy, is welcomed in London as a man who
embodies the 'new thinking'. He has thus been much involved in Russia's
efforts to reintegrate into the wider world.
Adamishin, who served as ambassador to Italy and deputy foreign minister
before coming to London, says this process started when Britain's former
prime minister Margaret Thatcher, described Mikhail Gorbachev 'as a man I
can do business with.' This was several months before he became the last
communist ruler of the Soviet Union. However at about that time, Adamishin
himself was playing an important part in reshaping Russia's relations with
the rest of the world, during negotiations in a most unlikely place -
Africa.
The quietly-spoken diplomat, was at the centre of the international effort
in the mid-1980s to persuade the Cubans to remove their troops from Angola.
The Cuban withdrawal ended a military threat to South Africa's security and
persuaded Pretoria to grant independence to Nambibia This withdrawal was
thus an important condition for the eventual ending of apartheid in South
Africa.
During these negotiations, Adamishin made some unlikely friends, including
Pik Botha, South Africa's crusty former foreign minister.
During months of shuttle diplomacy, which took him back and forth to Luanda,
Brazzaville, Windhoek, New York and other more secret places, Adamishin
gained the respect and trust of some of the most influential people in
western diplomacy, including Sir Robin Renwick, now UK ambassador to
Washington.
'It was touch and go right to the end', Adamishin says. 'The night before we
were due to complete the agreement in New York the Cubans said they would
not sign. I told them in that case Moscow would not sign either. But then I
spelt out a whole series of negative consequences which would follow. In the
morning, they signed.'
Such a breakthrough would have been impossible had the veteran Soviet
foreign minister Andrei Gromyko still been in charge. But shortly after
Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Eduard Shevardnadze took over the foreign
ministry.
'New thinking' swept through the foreign policy establishment and Adamishin,
who had languished in Moscow for more than 20 years as a speech writer and
increasingly influential counsellor, following his return from a six-year
stint at the Rome embassy, was given a free hand to tackle an intractable
problem, albeit one low on Moscow's list of priorities.
The chance to use his talents fully in Africa arrived after years of
frustration for a man who passed the formative years of his career in Italy
and longed for the chance to help loosen and modernise the sclerotic Soviet
system.
By temperament and experience Adamishin is an unashamed 'westerniser' who
believes that 'partnership with the west is vital for our hopes of turning
Russia into a normal, economically prosperous and predictable country.'
Throughout Russia's history such men and such ideas have had to contend
against the 'Slavophiles' with their quasi-mystical belief in the uniqueness
of Russia and the Slav soul and their suspicion - and even hostility - to
the corrupting ideas and examples of the west.
But, in his first interview inside the sprawling white stucco embassy on
Kensington Palace Gardens, Adamishin said that 'western Europe has not yet
made up its mind whether to embrace Russia and hold her tight in a
democratic embrace - like Germany after the war or Spain and Greece - or
draw the boundaries at the Baltic states and Ukraine as if Russia is really
an Asian exile.'
However, he speaks rather more warmly of Britain: 'You have shown more
understanding of our problems than some others. You helped us to join the
Group of Seven and helped in other parts of the world. The UK is not a
simple partner to deal with, but we consider you as a reliable, long-term
partner.'
He is optimistic that relations with Britain and other western countries
will improve further. 'Our interests coincide 80 to 90 per cent of the time
and relations between Russia, western Europe and the US are moving in the
right direction. But we still have to find where a balance of interests
exists in the remaining 10-20 per cent of cases.'
Misunderstanding and disagreement could arise from Russia's 'peacekeeping'
role in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which
were formerly part of the Soviet Union, and from its relationship with Nato.
Moscow wants an equal partnership.
'We each need to recognise certain special interests, in our case we see the
CIS as an area in which we have a special interest. We were also displeased
to be faced by unilaterally taken decisions over Bosnia, although the
situation in that respect is also much better now,' he adds.
Adamishin was born of Russian parents in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine in
1934. This was the year in which Stalin ordered the assassination of Sergei
Kirov and then used the murder as an excuse to purge political opponents.
Adamishin, however, shows few of the characteristics of 'Soviet man.'
'I was too young to remember the purges,' he says. But he is part of the
generation which grew up under Stalin and then started their careers under
Khruschev.
He attributes his survival as a free spirit to the influence of his
grandparents, who brought him up during the war, and to a lucky break which
took him into diplomacy. He was trained as a mathematician and specialised
in the Italian economy. His room mate was Luigi Longo, son of the eponymous
former Italian communist party leader. 'Gigi was six years older than me. He
became my teacher in everything from marxism to sexology,' he recalls
affectionately. The two men remain close friends.
The Italian connection changed his fate. 'They needed Italian speakers and I
was taken on by the first European department of the foreign ministry
(devoted to western European affairs). I translated for Khruschev when an
Italian delegation came to Moscow. I remember how Giuseppe Pella, the then
Italian foreign minister, outraged Khruschev by asking whether it was true
that Khruschev drank water while plying vodka liberally to his guests.
Khruschev pushed his glass up to Pella's mouth and ordered him to drink. It
was vodka of course.'
Two years later Adamishin arrived in Rome as stazheur, apprentice at the
elegant palace which houses the Russian embassy, less than a mile from the
Vatican on the Gianicolo hill. There followed six years as interpreter and
counsellor to Ambassador Semyon Kozyrev, (no relation to the current foreign
minister).
'He treated me like a son, gave me my diplomatic schooling, and protected me
from the KGB snapping at my heels. Thanks to his protection I was able to
violate all the rules governing the behaviour of Soviet diplomats in Italy.'
Like so many foreigners, exposure to the subtle arts of Italian life and
politics inevitably influenced his thinking and style. But he insists that
the main formative elements were his unusual 'class origins' and the
influence of his grandparents.
His father, Leonid, was killed along with 1m other Soviet troops, in the
first Nazi encirclement of Kiev in 1941. Anatoly was then seven years old.
His mother was a modest functionary in the ministry of agriculture.
'I spent my childhood in the Ukrainian countryside looked after by my
grandfather, a graduate from St Petersburg University who had voluntarily
'returned to the people' to teach in the countryside, and my grandmother.
She had been educated at a gentlewomen's academy but learned how to milk and
grow crops.'
Both, he added, were what used to be called in Czarist times raznochinits,
the name given to the proud and hard working meritocracy which was not part
of the hereditary aristocracy, but rose through the ranks and served the
Czar with diligence and honour.
This combination of inherited grit and acquired Italian subtlety marked him
out and helped him to survive 25 years at the heart of the foreign ministry
interspersed by events such as the Warsaw pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
and the collapse of detente after the invasion of Afghanistan and martial
law in Poland. It should also serve him well as he sets out on his declared
path 'of doing everything in my power to make sure that Anglo-Russian
relations will be confident and serene.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Back to our African Roots: The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucy has lost her title as our oldest known ancestor. In her place are the
Root family, who lived 4.4m years ago on the wooded highlands of east
Africa.
Some of this week's publicity about the discovery of 17 Root fossils in
Ethiopia suggested that they were the long-sought 'missing link'.
In fact they are not quite old enough to represent the putative ancestor of
apes and humans; the evolutionary split between the two classes of primates
is believed to have occurred at least 5m years ago.
Even so, the anthropologists who discovered the new hominid species -
officially named Australopithecus ramidus after the local Afar word 'ramid',
meaning root - have given the study of human evolution its biggest boost
since the 3.2m-year-old remains of Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) were
found in the same area in 1978.
Most of the Root fossils found so far are teeth and small fragments of bone,
which had been chewed up and scattered around the Awash River site by
scavenging animals. There is nothing to match the relatively complete
skeletons of Lucy and her contemporary known as 'Son of Lucy'.
The researchers - Tim White of the University of California, Berkeley; Gen
Suwa of Tokyo University; and Berhane Asfaw of the Ethiopian
Palaeonthropology Laboratory - have found pieces of skull and arm bones, but
unfortunately no remains of hips, legs or feet. Without them, it is
impossible to tell whether the Roots walked on two legs or four - or a bit
of both.
So the latest discovery takes us no closer to knowing when our ancestors
came down from the trees and started walking upright. But there is a good
chance that the anthropologists will soon turn up some bones from below the
waist as they continue to scour the research site.
What the fossils already tell us is that our ancestors 4.4m years ago were
about the same size as the smallest contemporary forms of chimpanzee, or
half as big as us. They had ape-sized heads and, presumably, ape-like mental
abilities.
Most of the technical analysis in this week's Nature paper describing A.
ramidus as a new hominid species concerns its teeth, partly because these
are the most plentiful remains and partly because dental evidence is
conventionally important for primate taxonomy.
The Roots' teeth are smaller than those of later Australopithecus species
such as Lucy, though larger than modern human or chimp teeth. Their dental
details are mainly intermediate between apes and the later hominids, as you
would expect, though there are also some special features such as
distinctive diamond-shaped canine teeth.
A battery of geological and radio-isotope dating procedures - carried out on
the hominid bones, other fossilised animal and plant remains, and the rocks
around them - all point to a narrow age range between 4.3m to 4.5m years for
the find.
The evidence from the other fossils shows that the Awash site, now an arid
semi-desert, was lush woodland when the Roots lived there. The researchers
found thousands of fossilised seeds of forest trees and plentiful bones of
tree-dwelling colobus monkeys.
Although the proven facts about A. ramidus are very sparse, they can be
combined with what is known about later hominids and modern apes, to give a
reasonable speculative view of the Roots' lifestyle.
They slept high up in the trees, for safety, and spent a lot of their waking
life there too, eating leaves and fruit. Their strong arms and hands enabled
them to swing through the branches, though with less speed and agility than
a chimp.
Sometimes, however, the Roots came down to the ground, to eat fallen fruit
and to supplement their largely vegetarian diet by scavenging dead animals.
They may even have banded together occasionally to hunt and kill animals.
These hairy hominids probably did walk upright, at least for part of the
time, but with a waddle that would have looked very different from today's
human gait.
If the Roots had ape-like minds, they may have picked up sticks and stones
to use as primitive tools, for example to pick juicy insects out of crevices
in tree trunks or smash open nuts.
But they were not clever enough to fashion tools of their own by cutting
sticks and stones into more useful shapes.
We shall have to wait for the fossil hunters to find more extensive remains
of the Roots to know how accurate this picture is and give some idea about
their social structure.
If the females turn out to be much smaller than the males - as was the case
with Lucy and her menfolk - then it would be reasonable to conclude that
dominant males competed for control of family groups.
For now, the significance of the discovery is its confirmation of the view
originally put forward by Charles Darwin, that the roots of human evolution
would lie in Africa.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Roll over, Beethoven: Truth of the Matter - The use and
misuse of great music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the many things which the world does not need, a new recording of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony ranks right up there, along with Prozac, pet
rocks and party conferences. I know Herbert von Karajan advised young
conductors to throw away their first 100 versions of the work (pity the poor
audiences) but there comes a point when enough is enough, when the obsessive
pursuit of perfection becomes a futile exercise in megalomania.
I was forced to pause, however, when Franz Welser-Most's new interpretation
of this classic work with the London Philharmonic popped through the post
this week. It was not the gaudy fireworks-by-moonlight scene adorning the
sleeve, nor the performance itself, which is more than competent. It was the
obtrusive white sticker on the front of the compact disc cover: 'Includes
music from Hovis and Pedigree Chum TV ads'.
I know that in the age of the sound-bite and the sample, in a world where
you can walk into a record shop and buy an album called Bach to Basics, this
should not come as a shock; but it did. This is Beethoven's Fifth, for
goodness sake, probably the most famous piece of music in the western world,
and someone is honestly trying to use it to sell brown bread and dog food?
And worse still, someone is trying to sell the compact disc by advertising
that it is used to advertise brown bread and dog food?
My mind reeled as I tried to recall the offending items but my memory, and
my imagination, drew a blank. Hovis: a wholesome family sits at the kitchen
table glowing with health and well-regulated fibre intake - da-da-da-da. It
just didn't pan out. Pedigree Chum: a cuddly spaniel bounds towards its bowl
of nourishing goodies - da-da-da-da. No way. These are the opening bars
which Beethoven reputedly described as 'fate knocking at the door'; could he
really have been referring to a kennel?
My curiosity was getting the better of me; I had to make a few calls. The
man from Hovis was brisk and confident. 'No, we've never used Beethoven's
Fifth, nor any Beethoven for that matter. We use Dvorak, the second movement
of the New World Symphony.'
He was so assertive, it sounded like the most logical pairing in the world.
'And there are no plans to use Beethoven?' 'None.' There was no doubt in
this man's mind, Hovis and Dvorak was a marriage baked in heaven, and any
interlopers were not welcome.
The woman from Pedigree Chum was less strident, and had to check: 'No, there
is no record of us having used Beethoven at all.' She sounded relieved. 'I
mean it just doesn't seem like music for one of our ads. It's a bit heavy,
isn't it?'
I nervously agreed that, yes indeed, it was a bit heavy, but in truth I had
lost all confidence in my ability to match world-famous pieces of music with
pet food products. If she had said that Pedigree Chum had been using
Siegfried's Funeral March for the last 20 years, I would not have batted an
eyelid. But she did not say that; instead she added that the music they were
'famous for' (where have I been all these years?) was Dvorak's New World
Symphony.
The mystery was solved. It was a cock-up, the right sticker on the wrong
compact disc cover. My instincts were proved correct; no-one can use the
music of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to push products. My ideals remained
intact, the great man could once again bask in the purity of his genius. A
final call, to EMI, and the end to my nightmare: the sticker was an innocent
mistake, and should not be appearing in the shops. Simple as that.
But the issue will not go away. Does listening to snatches of classical (or,
as some would have it, 'serious') music as an inducement to buy essentially
trivial products really do any harm?
The reason we, as a culture, continue to churn out Beethoven Fifths is in
ritualistic affirmation of our sophistication and love of high art. This, we
continually tell ourselves, is what we are capable of; this is the peak of
human achievement. It may have taken place some 200 years ago, but we are
still recording it, still travelling to see it performed, still discussing
it.
Are these sentiments not infected when such works of sublime intent are
wrung through the warped minds of some crazed creative department? Or is it
just a 'harmless bit of fun', that clarion-call of our times? Beethoven, a
most complex man, lived in a much simpler world. I find it difficult to
conceive of how fate knocking at the door would sound in 1994, but I have
the horrible feeling that after the first two notes, there would be a
commercial break.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Give me a Hot Monk - Liqueurs / Giles
MacDonogh rediscovers the joys of a sticky winter drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tastes change. In the late 19th century sweet liqueurs were all the rage. It
was a time when the idle rich drank themselves to death on powerful, sugary
brews such as green Chartreuse or Benedictine.
In the German painter George Grosz's autobiography we learn that even the
inhabitants of Pomeranian Stolp, now Polish Slupsk, could, for as little as
a mark, obtain powders which transformed crude schnapps into Chartreuse or
Benedictine. Later as an art student in Dresden Grosz met a dreamy former
schoolmaster who introduced him to Klosterlikor, which looked like 'thick,
yellow glue' and tasted like a blend of brandy and syrup.
The pot-bellied bottle's colourful label and imitative seal gave the
impression that it had been culled from some monastery or other. 'The image
of a fat, chummy monk drank our health.'
If the number of imitations is anything to go by then Benedictine must have
been one of the most popular drinks in the world on the eve of the first
world war. In the Palais Benedictine, in Fecamp, northern France, there is a
vast pyramid composed simply of counterfeit bottles drawn from every corner
of the globe. I presume that somewhere in that heap is the bottle which
Grosz enjoyed in his art school days while he put the world to rights with
his friend.
Benedictine was the bright idea of a Norman wine merchant called Alexander
Le Grand. He came across the recipe for a monastic elixir apparently
invented by a Venetian monk at Fecamp Abbey in the early 16th century. Le
Grand reworked the recipe giving it that sweet, viscous quality which was
the most memorable aspect of German imitations.
In 1863 he launched Benedictine. It was an overnight success. Three years
later he founded a public company to sell the liqueur. In 1881 it was quoted
on the Paris bourse.
By the turn of the century Le Grand had made such tremendously big profits
that his humble house had metamorphosed into a little Chambord, stuffed to
the oesophagus with works of art harking back to the age of those self-same
monks who had contributed so unwittingly to his fortune.
Ne'er-do-well sons and French succession laws wrought the usual havoc.
Benedictine was eventually bought by Martini vermouth which was, in its
turn, swallowed up by Bacardi rum.
The drink, we are told, is much the same. It is made from 27 different herbs
and spices: aloes, ambrette (a sort of amber-like hibiscus derivative),
angelica, apricot kernels, arnica, maidenhair fern, melissa, cardomom,
cinnamon, cloves, coriander, hyssop, juniper, lemon peel, myrrh, nutmeg,
pine kernels, saffron,tea, thyme and vanilla.
From these wonderful ingredients a number of distillates and flavoured
alcohols are made which are subsequently assembled together with syrup and
honey (to give it the sweetness) and saffron and caramel (to give it
colour). The brew is then heated and aged in cask. It takes about two years
to make a bottle of Benedictine.
Few people like the taste of neat Benedictine these days. It is a little
like drinking liquid gingerbread. In America the most popular way of
consuming the liqueur is with brandy (a B and B) and the company now bottles
a ready-mixed version which accounts for a large percentage of sales in the
US. The brandy goes some way towards cutting the sweetness of the
Benedictine.
Benedictine also combines well in cocktails. One of the more successful long
drinks I tried in the bar of the Palais Benedictine was with a good slug of
Benedictine combined with half orange and half grapefruit juice.
Benedictine is apparently popular in some parts of Lancashire where it is
drunk with hot water in a drink called 'Benny and Hot'. Sometime during the
first world war a Lancastrian regiment was removed from the Western Front
and sent to recuperate near Fecamp and this curious brew was born. Better, I
think, is a Hot Monk which involves pouring hot lemon juice over Benedictine
in the manner of a toddy. Best of all, I've found, is a Scotch Benny: a
blend of 50 per cent Benedictine with 50 per cent blended Scotch whisky. It
is the perfect winter warmer.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Cookery: In the grip of the grapes - They're at their best
just now, says Philippa Davenport - and the luscious Italia variety is best
of all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grapes are a best buy in Britain just now, and best of all are the sort
called Italia. They can be black or white and many countries now send
supplies to the UK but, for my money, only white Italia grapes from Italy
are truly enticing. The fruit from other sources never seems half so plump,
muscat-sweet and fragrant.
While the season lasts, I am happy to eat these grapes round the clock. For
breakfast, I will tuck into a bunch on its own, or halve and seed a handful
of the fruit to add to a bowl of yoghurt, together with a few almonds and
perhaps a drizzle of honey.
For lunch, what could be better than a hot, lightly-curried chicken or fish
broth aromatised with lemon grass, poured over a spoonful or two of steamed
rice, and finished with a floating garnish of soured cream crowned with a
few peel- - ed grapes for a cool and silky contrast.
One of my favourite salads at this season combines grapes with prawns, the
latter seasoned with toasted and ground coriander seed and torn basil leaves
and laid on a bed of shredded Little Gem lettuce. Also excellent is a salad
of creamy, mildly tangy goat's cheese with cos, Italia grapes and toasted
pine kernels.
In France, a typical bonne bouche of the grape-picking season consists of
chicken livers sauteed and tossed with a few peeled and pipped grapes,
warmed in butter with a splash of wine and served on soft rounds of toast.
Delicious for a snack lunch or as a fairly substantial appetiser at dinner.
Those who prefer fresh fruit and compotes to puddings proper may share my
enthusiasm for an end of summer fruit salad made simply with sliced bananas,
halved and seeded grapes, plus plenty of freshly scooped melon balls dressed
in a light lemon or lime syrup infused with a couple of sprigs of mint.
VENDANGE CHICKEN (serves 6)
Soothing and pure, this is a practical choice for a small party as most of
the work can be done ahead. But be sure to re-heat the chicken only briefly,
as described. That way, the meat will remain succulent and fresh. Prolonged
re-heating always risks over-cooking poultry, making it stringy and dull.
The chicken poaching liquor is re-used here to produce a copious quantity of
intensely flavoured sauce. Make the most of it by serving the bird in a
generous ring of rice that will soak up every drop.
Ingredients: a high-quality roasting chicken weighing about 4 lb; 6 oz white
Italia grapes; 2 glasses dry white wine; a bunch of fresh tarragon;  1/4 pt
double cream; 1 oz butter; 1 oz plain white household flour.
Wash the chicken and put it into a flame-proof pot, preferably oval, which
will hold it snugly. Pour on enough hot, not boiling, unsalted water to
cover the thickest part of the thighs. There is no need to immerse the
breast. Cover tightly and poach gently for 50-60 minutes.
Transfer the covered pot to a sink containing enough cold water and ice
cubes to come halfway or more up the sides of the pot. Leave the pot in the
sink for about three hours, replenishing the cold water and ice cubes from
time to time to speed the cooling process.
When the chicken is cold, strip off and discard the skin. Lift the flesh
from the bones, wrap it in greaseproof paper to keep it moist and
refrigerate it. De-grease the cooking liquor, return the bones to the pot,
half cover and simmer until reduced to 1-1 1/4 pt intensely chickeny stock.
Season, chill and de-grease again. (Do everything up to this stage the day
before serving.)
Boil the wine until reduced by half, then mix it with enough stock to make
about 1 1/4 pt in all. Make a sauce with the butter, flour, stock and wine
mixture, with cream and seasonings to taste. Cover to prevent a skin forming
and set aside. Cut the chicken into bite-size, quill-shaped pieces. Halve
and seed the grapes; peel them if you wish. Chop some tarragon.
Shortly before serving, bring the sauce back to simmering point. Add the
chicken, cover, and simmer very gently for eight-10 minutes. Stir in the
grapes and tarragon. Switch off the heat, cover and leave to stand for five
minutes. Check seasoning, pile into a ring of boiled rice, and decorate with
tarragon.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Fine Pinot Noir at Pounds 4.99 - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON, NICHOLAS LANDER and JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not long ago 'affordable Pinot Noir' was rightly regarded as an oxymoron.
Today it is quite possible to find charming, fruity, if relatively
lightweight, Pinots from California for less than Pounds 5.
Oddbins has done more than most to track them down and its Havenscourt Pinot
Noir at Pounds 4.99 has considerably more interest (and less obvious
sweetening) than most.
But now they can also field a fine Pinot Noir at the same price from Chile,
previously terra incognita as a source of delicate Pinot fruit. Hearty
congratulations on Cono Sur Pinot Noir at Pounds 4.99 which shows all of the
jewel-like appeal of simple young Pinot.
The Reserve version is Pounds 5.99 and is also stocked by Tanners, of
Shrewsbury, Shropshire, but at the moment the cheaper wine is the more
charming. (I assumed that Cono Sur was a pun, which only goes to show my
ignorance of Spanish; it means 'southern cone' apparently.)
An indication of how strongly the restaurant industry is growing is provided
by the first issue of Tandoori, a magazine for the 7,500 Indian restaurants
in Great Britain. It is now estimated that there are more Indian restaurants
in the UK than in Bombay or Delhi.
The magazine, founded by Karan Bilimoria, who established the successful
Cobra Indian beer brand in the UK and its editor, Iqbal Wahhab, who set up
East West Communications, to promote the growth of ethnic foods, includes
features on how to market a tandoori restaurant and how Bangladeshi cuisine
may develop in the UK.
The publishers will no doubt be hoping to emulate the success of Patak, a
company which makes Indian spices in Wigan, Lancashire and was named by
Marketing magazine as the fastest growing brand in the UK last year with a
92 per cent growth in retail sales.
Wine lovers should take advantage of the extremely serious wines Italy has
been able to produce from recent vintages. Lea &amp; Sandeman, of Kensington
Church Street, London W8 (071-221 1982) has a special offer of 1990
Supertuscans, of which Il Pergole Torte is a star at Pounds 21.74 while
Oddbins Fine Wine Shops have fallen in love with Rocca Albino's 1991
Piedmont range, including two stunningly seductive Barbarescos, Vigneto
Loreto at Pounds 12.99 and Vigneto Brich Ronchi at Pounds 13.99.
Following the opening of its organic wholefood shop in Yaohan Plaza,
Colindale, north west London, the Japan Centre group has opened another shop
in the capital at 212 Piccadilly.
Foods include: organic shitake mushrooms, tofu, fresh seaweed, sun-dried
fish and squid, green and wheat tea, bonito flakes, noodles, pickled
vegetables, seasonings, dressings and vinegars.
Also available are sea vegetables such as nori (for sushi making) and
instant wakame for miso soup. For those who want to give raw fish a miss,

FT  24 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Broking bread, 90s style - Where there's a
product, there's a market - and our daily bread is no exception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How the customer forms his or her first - and perhaps most lasting -
impression of a restaurant is a question which all chefs must address.
The key criterion for me is the bread. Invariably, if the restaurant offers
good bread, the rest of the meal will be a pleasure.
Yet, like all the seemingly simple things in life, offering fresh,
appetising bread twice a day presents chefs with one of their biggest
challenges. A challenge that incorporates culinary skills, logistics, timing
and cost appraisal.
At a busy restaurant, such as The Greenhouse in west London, the annual
bread bill is Pounds 25,000, an outlay which does not generate any obvious
profit. Supplying bread to restaurants is a highly competitive business in
which suppliers are judged by the quality of the last delivery.
Ideally, all chefs would like to bake their own bread but, aside from a
shortage of skilled bakers, bread-making requires kitchen space and time.
The dough has to be mixed, rested, proved, moulded and developed before
being cut, baked and rested again. To be ready for the lunch service this
work must start at 7am and be repeated again in the late morning for the
dinner service.
In south London, Gordon Ramsay, the chef at Aubergine, Park Walk, London
SW10, has decided that he will bake his own bread, some 160 rolls a day, and
is already aware of one of the pitfalls - that the staff might eat it before
it even reaches the restaurant customers.
Other chefs who bake their own include: Pierre Hoffman, at La Tante Claire,
in Royal Hospital Road, London SW3; Sally Clarke, of Clarke's in Kensington
Church Street, London W8, who now has a separate bakery in Notting Hill
Gate; and Michel Roux, at The Waterside Inn, Bray, Berkshire.
Until the early 1990s chefs had two other possible sources of bread. The
first was to deal directly with a commercial bakery and the second to buy in
partly-cooked bread.
But, however good the quality, it does mean that the first food a customer
eats is made outside the restaurant. And because there is usually only one
delivery, bread that has been made at 5am and delivered at 7am will be
offered as late as 10pm to a customer.
To some extent the problem can be solved by using part-baked rolls and
breads which are pre-cooked and warmed immediately before serving. But these
rolls are bulky and present considerable storage difficulties for a small
kitchen.
A new option for chefs presented itself in 1990 with the formation of Gail
Force, London's first 'bread brokers'.
It was founded by Gail Stephens, who grew up in Israel, trained in catering
at Westminster College and went on to cook at the Garrick Club, in Covent
Garden, London.
A chance encounter at a food exhibition in Wembley, north London, with a
specialist baker who was unable to supply all the interested outlets, led
Stephens to realise that here was a market waiting to be established:
uniting London's small new bakeries with the increasing number of chefs and
delicatessens who wanted to offer high-quality freshly-baked breads.
To make this market requires expertise and dedication.
Stephens' day begins at 3.15am so that she can meet her drivers at Park
Royal, in west London, at 4am. All the orders for the various breads are
then made up. Traditional Italian breads, pugliese, ciabatta and grissini
are boxed alongside English farmhouse loaves, while French ficelles,
baguettes and boules de campagne nestle next to Jewish chollas.
The best, from the ovens of Bakoven, in Coburg Road, London N22, Neal's
Yard, in Covent Garden and Beverley Hills Bakery, Brompton Road, London SW3,
which makes American muffins, are then on their way to the tables of the
capital's restaurants and delicatessens, such as Riva, in Church Road,
Barnes and Randall &amp; Aubin, in Soho.
Stephens' comments on her work are succinct. 'It's a crazy business. Most of
our customers are in central London but rents and rates there are
prohibitive. We have to work on the periphery and organise our deliveries as
best we can. Every half hour lost at the beginning of the day results in 1
1/2 hours delay at the end of the morning.
'Every chef wants their bread delivered at the same time, never later than
7am, and they all want the best quality at the lowest price. I can offer a
delivery of a second bake in the afternoon but that is no guarantee that I
will keep the business.
'One late afternoon Quaglino's needed 500 rolls and I drove through London
with them straight out of the oven. There was so much steam that I had to
roll the windows down to see where I was going. Quaglino's got their bread
but shortly afterwards I lost their account.'
Stephens believes that the 'bread revolution' which Britain has undergone
over the past five years will continue and the only way forward is to pursue
quality.
She has now invested in the baking skills of Philippe Dade and his new
bakery, The Bread Factory, in Stanmore, Middlesex,which will bake three
times a day, at 4.30am, 9.30am and 3pm, and whose rolls are already gracing
the tables of the Ritz and the Inn on the Park in central London.
In spite of all the inherent problems Stephens is delighted to be dealing
with a product that is so fundamental to the enjoyment of a good meal and
our general well-being. She would like to see a baker's skills more widely
appreciated, to be able to operate on bigger margins herself and find the
one supplier missing from her price list - someone who makes particularly
good doughnuts.

FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Genny opens London store
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENNY is an Italian label that does not have the high profile of a Versace
or an Armani but has become a favourite with many a busy, working woman as
well as with some of the more lively glitterati of the Italian social scene.
Monica Vitti, Princess Pignatelli and Isabella Rossellini are just a few of
Genny's fans.
For some time a small selection from the line has been available at Browns
of South Molton Street and at Harrods but this week Browns has given Genny a
separate shop at 18, South Molton Street, London W1 where a much broader
range of Genny can be seen.
Besides her beautifully soft and understated suits for day which many a
working woman adopts with a sigh of relief there are some delicious pieces
for the evening - simple empire-line velvet dresses (around Pounds 400) and
some flirty double-layered chiffon numbers in chocolate brown or black
(Pounds 600).
The hallmark of her collection is its simplicity and a new-found softness -
many of the pieces are ageless and could become the main prop around which a
wardrobe could be built.
The picture, above, perfectly sums up this winter's day-time look.

FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Italy's most distinguished stationery
products now available in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITALY, a country renowned for its paper and stationery, Pineider is the
most distinguished name of all. No young person de buona famiglia is
launched upon the world without a set of beautifully engraved visiting
cards, each one interleaved with tissue paper, from Pineider. In good
bourgeois and aristocratic homes a leather-bound visitors' book from
Pineider sits upon a console table. The Pope has bought all the Papal
stationery from Pineider almost since the very beginning (1774).
Pineider was started in Florence, an essential stopping-off point in the
Grand Tour. In those pre-telephonic days fine writing paper, inks and pens,
mattered. People of distinction bought them at Pineider.
Most of the range can be seen and bought at The Mirabilia Italiae at 16
Royal Arcade, Old Bond Street, London W1 - look for the beautiful visitors'
books, the photographic albums, the stationery, the cards. The famous
engraving service will start in about a fortnight.

FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Ermenegildo Zegna expands London business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ERMENEGILDO ZEGNA, the Italian menswear company, has for some years had a
seriously sophisticated shop in Bond Street purveying its own high quality
menswear. This week it opens another shop in Covent Garden (42, Shelton
Street, London WC2) with the younger, slightly less formal man in mind.
While the Bond Street shop concentrates on the more structured, 'sartorial'
lines, in Covent Garden there is a beautifully relaxed line of what Zegna
calls its 'soft collection'.
Zegna defines soft as 'wearing pants in cotton or Donegal, mixing them with
a nonchalant, easy checked or windowpane jackets' or soft could be an
'updated jacket, unstructured with lowered shoulders and shirt sleeves.' The
picture above shows exactly what 'soft' is all about - that Italian gift for
combining garments to create an air of understated chic.
It has nothing to do with skimping on quality. All the fabrics are designed
and manufactured by Zegna. It has everything to do with attitude, with
wanting to wear more relaxed, more comfortable clothes. Aiming at the
younger man, the new shop will have slightly lower prices  - wool suits will
average about Pounds 550, jackets start at Pounds 395.

FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Italians add style to vibrant streets of
London - Lucia van der Post finds that business is booming and that upmarket
foreign companies are flocking to England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The official news is confusing - retail spending down, interest rates
rumoured to be rising, the stock market falling - but no-one seems to have
told the shoppers on the choicer streets of London. They seem to be
responding to an entirely different beat. There is an infectious sense of
optimism about. New shops are opening all over town. In certain stores some
of the winter lines have completely sold out and the end of September is
only just in sight. So what exactly is going on?
What seems to be happening is that there are pockets of great prosperity and
success. Those who realised that there was more to the last recession than
just the fact that many of us had less to spend, that there had been a
sea-change in the way most of us viewed the world, and addressed that shift
in perception seriously, are beginning to reap the rewards.
The key to success in the 1990s seems to be value for money - the absolute
price scarcely seems to matter. High price-tags can move as fast as low ones
provided they are perceived to offer real value.
All over town, restaurants that get the formula right (Joe Allen, The Ivy,
Christopher's, Aubergine) are packed out, clothing lines that have a certain
pizazz as well as attractive prices are sold out, everywhere the special,
the out-of-the-way, the quality ranges are doing well. Get it wrong and you
might as well send straight out for Cork Gully.
Much of the newly buzzing atmosphere has to do with the fact that the big
department stores are falling over themselves to tempt the customers in -
revamped buildings, personal shopping suites, free coffee and newspapers for
the gold card set, new lines, special offers, exclusive ranges.
Harrods, Selfridges, Dickins &amp; Jones, Liberty, Harvey Nichols are engaged in
a bitter struggle for our hearts and purses and there is nothing like
competition for improving the quality of the end product. New deals are
being struck, exotic designers wooed, adventurous services broached.
And it is not just the department stores - all along Bond Street the
builders are busy, the skips are full, once deadly Madame shops are being
replaced by livelier, more contemporary, sharper names.
The scene is also being enlivened by an influx of foreigners casting a
concerted vote of confidence in London's importance as a sophisticated
centre of shopping and bringing more than a touch of European brio to the
scene.
The last few weeks have seen a non-stop celebration of Italian style - from
the haute sophistication of the menswear lines of Ermenegildo Zegna and the
fastidiously refined stationery of Pineider to the eminently wearable ranges
of Genny's womenswear and the streamlined artefacts of Bugatti.
Some of the names will already be known to you, some have had a small
presence in London for some time but now that they have tested the water are
encouraged to plunge in deeper while others, such as Pineider and the new
Bugatti range, are complete newcomers. Here, then, on this page is a taster
of what some of them have to offer.

FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Class in a name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUGATTI is one of those names that resonates through the years even for
those who have never seen one of the legendary cars. Bugatti, we all know,
stands for class, for cars that are the stuff of dreams.
Though it is well over 100 years since the Bugatti story first began, it was
only three years ago that the family decided to create a range of products
that would draw on the impeccable image and standing that Bugatti had
throughout the world.
The earlier generation of Bugattis were astonishing designers. Father Carlo
turned out hundreds of drawings for everything from furniture to silver and
glass, while Ettore, who designed the unforgettable cars, also turned his
hand to ships, aeroplanes and trains. With this rich archive to draw on the
family decided to open a design studio in Ora, near Bolzano in Italy, and
begin a modern, rejuvenated launching of Bugatti products.
Almost everything the Bugattis do is linked, however tenuously, with the
romance and glamour of motoring, harking back to its golden days. Luxurious
wraps of cashmere backed with softest suede are perfect for keeping delicate
bones warm whilst driving in an open-topped car. Soft suede motoring
trousers have subtle extra curving seams which can be let out so that there
is plenty of room for the knees to bend and the trousers retain their shape.
There are warm gilets, of softest suede or leather, exquisitely made, which
by virtue of skilfully placed zips also double up (yes, seriously) as
shopping bags or knapsacks. There is a beautifully designed
shootingstick-cum-umbrella and, of course, obligatory motoring accessories
such as sun-glasses (Zeiss lenses in anti-glare tempered crystal and
flexible hinges - all very sleek), watches (Ettore Bugatti used to present
watches to his victorious drivers), pens and leather goods.
The Bugatti hand-bag is one of the few long-established products. Ettore
Bugatti designed it for his wife, it was made for him by Hermes and has been
a classic ever since. At the new Bugatti shop the basic design is untouched
but two-tone versions in racing colours, for instance, can be ordered. The
locks are in the shape of the car radiator.
This may read like the stuff of every would-be luxury goods house but the
quality and the attention to detail is exceptional. Leather notebooks,
wallets and albums, for instance, have beautifully hinged covers so that the
leather does not wear out. Metals are carefully worked, fabrics the finest
possible. Prices, of course, are not low - the cashmere and suede rugs are
Pounds 1,600, the Bugatti bag starts at Pounds 808 but silk ties enlivened
with motifs of old cars are just Pounds 48. The new Bugatti shop is at 20
Beauchamp Place, London SW3 and - for serious collectors of special cars -
the first new Bugatti car designed since 1952 is available (for Pounds
285,000) from the Bugatti showroom at 49/51 Cheval Place, London SW7.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Fashion: Off-the-cuff tales of men's shirts - Avril Groom
condsiders the vexed question of choosing the right shirt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shirts are subject to the subtle whims and codes which groups of men devise
to make themselves distinctive.
According to Sir Hardy Amies, writing in his book The Englishman's Suit, the
shirt is now 'the fashionable, status-enhancing garment' for men. Yet a
surprisingly large number of British men apparently let their wives buy
their shirts for them.
Research by Van Heusen, which aims to overturn its staid image this autumn,
with a new range including both traditionally-made City-style shirts and
modern, more relaxed designs, divides shirt-buying neatly into thirds.
Some 34 per cent of all men's shirts, it found, are bought by women. Another
34 per cent are bought with a woman present, or at least with her approval.
The rest are bought by men alone, for reasons of speed, getting a better fit
or, most tellingly, not wanting to be pushed into something unsuitably
trendy.
Men who shop alone are particular about detail and more likely to buy the 3
per cent of shirts which cost more than Pounds 45.
More than half of the shirts purchased in the UK cost between Pounds 15 and
Pounds 30 with Marks and Spencer alone accounting for one-fifth of the
market.
Chain and department stores are more likely to be the haunt of the
shirt-buying woman, probably while she also shops for herself. A man is more
likely to go to a specialist or designer shop.
A straw poll of professional men with a sharp eye for a good shirt, showed
only a minority who sought their partner's advice, let alone expected her to
buy their shirts. But the men come in two very distinct categories: the
traditionalist and the trend follower.
The traditionalist shops when his old shirts wear out. He goes for good
two-fold cotton and quality details. Once he finds a suitable source he
sticks with it.
This includes mail order sources, as upmarket brochures from companies such
as James Meade or Boden testify. In this case, wives often make the final
choice and order.
James Meade (tel: 0264-333222 for brochures) estimates that 20 per cent of
its sales are by this method and Johnnie Boden reckons 'togetherness' is a
plus for mail order, less stressful than shopping a deux.
The trend-follower, on the other hand, is aware of labels and fashion
conscious. He is likely to spend time window- shopping and retires his
working shirts as painting smocks, not because they are worn out but because
he has gone off them. He is likely to work in a less conservative profession
and is adept at bringing individuality to the suit-shirt-tie uniform.
Both groups demand style and lasting value, and their main gripe about
cheaper shirts is their limpness after a number of washes.
The debate about easy-care cotton and fused collars (where the interfacing
is ironed on to the collar fabric which makes ironing easier but may
eventually distort the smooth line - Van Heusen fuse, Thomas Pink and Boden
do not) is a sideline as few shirt enthusiasts launder at home.
Small changes do not go unnoticed - traditionalists admit that the
appearance of an unusual collar shape or shirt colour in the office still
causes comment. Even the trends followed by the fashion-conscious point to
classic looks - subtle checks, textured self-coloured weaves, button-down
collars.
In the world of the working shirt, tiny changes can be talking points.
Because men now work jacketless, Van Heusen puts a pocket for pens even on
its most traditional, double-cuffed shirt. Some men love it, others feel a
plain front looks more professional. But there is, as Daniel White, the
company's marketing executive, says, 'a loosening up, a move towards
individuality.
'The 1970s were the great shirt years with a huge variety of shapes and
patterns. The 1980s boom brought a uniform - power stripes and double cuffs.
Now people want a more personal touch but it should be subtly done.'
To test the thesis, we record the views of four keen shirt buyers, none of
whom owns fewer than 30. Each clearly belongs to his own,
mutually-recognisable club.

Dean Marsh, music business solicitor with David Wineman: 'Because my clients
are unconventional I get away with more than most lawyers. I like a stylish
but informal, faintly Italian look. I have several suits by Oswald Boateng
and this green tweed one from Cordings, a shop so traditional it has become
trendy.
'My problem was how to stop the suit looking too countrified - I always buy
clothes with the overall effect in mind. My girlfriend's sense of style
helped choose the shirt. Checks are slightly informal but red is a town
colour and the traditional collar and double cuffs are smart. If I go for a
drink with clients, this outfit is acceptable in some clubs where a straight
City suit would not be. But I wouldn't wear it in court.'

Nick Straker, stockbroker with Morgan Stanley: 'I go to work very early and
often dress in the dark. So I choose plain shirts which won't clash with
whatever tie I've picked up. My suits, which are tailor-made, are mostly
plain and single-breasted. I avoid City fads like really baggy suits or
bright pink shirts, though there is now an interesting trend towards pale
yellow. I like long shirts with plenty of tuck-in and room under the arms.
Double cuffs look smart, with plain collars - working for an American firm I
consciously don't adopt the preppy, button-down look. I shop for myself but
I also like mail order. I discovered Boden do extra long fittings and I have
arms like a gibbon. Their shirts are high-quality traditional and I enjoy
receiving parcels.
My wife occasionally buys me a shirt. She is more adventurous.'

Alan Wilkinson-Marten, architect, associate at Norman Foster and Partners:
'I buy for myself because I'm single but anyway I love browsing in the Kings
Road and Covent Garden.
'Quality and style are important. A shirt should be very simple -
easy-fitting, finely-stitched in good cotton with interesting buttons. As I
like plain white shirts, these details are important. I pay more to get the
right design. Adolfo Dominguez is my favourite but I like the very subtle
patterns and good make-for-price of the new Van Heusen range.
'I work with sleeves rolled up so double cuffs are not on. Jacket and tie
are not necessary in the office but for outside meetings a shirt must look
good under an unstructured, Italian suit. For work in the Far East, a white
shirt and jacket is the convention. I take cheap, short-sleeved ones but
they don't last long.'

to specialist shops such as Thomas Pink where I would expect the fabric,
finish, length and so on to be to the standard I require. Quality is more
important than price. My usual style is double-cuffed with a partly cut-away
collar, in really good, striped cotton and a comfortable fit without
bagginess. This gives the professional look clients expect and looks smart
in the office without a jacket. I don't attempt to be fashionable but ties
can make a statement. My shirts last well and are professionally ironed. I
restock when they wear out, or at sales. Shopping in the City is
convenient.'

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Confused question of censorship - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In most places the end of summer is marked by slowing growth and the first
signs of autumnal decay. But the home-viewing landscape is burgeoning
suddenly into a vast, bewildering jungle.
There are exotic flora like Laser Discs and Digital Video, turning your TV
room into a riot of hi-fi sounds and colours. There are the modest but
multiplying sense-experiences available on normal video. And there are
corners of complete and tangled confusion, like the current state of video
censorship.
One recent development in this corner is worth note: the tendency for
distributors to rush out large-screen (re)releases of controversial films
while our censor dithers about video certification or our MPs haggle over
what we can watch in the privacy of our homes.
Hence the recent reappearance of Quentin Tarantino's violent, powerful
thriller Reservoir Dogs at cinemas near most of us. Another Tarantino work,
True Romance, may do the same since that too has been lingering in the
censor's office.
Since Tarantino's last film Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and
since a film adapted from a Tarantino story (Natural Born Killers) has been
the talking point of the American movie summer, are British VCR-owners
really happy to be subjected to this Mrs Grundyish nonsense? If not, they
should make their voices heard while the debate lasts. And if Britain's
powers-that-be will not hear them, perhaps the EC's will.
While some movies dawdle, others rush into the new formats. DW Griffith's
seminal epic of world cinema The Birth Of A Nation (Connoisseur) may have
taken 80 years to reach your VCR, also via recent censorship turmoils. But
at least it means we can now travel at one bound to the origins of cinema.
And you cannot stop glossier modern products like The Firm (CIC), Aladdin
(Disney) and, soon, Jurassic Park (CIC) from jumping almost straight into
your sitting room after large-screen exposure.
The Firm is this month's multi-format market leader. Already out on Laser
Disc, it will have the first ever simultaneous release on VHS and Digital
Video. The film is 2 1/2 hours of John Grisham-based nonsense, with Tom
Cruise battling a corrupt and murder-prone law firm. Entertaining: even if
there is a low-aim inevitability about the choice of a proven catchpenny hit
for this trend-setting multiple release.
We would hardly expect the honour to have fallen on a coterie masterpiece
like Scorsese's Edith Wharton adaptation The Age Of Innocence. But Daniel
Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer will soon be romancing it on Laser Disc. Nor
on genuinely original movies like Brian De Palma's hallucinogenic murder
mystery Raising Cain (on video only from CIC) or on the Terence Davies
Trilogy (ditto, Connoisseur), a haunting 1970s apprentice work from the
British maker of Distant Voices, Still Lives, or on Peter Greenaway's The
Falls.
This last, also from Connoisseur, is the pick of the month. You will be old
and grey before it gets to Digital Video or Laser Disc, but you should try
it now on VHS. It was the longest and greatest of Greenaway's pre-feature
films before fame came with The Draughtsman's Contract. I almost said his
'nonfiction' or 'short' films. But both terms would be violent misnomers.
The Falls last three hours and its joke-documentary form - stories about a
group of mysterious accident victims whose names all begin with 'Fall' - is
as fictive as you could get without being arrested for aesthetic
fraudulence. But relish Greenaway's gleaming surrealist visuals, the
po-faced epigrams of his narrator and the wondrous flair for briskly wagging
shaggy-dog tales.
The release of The Falls also proves that while other home-viewing systems
may offer state-of-the-art sound and vision, you can still only get
state-of-the-art art on VHS. That is: if our censor allows.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: The drama of intimidation - Three excellent fringe
productions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an electric new production at the Tricycle. Michael Henry Brown's
The Day the Bronx Died starts with gunfire: a child being shot apparently
without motive on a New York subway. Violence, physical and verbal,
continues throughout, yet the piece passes a supreme test: never does it
become violence for its own sake. This is a play about intimidation.
It is not a documentary, but cannot be far from fact. Here is the Bronx
breaking up in gang warfare. There are two terrifying aspects. One is that
the members of the gang are so young; it seems a matter of course to be sent
a gun by your elder brother, who may be already in prison, on your 15th
birthday and if you have it, you have to start using it sometime. The other
is that intimidation works - even of the great and the good.
Even in gangland, however, there are redeeming features. Officer Bream goes
about the business of maintaining law and order with apparent
self-confidence, though then he is shot. People try to bring up families and
educate them - in Mozart and piano competitions as well as baseball. Blacks
and Jews rub along together. As Big Mickey explains, this is - or was - the
melting pot.
Big Mickey (Ewen Cummins) is a black who has made it to a smart apartment
and is now being wooed to join the Republican Party. On stage beside him is
the young Mickey he was in the Bronx (Thomas Goodridge). Clearly the upward
mobility was touch and go, literally a matter of life and death.
A great virtue of The Day the Bronx Died is that all this is presented
without sentimentality, almost without comment. When the violence in the
Bronx becomes too much, those who can simply move on. The gang in the play
looks like an offshoot of the tontons macoutes, led by a boy called The
Prince (Freddie Anobil-Dodoo). The most dramatic moment comes when Officer
Bream (Alan Cooke) breaks the Prince's cane, but then of course, after
slight hesitation, the boy feels obliged to shoot. No-one will give evidence
against him.
Physical fighting comes about as close as you can get to the real stuff on
stage and the piece is magnificently directed - and paced - by Gordon
Edelstein. It deserves a wider outing.
Bronx seems topical, yet political trends can be cruel to the theatre. If My
Goat - a play about hostages in Lebanon - had been first performed just a
few years ago, it might have looked like a sparkling political satire. As it
is, it comes out as a mixture of the macabre and the sentimental, but is
still a fascinating piece, wonderfully acted at the Cockpit.
Michele Celeste, the Italian who wrote it, says that he took his original
source not from the Middle East, but from Naples 1943, when Neapolitan women
would pick up fleeing Germans as compensation for the loss of husbands and
sons who had been transported by the Nazis. There developed a kind of
transfer market in hostages, though there were also some emotional
attachments.
Much the same happened in West Beirut in 1982/83, where the action takes
place. There are only two characters. A pregnant Arab woman, whose husband
has been kidnapped by one of the warring factions, is in charge of a
European archaeologist, innocently caught up in the process of tit-for-tat
hostaging. The goat remains in the background: a substitute child competing
for food and being fattened up to be ready for selling.
If there is no symbolism in the names, it is a remarkable coincidence. The
woman's missing husband is called Yasser (after Arafat?). The man's German
wife is called Ulrike (after Meinhof?). And the German-Spanish archaeologist
is called Carlos, a name to conjure with in the world of terrorism.
Moreover, Carlos is played (superbly) by Jonathan Arun in an unmistakable
Irish accent.
The Irish dimension adds to the strange mixture of the primitive and the
sophisticated which seems to dominate Lebanon. When the woman thinks she has
traded her hostage, she finds she is gazumped because the market for
Frenchmen is higher.
The macabre comes in with the exchange of ears and little fingers as proofs
of identity; the sentimental with a man and a woman locked up together. It
is not very profound, but at times it is certainly haunting. Anna Savva as
the woman has a memorable husky voice and is full of intensity. This is a
fine performance. Burt Caesar directs and Tom Piper's set catches that sense
of parts of the Middle East being permanently rebuilt and destroyed.
The Royal Court has grown fond of cooking. A few months ago it stripped the
stalls in the main theatre to revive Arnold Wesker's The Kitchen, though no
food was actually served. In Joe Penhall's new play, Some Voices in the
Theatre Upstairs, food is lovingly prepared and sometimes appreciatively
eaten. The suggestion seems to be, as in Wesker, that cooking provides a
kind of therapy.
Therapy matters, for Some Voices is a study in schizophrenia. The voices are
heard inside the head of a young unemployed man called Ray. At times they
drive him close to suicide or murder, and in one memorable scene to dousing
the kitchen and himself with paraffin. Yet the voices can stop just as
mysteriously as they start. Ray is saved, at least for the time being, by
his elder brother Pete, the chef.
The piece is a remarkable mixture of violence and tenderness. I would guess
that the references to schizophrenia have been carefully researched. Equally
authentic are the scenes of drifting homelessness, of people who move in and
out of mental institutions and those who survive on a mixture of crime and
social benefits.
Despite the violence, it is the humanity that stands out. Movingly played by
Lee Ross, Ray has a brief period of happiness with Laura (Anna Livia Ryan),
a girl in tow to the flashy thug, Dave. Yet even Dave (Lloyd Hutchinson),
who comes to a sticky end, has had his moments of feeling.
None of the characters, including Ives (Tom Watson), the old man who says he
has come to like his mental home, is flat. Ives indeed has a scene of his
own describing how the madness came upon him in an explosion at the
gasometer where he worked: we never know whether this is true and nor does
it matter.
Best of the lot is Ray Winstone's Pete in his soothing care of his brother.
At first I thought this would be a dull part. It is a measure of the
strength of Penhall's writing, however, that it grows to become dominant.
Penhall is a young playwright to watch. Ian Rickson directs and the
production is sponsored by The Jerwood Foundation which specialises in the
welfare of the young.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Damned by lack of controversy - William Packer
lambasts the judges of the new Jerwood Prize for their unadventurous choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I should have known it would happen, if only on the principle that if things
can be got wrong, they will. There is no such thing as a racing certainty,
even of failure, as we should know from the example of the splendid Moonax,
coming from the back of the field the other day to take the St Leger at
40:1.
A couple of weeks ago I wrote in encouraging terms about the new Jerwood
Painting Prize - worth Pounds 30,000 to the winner - just as the work of the
six finalists went on show. While not intended as a direct reproach and
rival to the Turner Prize, it fills a gap in the programme, being confined
to painters, of which we have in Britain an inordinate number, and whom in
recent years the Turner selectors have largely ignored. The Jerwood is also
open to artists of all ages - I mistakenly said the Turner age-limit is 40
when in fact it is 50.
And now, in Craigie Aitchison, we have the first winner, and I can hardly
believe the judges could have done such a thing. For Aitchison is at once
the most unexceptionable and unexceptional of the bunch, neither unpopular
nor unsuccessful. It is the safest and, as I can now see with hindsight, the
most predictable of results. By this very lack of controversy and adventure,
the prize is damned.
Given the field the judges had chosen, here was a wonderful opportunity for
them to make a powerful statement to the world at large on the current
condition of British painting. Here too was the chance to establish the
prize itself, at its inaugural test, as an event of the first importance.
And they have blown it.
In the particular and personal case it is as hateful as it is unfair to
pillory Aitchison himself, for he is an inoffensive and, in his own terms,
accomplished painter. But it is the judges themselves who have thus set him
up and exposed him. Do they really mean to tell us he is the one artist, not
just of the final six but of the 250 who entered for selection, who now
stands, by the judges' own criterion, for all that is truly excellent in
modern British painting?
Do they really believe, in direct comparison with the other five, that he is
still the best, with his decorative mannerism, his formulaic figuration, his
subjective sentimentality? Better than Yuko Shiraishi, shall we say, with
her no less seductive surfaces, but infinitely tougher commitment to her own
minimalist abstraction? Better than John Lessore, whose apparent reticence
is belied by the ever more ambitious scale and scope of his figure
compositions? Better than that old war-horse of an abstract expressionist,
John Hoyland, the one finalist to have achieved any international reputation
and who, after some time in the doldrums, seems to be coming back to his
true strength? And I did not think that even these were in with a real
chance.
I made, and make, no secret of my preferences. Had they chosen Maurice
Cockrill, the prize would have gone to a late and still fast-developing
artist, one who has never been painting better and will surely soon be
stepping out onto the international stage. And had they given it to Euan
Uglow, they would have been giving it quite simply to one of the best
artists working anywhere in the world today. Where others dissimulate or, at
best, fudge an accuracy of scrutiny and statement, he achieves it. But they
didn't, and I can hardly say how disappointed in them I am, at the
opportunity they have thus thrown away.
I shall name names. Hilton Kramer, distinguished critic and editor of the
New Criterion in New York who has been an enthusiastic supporter of Uglow in
the past, is known to be deeply distressed at the result. So too is Judith
Collins, a senior curator at the Tate. Here then are the other four whose
fateful decision it was - Sir Peter Wakefield, late of the National Art
Collections Fund, Anna Ford of the BBC, Lord Gowrie of the Arts Council, and
my opposite number on The Sunday Telegraph, John McEwen. Oh dear.
Come back the Turner Prize, all is forgiven - well, possibly. Watch this
space.
The Jerwood Painting Prize: Winner and Short List Exhibition; Royal Academy,
Piccadilly W1, until September 28: sponsored by The Jerwood Foundation and
The Sunday Telegraph, in association with Modern Painters.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Music as a fashion statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Bank's International Chamber Music season, which opened with a
concert by the Endellion String Quartet and guests at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall on Wednesday, has been image-brightened. One knew this from the orange,
blue and pink spotlighting and the dim house-lighting. One knew it, too,
from the players' studiously informal attire. It was made explicit in a
programme-note, and its fatal consequences were sensed when Andrew
Watkinson, the first violinist, stood up before the account of Beethoven's
Op. 127 quartet to tell us what a privilege it was to be able to perform
such great music.
This mawkish spiel had the insidious effect of making us hear the Endellions
being privileged rather than Beethoven's direct utterance. The hall was full
and people surely had not come to have Beethoven sold to them. Not
surprisingly, it was hard to assess the Endellions' interpretation of this
piece. Extremely skilful, certainly, but not very startling or deep. Their
account of Britten's early Three Divertimenti had been far more impressive,
if only because a dazzlingly virtuosic handling of its wonderfully bare and
simple textures is 'all' that this music demands. Interestingly, the
violist, Garfield Jackson, was playing the same instrument used in the
premiere of the work's original version as Alla Quartetto Serioso in 1933.
This we learned from a chatty piece in the programme book, where the players
gave their thoughts on the evening's music to Anthony Burton, and which
confirmed one's impression that the concert and concert-series have been
thoroughly Radio Three-d, which is to say, Classic FM'd. The appearance of
Jean-Yves Thibaudet, pianist for Schubert's Trout Quintet (the double
bassist was Duncan McTier), confirmed one's impression that music-making is
becoming just another kind of fashion statement. His bejewelled suede
slippers and seriously red socks threatened to draw attention entirely away
from what his hands were doing; though his limber and very speedy dexterity
in the gorgeous fourth movement - the famous bird-twittering, fish-leaping
Theme and Variations - was a wholly musical adornment to the work; and the
performance was altogether stylish, energetic and enjoyable.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: A label for success - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manfred Eicher, founder/proprietor of the Munich record label ECM, is not
the sort of person to celebrate a 25th anniversary with boxed set
compilations or retrospectives. Never one to respond to the commercial mores
which preoccupy others in the music business, Eicher even claims not to pay
any real attention to how well his recordings sell. An autocratic and
idiosyncratic individual who controls every aspect of each recording, he
says that to him, 'popularity and appreciation is a side benefit, almost'.
Started by Eicher as a jazz label in 1969, Editions of Contemporary Music
has become home to hugely successful artists as well as harder-to-classify
fringe intrumentalists. Helped in large part by the runaway success of
American pianist Keith Jarrett's 1975 live recording, The Koln Concert which
has sold two and a half million copies, more than any other solo piano work,
Eicher can afford to record with less commercial artists. In between refined
jazz masters such as John Abercrombie, Dave Holland and Paul Motian, the ECM
catalogue lists the diverse sounds of cellist David Darling, violinist
Shankar and the African drums of the Moire Orchestra among others.
This mix of reliable sellers and 'outside' improvisation is constantly
renewed. The immensely popular Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek records
for Eicher as does the successful 'new' classical composer, Estonian Arvo
Part. But so does Heiner Goebbels, whose latest CD has the citizens of
Boston reciting Edgar Allen Poe's Landscape with Argonauts on the sidewalk.
In Twilight Fields Stephen Micus alternates between flower pots, a Bavarian
zither and something called a 'nay'.
Eicher has produced virtually every one of the company's 550 recordings and,
though he dismisses the idea, it shows. A wilfully solitary person outside
the studio, Eicher cites film makers Godard, Tarkovsky and Bergman as his
influences inside it. He is attracted by the bleak beauty of northern Europe
and always records in the same Oslo studio. This aesthetic taste is carried
through to the mixing desk.
If there is such a thing as the ECM sound, it is characterised by judicious
use of reverb and the stark clarity of each instrument's voicings.
Detractors say it is old; someone once described it as the most beautiful
sound next to silence. Explaining his studio technique, Eicher, who is
himself a conservatory trained violinist, says bluntly: 'I seek only
austerity and discipline. I do not impose a 'sound': the direction comes
from the music itself.'
In the ECM New Series, which concentrates on composers from Thomas Tallis to
Steve Reich, Eicher says he has tried to bring some of the spontaneity and
dialectic of jazz to written work. Part's compositions, which Eicher
describes as 'the music of slowly beating wings,' (Miserere in 1991 and
Tabula Rasa in 1984) have continued to sell especially well. Now Eicher
seems set for another success, this time with an unlikely experiment in
early music.
Eicher's latest offering, Officium (ECM New Series 1525 445 369-2), sets
Garbarek's distinctive yearning saxophone sound across the hymnal early
music of a vocal quartet, the Hilliard Ensemble. Compositions on the album
are from the 13th to 15th centuries and explore chants, early polyphony and
Renaissance motets. After some initial confusion over its proper category,
Officium has entered the classic FM chart at number two and now promises to
be as big a hit with the people who bought into monks chanting as it is with
confirmed ECM aficionados.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: The Mikado returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Opera's all-white Mikado is one of the company's hardiest
productions. Wednesday's welcome performance marked the opening of its sixth
run since it was new in 1986 - David Ritch once again reviving Jonathan
Miller's original - and everything in the Grand Hotel setting came up shiny
and slick. The cast, with one exception all returning to their roles, is now
more more confident than ever, though this inevitably means some loss of
spontaneity. Still, most of it remains very funny, not least Ko-Ko's
amazingly topical Little List, which now includes references to the
Hecklers, Jeffrey Archer, Mrs Bobbitt, and Mr and Mrs Michael Jackson.
Indeed, Richard Suart's Pythonesque Ko-Ko, with his gallery of accents and
twitches, remains the star of the show. Lesley Garrett's bubbly Yum-Yum -
she sings a sensuous 'The sun whose rays' - and Bonaventura Bottone's coy
Nanki-Poo (whose lyrical singing matches his twinkling characterisation) are
not far behind in the show-stealing stakes. Anne Collins repeats her
vengeful virago of a Katisha, Richard Angas his preening but absent-minded
Mikado, Ian Caddy his Pooh-Bah, and Arwel Huw Morgan the plus-foured
clergyman Pish-Tush. Completing the three little maids from St Trinians' are
Ethna Robinson (Pitti-Sing) and - new to the cast - Mary Plazas (Peep-Bo).
Sian Edwards, who has raised critical eyebrows for her seemingly arms-length
musical directorship of the company, here maintained a firm grip on the
score. She let the music sparkle, kept ensembles tight, and most
importantly, since ENO's resolve on the language issue seems set to waver,
allowed us to hear almost every word. There are only five further
performances of The Mikado this season, not to be missed.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: A lingering gaze into the well of loneliness -
Hellman's theatrical exploration of lesbianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How wonderful: a new production of an old play that - despite (or rather
because of) the general excellence of its acting and staging - sends us out
talking about the play itself. And how wonderful: at last, a play about
homosexuality (after a million other plays about homosexuality we have seen
this year) that is neither agitprop nor sentimental nor evasive. The play,
Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour, will be 60 years old this November,
and Howard Davies's production makes us see that it works on three levels.
On level one, it is about the unjust scandal caused by accusations of
homosexuality among teachers - unjust because those accusations are
unfounded. This is the level that almost any audience can take, and Hellman
was able to bring it to the movie version, These Three (1936), for which she
wrote the screenplay. Karen Wright (Harriet Walter) and Martha Dobie (Clare
Higgins) are young women who run the school for girls they have founded.
Mary (Emily Watson), a peculiarly evil 14-year-old, wrecks the school, to
which her grandmother (Gillian Barge) has sent her, by accusing them of
lesbianism. The accusations also blight the engagement of Karen Wright to
the pleasant Dr Joe Cardin (William Gaminara).
On the second level, it is about the unjust scandal caused by homosexuality
among teachers - unjust because homosexuality is not a crime or sin that
should cause social ostracism, even when one of the teachers finally admits
to, or discovers, homosexuality in her own thoughts. This is the level that
could not be brought to the screen until 1962. . Martha Dobie is the one who
confesses lesbian desires. Feeling that she has brought ruin upon everyone,
she shoots herself.
And on the third level, it is about the difficulties of repressing or
admitting homosexuality in oneself. This is the level that has seldom
hitherto been seen as a major theme in The Children's Hour. Here, however,
we not only see it in the character of Martha; we also see it, at any rate
in potential, in Karen - who has been delaying the marriage, who finally
sends Joe away, and who almost lets Martha kiss her 'that way'.
Later, when Martha is dead and when Mary's grandmother (not knowing of the
death) comes to start righting the wrongs that she has done the two
teachers, Karen has moved beyond the issues of right, wrong and injustice.
And, when she is then left alone, she mounts the stairs to the room where
the dead Martha lies. It is at least possible that Karen means to join
Martha in death; or that she wishes now at last to be united with her in
desire. These are only possibilities, I stress. A contrary option is also
possible: that Martha only thinks herself a lesbian and kills herself
because of the intolerable pressure of the situation; and that Karen's final
ascent of the stairs is simply her wish to repent her own homophobia.
The beauty of this production is not that it forces us to think worthy, glib
thoughts about the evils of repression, but that it brings these and other
ambiguous interpretations to the surface. So much so that Hellman, as never
before, seems to be kin to Henry James. In Mary's disturbing influence on
her educators and other children, one thinks of the evil things known by the
child Miles in The Turn of the Screw (and here Martha is also the victim of
a turn-of-a-screw situation); in the triangle of Martha-Karen-Joe, one
thinks of the Olive-Verena-Basil triangle in The Bostonians.
Let me not sound carried away. The Children's Hour is, on the whole a
melodrama. Its first act is far too diffuse, and Martha's third-act
revelation awkwardly sudden. But the play is given here, in almost all
respects, with such fine fluctuations of tone and mood that it keeps going
beyond melodrama; and Karen's final solitude - stressed in this production
more than Hellman's stage directions suggest - approaches tragedy.
If I have left little space to praise the performances, I hope my praise is
already implicit. It is easier to cite the production's flaws. Jason Carr
has provided film-type music to underline the big moments: can this please
be cut? Some American accents have minor problems. Alison Fiske's account of
the silly old aunt applies too much vocal caricature; Emily Watson does not
suggest the most disturbing or most real aspects of Mary's evil and spoilt
nature. However, to watch Harriet Walter, Clare Higgins and Gillian Barge in
their roles is a rare privilege. There are a thousand telling details in
their performances, and all of them work together to make the stage world
more absorbing.
In repertory at the Lyttelton Theatre, South Bank.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Entertaining road to hell - Martin Hoyle enjoys 'Don
Giovanni' and 'Eugene Onegin' in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nature, or rather town planning, has done Belfast's Grand Opera House no
favours. Next to the headquarters of the Ulster Unionists and across the
street from the Europa Hotel, the charming theatre has been the innocent
bystander in more than one bomb incident aimed at its neighbours.
Last Friday opera returned to the theatre after postponement through bomb
damage. Two Johns visited Belfast that day: Major, full of good intentions,
and Mozart's lascivious Sevillian who took the less well-paved but more
entertaining road to hell. Don Giovanni was played out in the unusually
intimate splendour of a fin-de-siecle interior, at first glance a
conventional Frank Matcham froth of gilt, cream and red, but with intriguing
eastern decorative motifs: Moslem sages jostle trumpet-playing cherubs on
the ceiling, cartouches frame Hindu gods, and elephant-heads form the
capitals of pillars.
This production is the result of co-operation between Opera Northern Ireland
and Bath and Wessex Opera. There were reportedly some technical hitches at
the first night in the west of England, and in Belfast the odd off-stage
crash and on-stage flash bespoke the occasional gremlin. But Roman
Terleckyj's production is as lithe and swift as its young cast. David
Myerscough-Jones' set is dominated by a huge grille that parts, ringing
changes on the basic theme of a closed-in society, with visual allusions
ranging from Piranesi-like nightmare prisons to the Marat-Sade spectacle of
panicky peasants clambering up the bars in an effort to escape the avengers
in the ball scene.
To judge by both Giovanni and the following night's Eugene Onegin, there is
no shortage of good baritones today. The Danish Johannes Mannov was a
plausible philanderer and a stylish Mozartian: his honeyed opening of 'La ci
darem la mano' with the sweet-voiced Zerlina of Yvonne Barclay turned it
into a real seduction. Eric Ashcraft's Ottavio was much less wimpish than
usual, Christopher Purves' light-voiced baritonal Leporello had the stage
communicativeness expected from an ex-Wallbanger (as in Harvey and the
ditto), John Hall's Commendatore was young and vigorous.
Musically Roy Goodman directed a fleet performance from the Ulster
Orchestra. Most stylish of all was the Elvira of Elizabeth Gale, once a
memorable Zerlina. There have been fuller voices in the role, but she knows
what the character and Mozart are about.
If Don Giovanni was conventionally enjoyable, Onegin had much in it that
reminded the English visitor of Pountneyesque ideas from ENO's glory days. A
little girl, Alice-like, wanders through the action: the child Tatyana was?
The innocence that never quite died? Invisible, all-seeing, she firmly shuts
a book over the grieving Onegin, as if the characters' destiny had been
already decided in the past. Between scenes a wind whistles across the
stage, dominated by the autumnal crimson of virginia creeper. There may be a
tendency to think of Pushkin's 'lyric scenes' as anticipating Chekhov.
However, only 48 hours after seeing a stage adaptation of Emma I was struck
how much Tatyana and her circle had in common with Jane Austen's small,
intensely-felt world of emotional ripening and developing moral awareness.
The later romanticism is all Tchaikovsky's own, and the Romanian production
team (director Ion Caramitru, designer Maria Miu) play up the element of
regretted opportunities, vanished hopes, unrecapturable youth. The St
Petersburg ballroom is full of ghosts - the tired nurse, Olga, Madame
Larina, the dead Lensky, his pistol raised as in that fatal duel - pass like
wraiths through the elegant dancers. As a way of dramatising an opera that
can unfold slowly on stage, whose conflicts are internal and psychological,
the production strikes a happy and tactful balance between theatricality and
the introspective beauties of the score.
The American Kimm Julian is a mature Onegin, a stiff avuncular figure,
perhaps a foretaste of one of Henry James's more icy creations, finely sung,
intelligently acted. Melanie Armitstead's dignified bearing and veiled vocal
quality were better with the grande dame than the impulsive girl. Mark
Beudert, another American, provided Lensky with Italianate tone, after
initially uncertain intonation, and made a handsome young poet. Kate
McCarney, a glamorous Olga, Colette McGahon's loving Larina and Enid
Hartle's experienced Nurse filled the lesser roles from strength.
Robust playing for Kenneth Montgomery was seconded by the splendid ONI
chorus, amazingly an amateur body. This recalls Welsh National Opera,
originally built around an amateur chorus, but WNO was able to grow through
the backup of English besides Welsh touring. Dreams of one central
organisation providing opera for Belfast, Dublin and Cork are still 'a
political hot potato'. Meanwhile ONI prepares a touring version of Don
Pasquale, looks forward to Elisir and aspires to next year's double of
Boheme and Cunning Little Vixen. As the company admits, Janacek is a
box-office risk, but 'it's the sort of opera that people can come to and
fall in love with'.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: British art set fair for revival - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The organisers of the 20th Century British Art Fair, which opens at the
Royal College of Art on Wednesday and runs until Sunday, have pulled in the
Big One. London's leading modern art dealer, Leslie Waddington, has agreed
to take part. He has withdrawn his pronouncement that London is artistically
dead and will show works by Henry Moore, Peter Blake, David Hockney, and
more.
His participation sums up a revivalist mood. The fair has grown to almost 50
exhibitors and concentrates on British art which shows 20th century
progressiveness without lapsing into the conceptual avant-garde. Another
important newcomer is the New Art Centre, with sculptures by Hepworth,
including 'Ascending Form (Gloria)' at Dollars 300,000, Frink and Armitage.
The loan exhibition consists of paintings from the Financial Times
collection. This is the first time works from the collection have been on
public view.
The fair began in 1988, near the peak of the market, and was an instant
success. One dealer sold a painting by SJ Peploe, the Scottish Colourist,
off his stand to a stranger for Pounds 275,000. This year Duncan Miller is
offering a very fine Peploe, indeed the largest he painted, 'Interior with
seated girl', for Pounds 175,000.
Julian Hartnoll, who is showing 'kitchen sink' artists like John Bratby,
reckons that many prices are now only 50 per cent of the levels six years
ago. Private collectors can now afford to buy again and anyone who dreamed
of owning paintings by the likes of Wyndham Lewis, Carel Weight, Patrick
Heron, Stanley Spencer, Graham Sutherland, Ivon Hitchens, Augustus John, in
fact all the established names of the century, should hurry along.
It is a dumb arts organisation which is not launching a re-building appeal
in the hope of attracting National Lottery money. Most start their projects
at Pounds 1m and then add a nought, or two. So it is refreshing that
Leighton House in Kensington, the home of the High Priest of Victorian art,
Lord Leighton, is only seeking Pounds 400,000.
It wants the money not to build, but to return to the past, to recreate the
garden, the grand Arab Hall, and the artist's studio as they might have
looked on some mythical day in the 1880s. Lord Leighton has just popped out
and you idly wait in his home. His easel, brushes and props are all in place
in the studio, and you can just catch the conversation of his deserted
supper guests, murmuring away round the dinner table. This is strictly
heritage restored.
With Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, a Leighton lover since his school days,
heading the appeal it stands little chance of failing, and the house should
be ready for even more visitors (it already gets 42,000 a year) by January
1996, when there is a big Leighton show at the RA to celebrate the centenary
of his death.
It would be interesting to open other artists studios in the neighbourhood.
Val Prinsep, GF Watts, Marcus Stone, William Burges (with a particularly
fine Pre-Raphaelite interior) and Luke Fyldes, all lions in their late
Victorian day, lived within pot throwing distance. Their homes are now
occupied by such contemporary luminaries of the cultural scene as Led
Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and cinematic foodie Michael Winner.
Once again British programme makers have triumphed at the Prix Italia,
Europe's oldest broadcasting festival. Standards among the 77 television
programmes competing for the three prizes have been higher in 1994 than at
any time in the past 20 years. Yet the BBC won the main prize for drama with
The Snapper, Roddy Doyle's sharp but hilarious story about teenage pregnancy
in a rumbustious Dublin family; and for music with Strange Fish, the
television version of Lloyd Newson's remarkable modern ballet danced by the
DV8 company. Furthermore, in the documentary category - the only one they
did not win outright - the BBC won the special prize with Black Daisies For
The Bride, a harrowing but undeniably original programme dealing with
Alzheimer's disease. Prix Italia and special prizes are each worth 15m lire
(Pounds 6,000). Christopher Dunkley will report in full in Wednesday's
television column.

SIGNALS OF DISTRESS by Jim Crace Viking Pounds 15, 277 pages
FREELAND by JDF Jones Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 293 pages
Signals of Distress is the fourth novel from the highly-talented Jim Crace,
but the first which could be said to be realistic. The setting is
Wherrytown, a miserable fishing village on the Cornish coast, and the time
is the 1830s.
Enter an American sailing ship with a slave aboard, and a London freethinker
and emancipationist, Aymer Smith. The impact of these arrivals on the chapel
culture of the village leads, inevitably, to conflict. Aymer Smith is the
novel's fulcrum. His utopianism is a fraud; everything he does - while
ostensibly for others - is in fact done to enhance his self-esteem. Vanity
and self-love lie at the root of his deeds.
The author's portrait of this spindle-shaped, boring windbag, who spies on
his fellow guests as they make love and is totally and irredeemably
unlovable from start to finish, is fantastically achieved, a tour de force.
It is also strangely unsatisfying because Aymer at the end knows nothing
more than he did at the beginning.
In short, Aymer is a cipher who belongs in the canon of revolting men to
which the writer Ian McEwan and the film maker Peter Greenaway, for
instance, have contributed many examples. Ostensibly, their creations, who
are men at their very worst, are intended to satisfy a liberal, pro-feminist
constituency; in fact they are anti-male.
After 270 pages in Smith's company, I was left with the feeling that this
horrible character, and the fact of having created him warts and all, is
ultimately less a comment on an autonomously created character than an
intended reflection of the author's integrity. But putting aside this
reservation, there is no doubt that he can write brilliantly and move his
enormous cast around with formidable panache.
Some of the themes of Crace's novel - notably that mankind's imperfect
nature will always sabotage aspirations to utopianism - are explored in JDF
Jones's first novel Freeland. Both works are also mercifully free of the
trickery and verbal showing off so common in novels today.
The Freelanders of the title are a motley band of idealists who intend to
settle in the Kenyan highlands and establish an ideal and just society,
crime free, with collectively owned property.
But to get where they want to go they must first pass through Lamu, an
island off the East African coast and an ancient landfall for mariners on
the Indian Ocean. The place is half-Arabic, half-black, civilised, corrupt,
corrupting and every bit as confusing and dangerous as the European cities
which they have left behind.
As the narrative unfolds it becomes clear that our dreamers are hopeless at
holding onto their beliefs amid the whore houses, the transvestites, and the
slave traders of Lamu; they become ensnared in local plots and most never
even get to Africa proper. To point up the unbridgeable gap between the
dream and the sordid facts of human nature, every chapter begins with a
quotation from the silly Utopian novel of the movement's founder.
Freeland is part of the long tradition in literature whereby Europeans
dumped in tropical climes behave foolishly, dangerously or criminally and
thus reveal that their civilisation is only skin deep. The most sublime
example of this form is Lord of the Flies.
The cast in Freeland is very large, for besides our 20 or so settlers, there
is also the local Arabic ruler and his clan, the local British
administrator, and an Englishman of dubious provenance who joins the
visitors in order to spy on them. The author does not always move them about
gracefully. He is also somewhat inclined to salt the letters of his
characters with asides to the effect that everything is falling apart,
rather than revealing this fact.
Yet there is much pleasure in this book for readers who like their fiction
straight up, unadorned, without linguistic flights of exhibitionist fancy
and no gratuitous mise en scene designed to expose either the reader's
queasiness or the author's bravery in reporting on the disgusting. A decent
read.

<TEXT>
THE EVOLUTION OF THE GOSPELS by Enoch Powell Yale University Press Pounds
16.99, 224 pages
Enoch Powell courts controversy. That is no bad thing, except that he seems
to have a Quixotic talent for picking fights he is bound to lose badly. In
this book - a new translation, with commentary, of the gospel according to
St Matthew - he does so by returning to his roots as a classical scholar, to
tilt at the windmills of New Testament scholarship by proposing a radical
new thesis about the Gospels.
There are a number of accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus, of which
four were made official by the early Church. One of these, the gospel called
'John', is a sophisticated theological work written much later than the
others. The others, known as the 'Synoptic' gospels, are more historical in
character. If the vehement world of biblical scholarship has a standard view
about these writings, it goes somewhat as follows.
The earliest is 'Mark'. It was written in the late fifties AD, in Rome,
perhaps under St Peter's supervision. It seems originally to have contained
neither the nativity nor resurrection stories. 'Mark's' purpose was to
persuade Roman converts that Jesus's crucifixion - a Roman punishment for
terrorism - was the result of a plot by Jewish leaders, who were too afraid
of the populace to stone him for blasphemy.
'Matthew' and 'Luke', the standard view continues, were written
independently of each other at least two decades after 'Mark', and were
based both on 'Mark' and a separate source of anecdotes and sayings, now
lost, which scholars call 'Q'.
Any discriminating reader of the gospels will notice furtherpoints. 'Mark'
is a crude work, a record of miracles and deeds, with little of Jesus's
teachings in them. 'Luke' is a skilful literary work, whose author explores
motivation in his characters and crafts a coherent narrative. 'Matthew' is
clumsy, a poorly edited compilation from unordered and overlapping
materials. But 'Matthew' has the virtues of its vices; alone among the
gospels it records great tranches of ethical teachings, as if its writer (or
compilers) had simply transcribed much of 'Q'.
Powell's controversial disruption of this standard picture is that 'Matthew'
is the original gospel, and 'Luke' and 'Mark' both derive from it, and from
it alone. Matthew itself is a composite work, Powell claims, consisting of
an early document with later additions and changes. The early document
justifies Peter's mission to the Gentiles, the later changes were made to
please Peter's opponents, the Christians who wished to remain within
Judaism. In thus witnessing doctrinal struggles in the early church, says
Powell, Matthew is uniquely important.
To establish his theses Powell uses techniques of textual criticism.
Although singularly brief, his argument cannot - alas] for it is fun to
delve among such arguments - be rehearsed here. But one does not have to be
a Greek scholar to see that it fails. For everything Powell says is
consistent with the standard view that 'Matthew' and 'Luke' derive from
'Mark' and 'Q' - with Luke perhaps adding something of his own.
On the second thesis - that 'Matthew' is a heavily emended text - Powell is
less dogmatic, and more plausible. There is little doubt that the gospels
were doctored as Church politics required, and 'Matthew' seems worst
affected. But this too is consistent with the standard view; it would only
be significant if 'Matthew' were indeed the first gospel.
Powell ignores the standard view, and he also ignores an even more important
matter, which is that the real first gospel is actually Paul's epistles,
written - the standard view again - two decades before 'Mark'.

PARALLEL THINKING by Edward de Bono Viking Pounds 16, 240 pages
Socrates has a great deal to answer for. Thanks to him, and to fellow
ancients Plato and Aristotle, the west has got stuck in an adversarial way
of thinking, in which creativity has been stifled and destructive criticism
has flourished.
In Parallel Thinking, Edward de Bono suggests that we put the last 2,500
years behind us and start looking at the world in a new way. No longer
should we be preoccupied with truth and falsity, definitions and judgments,
but we should think in terms of possibilities, laying before us a number of
parallel ideas, using them to design a way forward.
This is his boldest attempt yet to change the way our minds work. The deluge
of books from de Bono over the last 30 years has introduced the world to
lateral thinking, to water logic and to a large number of other thinking
techniques. This time he is doing something more radical: suggesting that we
throw out our entire thinking machinery and adopt his ways instead.
To take such a bold step, we are going to need some persuading. He tells us
that western thinking, which assumes conditions are stable, is increasingly
ill-equipped to deal with a changing world. He claims it encourages us to be
destructive and discriminatory in our habits and institutions (he just stops
short of making Socrates responsible for racism, but does blame him for the
pointlessly adversarial nature of the British parliamentary system). Western
thinking also makes us complacent, because we build everything around the
status quo; and arrogant, because we view the truth as absolute. These
tendencies mean we cannot accept that the whole system is flawed.
Instead, if we could only stop viewing events in terms of is/is not and
always/never and concentrate on sometimes/usually/maybe the world will open
up, and new ideas and initiatives will fall into our laps. De Bono is not so
unrealistic to assume that adults can make the transition easily or quickly.
He insists that all schools should teach these new ways of thinking to
children, that governments should set up special thinking departments, and
that the United Nations should even establish an Office of Creativity.
De Bono is right to point out the dangers of a system that relies
excessively on criticism. He is right that new ideas need encouragement,
they do not just happen. It may also be true that we are excessively
preoccupied with putting events into boxes, rather then viewing them from
all sides, and wondering what they lead to.
Yet he overstates his case. As ever with de Bono, the whole is produced with
breathtaking arrogance. The sub-title, 'From Socratic to de Bono Thinking',
gives a flavour of what is to follow. Every one of the footnotes refers to
his own works, and the text is written in a style of one that brooks no
opposition. This is made harder to swallow by the fact that parallel
thinking is meant to be about humility and alternatives.
There seems no reason to view the Socratic and 'de Bono' methods as rivals.
Imagine the chaos if for every minor thought we had to lay out all the
possibilities in parallel and design a way forward. For the vast majority of
our thoughts our accustomed machinery suits us well, making it possible to
get through the day at all. Certainly we should try to be less inflexible in
our judgment; but Socrates would hardly have had a problem with that.

<TEXT>
INSIDE YELTSIN'S RUSSIA by John Kampfner Cassell Pounds 17.99, 288 pages
ZHIRINOVSKY: THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK edited by Graham Fraser and George
Lancelle Penguin Pounds 5.99, 173 pages
Here we have two books. In one, a Daily Telegraph journalist describes three
years spent in Moscow, reporting on corruption and economic decay; in the
other, a would-be fascist propounds a narrow vision of Russian economic and
military superiority, making liberal use of aphorism and epigram. An odd
pair, but together, John Kampfner's Inside Yeltsin's Russia and Vladimir
Zhirinovsky' s Little Black Book shed light on one another in a curious and
unexpected fashion.
Inside Yeltsin's Russia is typical of its genre, opening with Kampfner's
memory of student days in Russia, and concluding with a forecast of Russia's
future. In between, Inside Yeltsin's Russia is sometimes muddled,
occasionally switching too quickly from businessmen to politicians and then
back again.
But it may be that the book's structure reflects the confusing nature of its
subject with deadly accuracy. Yeltsin's Russia was and still is a Russia in
which nothing is quite as it seems. A business is not necessarily business,
but might be a mafia front; a bank is not always a bank, but a means to
launder money. Businessmen are not necessarily businessmen, and politicians
are not necessarily politicians.
Kampfner writes that 'ideological differences played a part, but not the
most significant part, in the power struggle that dominated Yeltsin's first
years in power. Politics was largely a means to an end, and that end was
economic control.' Economic control is a polite way to say that politicians
were primarily interested in self-enrichment, that politics were largely
about money, and that most of what looked like political debate was, in
fact, carefully controlled stealing.
Take, for example, Kampfner's convincing explanation of the power struggle
between president Yeltsin and vice-president Alexander Rutskoy. Although
this struggle began in the autumn of 1992 and culminated in the storming of
the Russian parliament a year later, its origins lay not in a political
difference, but in a bitter disagreement over whose aides and followers were
stealing the most.
Rutskoy's Kremlin office was frequented by businessmen who 'would barge in
unannounced, calling him 'Sasha' and giving him orders'; yet Rutskoy had a
habit of summoning his political adversaries to meetings, claiming to
possess compromising material about their own business deals, and demanding
favours in exchange for keeping quiet. If Rutskoy really was ever interested
in constitutional issues - in, say, upholding the principle legislative rule
in the battle against executive power - he did an excellent job of
concealing it.
Yet put down Kampfner's book and pick up Zhirinovsky: The Little Black Book,
and all of the confusion melts effortlessly away. True, The Little Black
Book is not quite what it appears to be either. Although it also looks, on
the surface, like a classic of its genre, sharing its epigrammatic format
with Mao's Little Red Book and Nietzsche's collected works, it is only a
compilation of Zhirinovsky's sayings, put together by Graham Fraser and
George Lancelle, two non-Russians who are (not surprisingly) unsympathetic
to the man and his ambitions.
But although in translation and surrounded by critical editorial comment,
Zhirinovsky's actual sayings are concise, and his ideas are clear.
Are both Yeltsin and Rutskoy corrupt? Well, says Zhirinovsky, 'the only
party with clean hands and a clear conscience - we are unsullied and
unmarked by a single drop of blood - is the Liberal Democratic Party of
Russia,' the party led by Zhirinovsky himself. Do people feel economically
insecure? Under a Zhirinovsky government 'some of the population will live
very well because people will have the opportunity to work honestly and,
after that, to enjoy a secure old age.' Foreign policy is simple too: 'Why
should we inflict suffering on ourselves? Let others suffer.'
In Zhirinovsky's speeches all of the muddle and moral uncertainty which are
so evident in Kampfner's account of life in modern Russia are swept away -
and that, of course, is precisely Zhirinovsky's appeal to the 'lumpenized
masses', in whose name he claims to speak.
His star may already be fading, as even the 'lumpenized masses' learn to see
through him, but Zhirinovsky will undoubtedly be followed by others who see
the value of clear speech and ideas. While Yeltsin dithers, hiring more old
apparatchiks to work for him, others with better intuitions about what
Russians want to hear will, for better or for worse, capture the public's
attention. Having read these two books, no one would find it difficult to
understand why.

ambivalence and recriminations on the island of Haiti
</HEADLINE>

THE HAITI FILES: DECODING THE CRISIS edited by James Ridgeway Latin American
Bureau Pounds 9.99, 243 pages
Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, said: 'Pluck the chicken as
long as it does not squawk.' His successors have been enthusiastically
following his advice for 190 years.
That the chicken is now hardly worth plucking is not the achievement of
Haiti's corrupt leadership alone, however. As US troops once more land on
Haitian soil, it is worth remembering that almost every foreign intervention
in this nation's history has ended in recrimination - for both sides.
For the US, which sent gunboats into Haitian waters two dozen times between
1849 and 1913 and occupied the country for 19 years this century, Haiti has
been one of the most troublesome countries in its Caribbean backyard.
This book, fortuitously published as the US prepared its invasion force,
suggests it will continue to be. For those confused by last week's
developments, this eclectic collection of essays, documents and chronology
is full of insight.
Its editor, James Ridgeway, is a columnist on New York's Village Voice. He
provides two chapters: on Haiti's ruling families and the extension of
Haitian government terror tactics to New York. The book's viewpoint is
predictably politically correct, but the targets at which it takes aim - the
country's mulatto oligarchy, its drug-running army and police, the Duvaliers
and the US government and its agencies - are legitimate.
While some may want to discard the more egregious conspiracy theories, what
comes through strongly is the ambivalence at the heart of the US government
about Haiti policy. It is an ambivalence that continues even with US troops
on the ground. Here is current commerce secretary Ron Brown, who as partner
in a Washington law firm represented the Haitian government of Jean-Claude
'Baby Doc' Duvalier in the US for the four years until just before Baby Doc
was kicked out of the country in 1986.
The US military's preference for their brothers in uniform - led by West
Point graduate Lt Gen Raoul Cedras - over the poor illiterate people who
make up the majority of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's support,
is also clear. Last year, when lightly-armed US troops were heading to Haiti
to back an accord to return Aristide to the island, a Pentagon spokesman
helpfully said: 'One shot and we're out of there.' Unsurprisingly, the
government organised a riot by armed thugs in Port-au-Prince as the US army
was to arrive, and the troop carriers turned back.
Now as US generals emphasise the patriotism of Cedras and the Haitian
military leaders, US troops are fanning out through Haiti with the help of
the Haitian military. Yet were not these the people the US was determined to
oust only a week ago? If it is the biggest part of the problem, how can the
Haitian army be part of the solution?
In one chapter, a supporter of the Haitian military government argues that
the man the US has to fear most is not Cedras, but police chief Michel
Francois who runs the so-called attaches - thugs attached to the police -
and is cited as being linked to Colombian cocaine barons.
'Michel Francois is sworn not to let Aristide come back. You're not going to
work a deal with him . . . They (the US intervention force) are going to
have to kill Francois.' For a US administration anxious not to repeat the
mistakes of its intervention in Somalia - when a witch hunt for clan leader
Mohamed Farah Aideed ended disastrously - this must be a chilling thought.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: Just the ticket, mate - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip.
It would seem natural, we were told, 'for Julie Andrews to suddenly cavort
through the wild, flower-strewn hills' at Thredbo, New South Wales. Sadly,
during our visit, she appeared to have stayed at home in Gstaad. Still, you
can understand the attempts by the resort's marketing department to depict
it as something out of the European Alps, in spite of the ubiquitous snow
gums and crimson rosellas.
It does have a most attractive mountain village and the skiing, on balance,
is probably the best in Australia. But it is debatable whether 'hot runs
like Cannonball, Funnel Web and Michael's Mistake' have 'world-wide
reputations', good as they are, and whether 'every metre is groomed like a
Test match wicket'. This kind of hype is encouraged by intense rivalry
between Thredbo and its biggest rival, neighbouring Perisher Valley.
Until recently, Perisher claimed the highest lift in Australia: the Mt
Perisher double chair. Then, Thredbo had it surveyed on the sly and
announced that, because the lift did not quite reach the summit, it had the
highest - Karel's T-bar, at just under 6,675 ft - by just over one skier's
height: 6ft 6 1/2 in.
Our last resort in Australia was Perisher's other big rival, Mount Blue Cow.
Built only seven years ago, the name is said to be inspired by a cow
belonging to a stockman's wife which strayed into the high pastures one
autumn and was found frozen to death the following spring.
Recently, The Cow, Australia's newest resort, bought one of the oldest - its
neighbour, Guthega. It was here that we skied our last trails in Australia,
Wombat's Lament and Mother-in-Law, after that we headed for Sydney en route
to New Zealand's South Island.
'No dramas, mate,' is a common saying Down Under. But, suddenly, there were.
While we were having breakfast overlooking Sydney harbour, our flight to
Christchurch was taking off without us.
Our tickets were printed last year - and Air New Zealand's schedules had
changed so that our flight left at 8am instead of 11.30. At the airport, we
were told the next flight would not get us to Christchurch until after
midnight. The grim prospect loomed of a 300-mile drive back to Thredbo to
ski.
'Do you have a flight going anywhere in New Zealand?' we asked, desperately.
There was one to Wellington in half an hour. It was not where we wanted to
go, but we grabbed it. As long as we could fly on to Christchurch and reach
Mt Hutt before midnight, we would ski that day.
By the time we had neared the bottom of the long, winding dirt road to the
mountain, it was 9pm. Would the road be open? Would we be able to reach
snow? Would there be anyone there?
To our relief, the place was humming. Soon Lucy and I were rumbling up the
mountain in snow cats for two mile-long descents, our paths lit by powerful
arc-lights on the machines. Our record of skiing every day was intact -
just.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: Oh lucky man - Soccer / Keegan's Newcastle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tyneside is gripped by mania. Newcastle United lead the league. One Geordie,
among the Arsenal fans in the West Stand at Highbury on Sunday, explained
that if he wanted to see his team play he had to travel to away matches to
do it. His brother said: 'Seeing Newcastle on top of the table seems unreal.
It's like having a Labour Government with a thumping majority.'
Tyneside has not been touched by football glory for 20 years. In 1974,
Newcastle reached the FA Cup final. They were outplayed by Liverpool and
lost 3-0. Kevin Keegan inspired the winners and scored twice. The game
represented a turning point for both clubs.
Liverpool had won the league two years earlier, but the cup victory
signalled the start of a period of unprecedented domination. In the next 15
seasons they won 10 league titles, they also won four European cups; the
first inspired by the irrepressible Keegan, the last three master-minded by
his replacement, Kenny Dalglish.
Newcastle went into decline. They sold Malcolm MacDonald to Arsenal and
Terry McDermott and Alan Kennedy to Liverpool and were relegated in 1978 -
one year before the last Labour government fell. They returned to the first
division in 1984, inspired by Keegan, Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley. The
euphoria was short-lived. Keegan retired. Dalglish, now manager of
Liverpool, bought Beardsley. Newcastle were relegated again in 1989. By
February 1992 they had slid into the debt and to the bottom of the second
division. The club turned to Keegan again.
Just as Keegan, the player, provided the yardstick by which Dalglish was
measured. So Keegan the manager must measure himself against what Dalglish
has achieved. Dalglish was more extravagantly gifted but lacked the
ebullience which made Keegan a talisman wherever he played. Dalglish won 102
caps for Scotland, yet, unlike Keegan, a sense of underachievement hangs
over his international career.
A similar doubt surrounds his time as manager of Liverpool. He managed the
club to three championships, the side of 1987-8, was perhaps the greatest
Liverpool team. Yet he could not avert the decline of the Liverpool empire.
At Blackburn, Dalglish has hardly put a foot wrong. Arthur Cox and Roy
MacFarland at Derby, Graham Turner and Graham Taylor at Wolves, have also
spent heavily from the pockets of benefactors, without lifting their clubs
out of division one. Dalglish steered Blackburn to promotion within eight
months of arriving and then to second place in the Premiership. But he
plodded up the ladder. Keegan scampered.
The team Dalglish built with Jack Walker's gold, possesses a leaden quality:
witness their grimly uninspired 1-0 loss to Trelleborgs of Sweden in the
UEFA Cup. On the same night Newcastle gave a golden performance away to
Royal Antwerp. Newcastle won 5-0. They have won all six league games,
scoring 22 goals and are four points ahead of Blackburn at the top of the
table. They are playing dazzling football. Today they are at home to
Liverpool whose fans could remind Keegan that Newcastle will not be a great
team until they can sustain their form in the first eight matches over eight
months.
Even so Keegan's achievement is already striking. He took over at Newcastle
four months after Dalglish did at Blackburn. And he took over a team much
lower down the league. Dalglish has spent about Pounds 30m in three years.
Keegan has spent Pounds 17m in 30 months. But where Dalglish has bought blue
chippers and bargains. Keegan has gambled - but then taking over Newcastle
when he did was a gamble.
Dalglish spent Pounds 2.2m on Tim Flowers, an England goalkeeper. Keegan
spent Pounds 300,000 on Pavel Srnicek from the Czech Republic. Srnicek
dominated at Arsenal. Dalglish spent Pounds 8.3m on his two first-choice
forwards, Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. Keegan has spent just over Pounds
6m on Beardsley, Andy Cole, Robert Lee and Ruel Fox. Beardsley was 32 and
Newcastle's chairman, Sir John Hall, opposed the deal. Cole had played just
one top-division game and had a poor personal reputation.
Players blossom at Newcastle. At Norwich, Fox rarely ran at defenders. This
season he is a born-again dribbler. Cole is now creator as well as
goal-scorer. Lee, who scored roughly a goal every five games at Charlton, is
emerging as a game-winner, scoring eight goals in eight games.
Newcastle's success is based on more than an eye for untapped talent. The
team has a style. Where Blackburn are solid and functional, Newcastle have a
distinctive personality.
Last Sunday they posed insuperable problems for one of the league's most
sophisticated defences. Newcastle are not the only team in the Premier
League dedicated to attack, they are not the only quick, intelligent,
passing team. Cole is an exceptional goal-scorer, but there are half a dozen
of them in the division. What makes Newcastle special is their relentless
running - into attack and back into defence - and the ability of their front
four to dribble.
A good passing game is based as much on the effort of the players off the
ball as the perception of the man with it. On Sunday, one sweeping Newcastle
counter-attack ended with John Beresford, the full-back, appearing unmarked
at the far post to make a header. He then turned and sprinted back 90 yards
to his defensive position. Opposing defences must chose between picking up
the runs from deep of Beresford, Marc Hottiger, Scott Sellars and Philippe
Albert and double-marking Cole, Beardsley, Lee and Fox.
For Arsenal, Martin Keown marked Cole, while Tony Adams burst forward into
the space in front of the penalty area from which Beardsley, in particular,
likes to plot mischief, to break up attacks. Cole did not score but Keown,
stretching and twisting all afternoon, did, twice, in his own net.
Newcastle's other goal in a 3-2 win came from a generously-awarded penalty,
but Keegan brushed aside suggestions that his team had been fortunate.
Football coaches who want their players to shoot more tell them they must
buy tickets to win the lottery. Newcastle's ceaseless, sharply-pointed
attacks bring a lot of tickets. They are bound to earn themselves some luck
and Keegan has always been a lucky man.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: More power to your right foot - Motor Racing / The
Formula One year is building to a finale which will be decided by driver
skill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bizarre as it may seem the outcome of this year's Formula One world
championship, still the technological pinnacle of motor racing, may prove to
have rested on the thickness of a short plank.
Made of wood, bolted to the underside of the Benetton-Ford of current
championship leader Michael Schumacher - as it is every grand prix car  -
its purpose is to make the cars ride higher and thus lose some of the
downforce which has allowed them to corner at G-forces for which most
circuits had never been designed.
The plank forms a small part of the intended safety dividend from that black
day in May when the late Ayrton Senna's Williams-Renault speared tragically,
and still not wholly explicably, into the unyielding concrete wall of
Imola's infamous Tamburello curve.
Had the plank under Schumacher's Benetton been a few millimetres thicker
when it was measured by race officials at the end of the Belgium grand prix,
he might be watching tomorrow's Portuguese round from the sidelines
reasonably confident that Damon Hill had little chance of challenging his
lead in the four remaining grands prix.
Schumacher would have had that confidence even though at the Estoril circuit
he will be sitting out the second race of a two-race ban for ignoring the
stewards' black flag for a misdemeanour in the British grand prix at
Silverstone. Instead, the plank's missing millimetres, bringing the car
closer to the ground and thus making it more aerodynamically effective, were
construed by officials as more than could be explained by scraping over the
kerbs. Schumacher lost all his points for first place. If Hill takes his
Renault-Williams to victory tomorrow, as he has vowed he will, the young
German's lead will have been cut to just one point.
In the season's final three races Schumacher will have to cope not just with
Hill and the other rivals who he has outpaced so easily this season , but
the fiercely competitive former FI and IndyCar champion Nigel Mansell.
At 41 Mansell, returning from IndyCars to his old Renault-Williams seat, has
something to prove. Currently enduring media taunts that he is over the
hill, he will almost certainly prove Schumacher's most formidable
challenger.
Benetton was also fined in connection with the black flag incident. It has
been involved in disputes with the authorities over its in-car computer
software and its pit-stop refuelling equipment. There is a risk that for
both Benetton and Schumacher a season which began as a tour de force may end
as fiasco. If so, it will be a debacle for Benetton only. Spectators, media
and sponsors, are more likely to relish an exciting fight to the finish.
Better yet, this season's rule changes, embracing a 'technology ban', and
safety changes, are having an almost entirely positive effect on grand prix
as competition and spectacle. It may still not offer the wheel-banging
closeness of touring car racing, but the huge technology advantage of
leading teams has been much diminished. In particular, the banning of
traction control, that odious computer device which limited power to the
rear wheels while accelerating out of a corner, has tilted the balance of
power firmly back to the driver's right foot. No longer is he protected by
technology from his own over-eagerness. Recently, we have witnessed even the
demi-gods pirouetting into the gravel-traps as they re-learn the traction
control through human perception and reflexes.
There are those who argue that the traction control ban is a step backwards
in terms of safety, and perhaps it is. But balancing power against available
tyre grip is one of the most fundamental of racing driving skills. Its
absence had served to diminish a sport which, by its very essence, can never
be wholly safe.
The changes have also helped brave and skilful drivers escape from the
relative obscurity of the middle pack.
No-one, for example, could fail to be impressed by Ukyo Katayama thrusting
the Tyrell-Yamaha team back to prominence and harassing even the
Williams-Renaults in the most recent grand prix, at Monza.
The hard-charging of Rubens Barrichello with the Jordan-Hart and Ferrari,
with Jean Alesi and the ever-cheerful Gerhard Berger, are also beneficiaries
of the levelling of the technological playing field.
With Estoril the latest circuit to have corners tamed and run-off areas
increased, tomorrow's drama should be confined to the race itself. It should
nevertheless contain plot and texture enough for the most demanding
aficionado.
In the past few days, Hill and Schumacher have re-signed for their teams.
Their immediate futures are assured. But the young Scot, David Coulthard,
who must give up his Williams seat to Mansell for the last three grands
prix, will be out to prove that it is he, not Mansell, who deserves to drive
alongside Hill next year. He pressed Hill hard at Monza and will probably do
so again tomorrow. Hill himself is uncomfortably aware of a growing tide of
'Coulthard is faster' comment. The coming months for the likeable Hill will
be uncomfortable indeed if tomorrow Coulthard remains behind him only on the
basis of team orders.
Neither will gain much relief from Ferrari. Alesi, after leading so easily
at Monza until mechanical failure intervened, lusts for his first win.
Trying hardest of all will be Johnny Herbert. It has been a miserable couple
of seasons with Lotus for the undoubtedly rapid Englishman. Lotus'
deteriorating financial position led at last to the appointment of
administrators a few days ago. Ironically, this coincided with the arrival
of new Mugen-Honda engines. At Monza Herbert headed even the Williams cars
away from the start. The brief challenge was ended by a collision with the
fiery Irishman, Eddy Irvine. But if Herbert can prove tomorrow, in front of
several potential sponsors, that Monza was no flash in the pan he may save
not only his own career - but Lotus itself.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: Four views of the southern stars - Rugby / Derek
Wyatt saw the best of the League and Union seasons below the equator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago, I took one of the Sydney's new double decker trains to North
Sydney to watch the rugby union semi-final between Warringah and Gordon.
The ground has a Field of Dreams quality to it; it is a quaint and mellow
oval which could easily double as a home for a Palm Court orchestra and it
is owned not by Warringah or Gordon or by the Sydney or New South Wales RFUs
but by the local council. As such it plays home at weekends to the North
Sydney professional rugby league team and a host of rugby union sides,
something we, in England, find unacceptable, although why we do, is hard to
fathom.
Although Gordon caused an upset last year by winning the Grand Final -
Randwick, the best side, had done a Bath, losing their concentration, and
the match, in an early round - this year they have been a shadow of
themselves. Warringah, with a strongish pack and fielding the best player,
Mark Catchpole (son of the legendary Ken Catchpole), at scrum-half, were
favourites.
The game was played under floodlights to attract a larger crowd; the first
rugby league semi-final, which drew 40,000 to the Sydney Football Ground
that afternoon would have offered over-powering competition.
As I watched Gordon and Warringah my mind wandered, the game had little
attraction for the neutral spectator and I kept thinking that I had seen
parts of the ground before. It was not until later that it dawned on me that
the stands had come from the Sydney Cricket Ground when the 'hill' was
dug-up.
In the end, in front of 8,000, Warringah emerged the winners by 29-18 though
Gordon were much the better side. Warringah went on to lose to Randwick a
week later.
It was an unfair comparison but a week earlier I had been in the Bosch
hospitality suite at Ellis Park in Johannesburg to watch Transvaal narrowly
beat Western Province in the Lion Cup, South Africa's equivalent of the
Pikington Cup, in front of 42,000 spectators. That day, there were 20
prospective international players on show. At North Sydney there were none.
Sydney is essentially a village, you go to a bar or restaurant and bump into
the strangest of people. I ran into Sir Nicholas Shehadie who was Lord Mayor
of the city when I first visited in 1975 with the England rugby team. He
invited me to a game that weekend, the major rugby league semi-final between
Canberra and Canterbury at the SFG, where a month earlier the Wallabies had
beaten New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup with that tackle by George Gregan.
There was a buzz in the air. The media was excited and at the many
breakfasts, brunches and cocktail parties that morning, the talk was of the
game.
The ground, by Australia's best known architect, Philip Cox, ranks alongside
those at Murrayfield and Old Trafford. Sir Nick chairs the trust that also
looks after its neighbour, Sydney Cricket Ground.
We were joined at his table for lunch by, among others, a cabinet minister
and David Campese, the Wallaby back, fresh, or rather, unfresh from his
French Barbarian appearance in Paris against the Barbarians.
Big-spending rugby league club, Canberra Raiders, have had the most
brilliant season. Their full back, Brett Mullins is the best player in the
world and their line up also includes Mal Meninga, although he is well past
his sell by date.
Canterbury on the other hand are the local side made good, deeply embedded
in the culture of their south Sydney suburb. It is not unusual for them to
hold Greek or Italian family days. They have established a strong link with
the underclass in Sydney and they have carefully exploited their underdog
position.
The game was played in perfect conditions in front of a capacity crowd of
42,000. With just under two minutes to go to full-time, Canterbury led by
17-12. At the last, they succumbed to a try by the post and with the scores
level, the game went to over-time.
It was heart-in-the-mouth stuff and a replay seemed on the cards until
Canberra's Darryl Harrigan, a former New Zealand rugby union player,
squeezed in a drop goal late-on to take the game by one point.
All the talk - in South Africa, in Australia and in New Zealand - is about
how rugby union will go open. No-one, that is no one administrator or
player, has a blue-print that works beyond their own country.
In South Africa, the revenue from the provincial games runs into millions of
pounds. As a result, players are training five days a week and being
appropriately enriched for their full-time commitments. Nowhere else in the
world, except perhaps France, is this possible.
In Australia, Nick Farr-Jones, the captain of the 1991 Rugby World Cup
winners, suggested that the best solution for union, very much the poor
relation to League, was to: 'replicate the cricket scenario. We have grade
cricket, Sheffield Shield matches and internationals. The grade cricketer
gets nothing, the state cricketer receives appearance money and the
internationals are paid well.
'Rugby must do the same - club rugby doesn't have the support to pay
players; state and national rugby does. We must find a way to compensate the
players fairly for their efforts but l would advise against the players
giving up their day-job.'
Farr-Jones does not believe it would be wise for players just to play rugby
and not have some regular employment.
David Kirk, the All Black captain of the 1987 world cup winners, said in
Wellington, where he works as the adviser to the Prime-Minister, Jim Bolger:
'The change in emphasis in the game where players are seeking payment has
brought a greedier, less intelligent player into union.
'Too many of our current squad are unemployed or euphemistically employed by
unions or self-employed working somewhere in the so called sports business.'
Last Saturday, I watched quite the best game of rugby l have seen since the
All Backs demolished London at Twickenham a year ago, when I attended the
Auckland versus Otago match in New Zealand. The score, 46-30 to Auckland,
belies the quality of the skills on show. This was, I was told, how
Auckland, last season' champions, have been playing for three seasons and is
the legacy of a previous coach, John Hart.
I was fortunate to arrive in time fo the NZRFU Council's vote to decide on
who would coach the All Blacks for next year's world cup.
Laurie Mains, the incumbent, having lost an unprecedented four out of six
Tests this season was returned by 11 votes to eight. Poor John Hart was
defeated for a third time and will not stand again.
The debate about the 'coach' has dominated the news for three weeks and the
decision to re-appoint Mains became the lead story for the 1pm, 6pm and late
evening news programmes on all three TV networks.
That night, I saw a piece of graffiti: 'To win the world cup in '95, NZ
needs a coach not a Lawrie.' But do not write off New Zealand yet.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Outdoors: After the massacre, the narcissi - Gardening /
Some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely and see tangible
evidence of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Robin Lane Fox has some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely
and see tangible evidence of success
THIS weekend, it is time to plan the annual bulb massacre. During the past
30 years, I have sent hundreds of them to their death: tulips, anemones,
iris, muscari - and my latest victims, 200 ipheions, which were planted
lovingly on a warm October day last year and responded by sending up two
green shoots between the lot of them in March.
Gardeners like to forget the mass murders buried in their gardens because
hope springs eternal; if only the Triumph tulips would do the same. But I
want to share 35 years' experience of such things with those of you who
cannot confess to it or are starting out with high hopes, coloured
photographs and bulb catalogues which talk of naturalising.
This year is the tulips' 400th anniversary. I send my happy returns to the
family although, as individuals, I have seldom had one which has reached its
fifth birthday. But since tulips should not be planted until late October, I
will reserve a separate week for their birthday obituary.
How, though, do wise gardeners spend their money with better prospects of
success? My successes have always been narcissi. This year, the trade has
not found narcissi easy because many of the bulbs did not grow on well in a
year of peculiar weather.
I follow firm narcissus rules. I put the tall, hybrid varieties in grass,
chosing them to cover their widely differing seasons. I swear by the early
Icy Follies, followed by Barrett Browning and the late Pheasant's Eye. These
narcissi, with a white base to the flowers, persist better in grass than the
tempting all-white daffodils.
Order them in 25 kg bulk for country planting and do not economise by
starting with a few and seeing what happens. They grow almost everywhere,
but you should segregate the varieties in separate clumps because they
flower at different seasons. They look miserable if they open when their
neighbours have gone brown.
Small narcissi also are excellent and persist well, but the catalogues
mislead you by recommending them for naturalising. Why not? you might think;
after all, some of them grow wild on the Welsh borders or in the Yorkshire
dales?
The best method is to plant a few, see if they like you and allow them to
colonise. Vigour varies widely but you should start with some small,
experimental clumps of February Gold, Tete a Tete and the native Lent Lily.
They all flower early, allowing you to mow the grass much sooner in the
year.
I have known gardeners whose grass has been colonised by these strong
varieties after three years. If they start to spread, the best method is to
lift and divide them after flowering when they are still in leaf: they move
much better late in April, the season when no supplier can send them out.
We all buy dry bulbs which need to be planted quickly. Next year, there is
no particular merit in dead-heading them, but it really does help, after
flowering, to spray the leaves with liquid fertiliser once a fortnight.
Most of the small narcissi which I have not murdered are used in small
groups, in flower beds. They bloom early and the small leaves are
unobtrusive when they die. The prettiest, but not the cheapest, is Dove
Wings, although groups of a dozen bulbs go a long way.
Generally, you can make as much of an impact with small clumps, spaced well
down the length of the bed, rather than with an expensive total coverage.
February Gold is the strongest form of all (although it is not gold and does
not flower in February). Jack Snipe is almost as good and Peeping Tom also
has stamina.
Never try to naturalise jonquils in grass: they are better in dry ground
below a wall. The pure white forms are extremely pretty and we have had
sensational success with the pure white Thalia, planted to face due north at
the foot of Oxford's ancient city wall. It is supposed to prefer a warm,
sheltered place but it has spread by the hundred in this unlikely site.
Narcissi grow well on heavy soil but, in light gardens, I would choose
anemone Blanda as a carpet instead; its starry flowers open at ground level
in pink, white and blue (or simply blue, if you prefer). They arrive like
dry, black nuts from the suppliers and I have learned the trick to them.
Soak them for 24 hours in a bowl of cold water before planting, and do not
worry if you are not entirely sure which side of the corm should be
uppermost. Somehow, they right themselves.
They are excellent for the front of beds which will be semi-shaded when
leaves return to the trees but where they can open in the spring sunshine
meanwhile. They will often spread quite happily and the leaves are not a
bother.
Crocuses are harder to kill if you are not too experimental. Despite a few
triumphs, I have vowed to follow narcissus rules with this family, too.
Almost the only ones to go into grass will be the strong Dutch hybrids,
which persist if you do not mow them before the leaves have died away.
The whites and yellows are chosen easily, but the blues are more tricky
because the best-known are purple or striped annoyingly. My favourite is Sky
Blue - but squirrels and mice like all these crocuses, too, and I know of no
protection except the shotgun.
Small-flower crocuses usually dwindle in grass, except for the vigorous
Tommasinianus; this variety is the other great bet for a future carpet in
the lawn. Other small varieties include flowers which I might well choose to
take to my desert island: Blue Pearl and Cream Beauty are of unsurpassed
beauty and show great stamina along the front of flower beds out of season
or at the foot of hedges of roses. On open ground, they persist and
multiply, but grass is too much for them. The best multiplier of all in a
flower bed is the pale blue vernus Vanguard - not the cheapest, but much
your best hope of total cover.
Leave aconites alone in quantity. They are better bought in green leaf in
the spring and planted in small samples to see if they are happy. The same
is true of snowdrops, which few people establish from dry bulbs planted now.
Better bets for the bigger cheque-book are the milk-blue and white
chionodoxa Luciliae, which spreads rapidly, and the wonderfully early scilla
Spring Beauty, which makes clumps but is essential because it flowers so
early. Bluebells are a romantic menace and you probably want no more in your
life.
I would like to have ended on a positive note. For 20 years, my best early
spring bulb was the wonderful iris Histrioides Major, which flowers in a
brilliant blue at a height of 6in and resists any weather. I have never been
able to kill it, whereas its other small relations split into small bulbs
and dwindle after two years.
Now, the nurserymen have killed it instead. Its two main suppliers in
Holland allowed a virus simultaneously into their stock, and this admirable
bulb is now off the market.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Motoring: Citroen discovers a cure for the bends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Open most motoring magazines and you will see pictures of family-type cars
being cornered savagely, with the wheels on one side pushed up under the
body and hanging down on the other. Pity the photographer who has to make
head-on action shots of the latest Citroen Xantia Activa. They will look as
if the car were standing still.
However hard it is cornered, the Activa refuses to roll. If you look closely
at the tyres, you might see a tiny amount of side-wall distortion - but that
would be all.
The secret? The Activa has an electronically controlled roll limitation
system. As soon as the body inclines by half of one degree, sensors activate
a pair of hydraulic jacks. Working in conjunction with Citroen's unique
gas/hydraulic suspension, they keep the body as flat as it would be on a car
with no springs at all - without compromising ride comfort in any way.
Although Citroen is reluctant to admit it, the roll-stifling system makes it
possible to drive the Activa round bends faster than ever. 'That is up to
the driver,' the company says. 'We see it as a useful innovation that
improves handling and gives the driver greater control.' Quite so.
A few days ago, in the Massif Central, I swooped along curving mountain
roads in a Citroen Xantia Activa at speeds no sensible family man - or even
a company rep in a hurry - would contemplate. It remained undramatically
controllable. To drive it like this, however, is to miss the point of active
roll limitation.
At realistic speeds, the ride was even more tranquil than that of the normal
Xantia XVS turbo-diesel, which is my present personal transport. That is
because the absolute lack of body roll makes winding roads feel almost
straight, a fact passengers appreciate even more than drivers.
The Activa (effectively, the top XVS two-litre, 16-valve, petrol-engined
model) with its active anti-roll system, makes its debut at the Paris
Mondial de l'Automobile opening on October 6.
Active anti-roll suspension was previewed on Citroen concept cars at the
past two Paris motor shows, in 1990 and 1992. It will be featured at this
year's show on a startling, though practical, concept car called the Xanae
(call it Zan-eye-eh).
Citroen says the Xantia was designed from the outset to take active
anti-roll suspension, but there is no reason why the big XM should not be
adapted to have it, too.

FT  24 SEP 94 / As They Say In Europe: Does British philosophy exist? - Why
the death of intellectual Sir Karl Popper made news abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taking up from where we left off last week - the inadequate intellectual
agility of the English - we see the same phenomenon highlighted in an
important story this week. Sir Karl Popper died a week ago: he was,
according to the Nobel prizewinner, Sir Peter Medawar, the greatest
philosopher of science 'who has ever lived'. His work extended beyond that
area, but for the British his death was a matter largely for the obituary
pages. On the continent Popper's death was news.
Like most British intellectuals of his generation, Sir Karl was born in
Vienna in the first decade of the century. He left for New Zealand
initially, to avoid the Nazis. He was a member of the famous Vienna Circle
which gave logical positivism and the verification principle to an
unsuspecting world. To British journalists, the verification principle is a
tool employed by a ruthless management in any crackdown on expense claims.
To continentals the mere mention of such matters provides the occasion for a
flashy display of intellectual skills.
Few there would admit any deficiency in their acquaintance with the course
of 20th century philosophy. This was nowhere better illustrated than in
Vienna itself. Among the massive tributes paid to Popper, the article by Pia
Maria Plechl, a leading local columnist and luminary, in Die Presse, stood
out. She opened with an alleged quotation from the philosopher, which, in
one formulation, concerned a black man searching for a black hat in a black
cellar. A fruitless search might have led him to conclude, 'It's really not
there.' Popper had shown the world that the correct response was, 'Maybe
it's really not there.'
Maybe the commuter on the rush-hour tram from Grinzing understands this sort
of thing but it left me puzzled. Why does the man have to be black, for
example?
In Vienna, Popper mixed with the logical positivists. Another noted
philosopher, A J Ayer, when asked on television why he had ceased to be a
logical positivist, replied: 'Because it was all rubbish.'
This statement caused a sensation in the British philosophical community
which speculated for some years on its exact meaning.
In southern Europe television dominated many of the Popper-inspired stories.
The reporters there wisely kept to philosophies they could understand.
Sunday's La Stampa pretended it was really interested in Popper's seminal
work of 1945, The Open Society and its Enemies, but did not take long to get
round to his view that television was the real enemy of democracy and that
it encouraged violence among the young.
El Pais on Monday was so entranced with this topic that it left Popper to
its television critic, who, under the headline, 'Popper No' said he did not
like the man.
'I do not want the dogmatism of the anti-dogmatists, and I do not like those
who not only believe the US model is the least worst of all possible models
but usually believe it's the best.'
The writer went on to argue: 'The attribution of crime to television is a
matter for minor popular psychologists.'
But the adjacent listings showed Popper was right: la Ley de Los Angeles (LA
Law) jostled with bull-fighting and westerns for the attention of the
Spanish public that evening.
An editorial, entitled 'Popper's Hour', appeared on the front of the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In Paris, Liberation devoted a page and a
half to the great man - 'We lose Popper'. They both grandly noted how he had
been able to translate the principle of fallibilism from science to
philosophy. This roughly states that nothing can prove a theory to be
absolutely true, because something might come along that falsifies it, but
only one thing needs to go wrong for it to be proved false.
This is the philosophical version of Murphy's law and has certain compelling
qualities. But the fallibility principle must presumably apply to the theory
that watching television makes you violent. And equally to the theory that
watching television does not make you violent? (As you will gather, I did
not emerge from my philosophy finals covered with glory.)
It was probably the Frankfurter Allgemeine that produced the most impressive
testimony as to Popper's influence: 'He played a significant role in the
westernisation of the Federal Republic.'
This had happened because the former chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, had
discovered him early on and then helped push his Social Democratic Party
away from dogmatic Marxism.
I cannot believe that it is usual for the death of a philosopher to make
such an impact on European commentators. Nor that there has in recent years
been a such a man who has spoken from beyond the grave in so many voices.
And in so many languages, apart from English that is.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Outdoors: Why cats get the bird - Country View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that, in 1994 for the first time, magpies have moved into the top
ten garden birds will be greeted with cries of horror in some quarters.
The survey, carried out by almost 20,000 members of the Young Ornithologists
Club, shows an overall fall in the numbers of songbirds visiting our
gardens. No doubt there will be some who blame the magpie for the loss.
Certainly this fine bird, with its beautiful black and white plumage, tinged
with metallic green and blue, and its bold piratical manner, has done
extremely well during the past 30 years for its numbers have trebled.
On the other hand it has made a come-back from extreme scarcity and there
was a time when it was most unusual to spot a magpie as they were heavily
controlled by gamekeepers.
Even today, in areas with large shooting estates, it is a rare occurrence to
see one of these birds. But neither the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds nor the British Trust for Ornithology condemns the magpie.
In the poor habitats provided by some gardens, which offer little cover for
songbird nests, magpies can be devastating but, generally-speaking, their
bad reputation is unwarranted. Research shows that in rural areas an
increase in the number of magpies has been matched by an increase in
songbirds and even the recent YOC survey indicated that chaffinches and coal
tits were also moving up in the top ten.
The real reasons for the decline in our songbird population are much more
difficult to pin down and probably result from a complex mix rather than one
single determinant.
Blaming the magpie merely masks the real causes and diverts attention from a
proper investigation. Various explanations have been put forward including
the increased use of slug pellets.
One significant cause is likely to be the domestic cat, the population of
which, in Britain, now numbers around 8.5m. While the magpie empties a nest
by removing nestlings one at a time with a great deal of noise and distress,
it is generally taking nature's doomed surplus, the young of incautious or
incompetent parents, Often, the then wiser parent birds nest elsewhere and
successfully raise a second brood.
Cats, on the other hand, move silently by night and eliminate the parents,
leaving the chicks to perish and thwarting any chance of a second brood, a
much more devastating blow.
So rather than blame the magpie, why not contribute to The Cats Protection
League which works hard to persuade cat owners to have pets neutered? The
spaying of a single female could prevent thousands of unwanted kittens and
help many more garden birds to survive.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Motoring: Honda prepares to take on Europe's best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the latest Honda Civic, designed and developed in Britain and
Germany for European markets and about to go into production at Swindon,
Wiltshire, writes Stuart Marshall.
It will be unveiled in Paris in two weeks and will put Honda into contention
with Europe's mainstream car-makers.
At prices between Pounds 11,000 and Pounds 14,000, the Civic will compete
with up-market versions of cars like the Ford Escort, Opel/Vauxhall Astra,
Peugeot 306 and Volkswagen Golf.
All Civics are fitted with power steering, and the top models have enough
wood veneer interior trim to make former Jaguar owners feel at home.
Four engines - of 1.4 and 1.6-litre capacity - will be offered, two of them
with Honda's exclusive VTEC variable valve timing.
Every Civic will have twin air-bags - a first in this class of car,
according to the Honda company. Automatic transmission and air-conditioning
will be extras, although priced reasonably.
Sales start next month. A new, Civic-based Rover 200 will be launched early
in 1995.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Along the trail of the trappers - On Safari /
Michael J. Woods sails and canoes up the rivers and coast of Labrador
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The minke whale was heading west. Marine Atlantic's ship Northern Ranger was
going east. We passed each other near Black Island at the mouth of the
Churchill River on the coast of Labrador, each going about our business with
single-minded concentration. The whale was pushing purposefully through the
water and rising to breathe with a minimum of effort. I saw it only twice
and then it was gone.
The Northern Ranger had just called at Rigolet to discharge cargo and take
on passengers. Now, just after 6am, the sea ahead was like silk - grey,
glinting, smooth. The ship tore it apart and left it in shreds and tatters
astern.
Labradoreans rely on water - lakes, rivers or sea, liquid or frozen - to get
about. Labrador has plenty of wilderness and few roads, fewer of them are
surfaced. The trans-Labrador highway slashes across the widest part, a bumpy
350 miles from Labrador City to Goose Bay, and that is about it. To reach
any of the coastal settlements you must take the coastal steamer in summer
or drive a snow-mobile over the ice in winter. Or you can fly.
Heavy loads come by boat. The forward hold of the Northern Ranger contained
snow-mobiles, all-terrain vehicles, bundles of timber, great bags of sand
and gravel, a three-piece suite, a kitchen and various domestic items. We
passengers travelled behind. My roomy cabin had the widest bunk I have ever
slept in.
A favourite way to see the coast is to take a two-week return trip from the
base at Lewisporte. Recognising this leisure use of their boats, Marine
Atlantic, asked Labrador Scenic to provide a guide and a full itinerary for
their holidaying guests. I joined at Goose Bay, a settlement founded around
an airbase.
From here we were taken in small boats across the Churchill to Mud Lake, the
unalluring name of an attractive little village beside the lake. Narrow
paths through tall grasses and groves of pink willowherb led from one
colourful clapboard house to another. Huskies, in summer retirement, barked
from their moorings in the surrounding woods and chortling children played
by the river.
We rejoined the Northern Ranger just before dark and at 10pm. She coiled her
ropes aboard and we steamed away towards the north. As we went, the scenery
changed. Trees became more infrequent and bare bed-rock, ground down and
smoothed by millennia of ice, increased. Icebergs hovered on the horizon.
We received word that three polar bears had been seen on the previous day on
Quaker's Hat, an island noted for its thousands of breeding sea birds.
Crowds hung over the rails as the ship drew near but the bears had gone. The
ship hooted loud and long as we passed and the sky filled with anxious sea
birds.
At each settlement the ship became lighter as the hold emptied. This gave
time for the passengers to look around although, although for some, it was
never quite enough. Twice the ship had to return and pick up a lonely figure
waving forlornly from the pier.
Nain is the most northerly settlement on the coast and the turning point for
the ship. After a tour of the town's sandy streets to see its sports hall,
television station, fish plant and Moravian church, I walked up the hill
behind. A short steep climb gave me a view north over wave after wave of
inlets and islands much like those we had already passed.
The thousands of miles of apparently empty countryside are home to bears and
wolves and the largest caribou herd in the world. These animals, together
with smaller fry such as foxes and martens, were the quarry of trappers and
hunters who would spend all winter amassing meat and skins. After more than
six months away from home in the toughest conditions - the temperature often
hit 40 below - they would load their Canadian canoes to the gunwales and
paddle home with the spring thaw to wives wondering anxiously if they had
survived.
Joe Goudie comes from such a family, his father and his uncle were trappers
and Joe still has hunting in his blood along with a dash of Welsh, Scottish
and Cree Indian. One time MP and now Native Liaison Officer for Canada's
National Defence, Joe also leads canoe safaris down the Churchill River.
After a night in a log cabin set in open spruce woods, we put the boat in
the water, loaded it with tent, wood-burning stove, food, axe and saw and
paddled away. The river was flowing quite swiftly especially in the early
part of the journey where the water was most exciting although never
dangerous. After that it was easy paddling and we passed gently through the
wilderness.
We kept our eyes open for moose and bear, drifted up to great northern
divers and Canada geese and watched ospreys patrol overhead. The river
widened into lakes and then closed around us again, dark walls of spruce and
fir lightened by the brighter green of willow, alder and white trunked
poplar by the waterside.
On one high bank the trees were tipped at crazy angles, their bark torn from
their trunks. This was the work of ice, said Joe, carried down on a river
vastly swollen by the thaw and shredding any obstacle in its path.
Distant spruce trees marked the site of our camp, their dark knobbly tops
looking like the spires of a medieval cathedral. We pulled out on to a sandy
beach from where we watched the sunset as we ate salmon and trapper's bread.
Only the black flies, which plagued us briefly as an evening calm descended,
marred an otherwise perfect spot.
A side trip up a stream to visit a beaver lodge left only a couple of hours
paddling before the end of our voyage just above Muskrat Falls. Here the
twisting, coiling water of the river was transformed into a roaring fury of
foam. Joe picked up the 70lb canoe, swung it easily on to his shoulders, and
carried it up the steep path which marked the portage route the trappers
used to avoid the falls. To them it was just a brief interruption in their
long journey along this river road.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Under the idyllic volcano - On Safari
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, Nevis is one of the smaller
islands. It is sister island to St Kitts. Nevis is very much the little
sister, a village of an island, 9,000 people clustered around a dormant
volcano with the sea lapping at their feet, writes Michael J. Woods.
Nevis is in the group known as the Leeward Islands, which seems to mean
little for the wind blows constantly, especially up in the hills, and keeps
the humidity at comfortable levels: the perfect climate for the active, I
thought, for I am a restless soul and cannot be doing with endless days on
the beach.
Like many of its neighbours, Nevis has a history of sugar plantations dating
from the 17th century. The remains of some of the sugar estates are still
being found. I visited several in the company of a local guide, David
Rollinson. Each had a windmill built like a nuclear silo to withstand the
battering of hurricanes and the agitation of earthquakes - the price to be
paid for living on an otherwise perfect island.
Jim Johnson, another guide, led me to a sugar mill ruin he had only recently
discovered, buried in a secondary growth of jungle. The remains of the
private chapel were almost filled with living pillars of weeping fig stems.
The weeping fig is a fast-growing and prolific tree, and there is a great
spreading example at the entrance to Montpelier Plantation Inn which was my
home for the week. It casts dense shade over the front of the main building,
once part of a sugar factory. The great house no longer exists but is
notable for being the place where Nelson married Frances Nisbet in 1787.
The Montpelier is perfectly located on a saddle on the lower slopes of
Nevis' volcano. It has such a relaxing atmosphere that I could feel my
resolution to be active seeping away as each day passed.
Like many similar islands, Nevis has suffered from the damage caused by
imported mammals. Goats, sheep, pigs and donkeys do little for the
indigenous flora while mongooses, and the rats they were brought in to
control, have eliminated the native agoutis, iguanas and edible frogs.
While the bird life is limited, there were enough fish to satisfy anyone. To
see them, Julian Rigby took me in his boat across the two-mile strait to St
Kitts.
Fish, mainly small and in electric blues and yellows, played and fed among
the coral and sea fans. Occasionally I would glimpse something more subtle,
a flat fish rippling beneath the sand, for instance. Sometimes it was more
sinister: when five larger, almost circular fish, in silver edged with blue,
swam through in line astern, every inhabitant of this underwater world fled.
St Kitts was also the location of my most active exploit of the week,
climbing Mount Liamuiga. This is St Kitts' volcano, 3,700ft high and topped
with cloud forest. The route we followed was carved out of the mountain-side
through the rain forest by slaves in 1690. Greg Pereira drove us in his
Landrover through steep cane fields to the edge of the forest where we
stopped for a picnic breakfast. We were already promisingly high. From here
he pointed to our destination on the crater rim, 1,000ft below the summit
proper.
The forest was cool and delightful, full of tree ferns and palms. Some tall
trees had buttress roots and others had been overtaken by strangler figs,
while the ground was green with soft club moss. The path steepened until, at
times, we were climbing ladders of roots. But the views both over the island
and down into the forested crater, with its occasional sulphur-fringed
fumeroles, were worth the climb.
On my last day I went to find Nevis' water source, up a track spiralling
around the mountain. But, after an hour or so, the attraction began to fade
and I found visions of a cool dip and a leisurely lunch by the pool at the
Montpelier floating into my mind.
The sun seemed to get hotter and the hills became increasingly steep. I
never did reach that spring.
Michael Woods was a guest of Montpelier Plantation Inn, PO Box 474, Nevis,
West Indies, (tel: 809-4693462). His visit was arranged by Caribbean
Connection (UK tel: 0244-341131), whose prices for seven nights at
Montpelier start at Pounds 946 per person, including flights and breakfast.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Afloat in the deep jungle - On Safari

I was alone, paddling a small dug-out canoe through flooded rainforest. The
boat was borrowed, the paddle my own, traded with the Jagua Indians for
valued T-shirts, and the forest was immense, writes Michael J.  Woods.
The low afternoon sun penetrated the riverine trees, illuminating trunks
whitened by lichens and the greens of thin palm fronds and huge leaved
epiphytes. These, in turn, were reflected in the Amazon's motionless waters
which, in spite of a patina of dust, leaves and twigs, formed a perfect
reverse image.
A ringed kingfisher flew across the water, a large bird with chestnut belly,
white collar and determined manner, while a crimson crested woodpecker, in
black with a red cap, pecked delicately at a dead stump.
The Amazon near Iquitos in Peru, still 1,200 miles from the sea and normally
five miles across, was flooded to almost twice its width. Banana fields were
submerged, the houses, all on stilts, stood just above the flood, and water
lapped deep into the forest.
From Iquitos, a small town of crumbling facades, rusty corrugated iron and
an atmosphere redolent of Greene and Conrad, we motored downstream to the
Explorama Camp in a long narrow boat thatched against sun and rain.
This was the first of three camps I visited, all designed in fundamentally
the same simple and unobtrusive way with bedroom blocks linked by covered
walkways to showers, toilets and communal areas festooned with hammocks.
There is no electricity, little plumbing and the limited privacy in the
bedrooms, which are designed to encourage a flow of air. The locations are
perfect, the food good and the beds comfortable and well-netted to prevent
mosquitoes 'singing a private song in your ear', as Julio Parano, our
Peruvian Indian guide so aptly put it.
Visiting at a time of high water had its advantages, for though the jungle
walks were curtailed, we made up for that with river cruises in open boat.
The rivers, twisting, caramel-coloured and soupy with silt, are the highways
of the rainforest. There is constant traffic ranging from overloaded banana
boats labouring upstream to the quick canoes of children which, on school
days, line the shore by the schools.
Parano, now a conservationist and guide, was raised as a hunter in the
jungle and has senses appropriately honed. From the water his keen eyes
spotted greenish coloured three-toed sloths clinging motionless to bankside
foliage; he pointed out a bushy-tailed squirrel which scampered high into
the tree tops; and once, identifying a pygmy marmoset by its squall, scoured
the vegetation with his binoculars until he located its tiny form.
Swallow-tailed kites wheeled above the trees, egrets hunted the shallows and
parrots screeched past on whirring wings.
One afternoon Julio took us in search of the hoatzin (pronounced watson), a
noisy chicken-sized bird of some scarcity living on a lake in the centre of
a forested island. High water had joined the pool to the river but, our long
boat was too big to penetrate the trees.
Unperturbed, Julio intercepted a local lad who was paddling past and hired
him to carry us in pairs in his canoe, weaving deftly through the trunks, to
spot several hoatzins as they squawked to one another in the twilight.
Life with Julio was never dull. Unannounced, we would pull into villages to
see what was going on. We were invited into houses to watch the cooking of
manioc and the salting of fish; we weaved thatch, paddled canoes and joined
local men in netting fish.
Holding the heavy folds of the net in hands and teeth with a loop over one
elbow, we whirled it outwards to open like a parachute, theoretically
hitting the water in a circle and sliding through the surface to trap fish
in its mesh bell. Although in practice the circle was often far from
perfect, the fish were so numerous that every cast was a success.
Everything in the rainforest seems to have grown to excessive size. Lily
pads were like tea trays, insects as big as mice, butterflies the size of
bats and bats as large as crows.
But for a habitat as rich and varied as this, there is surprisingly little
to see at ground level, for most of life goes on in the tree-tops.
Fortunately, the Amazon Centre for Environmental Education and Research
offers an opportunity, unique in South America, to wander around the canopy
more than 100ft above the ground on a series of swooping suspension bridges.
As I looked down, the jungle hummed and whined like a very bad international
telephone line, interrupted periodically by pings and buzzes, yelps and
yaps, while at my feet stretched a billowing carpet of leaves in every
imaginable shade of green, from the palest celery to the blackest spring
cabbage.
Brightly-coloured birds stood out from its surface - azure-spangled
cotingas, golden woodpeckers, green honeycreepers and red-throated
caracaras. I watched a centipede make its sinuous way over the crevasses of
bark and wondered idly if this was a species previously known to man.
After the still, dark, humid oppression of the forest floor, the canopy
walkway supplied a breath of fresh air. But the best moments were on the
river as day broke.
The soft light of dawn cast everything in a greeny-grey shade, a veil of
mist shrouded the tree-tops and their perfect reflections wrinkled in our
wake. Fishermen cast their nets with gentle splashes and blue-grey woodsmoke
rose from rekindled fires. Apart from the quiet calls of children in their
red cedar canoes, the only other sound was the dripping of water from
up-raised paddles as we glided slowly through the Amazon jungle.

Far below me among the grey, wave-worn rocks of the inhospitable shore were
the tiny white forms of young seals. They appeared lifeless: their puny
bodies must surely have been shattered by the tumultuous ocean as it beat
upon the island and flung them among the hard stones.
However, through binoculars I could see an occasional movement. I also
spotted several of the rocks shifting, too, for some of the 'rocks' were
adult grey seals. They had come to give birth on this nursery beach and now
some of the mothers were suckling pups.
Giving birth in the grey seal world is closely followed by mating, for it is
the one time in the year that bulls can find groups of cows gathered
together. From my cliff-top vantage point I had an excellent view of the
action as males skirmished with males, bulls pursued cows and mothers
protected pups.
These dramas were unfolding in the Shetland Isles, the archipelago of about
100 islands which makes up the most northerly point of Britain. As close to
Bergen in Norway as to Aberdeen. The Shetlands are inhabited by a people
whose musical tongue seems to owe as much to Norwegian as it does to English
and who are the first to acknowledge their strong links with Scandinavia.
Including Mainland, there are five notable islands in this wind-swept but
mild northern outpost, and each appears to have a wildlife speciality of its
own.
The northernmost island is Unst. The Burra Firth forms a deep cleft in its
north coast and on one side of this fjord is Hermaness national nature
reserve, the spring-time breeding site for thousands of sea birds. Of these,
the most sensational are the gannets: goose-sized birds which fish by
plunging into the ocean from a considerable height.
I watched them hunting for over an hour as bird after bird folded its wings
back against its body and plummeted like an arrow deep into the water. Both
great and arctic skuas nest here, too. Unmerciful pirates, they will harry
the other birds until they disgorge the fish they have caught.
Fetlar is the smallest of the main islands. With fewer than 100 people, it
struggles constantly to maintain its human population, though matters are
reversed in the summer when bird-watchers arrive because of two rare
visitors.
Beautiful snowy owls nested here for a number of years until 1975. The
females of these white, amber-eyed birds still return each summer, though
sadly not to breed. Seventy per cent of the British population of red-necked
phalaropes, a small swimming wader, breed on Fetlar. The Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds has a large reserve and a public viewing hide.
Yell, with its high heather moorland and convoluted shoreline, is reputedly
the otter island of Shetland, although I caught sight of otters on all the
islands apart from Fair Isle. Shetland is home to around 1,000 otters - one
of the densest populations in western Europe.
Otters turn up in the sheltered voes or fjords around Yell's coast. I
watched one animal playing exuberantly in the wake of my ferry. Those who
are patient should have good views of these lovely mammals as they swim and
dive or feed along the shore.
Mainland is the largest of the islands. Its southern-most point hit the
headlines in January 1993 when the oil tanker MV Braer went aground
releasing 84,000 tonnes of crude into the sea. The effect on Shetland and
its wildlife appears to have been slight, and there are still big sea-bird
colonies on the cliffs of Sumburgh Head.
Much of Shetland's coastline consists of dramatic cliffs, some of the finest
are on the west coast at Westerwick. These are good spots to watch for
cetaceans. Killer and pilot whales have been seen from here and several
species of dolphin occur around Shetland. It is said that the Good Shepherd,
Fair Isle's boat, encounters dolphins on almost half its summer voyages.
Spring and early summer are the best times to catch the large colonies of
nesting sea birds but autumn can be good for other reasons. It is the time
when migrants, flying south from the Arctic Circle, pass through. October is
when grey seals pup and mate and there is much seal activity in many hidden
coves and caves.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (9): A tour of the towers -
Heritage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Which came first, the tower or the church? This is a conundrum that has
taken Bill Goode up many a church tower.
Goode, an 81-year-old retired pork butcher, has ascended and measured all
but a handful of Britain's round church towers and can usually tell whether
a particular tower is Saxon, Norman, or a later rebuild.
He is also the founder of that splendid example of the British love of
obscure but worthy causes, the Round Tower Churches Society, which comes of
age this month.
To celebrate the event, the society has published a new edition of Goode's
guide to all the round-tower churches in the country.
Goode became interested in churches at the age of 52. He was looking for
something to photograph with his new camera and when he chose the
round-towered churches of the Waveney valley, inland from his native
Lowestoft, Suffolk, he realised what a poor condition many of them were in.
Eight years later he turned his enthusiasm into a national society, with a
membership that has just topped 400. In the intervening years it has raised
several thousand pounds which has been dispensed as grants to help restore
the round-tower churches that give their name to the society.
There are 175 complete round-towered churches in England, and a handful of
others in a ruinous state. Goode and his fellow enthusiasts aim to make sure
no more are allowed to deteriorate, by raising funds and creating interest
in these remarkable buildings.
Preventing others falling into ruin is an uphill task. Of the 162
round-towered churches in Norfolk and Suffolk, most are in isolated hamlets,
or even sitting alone in fields at the site of a former settlement. Of the
remaining 13 round-towered churches, six are in Essex, two in
Cambridgeshire, three in Sussex and two in Berkshire.
These church towers are round, and are found in only these six counties,
because they are areas in which the stone was not good enough to build
corners. The faithful had to gather flints and puddingstone, a dark iron
conglomerate from the surface of the fields, to build their churches.
Some are very low (the average height is 35-40ft), others a little higher
and built in clearly-visible 10ft 'bands', which are the result of the short
building season between Easter and Michaelmas in which mortar was able to
set in frost-free conditions.
By examining the tower in detail - and Goode has ascended and measured all
but a handful of the round towers - he can usually tell its age and origin.
His conclusion is that 90 per cent of the East Anglian round-towered
churches were built before 1066, with some of the churches dating back to
800. The towers themselves tend to be a little later, he says, because in
most cases they were added to the churches.
'People often think the tower came first because it often looks older than
the adjoining church. But what I believe is that the Saxons built a church
of flints and rubblestone - in many cases to replace an earlier wooden
church - and then added a round tower,' says Goode.
'In later centuries the faithful would reface the church with superior
knapped flints and update the earlier buildings using superior dressed
stone. But if the tower was sound they would leave it.'
Round Tower Churches of South-East England by W E Goode is available from C
P Marchant, 4 Finchley Court, West End Street, Norwich NR2 4ET. Price to
non-members is Pounds 24 hardback (plus Pounds 2 post and packing), or
Pounds 15 paperback (plus Pounds 1.50 p+p). Details of the society from E M
Stilgoe, Crabbe Hall, Burnham Market, King's Lynn, Norfolk PE31 8EN.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (7): Free house even if a pub
won't pay - Gerald Cadogan looks at the economics of buying an inn and finds
that even those that lose money can be good buys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

<TEXT>
'If I were buying a pub again', says Tony Hackett, landlord of the
Bartholomew Arms in the Northamptonshire village of Blakesley, and a
licensee for 35 years, 'I'd start by visiting other pubs around - before I
went to the one I was interested in - just to see how much beer was being
drunk in the area. If they're clean and bright but empty, it means no
trade.'
A rural pub needs a village of 500-600 people to be viable. Most of these
need to live near enough to walk or roll home. Blakesley, says Hackett, is
alright, but 'Maidford's never been a drinking village.'
The trade is not what it was, Hackett says. Gone are the days when licensees
wore their best suits for the Brewster Sessions in February (when licences
are renewed). The magistrates would have a report in front of them from the
watch committee on what needed repairing and a man turned up from the
brewery with a big book to note it all down.
'Sometimes, the beaks went round to check for themselves. Nowadays licensees
come in T-shirts and jeans. I stopped going seven or eight years ago,' he
says.
His life has been in Northamptonshire pubs. One he took in 1962 cost Pounds
126 for the fittings, fixtures and stock, and had a rent of Pounds 16.
'An old couple had had it. It was very run down.'
But he built it up and soon it was the only pub in the county, outside
Northampton, to have tanks fitted because the cellar did not have enough
room for the increased amount of beer he needed.
Pubs divide into the traditional and the gimmicky. Hackett has no tolerance
for the gimmicky. 'They are only good 'til the pub down the road comes up
with a better gimmick.'
That explains why many publicans are in and out of the trade in two or three
years. Theme pubs have a shifting population.
'There is no allegiance. At gimmicky pubs with youngsters you must be
prepared once or twice a week to get your head thumped.'
For food, he says, stick with what a pub does best, and remember that it is
not an expensive restaurant and should not compete with one.
'A good ham, egg and chips is far better to offer than coq au vin,' even if
the husband has qualified in catering and the wife fancies herself as a
cook.
Hackett also believes pubs should concentrate on creating the atmosphere of
a welcoming family pub at the centre of village life to improve business. If
there is an unruly element, 'get rid of it straightaway,' he says. The
police 'take the attitude that you took the troublemakers' money helping
them to get drunk. So you sort it out yourself.'
Hackett stocks two traditional beers - 'real ale' - and three keg beers.
Drinkers stick to one beer. 'A Phipps man didn't dream of drinking a Charles
Wells.' This made problems for the darts teams when players refused to go to
some pubs. Therefore, says Hackett, a large choice of traditionals has
little point as they must be kept well and sold quickly, or they go off.
The drink-driving laws are not really a problem. People have adapted. One
person drives, often the wife, if they cannot walk home.
You can become a publican as a tenant, or manager or owner.
Breweries are disposing of tied houses and there are some repossessions in
the market, although far fewer than a year ago. So there is a range of free
houses available. The choice, says Paul Reilly, west country manager of
specialist licensed agents, Business Sales Group, is whether to take a run
down pub cheaply, trade up and move somewhere else in a few years, or buy a
sound business.
Buyers need to decide on their aims, and how they want to live and - most
importantly - how strong their marriage is, before they start looking. How
long will they stay? Can they improve it? Does it have outline planning
permission for an extension? Banks are more likely now to lend, says Reilly,
and the brewers will help free houses with loans.
Pub sellers achieve best prices if they have good trading accounts,
preferably for three years, and the house is is in good order.
'If it needs a new carpet, do it before you put it it on the market,' says
Reilly. The usual price is about one and a half times turnover net of VAT.
An alternative guide is how many barrels it sells. If the pub sells less
than five barrels a week, it is not viable. Five barrels a week is about 250
a year, which can be capitalised at Pounds 500 a barrel - or a price of
Pounds 125,000. So, occasionally, with a low-turnover pub, the bricks and
mortar may prove more valuable than the business.
A pub like this could sell at prices far below comparable houses - or
cottages - that are not pubs, although sometimes VAT is added to the
purchase price.
In tenanted pubs a typical rent is Pounds 38 a barrel. Managers, of course,
do not put up their own money but normally have a share of the profits as
well as their salary.
Although the beer is the prime commodity, the publican's income comes less
now from the 'wet trade'. The ratio used to be 80 per cent wet, and 20 per
cent from food; but now the food may be 40 or 50 per cent of turnover.
Gaming machines, known as AWP (amusement with profit) machines, are another
source of income. The publican normally receives half the take.
Even so if, if a publican cannot sell beer, other income will not keep a pub
afloat.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: On Safari - Come on safari with me, says Michael J.
Woods, who likes to go in search of the simple bear necessities of life,
from Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks in the US, to the Arctic, Italy
and all of Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The black bear waddled across the forest road. He was a rotund bear, ready
for his winter sleep. Under his thick, dark coat, rolls of fat shimmied as
he walked.
He moved unhurriedly through the trees for he was a smug, snug bear. Before
long he would be dropping off in his den, leaving the woods, still aflame
with their fading red and golden foliage, and waking to bursting buds and
bird song.
He was my very first bear after a quest which I had pursued for years. And
he had turned up in a totally unexpected location, just three miles from a
large shopping complex in New Hampshire.
My search for bears had taken me to Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks
in the US, to the Canadian Arctic, to Spitsbergen and to Italy's Abbruzzo
national park. In some of these places bears were rare, in others they
merely avoided me, but I was never disappointed: other wildlife more than
made up for their absence.
A British Airways Holidays fly-drive trip took me to both Yellowstone and to
Yosemite. In Yellowstone I had excellent views of large buffalo herds, of
elk, white-tailed deer, moose, coyote and a whole regiment of squirrels and
chipmunks, as well as a magnificent range of thermal effects, including Old
Faithful.
Yosemite was equally exciting. Although the wildlife was not as prevalent,
it was very tolerant of people.
Furthermore, Yosemite has beautiful landscapes, a wonderful variety of
massive granite domes and more record-breaking waterfalls in a small area
than anywhere in the world.
I came close to seeing polar bears in the Arctic when, travelling over the
sea ice around Baffin Island with several Eskimo, we came across the bloody
remains of a seal and great flat-footed tracks padding away through the
snow. Again, the area had much to offer, from nesting guillemots and
restless old squaw ducks to gyr falcons and even, lying unblinking among the
lichens of the newly-exposed spring tundra, a human skull.
Spitsbergen, or Svarlbad, is a Norwegian archipelago which lies well within
the Arctic circle to the north of Norway. In the winter it is ice-locked, so
I went there in the summer with NSR Travel to join a ship called Polar Star
and cruise around the islands. We watched reindeer among the ruins of old
polar explorers' camps, admired walruses on ice floes and enjoyed dolphins
playing under our bows.
Italiatour took me to Abbruzzo national park where a few European brown
bears still survive just 100 miles from Rome. Although I searched for almost
a week, they eluded me. But walking in the mountains I had my best-ever
views of chamois and enjoyed the masses of spring flowers of this
surprisingly empty area.
Koalas, of course, are not strictly bears, so perhaps that is why I found
them easy to see, especially on Kangaroo Island, off southern Australia, a
paradise for those keen on wildlife. This is the third biggest Australian
island, and has a large breeding colony of sea lions; visitors to their
beach can get within yards of mothers with pups, as well as bulls.
All along the coast are nesting sea eagles and ospreys, while a range of
waterbirds lives in the billabongs. Craig Wickham, who runs safaris on the
island, also takes clients looking for echidnas and possums at night.
New Zealand has no bears. Indeed, it had only two mammals of its own. Then
man introduced some more which promptly set about destroying the native
lizards and ground-nesting birds. The Department of Conservation, anxious to
save the country's native wildlife, has removed introduced mammals from the
island of Tiritiri-Matangi in Hauraki Gulf maritime park.
Visitors can see projects for reafforestation and for the reintroduction of
native birds such as kiwis and takahes, as well as a number of other
endangered species. Similar proposals are in hand for other islands in this
Park.
There are no bears in Antarctica, either, but if you want to see wildlife at
close quarters in a wilderness of beauty on an unimaginable scale, then the
Antarctic is hard to beat. A cruise ship like the World Discoverer will drop
you among bustling penguins in noisy, chaotic colonies hundreds of thousands
strong.
You can drift in dinghies past lounging crab-eater seals, menacing leopard
seals and ill-tempered elephant seals, and watch whales under your very
nose.
A notable bird of the Southern Ocean is the wandering albatross, one of the
world's largest birds, with a wing-span of almost 12ft. Among the smallest
are humming birds. Many are found in the Caribbean and 13 species can be
seen at Trinidad's Asa Wright nature centre.
Although generally considered elusive, Britain's mammals, which no longer
include bears, can be surprisingly easy to see. During the autumn rut the
three largest deer species - fallow, sika and red - are at their most
striking. As they are preoccupied with securing mates, they are both
dramatic to watch and often unguarded.
The Scottish highlands, Exmoor, the New Forest or any one of the deer parks
throughout Britain should be fruitful places to visit.
For more information mammals, a useful booklet, Where To Watch Mammals, is
published by the Mammal Society. There are numerous wildlife holidays
available in Britain, and some of the best are run by universities such as
Exeter, Nottingham and Bristol, and by the Field Studies Council.
None, however, includes bears. It will be a long time before I experience
another wildlife sighting as exciting as my black bear in New Hampshire, US.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: African walkabout - On Safari / Travelling on foot
is just one of many ways of seeing the bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The deep rumble made by one elephant talking to another is a sound which,
once heard, is impossible to forget. I had come across it before, sitting on
a high bank above the River Ruaha in Tanzania and looking down on an
extended family group of elephants at sunset.
Lit by the fiery orange of the last light of the day, they drank and
browsed, played and greeted one another, totally relaxed and at peace. I had
even had the privilege of feeling it during an elephant back safari in the
Okavango Delta, for that rumble sends the whole body of the elephant
quaking.
But the biggest surprise came during a walk in Zambia when the same rumble
reached me unexpectedly from just the other side of a dense thicket. We left
the termite mound we were inspecting and withdrew quietly and quickly,
keeping the elephants upwind and leaving them to their own devices.
African safari companies are becoming increasingly bold and imaginative in
the methods by which they encourage their clients to come close to wildlife
and to appreciate their surroundings, rather than simply to concentrate on
seeing and photographing the large or dangerous mammals. The use of open
vehicles with a thin canopy and neither sides nor doors in southern Africa
is a world away from the enclosed mini-buses employed in east Africa but an
even more significant step forward, literally, is a walking safari.
At first, forsaking a vehicle in the bush feels about as crazy as abandoning
a life raft in the open sea. But there is no doubt that walking is one of
the most exciting ways of enjoying the bush.
You may not come away with the greatest photographs of larger animals,
because they tend to be more wary of people on foot, but your appreciation
of the smells, the space and simply the feel of the place will remain in the
memory.
Zambia has long been considered Africa's walking mecca, for this activity
has been a major feature of safaris here for many years (try Twickers
World). But the walking opportunities in other countries are growing rapidly
as governments alter park rules to permit them and as safari guides gear
themselves up to this new discipline.
Richard Bonham (booked through Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions) guides
walks in the Selous Game Reserve in southern Tanzania and it is possible
that this opportunity will be extended to other parks in that country
especially now that a regular air charter has been established - contact
Wildlife Safari. Good walking is also available in Botswana, Zimbabwe and
South Africa. Safari Consultants and Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris are among
others who offer this opportunity.
Alternatives to walking, which avoidmotors, are also growing in popularity.
Horse-riding safaris, mainly for those who ride regularly, are available in
Botswana, Kenya and South Africa. (Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris). You do not have
to be a regular elephant rider to enjoy an elephant back safari in
Botswana's Okavango Delta, though, and this experience, offered by Ker and
Downey, enables visitors to experience the joys of travelling through the
Delta aboard the mammalian equivalent of an all-terrain bus.
There are new opportunities to watch gorillas in Uganda which has seen a
regeneration of its tourist industry. Not only does it have gorillas,
together with a range of other primates, but some of the most picturesque
national parks in Africa and good walking in the Ruwenzori Mountains. Try
Abercrombie and Kent, Twickers World and African Explorations.
And then there are the opportunities available in the new South Africa. By
the increasingly exacting standards of Western Europe, some safaris on offer
here are quite dated. If you are looking for a single night in an
air-conditioned safari camp, with game drives evening and morning during
which you might experience, as I did, radio-linked drivers relentlessly
pursuing the Big Five in order to provide you with a certificate and a free
T-shirt, then Mala Mala is for you (Rattray Reserves).
If, on the other hand, you are looking for rather more from your African
experience - starlit nights in the bush, peaceful and unobtrusive game
drives - and a good guide then you are probably looking for a tailor-made
itinerary offered by many of the smaller operators such as African
Explorations, Art of Travel and Safari Consultants.
But what South Africa does offer, in greater measure than probably any other
African country, is the chance of independent travel. With its excellent
infra-structure, accommodation and services and with its amazingly rich
variety of landscapes and wildlife, it is well worth investigating. Namibia,
just over the border, is also an exciting destination for the independent
traveller. Try Sunvil for a fly-drive and assistance with an itinerary.
For the more rugged, Safari Drive will provide a fully equipped Land Rover,
complete with all camping equipment including a tent pitched on the
roofrack, to enable you to travel through Botswana and Zimbabwe on roads
suitable only for four-wheel drive vehicles.
If independent travel is not for you, but you are looking for something
special, there is a growing list of safari operators, such as Abercrombie &amp;
Kent and Safari Consultants, who have wildlife tours led by specialists from
Britain and Africa.
Other safaris include those concentrating on photography or ornithology (try
Hartley's Safaris) while Art of Travel provides the chance to take a
painting and drawing and even a wildlife writing safari.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (5): Chalets for those who
like Alps without snow - Audrey Powell explores resorts in France and
Switzerland finds that properties by the slopes often sell to people who do
not ski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is common knowledge that a large number of people who buy homes on golf
courses do not play golf. It also appears that many people who buy homes in
Swiss ski resorts never ski.
'Your average client for an upper price property is 50 or over. He has made
his fortune and comes to the mountains to relax. He likes the peace and
quiet, the civilised way he is treated. He likes to look at the view and go
walking. To him skiing is totally irrelevant,' said a developer in
Switzerland.
'He (and it usually is a he) does not want a lot of bedrooms. He has guests
but puts them up in the local hotel. These are the kind of people who are
able to pay Pounds 200,000 upwards for a ski-resort home. Not the yuppies.
They go on package holidays or rent somebody else's chalet.'
His remarks are a reaction to a report by Mintel Leisure intelligence which
argues that the British Education Reform Act, which discouraged ski trips in
school time, will, in the long term, reduce the appetite for skiing among
British adults. The number of children going on school skiing holidays has
fallen from 200,000 in 1990 to 60,000 in 1991/1992.
Already, Mintel says, the mass market for skiing holidays has dropped
sharply and only real enthusiasts have continued to ski.
But if the developer is correct these trends may not affect the already
slender British demand for ski-resort property.
A London agency which specialises in selling Swiss resort property, David de
Lara &amp; Partners, also notes a lack of commitment to the sport among buyers.
The people who purchased his chalets or apartments were interested in summer
activities.
'Skiing is never the primary motivation,' said de Lara.
The market was 'not bad' at present. There were British buyers and other
buyers. But new properties were getting more expensive in Switzerland. So
something an intending purchaser might like to note is that not only are the
rules about selling to foreigners different in the various cantons, but the
related costs vary as well.
Acquisition fees, based on purchase price, including notary fees, federal
and cantonal charges for making the search, purchase tax, drawing up deed
and land registry fees in Champery (Valais) come to 2.2 per cent. In Villars
(Vaud) they are 5.5 per cent. Bank interest rates on mortgages in Valais are
5.5 per cent for both Swiss and foreigners. In Vaud they are 6.25 per cent
for Swiss - and 7.25 per cent for foreigners.
Annual taxes on a property, including tax (communal, cantonal, federal) in
Valais come to 1.2 per cent. For a similar property in Vaud they are 2.2 per
cent.
The agency is offering property in Valais. At Champery, a traditional Alpine
village of timber chalets on the Swiss-French border, it has apartments in
two new chalets. In one, units are ready for occupation. A one-bedroom
apartment costs from Pounds 134,000 (SFr290,000).
There are two and three-room versions and a penthouse at Pounds 300,000.
There are also chalets on the hillside, looking down on the village. Price
Pounds 315,000 for four bedrooms.
In Vaud, Lennards Properties International, a British-owned Swiss company,
has apartments available to non-resident foreign buyers in a new 15-acre
project at Villars. This is Domaine de l'Elysee, where the first
apartment-let, L'Astragale, is being built. There will be 14 units in the
five-floor building and some should be ready by December. A two-bedroom
appartment is Pounds 216,000; a four-bedroom penthouse, Pounds 380,000.
Five-apartment chalets will be built on the rest of the site, spread over
several years.
Villars is a pleasant, long-established village and its central road is soon
to be made traffic-free. It is one of the few Swiss resorts which over the
years has allowed foreigners.
In France Zigi Davenport of Alpine Apartments Agency, notes how recent
building and road work, and new lifts, have improved its access and general
appearance in Meribel, in Les Trois Vallees, where the agency has property.
There had been a lot of residential building for the Winter Olympics and at
very high prices.
'Incredibly most of it has sold and more is taking place,' says Davenport.
Last winter's excellent snow- falls resulted in some of the best skiing ever
in the area and demand had returned for prestige property.
Chalet l'Auberpine is a new stone and wood-clad apartment block set off the
road, with views across the valley of bel. For those who do intend to ski,
it has the advantage of being beside the new chair lift and on the piste, so
they can ski back to the building. A two-bedroom apartment is Pounds 145,450
(FFr1.9m); a three-bedroom duplex, Pounds 240,000.
Neighbouring Courchevel 1850 is still pricey, but popular with the French,
who, in spite of recession, are buying again, says Davenport. But, with a
thought for the low-budget purchaser, she suggests a one-bedroom and
bunk-room apartment, which can be had for Pounds 34,000 at Val Thorens.
Letting this for three weeks in the main ski season in February, could
produce a rental income to cover running costs.
Val Thorens claims to be the highest ski resort in Europe. But it has its
detractors. In bad weather 'you may be forgiven for thinking you have been
stranded amid the mountains of the moon,' says The Good Skiing Guide 1995
(Consumers' Association, Pounds 14.99, 624 pages).
What of Italy? It was popular for skiing holidays last season because of the
weak lira but not much of its ski resort property comes on the British
market.
When architect and mountain resort planner Laurent Chappis designed
Sansicario, in northern Italy, 58 miles from Turin and nine miles from the
French border, he knew what he wanted to avoid. Some modern ski resorts are
stark when snowless in summer. Their tall apartment blocks lack the charm of
traditional chalet design. Chappis was determined that Sansicario's
buildings should have the minimum impact on the original scene; that the
village would be vehicle-free and properties should have pistes 'on the
doorstep'.
The residences and hotels are built around a commercial centre on gradually
descending levels. The buildings are spaced out and no more than three
storeys high. Large underground garages accommodate cars.
The properties are on the western slopes of Mount Fraiteve, with a view
through woods of larch and fir. The residences, centre and ski-lifts are
connected by pedestrian routes and there is a monorail for more distant
buildings.
There are 100 cable-cars, chair-lifts and ski-lifts, and few queues. The
centre has shops, bars and boutiques.
In 1976 the first buildings were ready. In 1997, along with Sestriere,
Sansicario will host the World Ski Championship. Apartments are available
from Pounds 100,000 (L242m) to Pounds 300,000. There is a swimming pool and
cinema as part of the development.
Indeed, UK agent Brian A French, in Knaresborough, which is offering the
apartments, says Sansicario can be enjoyed equally in summer and by the
family which does not ski. There is horse riding; tennis can be played from
9am until midnight and a golf course is promised, with construction expected
to begin next spring.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Island refuge from cold,
grey winter - Prices in the balmy Canaries and Madeira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing number of Britons are taking their holidays in the sun not in the
heat of summer but in cold, grey winter.
For them, buying a winter holiday-home in a warm climate makes sense and
they should be able to let at high season rates in summer.
Spain's Canary Islands, off the north west coast of Africa, are favourites.
Breezes keep them from being too hot and the temperature changes little
throughout the year.
Of the seven major islands, Tenerife, the largest, is probably most popular.
Its southern coast has beaches, golf courses - and most of the tourists. The
north is damper and greener.
There is plenty of choice of property. one resort in the south has
apartments, villas, building plots and a country club with 17 tennis courts.
The villas cost from Pounds 70,000 (Pta 14m) to Pounds 200,000, with garden
and swimming pool.
An interesting Canarian house halfway up a cliff looks down on the fishing
village of La Caleta. It needs modernising but has scope for imaginative
conversion, Pounds 28,000.
UK agent Babet, in Somerset, can send details of these and many other homes
on the island. Allow 7 per cent of the purchase price for legal costs.
Since 1965, Chilcott White (Overseas) in Croydon, Surrey, has acted as
selling agent for a Canarian landowner building groups of detached homes in
Tenerife.
Today it offers two to three-bedroom cliff-top properties in the north,
close to the Orotava valley and eight miles from Puerto de la Cruz. These
bungalows or split-level villas are built to order.
Prices, with land, are about Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 50,000 (larger plots
are available). A garage costs from Pounds 3,500, a swimming pool, Pounds
10,000. Add 30 per cent for purchase fees and taxes. Building takes six
months.
Gran Canaria, the third largest Canary island has long sandy beaches, which
make it popular; pine forests and mountains.
It also has areas of caves, both coastal and inland. Many become fascinating
homes. Estate agent Sheena Gallagher, of Property Market, in Las Palmas, can
offer a cave-house with sitting-room, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen.
It is on mains electricity, 'but water comes naturally into an underground
tank in winter.'
The property has its own area of land and can be reached easily by car. The
price is Pounds 50,000.
This agency also has converted farms at around Pounds 350,000 and a number
of old 'character' properties. One, at Pounds 35,000, has two bedrooms and a
cellar, which is a cave.
Another, built in 1670 and well cared-for, has four bedrooms, several
out-houses and an artist's studio. It has attractive views. Price Pounds
145,000.
North of the Canaries, the small Portuguese island of Madeira has a
different character. The Canaries are tourist-orientated, Madeira has a more
settled atmosphere and a faithful winter-sunshine following.
It is a beautiful island, often called a floating garden - so much
vegetation grows so easily in its mild climate, but it is short on beaches.
Its image may have become dated, but Madeira is no longer the 'forgotten
island'. EU money pours in to improve its roads and help it develop a new
business status, with an offshore financial centre, free trade zone and much
else.
Owners of private yachts can benefit from Madeira's international shipping
register, which offers a tax holiday until 2011.
There is a good deal of property and land to be had, though the island does
not advertise this much to the outside world. A third of the population
lives in its capital Funchal, where prices are highest.
Here, among new developments, are blocks of one to three bedroom apartments,
from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 110,000. These are offered by Ilhopredio, in
Funchal, an estate agency run by John Rodrigues and his English associate,
Michael White.
Prices of existing properties range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 240,000.
'The market is a little quieter but still buoyant and prices have settled,'
says White. 'There is a thriving community of English, German, French and
returning Portuguese from South Africa.' But the recession had reduced the
number of buyers from Britain.
Another Funchal agent, Ivo Pereira, belongs to a group building hotels and
apartments. It is building apartments just outside Funchal. They are part of
a project with its own swimming pool and are priced from Pounds 85,000.
Information: Tenerife: Babet 0460 76213; Chilcott White 081-688 4151. Gran
Canaria: Property Market 28 64 07 33. Madeira Ilhopredio 23 24 77; Ivo
Pereira 76 61 70.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Trains on the school timetable -
Paul Cheeseright visits a station and travel agency run as a going concern
by Shropshire schoolgirls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Moreton Hall Travel defies the canons of business orthodoxy. No business
plan, just an idea or two about expansion. No stable management, just
executives passing through. But, as its first financial year comes to an
end, it shows a profit.
At one level, Moreton Hall Travel is an educational plaything. At another,
it is a serious concern: serious enough to have handled Pounds 262,000
during the year to July.
It is in fact a business run by students of Moreton Hall, a Pounds
10,000-a-year girls school near Oswestry, Shropshire. The students, under
the eye of David Lloyd, a geography teacher, operate primarily as agents for
British Rail but are starting to diversify the business into other forms of
travel.
'Everything has been going slowly, one step at a time, so that if we got
into financial difficulties, we could ease out of it,' said Lloyd.
The first step was taken eight years ago. The school booked rail tickets for
the pupils, the youngsters paid and British Rail sent the tickets back, plus
9 per cent commission. The funds accumulated to the extent that the school
had enough money to construct a little travel agency in the geography room.
That provided an opportunity for work experience in an undemanding
environment. But a year ago, the school made a leap into the wider
commercial world. It kept the geography room travel desk working, but took
over the booking office at nearby Gobowen station.
Gobowen, on the Shrewsbury-Chester line, is the railhead for Oswestry. The
buildings at the station are owned and have been refurbished by English
Partnerships, the government regeneration agency. The school provided Pounds
1,000 to help equip the booking office.
'We lease the booking office. We have no jurisdiction over the platforms,
but the Women's Institute provides the flower tubs. We haven't taken over
the station as such,' Lloyd explained.
With the booking office Moreton Hall Travel found itself with
responsibilities. It needs, for a start, to find Pounds 3,500 to rent the
building. It pays Pounds 170 a week to the booking office manageress,
Ceinwen, Lloyd's daughter who is spending a year at Gobowen before going to
university. There are the water, electricity, telephone and rates bills.
The responsibilities shift from year to year. Girls from the upper sixth
direct. Most of the work is done by the lower sixth, which trains the upper
fifth. The inner circle of current directors is Sabrina Hartshorn, Deborah
Pratley, Emma Sharp and Emma Sherrard.
'We're being shadowed by Mr Lloyd but we have a large say in what goes on.
We can take the initiative. The decisions are taken as a team,' said
Hartshorn.
This team is of an expansionist frame of mind. 'The first thing is to get
into a larger building so we can get more people working here,' Sharp said.
'With more room we could attract larger support,' added Hartshorn.
The immediate snag is the railway timetable. 'At the moment with British
Rail in such disarray, you're not sure where you stand,' said Pratley.
'Future revenue depends on the timetable. It's not too good so it loses us
customers,' said Sharp.
The railway agency business accounts for 90 per cent of Moreton Hall
Travel's revenue. The only British Rail services which Moreton Hall Travel
cannot sell are season tickets and warrants for the armed forces. But the
railway traffic provides a public which may buy other travel needs and forms
one part of a firm customer base.
Another part of that base is the mass of the pupils' parents and parents'
friends. With such a base, hopes of diversification, nursed by the
directors, look encouraging.
An obvious step is expansion into forms of travel other than the railways.
Moreton Hall Travel takes air bookings but places them through Brian Bass,
the Shrewsbury travel agent. The difficulty is that the commission is just 2
per cent.
There are plans to use Gobowen station as a tourist information point for
Oswestry Borough Council, which would generate income from the provision of
the service, and to establish an extension of Oswestry's railway and bicycle
museum. This is where the need for extra space comes in.
Leasing a second building at Gobowen, which Lloyd thinks would add 50 per
cent to the rent bill, would provide the scope for the additional
enterprises and provide a place where pupils could study for vocational
qualifications in leisure and tourism, while gaining their work experience
on the spot. 'We need to start creating some employment ourselves,' said
Sherrard.
All of this is going to make Moreton Hall Travel a more complicated
enterprise. The business, which has no capital structure, has never had a
loan. In this financial year it will make a surplus of around Pounds 5,000,
and will have to abandon informality.
The school is appointing an enterprise manager who will take formal control
of Moreton Hall Travel and run the other little businesses associated with a
boarding school, such as the tuck shop. A holding company will be set up.
Moreton Hall Travel will have to come to terms with VAT and the requirements
of Companies House.
That will pose interesting questions for the schoolgirl directors. How will
they pay the school for Lloyd's time, how will the school pay the company
for the use of its premises to study for the leisure and tourism NVQ?
Expansion carries with it the loss of innocence.

I bought 2,000 shares in an investment trust and received 400 free warrants.
I had intended to place 1,500 shares in my general Pep within the prescribed
42 days, and I understood that 300 warrants could also be put in. But my
broker told me this was not possible because trading in the warrants had
begun already.
If shares resulting from an investment trust launch are offered as a 'unit'
with warrants attached, then both the shares and the warrants may be
transferred into a general Pep until the day before the warrants are traded
separately.
On or after that day, and up to and including the 42nd day since the date of
allotment of the unit, only the shares may be transferred. Warrants may not
be bought directly from the 'market' for a general or single company Pep.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No allowance for inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is any allowance made for inflation in the differential between the
immediate interest rate and the redemption note in government stock? I ask
because I have a quantity of Treasury stock 13.5 per cent 2004-08. I bought
it to yield an immmediate 10.5 per cent and a redemption yield of 8.7 per
cent.
If I hold it until maturity, I am being paid 10.5 per cent in 1994 money. If
no allowance is made for inflation, then my capital loss in 2008 will bring
my overall yield to 8.7 per cent and will be in 2008 money which, even at
today's low inflation rates, will be worth some 35 to 40 per cent less.
No allowance is made for inflation in the differential between the immediate
interest rate and the redemption rate in government stock. But, as you will
know, dealings in government stock are free of capital gains tax.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife's gift of money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have been resident in the UK for close to six years and have
been deemed ordinary residents for tax purposes. But, as nationals of two
different European countries, we believe we are still considered as
domiciled in our countries of origin.
My father-in-law, also a foreign national, intends to give her some money.
Is she likely to have to pay any tax on it (the gift is foreign currency, to
be converted into sterling)?
Does it make any difference, in tax terms, if she transfers the whole amount
straight to her UK bank account, or deposits it in a foreign account (in the
currency of her choice, including sterling) and then transfers money to the
UK?
If your father-in-law makes the gift in sterling, the answer to your first
question is no. The answer to the second question is no, except that the
interest on the deposit account would be assessable on the remittance basis
if the account were outside the UK.
If the gift is made in foreign currency, there could be a capital gains tax
liability if there is any favourable movement in the exchange rate between
the day of the gift and the conversion into sterling.
If the foreign currency were deposited in a bank outside the UK, the
exchange-rate gains would be assessable on the remittance basis, but any
exchange-rate losses would be disallowed. The gains would be eligible for
indexation relief, regardless of where the currency was deposited.
As you are both domiciled overseas, you ought to have been making tax
returns on the special form (11K) designed for people with overseas
domicile. If you have not, remind your tax office to send you this form in
future.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Savers must wait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the dust settles after the base rate rise, long-term fixed-rate products
continue to flourish: Cheshire building society, for instance, has
introduced a bond paying 9 per cent until December 12 1999. Escalator bond
rates also continue to rise.
But savers hoping their income from everyday accounts will be improved may
be disappointed. Of the high street banks, only Barclays has moved to
increase rates to savers - on average, by the full 0.5 per cent.
When rates fell in February and banks were able to pay savers less, the
rates were changed much more quickly. But it is usual for bank savings rates
to rise or fall in line with the base rate change, and rises can be expected
eventually.
This is not the case with building societies. With the rise in base rates,
mortgage rate increases have been announced relatively quickly. The average
rise at present is 0.4 per cent, immediate for new loans and from the
beginning of October for existing borrowers.
The few savings rates that have been announced are up by an average of only
0.2 per cent and, again, these will be paid from the beginning of October.
Most societies are waiting for the bigger players to make a move on savings
rates and will then follow. In any case, delaying an increase in savings
rates means they will be collecting more interest from mortgages than they
are paying out on savings.
If, however, building societies do delay rises in savings rates and then
increase their margins, returns from National Savings will start looking
more competitive.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Lenders rush to follow Halifax -
Mortgage rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax decided on its new standard mortgage rate this week, emboldening a
host of other building societies to do the same. It has passed on almost the
full half percentage point rise in base rates by increasing its standard
variable rate to 8.1 per cent from 7.64. This applies already to new
borrowers and for existing borrowers from October 1.
Other building societies which have raised their standard variables rates to
8.1 per cent include Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester and Chelsea. Barclays is one of the few banks to have announced
its new rate, also of 8.1 per cent, with effect from October 1 for new and
existing borrowers.
Another batch of lenders are clustered around 8.14 per cent. These include
Bristol &amp; West, Britannia, Leeds, Nationwide and Northern Rock. Abbey
National and National &amp; Provincial are on 8.09 per cent, while TSB and Bank
of Ireland are at the lower end of the market with 8.05.
The TSB rate represents a rise of 0.6 of a percentage point - higher than
the base rate increase - and comes into effect for new and existing
borrowers from October 20. Woolwich is the largest society yet to announce
its new rate and most of the banks also are undecided.
Discounted rates
You can avoid the higher rates by taking advantage of discounted rates still
available from a large number of lenders including Abbey National, Alliance
&amp; Leicester, Bristol &amp; West, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, National &amp; Provincial
and Woolwich. These offer a percentage reduction on the variable rate over
various periods and can represent substantial savings for new borrowers.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester offers a three percentage point discount for 12
months to those with a deposit of at least 20 per cent, or one of 2 per cent
to those borrowing up to 95 per cent of the value of their home.
The three percentage point discount amounts to a saving at present of Pounds
110 a month on a Pounds 50,000 interest-only loan, and of Pounds 235 a month
on Pounds 100,000. These amount respectively to Pounds 1,320 and Pounds
2,820 over the year.
Lenders, however, are using discounted rates to increase their market share
rather than provide a better service to their customers. This is because
they are available only to new borrowers (although some lenders, such as
Halifax, do not make them available for re-mortgages at all).
This means that existing borrowers are being left out. 'It has caused us the
occasional slight headache, since some of our borrowers are raising their
eyebrows over this,' says Abbey National. 'But we do not think it would be
right to let our borrowers switch to lower rates just because it happens to
be better.'
What can existing borrowers do? Many lenders are offering to cover some of
the re-mortgage costs of those tempted to switch lenders. Abbey National
itself is offering to pay up to Pounds 320 towards the valuation and Pounds
250 towards legal fees.
It is almost certain to be worth taking advantage of such offers in order to
get the reduced variable rate, although it is important to calculate all the
costs and balance these against the savings to see if it is worth switching.
But one FT reader, reluctant to leave his present lender, claims he could
move to another offering a discounted rate and then switch back to his
original lender as a 'new' borrower, entitling him to get its discounted
rate while incurring minimal costs.
Before going through this rigmarole, though, it is worth talking to your
lender - particularly if you are a highly-valued customer - to see if you
can get the discounted rate. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester says the only way
existing customers could secure the discounted rate is by re-mortgaging with
the society.
Abbey National is reluctant to endorse a similarly absurd, but at least
flexible, position. It hopes that its customers will realise there is more
to a mortgage than its interest rate, and that having a long relationship
with a lender can reap benefits - such as further loans.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Rates reach year's best level -
Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, The Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annuity rates are at their highest since the start of the year, having risen
by an average of 16.5 per cent. This week, some life companies increased
their rates against a background of rises in long-term gilt yields.
These were 8.9 per cent on September 12 - the day the Chancellor, Kenneth
Clarke, announced a half percentage point increase in base rates - and had
risen to 9.25 per cent by September 20.
As the table shows, Royal Life is looking very competitive, having raised
all its annuity rates on September 20. Sun Life of Canada and Canada Life
have also increased theirs.
Since the start of September, annuity levels at Canada Life have increased
by around 2 per cent, at Royal Life by around 4.5 per cent, and at Sun Life
by around 2.4 per cent. These rates cover a male aged 60 on a particular set
of benefits.
The uncertainty of how long-term interest rates will perform and this week's
fall in bonds are, however, beginning to affect the annuity market.
And while annuity rates are quite high at the moment, most actuaries are
expecting them to fall slightly as the year draws to a close.
Thus, it is imperative for you to shop around for the annuity best suited to
your needs.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Charges to watch - Personal pensions
and you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you take out a personal pension, it is tempting to assume that if the
provider is a household name and its performance record is up to scratch,
you are on to a winner. But this is simply not true.
Performance, arguably, is the most important criterion but the provider's
charges come a close second. Where charges are high, the performance must
consistently be outstanding to compensate.
Yet, the latest survey from Money Management magazine* reveals just how many
second-rate products are available. Hearts of Oak friendly society deducts
just under 40 per cent of your premiums in charges while its performance is
unexceptional, to say the least. By comparison, one of the lowest chargers,
Abbey Life, deducts about 14 per cent.
Other high chargers identified in the survey include Royal London, Eurolife,
British Life Office, Lifetime, Refuge, Acuma, Colonial Mutual, Hambro
Guardian, Crown Life, Gartmore, Providence Capitol and Windsor Life.
Analysis of charges is particularly important when, as at present, there is
a marked lack of consistency in performance league tables. In the survey,
several household names failed to match up to expectation.
Standard Life's with-profits plan is one of the worst performers over 10
years as is NPI's, which only just avoided the bottom five category.
National Mutual's overall performance, one of the best in Money Management's
March 1994 survey, took a nose-dive in the latest tables.
But while high charges can undermine a good performance elsewhere, charges
alone do not guarantee good value. Several of the lowest charging offices
also achieved notably poor returns. Guardian Assurance and NPI fall into
this category.
Personal pensions have attracted a lot of criticism since their launch in
July 1988. Nevertheless, more than 5m have been sold to the self-employed
and to employees who are not in a company scheme.
Although there is nothing wrong with the concept of personal pensions, the
high commissions and charges associated with them mean they have been
mis-sold widely to employees who would have been better off in the state
earnings-related scheme (Serps) or their company plan.
Despite the adverse publicity, however, there are still more than 100
financial institutions selling these products. Surveys such as Money
Management's indicate that over half are not competitive.
Clearly, it is vital to shop around to get the best value for money (see
below). Until January 1995 this will not be easy because, at present,
providers do not have to tell you what their real charges are. Unless your
adviser consults the latest surveys and has a comprehensive database on
charges and performance, the advice will be worthless
It will continue to be worthless if, when the new rules come into force and
providers must tell you their true charges, these are not compared with
those of competitors.
Yet, according to the Association of British Insurers, the vast majority of
regular-premium personal pension plans continue to be sold by direct
salesmen or companies that agree to sell only one provider's products and do
not have to tell you that you can do better elsewhere.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: National Savings quick to launch new
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Savings has launched new issues of its fixed-rate products a week
after the government put up base rates by half a percentage point, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Variable-rate products are unaffected. Savings
certificates: The new 42nd issue pays a tax-free 5.85 per cent a year
compound when held for five years. The return is equivalent to an attractive
9.75 per cent gross for a 40 per cent taxpayer (7.8 per cent gross for a
lower-rate taxpayer).
Index-linked certificates: The 8th issue pays the same as the one it has
just replaced - a return of 3 per cent a year compound in addition to
inflation when held for five years. The new issue has been released because
purchases above the minimum no longer have to be made in multiples of Pounds
25 - they can now be in any amount. The same applies to the savings
certificates.
How attractive you find index-linked certificates depends on your view of
inflation over the next five years.
Yearly plan: The tax-free five-year return is increased to 5.85 per cent a
year compound. The plan is designed to help those who want to buy a savings
certificate through regular instalments. Monthly payments of between Pounds
20 and Pounds 400 are made by standing order for 12 months to buy a
four-year Yearly Plan certificate.
Capital bond: This taxable fixed-rate product is aimed at non-taxpayers,
since the return is paid gross. The new series I pays 7.75 per cent a year
compound if held for five years. But given that the returns are taxable and
the money is tied up for five years, many people may find even the new rate
relatively unattractive.
Pensioners guaranteed income bond: The new issue pays 7.5 per cent a year
gross, fixed for five years and paid monthly on a minimum of Pounds 500 to
those aged 65 and over. Interest is taxable but is paid gross. There are few
products paying monthly income on such a small deposit but look first at
fixed-rate building society rivals.
Children's bonus bond: Issue G now pays 7.85 per cent a year when held for
five years on Pounds 25 up to a maximum of Pounds 1,000. The bond is a
useful way for parents to give to their children as it is tax-free.
First Option bond: Aimed at taxpayers, returns on this bond, which are fixed
for one year, are paid net of basic-rate tax. The new issue pays 6.4 per
cent gross, equivalent to 4.8 per cent net, on Pounds 1,000-Pounds 19,999.
The rate goes up to 6.8 per cent gross (5.1 per cent net) on Pounds 20,000
up to a maximum of Pounds 250,000. The rates are competitive but not overly
so. Look first at building society fixed-rate products.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Points to consider before you decide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before taking out a personal pension you should take advice, preferably from
a fee-based independent adviser who will not be influenced by the amount of
commission he can earn, writes Debbie Harrison. And you should consider
these points:
Will the provider remain strong financially over the long term - or does the
organisation look a potential target for a takeover bid or a merger?
Is the performance consistently good over the long term?
Is the investment team that achieved this performance still in place?
How much of my premiums will disappear in charges?
Does the adviser have a good software system to check providers' real
charges?
Are the contract conditions flexible? Can I increase, decrease or stop
payments without penalty? Can I retire early/late without penalty?
Will the adviser ensure that all commission payments are stripped out of the
plan if I pay on a fee basis? (If you pay on a commission basis, then opt
for a series of one-off or 'single' premiums to avoid the high up-front
charges associated with long-term, regular-premium plans).

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Don't take unit trust yields at face
value - Investors should be cautious over higher returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newly-launched income unit trusts have been taking advantage of a technical
rule change allowing them to publish higher yields than before. Earlier this
year, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) - the chief financial
services regulator - decided that fund management groups could take their
annual management fee out of investors' capital instead of income, which can
boost yield figures by up to 50 per cent.
Save &amp; Prosper launched an Extra Income unit trust, with an initial yield of
6.25 per cent, earlier this month while Mercury Income Portfolio was
launched last month with an initial gross yield of 5.25 per cent. Both
groups have taken full advantage of the SIB change, which adds up to 1.5
percentage points to the yield figures they could otherwise have shown.
The change affects unit trusts aiming mainly for income, or emphasising
income and capital growth equally. Unit trusts are being told to disclose
the method of charging fees against capital, noting clearly that this could
impair future capital growth. Existing unit-holders are entitled to three
months' notice of a change of charging method.
Management groups are divided over whether existing unit trusts should
convert to the new treatment, pointing to possible tax disadvantages for
investors as well as managers.
The main catch is for higher-rate taxpayers who may not want the higher
yield. They will find themselves paying 40 per cent on the excess income
unless they move to a different, lower-yielding fund.
Although most managers claim there is little possibility of investors being
confused or misled, some are nervous about the appearance in close proximity
of figures established on different bases, and stress that total return is
what counts. They urge investors to probe beyond headline yield figures to
find exactly how returns are being achieved.
Peter Edwards, of Premier Unit Trust Brokers in Bristol, thinks most unit
trust groups eventually will join the charge-to-capital club, whatever their
present attitudes. 'It's a very competitive world - they will see this as
something they have probably got to do.'
The danger of charging fees to capital is that it might be eroded or future
growth constrained, but Edwards believes ordinary investors are not
concerned with the allocation of management fees. 'People don't honestly
give a hoot about this. Most people just want that dividend cheque.'
S&amp;P is expecting Extra Income to pull in more than Pounds 50m in its initial
offer period. S&amp;P's literature notes that ' . . . it is likely that some or
all of the annual management fee will be charged to the fund as capital.'
Julian Tregoning, director of investment products at S&amp;P and chairman of the
Association of Unit and Investment Funds, says this is merely the required
form of words. In practice, the full 1.5 per cent will be charged to
capital.
He says S&amp;P might alter some of its existing income funds so that only part
of the management fee is set against capital. 'It will depend on the income
requirements. We want to make sure we maintain income.'
Management groups with income funds at the top end of the performance tables
are taking a cautious approach to the rule change. Peter Reeve, managing
director of Jupiter Tyndall Merlin, says he and the trustees have decided
against any immediate alteration to the group's income fund.
This is the top performer in the UK equity income sector over five, three,
two and one years to August 1 (source: HSW, offer-to-bid, net income
re-invested). Reeve says: 'We shall have to see how our nearest competitors
in the performance tables deal with this. We are not rushing into anything.'
At GT Unit Managers, also a consistent high performer, managing director
Martin Harrison says the new charging method will not be adopted for the
existing income fund. But the group might well launch a new unit trust using
it, given the very strong demand for income.
Perpetual does not plan any immediate changes. Marketing director Roger
Cornick explains: 'We are not rushing to tell investors we can possibly
squeeze a drop or two of extra income. I think groups with the greatest need
for improved yield figures will probably make use of the relaxed rules most
quickly.'
M&amp;G also is making no changes. Communications manager Rachel Medill points
out: 'By taking charges from capital, you get a high yield - but you are no
better off in total return terms.' She was vague, however, on whether this
would be long-term policy for M&amp;G, saying the pressures of competitive life
made a definite forecast difficult.
Schroder is to write to the 14,500 holders of its Pounds 128m Income fund in
November telling them that the fund will begin taking its 1 per cent annual
charge out of capital next February. This will lift the yield by 28 per
cent, from 3.6 to 4.6 per cent. Unit-holders who object will be offered a
free switch into another of the group's funds.
According to Bridget Cleverly, assistant director of marketing, the group
thinks the change will be tax-neutral. 'It will make our income fund much
more attractive for people looking for income not total return,' she says.
Schroder also is considering a similar move involving its gilt and fixed
interest trust and global bond fund.
Both Fidelity and Gartmore have decided against altering any of their
existing funds at present. But at Prolific, which has yet to decide,
marketing director Mike Webb says there is a very sound investment reason
for charging fees to capital.
It is, he explains, easier for the fund manager to achieve a yield by
investing in companies lower down the yield curve than is possible when fees
come out of income. This means the fund manager is able to buy shares with
better prospects for long-term capital growth.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Withdrawal symptoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G is about to launch a personal equity plan with no initial charge - the
second since its successful Managed Income personal equity plan in January,
writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Instead, M&amp;G will make its money from its
annual charge of 1.5 per cent and withdrawal fees.
These are intended to encourage long-term investment. You would pay 4.5 per
cent for redeeming in the first year with a tapered structure of 4, 3, 2 and
1 per cent over the next four. There would be no exit charge after the
fifth. The Pep is based on a new fund, Managed Growth, which will invest in
other M&amp;G funds aiming for capital growth.
Fidelity is aiming to go one better. From Monday, it will drop the initial
charge on its Moneybuilder Pep, which does not have a withdrawal charge.
Moneybuilder is also a fund of funds and is in the top five in the sector in
the five, three and two years to August 1 (source: HSW; offer to bid, net
income re-invested), although performance has slipped since then.
Investors will have to pay an annual management fee of up to 1.75 per cent,
since Fidelity is charging 0.5 per cent in addition to the annual fees of
the underlying funds.
Fidelity pioneered withdrawal fees in June 1992 but, along with Gartmore,
dispensed with them earlier this year. But the Securities and Investments
Board, the chief financial regulator, announced this week that unit trusts
will be able to impose exit charges from November 1 (previously the trust
had to be within a Pep to be able to do so), a move which the industry
welcomes as giving it more flexibility.
Unit trusts will not be able to charge more, though: a combination of
initial and exit fees must not exceed more than the present maximum of 7 per
cent initial charge.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: The AIM is excellence - The market
proposed to replace the USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock exchanges everywhere face a common problem: the need to protect
investors while creating an environment where small companies, in
particular, can raise capital at an affordable price.
In Britain, the London Stock Exchange earlier this month produced a plan
which tries to strike a balance. Its Alternative Investment Market (AIM),
intended to replace the Unlisted Securities Market when it expires at the
end of 1996, will allow the UK's smallest companies to seek an exchange
listing without meeting any minimum requirements.
There will be no minimum level of capitalisation, no minimum level on the
amount of shares in public hands, no minimum trading record requirement and,
most controversial of all, no requirement for a 'sponsor' - usually, an
investment bank which checks the documents accompanying a flotation to see
they are accurate.
The trading and reporting requirements for AIM companies will, broadly, be
similar to those of others on the stock exchange. Once listed, they will
have to disclose information in much the same fashion as companies on the
exchange's official list.
The question being debated is how to encourage investors to put capital into
small companies without raising the cost of complying with investor
protection regulations to unrealistic proportions.
Specialists in small companies say investing in the sector is high risk,
anyway. 'But you have got to make a distinction between rules which protect
against business risk and those which protect against fraud,' says Marc
Cramsie, head of corporate finance at stockbroker Singer and Friedlander.
The latter are the most important, he adds.
Brokers, venture capitalists and others have looked with envy across the
Atlantic to the Nasdaq market's small capitalisation stocks listing. In
particular, the participation of US retail investors at this end of the
stock market is striking.
Nasdaq argues that its own minimum entrance requirements for listing have
been a crucial factor in encouraging investors into small companies. 'If you
are going to maintain the confidence of investors and confidence in the
markets, you need to maintain some minimum standards,' says Joe Hardiman,
its chief executive.
Getting an initial spot on Nasdaq's small companies list requires
registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, total assets of
Dollars 4m, an initial flotation of 100,000 shares with a total minimum
value of Dollars 1m, and at least 300 shareholders. Like the AIM, though,
there is no formal requirement for a sponsor with the duty to provide a 'due
diligence' review of information filed.
As a practical matter, Hardiman says, 'only a tiny fraction' of Nasdaq Small
Cap companies have no sponsor because each is required to have two
market-makers (share wholesalers) prepared to buy and sell the shares in all
market conditions. He points out that no sane market-maker would agree to
take on a company without having checked it out thoroughly.
The proposed AIM market will require only one market-maker, a rule which
also could prompt the majority of companies which list there to use a
sponsor as well.
Cramsie argues that the danger of dropping the requirement for a sponsor is
that companies will seek listings on the AIM mostly to have a
publicly-quoted price for their shares - useful for those seeking a public
valuation or wishing to reward employees with profit-sharing arrangements.
Those genuinely seeking new capital will join the official list or, worse,
choose to list in another country.
'It's going to be very useful for a lot of companies simply to have a
trading price somewhere for their shares,' Cramsie says. 'But the stock
exchange really should try to make the AIM a market where people actually
are going to raise money.'
Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood Securities - which
specialises in small company stocks - says he is uneasy about whether AIM
rules will be too loose to encourage retail investors to take part in the
long run.
In particular, he adds, the goal of the AIM should be to create a US-style
share-buying public instead of one which chooses 'race-courses and bingo
halls'. He fears that if too many AIM-listed companies turn out to be run by
people with dubious credentials, the entire market will be discredited.
David Jones, chairman of Sharelink, a share-dealing service for private
investors, says he believes his clients want to invest in small companies.
Moreover, he feels the absence of minimum requirements for companies seeking
a listing should not be a deterrent so long as investors understand the
nature of the market.
'What private investors like is clarity,' Jones says. 'The proposition that
you need lots of regulation to encourage them is untested. We think the
proposed AIM will make private investors much keener to go into this
sector.'
Instead of more regulation, Jones suggests that better communications
between shareholders and company directors would improve matters. He feels
directors should meet more often with investors to answer their questions
about trading conditions. 'We need a completely new approach to
communication,' he stresses.
Jones adds that, if anything, new rules designed to protect investors by
limiting opportunities for insider dealing serve only to frustrate this
heightened level of communication.

The table, compiled by Touche Ross, sets out how the tax treatment of

Investing in companies quoted on Rule 4.2 has considerable capital gains tax
advantages, but they are not considered suitable for a personal equity plan.
Both Unlisted Securities Market and Rule 4.2 companies have inheritance tax
advantages not shared by companies with a full quote. AIM's position remains
to be clarified.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (4): A walk on the waterside
in Britain's cities - New horizons on old waste sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marina developments. Two boring words that strike pleasure into the heart of
any UK property developer.
In truth, these areas are often relics of the Industrial Revolution - old
ports well suited to conversion. They can give new life to their cities,
providing space and visual pleasure. And, usually, they are next to city
centres - often because they were the reason the city was founded.
Now that the Department of the Environment is tilting against edge-of-town
greenfield sites for development, these brownfield/grey-water sites are an
alternative to regenerate Britain's great cities and clean up industrial
wasteland.
In its heyday, around 1913, Cardiff, the Welsh capital, supplied coal from
the south Wales valleys for the world's steamships. But this rich commerce
had to take into account the extraordinary tides in the Bristol Channel.
For 14 hours a day Cardiff Bay is mudflats. Boats laden with coal could
leave only at high tide. The Coal Exchange in Mount Stuart Square (the
pre-first world war equivalent of OPEC headquarters) had clocks flanking the
entrance to the trading floor to indicate tidal times.
Today the tides, which can rise and fall more than 30 feet, are the reason
for the largest scheme in the regeneration of waterfront Cardiff  - the
building of a barrage across the bay to pen in a 500-acre freshwater lake
with a stable water level that will be a haven for watersport enthusiasts.
After many delays, work has started and the barrage should be completed in
1998.
This huge space of water will lie between Penarth on the west and the inner
harbour of Cardiff to the east, which is the centre of the Cardiff Bay
Development Corporation's schemes for new housing, jobs, facilities and
shops around the old coal port. (The working port is the adjacent Queen
Alexandra Dock, which dates to Cardiff's prosperous years.)
The port at Penarth is already the Portway Village marina and is set, like
town squares, around two dock basins under the dominating presence of the
old customs house on the cliff above. Camper and Nicholsons runs the marina,
a development by Crest Nicholson (its joint company with Crest), which has
about 230 boats permanently. Two housing units are still available, and some
are for resale. With visiting boats, 18 per cent up on last year, it always
has something to watch. 'I'd like the activity - and the barbecue parties
here,' says Pat Lewis, who moved from the Midlands to be housing strategy
manager for CBDC.
The tides make for exciting trips on a Bristol Channel cruising route that
stretches from Padstow, in Cornwall, to Gloucester, says marina manager
Charles Bush. Once it has a stable water level, Cardiff Bay will become a
major venue for boating, he says.
In Cardiff, access to the port has been improved. The new peripheral
distributor road, which links Cardiff Bay with the M4, has been put in a
tunnel and a boulevard, to be called Bute Avenue, will lead from the city
centre to the waterfront. A new opera house for the Welsh National Opera,
and a 'virtual reality' cinema will join the Welsh Industrial and Maritime
Museum, Techniquest (a hands-on science museum) and a Harry Ramsden's for
fish and chips.
Job opportunities are rising with several new offices - including NatWest's
resuscitation of its grandiose bank of 1916 in West Bute Street, another
symbol of Cardiff's wealth. Nippon Electric Glass and Schott of Germany have
recently invested Pounds 200m in a new factory.
Cardiff is different from ports such as Manchester and Liverpool. Its
history as a coaling port means that it needed only large flat areas to dump
its product. There are no warehouses to turn into flats, except for the
isolated conversion by Lovell, a few years ago, of a Spillers' flour
warehouse. Instead, it gives a rare chance to use lots of space to build a
high-quality townscape from scratch, which is CBDC's aim. People may enjoy
living and working around the inner harbour - and praying; they will have an
Anglo-Catholic church, a Greek Orthodox church and a mosque within 100 yards
of each other.
The new housing schemes have a target of 6,000 units, with 1,700 built or
being built. Barratt, Beaser, Tarmac, Westbury and Windsor Quay are the
developers for a variety of housing, of which 25 per cent will be social.
The whole is an exciting plan to reunite a city with its roots in the water.
Swansea's wealth was in metalworking, but only two chimney stacks are left
of the 300 that were there at the turn of the century. Two years ago it
opened its barrage at the mouth of the river Tawe, creating a lake with
excellent moorings and eliminating the mudflats problem. A licence for the
lock costs Pounds 80 a year.
Inside the barrage is the water entrance to the marina at the south dock. It
closed in 1969, but the decision in the 1970s to make a maritime quarter
created the country's first marina on old industrial land.
The scheme finished in the mid-1980s - although one housing site and two
leisure sites await development. Grosvenor Waterside, the development arm of
ABP, has plans for the less used part of the eastern commercial docks, using
public and private money and providing everything from sheltered housing to
Pounds 200,000 homes.
Westrec of the US, a Marina management company, took Swansea marina on as
its first in Europe, and aims to raise the 66 per cent occupancy of berths
by providing better facilities and, probably, a club for owners (most of
whom live within 25 miles of Swansea).
In London the Chelsea Harbour development by P &amp; O sits on an old coal dock
and goods yard. Residents value its security and quiet, the harbour club and
restaurants, a nearby supermarket, and stunning views.
(For the best view of it take a helicopter from the Battersea heliport
across the river.) A car is necessary since it is a long walk to the London
Underground.
The marina has 55 berths (at Pounds 160 a year per metre) and can be left or
entered 90 minutes either side of high tide. Yachts may repair to the
Harbour's five-star Conrad hotel.
The 310 units in the eight blocks are all sold, bar a house or flat or two.
But about 10 per cent are for resale at any time, at prices from Pounds
325,000 to Pounds 1.3m.
Rentals are also available. Harbour Estates is the agent on the spot. Beaney
Pearce, Parkway, and Strutt &amp; Parker also offer flats for sale.
In Edinburgh the decision to move the Scottish Office with 1,600 staff to
the port of Leith has given an impetus to plans there. Known for its
restaurants and wine bar, Leith now boasts an hotel converted from an 1883
sailors' home. (a joint project by Forth Ports and Ken Mculloch of One
Devonshire Gardens hotel in Glasgow). Forth Ports has shops, offices and
housing in train.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (3): In the hunt for a
sporting venue - The hunting, shooting and fishing properties on the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Autumn is the high season in field sports. Pheasant and woodcock are shortly
to be in the firing line; grouse and snipe have been fair game since the
glorious twelfth of August, and the shooting season for partridge, wild
geese and duck opened on September 1.
The grouse in Scotland have been a little disappointing, but salmon are
doing well. And now that the harvest is in, cub-hunting has begun - training
of the cub hounds to work as a pack and culling the weaker cub foxes.
They are all expensive sports but, if you travel almost all the way to John
O'Groats, the northern tip of the British mainland, you can buy an estate of
44,000 acres for less than the price of a house in Kensington, west London.
The Forsinard and Bighouse estate, in the bogland 'flow' country of
Sutherland, offers virtually every kind of field sport, plus a 4,300-acre
farm, 15-bedroom hotel, railway station, a sand and gravel quarry, and an
extraordinary variety of wildlife.
The price? Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh is asking for offers over Pounds
1.35m. And no parking problems.
The natural home for hunting folk is Leicestershire, where six packs -
revered names such as Belvoir, Cottesmore, Fernie, Pytchley and Quorn -
converge on Market Harborough.
It is special because much of the rolling country is still pasture, which
keeps the old pattern of small fields divided by hedges. As the hedges were
not grubbed up 20 years ago, jumping over them offers more thrills - and
spills - per mile than in the rest of the country where they were removed
(with government grants). And Leicestershire has fewer barbed wire fences.
An ideal hunting box (house for hunting) with an immaculate stable yard with
eight loose boxes is Ravenhead, at Ingarsby, near Leicester in Quorn hunting
country. Strutt &amp; Parker in Market Harborough offers it for Pounds 450,000.
Also in Quorn country (for Friday meets) is Inkerman Lodge at Hungarton near
Melton Mowbray, which has 60 acres of grassland and costs Pounds 425,000
from Savills in Stamford. In Cottesmore country, Strutt &amp; Parker offers
Alstoe Farm at Burley-on-the-Hill in Rutland for Pounds 290,000.
An alternative is to make some income from hunting, by taking the lease of
Kirby House Stables near Belvoir Castle, which used to be the Belvoir hunt
kennels. The yard, with 49 loose boxes (21 let), three cottages and
paddocks, yields a net income of Pounds 6,000, but could manage a further
Pounds 15,000 from letting the remainder. The price for the lease, with 10
years left, is Pounds 100,000 from equestrian property specialist
Christopher Stephenson.
In the Cotswolds, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Oxford is selling Copse Hill
Court at Upper Slaughter, a house converted from a 19th century stable block
but still with five loose boxes and nine acres in Heythrop country. The
price is Pounds 575,000.
Two other Heythrop houses from KFR are Evenlode Place (Pounds 900,000) and
Downs Lodge near Shipton-under-Wychwood (Pounds 545,000).
Another hunting paradise is Ireland, where it has always been a cross-class
pursuit. If you want to go out with the Wexford, Kilmokea at Great Island,
Co Wexford, has 14 loose boxes, an indoor arena and 19 acres of farmland.
But any buyer must also be a gardener, to maintain a famous garden of seven
acres. The guide price from Jackson Stops &amp; McCabe is IPounds 400,000, but
it would be essential to be sure of the outgoings before taking it on.
For shooting and fishing, combined perhaps with deer stalking, the ideal is
an estate in Scotland. 'Demand far outstrips supply,' William Jackson, of
KFR in Edinburgh reports.
Besides Forsinard and Bighouse in the north, Strutt &amp; Parker offers Carnoch
in the west near Fort William (where the railway station is the link with
Glasgow and London).
Offers over Pounds 300,000 (down from Pounds 375,000) will buy a house, a
hill farm, 4,355 acres with deer stalking and rough shooting, and the whole
Carnoch river system - which is always a good buy as it is easier to improve
the fishing as you want it.
For the romantic, the same agent offers the Island of Inchfad in Loch Lomond
for Pounds 550,000 (or in one-eighth shares of Pounds 90,000), for duck
shooting and as a base for fishing salmon, trout and powan - the loch's own
freshwater herring. It is 120 acres and has four cottages.
The Upper North Wark fishing beat on the Tweed (with a four-year average of
122 salmon) costs Pounds 700,000 (again Strutt &amp; Parker). Or buy a specified
week in perpetuity on the Beauly river near Inverness from Pounds 11,000
plus VAT per rod per week on the Upper Beauly (126 salmon last year) or
Pounds 25,000 on the Lower Beauly (1,065 salmon last year), from KFR.
Fishing in the English West Country is far cheaper. Strutt &amp; Parker in
Exeter is selling a beat on the Taw in north Devon (20-year average: 23
salmon and 42 sea trout) for Pounds 175,000. A cottage is Pounds 75,000
extra. Stags offers Feld House near Chulmleigh with 11 acres and a mile of
fishing on the Little Dart, a tributary of the Taw, for Pounds 230,000.
And in glorious, unspoilt country in the west of Ireland a complete salmon
river system is available. The Ballisodare fishery in Co Sligo, covering
four rivers, belonged for a long time to the Cooper family (as the Cooper
Act 1837 ordained). They managed a superb fishery in the last century, which
is now for sale with the netting rights in Ballisodare bay which means being
able to control the fish returning to the rivers. The present owners have
run it for pleasure, but the new owner could make it more commercial.
In recent years the average catch on rod and line has been 1,200, with 800
more netted. The minimum price is IPounds 500,000 from Hamilton Osborne King
or KFR in London.
Finally, for shooting on the Pennines, consider the Scargill estate of 4,222
acres (with sporting rights over a further 922 acres) in Teesdale. Besides
grouse (20-year average: 393 brace), it offers pheasant and duck, and six
let farms producing Pounds 23,338 a year - to set against the price of
Pounds 1.35m from Murray or Savills in York.

ED&amp;F Man, the 200-year-old commodities broker, will be valued at Pounds
462.6m when it comes to market next month through a placing and public offer
at 180p a share, writes Peggy Hollinger. About Pounds 110m in shares are
being sold, of which Pounds 27.5m are being offered to the public. This
represents about 24 per cent of the total enlarged share capital.
Man was forced by the recent stock market fall to pitch its share price
substantially lower than had been hoped. It had expected to float on an
historic price/earnings ratio of about 12 but the shares will start on a
multiple of 9.5.
The share price reduction has left Man with what appears to be an attractive
notional yield of 6 per cent. But analysts are not convinced the group will
be able to sustain such healthy dividend payments. 'If you look at the
operational cash flow over the past four years, they have moved from hugely
negative to quite positive,' said one.
The price announced yesterday may leave the shares looking cheap if only the
p/e is taken into account. But there are several concerns over the quality
of Man's earnings, which mean the jury could be out for some time.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watmoughs, the printing and binding company, has just announced interim
results that were fairly strong and Patrick Walker, the chairman and chief
executive, gave an up-beat statement reflecting improved demand. Following
the announcement, he sold 19 per cent of his holding: 190,000 shares at
369p. He is left with more than 800,000.
The considerable sale by John Haynes, chairman of Haynes Publishing, is a
good example of how important it is to judge a share transaction in terms of
the director's existing holding. Haynes holds about 60 per cent of the
company, which is capitalised at Pounds 69m. His sale, therefore, represents
only 1 per cent of his holding.
Blenheim Group, the company that organises exhibitions and conferences, used
to enjoy a golden spot in the market as its growth rocketed. But the
momentum slowed and, over the past year, the stock has underperformed by 32
per cent. Since January, directors have been buying their own shares, and
the most recent transaction is by chairman Neville Buch. He bought 15,000
ordinaries and 400,000 convertible cumulative preference shares to take his
holding to more than 5,340,000 shares.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Inchcape falls back - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: This year has not been a happy one so far for Inchcape, the
international motors, marketing and business services group. Its share price
has fallen by a third since January and analysts will be anxious for
reassurance when the UK-based organisation reports results for the six
months to June 30. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds
115m-Pounds 120m, compared with Pounds 130m last time.
MONDAY: The stock market will be waiting to see if Hammerson provides
details of the planned sale of its Pounds 175m Australian property portfolio
along with its interim results. With around 50 per cent of its assets
overseas, Hammerson is among the most international of UK property
companies, so its comments on market conditions in Australia and Canada -
where it acquired three shopping malls in July - will be watched closely.
Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 22m, against Pounds
15.2m last time, and a dividend unchanged at 3.5p.
TUESDAY: Multi-media will be the buzzword when Dorling Kindersley, the
publisher of highly illustrated reference books, reports its annual results.
Distribution problems last autumn are expected to have cut pre-tax profits
from Pounds 9.7m to about Pounds 8.5m. But most interest will focus on
prospects for the group's latest CD-ROM products: five educational packages
which combine text, sound and vision for use on home computers.
TUESDAY: Exceptional re-structuring costs obscured last year's results from
Sears, the clothing retail group. But, on a directly comparable basis, it is
forecast to report an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 39.5m
to about Pounds 46m. Interest charges are likely to be down and both British
Shoe Corporation and Selfridges department store are expected to show strong
performances, but the picture from the clothing multiples is likely to be
mixed.
TUESDAY: Half-time pre-tax profits from Tarmac, the housing and construction
group, are expected to fall within the range of Pounds 19m to Pounds 25m.
Last time, profits were Pounds 2.5m. It is thought that the dividend will be
maintained at 3p. The housing division and aggregates market are forecast to
produce improved performances.
WEDNESDAY: Good results recently from house-building companies are expected
to be repeated when Beazer Homes, floated out of Hanson in February, reports
interim results. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds
28m and Pounds 31m.
THURSDAY: Improved half-time results from Redland are forecast, with the
building materials group expected to turn in pre-tax profits of around
Pounds 130m, against Pounds 108m last time. The continued recovery in the
continental European building market is likely to be a key component of any
improvement.
THURSDAY: Forte announces half-year results, with pre-tax profits of between
Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m expected compared with Pounds 37m last time. The
results come at the end of one of the most momentous months in the hotel and
restaurant group's history. It has been given a formal say in the management
of the Savoy group, although it has not won overall control.
More significant from a commercial point of view, it won control of Meridien
hotels, the French chain controlled by Air France. Attention is likely to
focus on Forte's success in holding on to contracts to manage Meridien
properties.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (2): Bright promise fades
away - How the UK residential market has fared this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year had started full of promise but, as winter turned to spring, and
then summer, the property market started sticking. The rise in long-term
yields killed the attractive fixed-rate mortgages of January and February,
taxes went up in April and the government did badly in local and European
elections. As confidence waned, sales fell.
The mid-September base rate increase also prompted fears that the uncertain
recovery in the housing market would be checked.
Negative equity probably provides a salutary reminder that, although prices
are slowly improving, they still have a long way to go until they reach
1988-89 levels. The priority now, after a recession that affected the
house-owning middle-classes most, is to have a home (with all the security
and permanence that implies) and not a fast-profit investment vehicle.
If potential sellers do not see anything to buy that they like and there is
no reason to move, they are staying put.
The Corporate Estate Agents Property Index of net sales (those that went
through), based on about half the country's housing transactions through
estate agents, peaked in February (38,126 sales) and March (40,114), but by
July had fallen to 29,382 - 9.7 per cent down on July 1993. In August the
figure was 29,570, 1.7 per cent down on the same month last year but up 0.6
per cent on the previous month.
It is curate's egg of a market, good in parts. There are masses of would-be
buyers, and the affordability of houses has hardly been better, but agents
do not have enough vendors with the confidence to instruct them to sell.
This stock shortage makes the market still stickier and prices, as recorded
by Nationwide and Halifax, have barely moved. Turnover is low and the
expected general recovery is still on the horizon.
Two sectors are different. The shortage of homes for resale has boosted the
lettings and new homes markets. New house prices went up sharply in August
by 2.2 per cent from July, Halifax estimates.
More people are becoming tenants, some for well-established reasons (job
demands, divorce, widowhood, waiting to buy after selling) and some because
they now prefer the flexibility - and reduced responsibilities - of renting.
It is also a market of strong local variations. Prices have surged in London
and for good properties within easy reach of the capital. But in other parts
of the UK they are still coming down.
In December 1992, Yolande Barnes, head of Savills' Residential Research,
forecast rises of 10 to 15 per cent in prime central London prices by June
1994. The actual result, she computes, was 23.4 per cent, putting prices at
about the level of June 1987.
We shall see in January how her forecast of December 1993 - that prices
would rise by 19 per cent across the country in 1994 and by 25 per cent in
prime central London - has worked out. With half the year gone, the London
advance has reached 11.9 per cent, showing that there has been good recovery
in the capital.
This is very different from what Nationwide and Halifax have been saying
but, as Barnes emphasises, their figures cover the properties on which they
give mortgages and therefore leave out 28 per cent of transactions - mostly
at the top of the market - that do not involve mortgages.
James Wilson, of buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, thinks a more likely figure
for the 1994 increase will be 10-12 per cent and points out that London is
always a different market because foreign investors help to buffer it from
the domestic economy. He expects a further 10 per cent rise in 1995.
Besides rich foreigners, City bonuses have been a factor, particularly in
areas such as Kensington, Holland Park and Notting Hill, which showed an
annualised increase for flats of 28.1 per cent and for houses of 22 per cent
in the second quarter of this year.
The bonuses have also affected the market in counties such as Hampshire,
where owners of cottages, village houses and country houses have been
obtaining the asking prices immediately.
Michael Dunning, of Lane Fox in Winchester, sees many frustrated buyers
chasing houses costing more than Pounds 500,000 with supply 'distinctly
short'.
On Savills' figures, the general rise for good country houses has been 3.8
per cent in the first half of the year, with average rises of 1.7 per cent
in the north, 2.6 per cent in the east and west and 8.1 per cent in the home
counties.
But it is a patchy picture in which local conditions and the quality of the
house both have an effect. In East Anglia, Cambridgeshire is, as usual, the
first county to feel the improvement in the economy spreading out from
London, thanks to its university, high-tech industries and good
communications. Prices have risen about 5 per cent this year, Bidwells
reports, with far easterners and Channel Islanders among the buyers. There
is the support of a strong lettings market.
Other parts doing well include south-east Wales, Gloucestershire, North
Yorkshire and the West Midlands, according to the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors market survey for May-July.
Some selling and buying agents feel that Savills' bullish forecasts for 1994
price rises have encouraged vendors to put off decisions in the hope that
they may wipe out any negative equity which they may have carried. But there
cannot be any price changes without market liquidity.
Finally, in spite of exceptions, there is little prospect of quick capital
gain. If attitudes to buying really have changed - and property is no longer
something to take a punt on - the turnover in the resale market will
continue to be much less than a few years ago.
That is good news for landlords and new home builders. But for estate agents
it can lead only to amalgamations and reductions as there will not be enough
business to keep them all going.
In the meantime, buyers should sell if they can and determine how large a
mortgage their salary can stand so that they can beat the competition for
that ever rarer item, a period house for sale.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Make the most from your home - How
retired people can maximise their income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As people live longer and retire earlier, they may find that, towards the
end of their lives, they do not have enough money to live on. Savings become
depleted and inflation eats gradually into a pension.
Some may even have to consider going into residential care and will need to
plan how to meet the costs (see below). Those who no longer have any savings
may find that their last precious asset is their home.
Depending on its value, it could be worth trading down. But many people
under-estimate the costs of moving, while others find the idea too
traumatic. How, then, to bridge the income gap?
Home income plans. These have had a terrible name since the late 1980s when
unscrupulous advisers encouraged many elderly owners to take a mortgage and
invest in risky, equity-related investment bonds to pay off the mortgage and
produce an income. Many investors were left with large debts or even lost
their homes. Some are still claiming compensation (see right).
There are, however, more secure plans on the market. The Safe Home Income
Plan (SHIP) campaign, launched in 1991, has a code of practice for companies
selling them. Members are Allchurches Life, Carlyle Life, Home &amp; Capital and
Stalwart Life.
The two main types of home income plan are:
Mortgage annuity scheme. You raise a mortgage on part of the property,
usually up to a maximum of Pounds 30,000 (so that the loan attracts maximum
tax relief), and invest the money in an annuity which pays a monthly income
after deducting interest payable on the loan. The annuity should be on a
'last survivor' basis so that it continues until the death of the second
partner. Owners retain legal possession of the home, which is sold when they
die to pay off the loan.
According to Cecil Hinton of financial adviser Hinton &amp; Wild, a London-based
firm which specialises in the home income plan market, it is best to fix
both interest and income payments. The higher your age, the more income you
can expect from the annuity - there is little point in thinking about such a
scheme unless you are at least 70.
Hinton says a single man aged 75 who is a basic-rate taxpayer could expect
about Pounds 1,870 a year, and a single woman of the same age around Pounds
1,200, on a Pounds 30,000 loan. A married couple aged 75 would receive
Pounds 770. Non-taxpayers getting state benefits must take into account the
effect of the additional income on their tax status and benefits.
Home reversion schemes. You sell your home to the company, giving up your
right to the property, and are given either a lump sum or an annuity income.
But since you could live a long time, the reversion company will not pay the
full market value of the home - only a fraction.
According to Age Concern*, which has a fact sheet on raising income from
your home, the cash sum can be 35 per cent or less of the home's value and
will rarely be more than 60 per cent, even for those over 80. You will not
benefit from any rise in the property's value once you have sold it.
A single man aged 75 (25 per cent taxpayer) could expect to receive a Pounds
24,500 lump sum or an annual annuity income of Pounds 3,400 while retaining
a half share in a house valued at Pounds 100,000. A single woman of the same
age would receive about Pounds 23,400 (lump sum) or Pounds 2,600 (annuity
income). The corresponding figures for a married couple would be Pounds
22,300 or Pounds 1,900, according to Hinton.
Paying for care. Most elderly people want to stay in their own homes for as
long as possible. But with longer life expectancies, a growing proportion
cannot avoid spending their final years in a nursing or residential home.
The problem then is finding the money to pay for the care. Typical weekly
nursing home costs of Pounds 300 to Pounds 400 exceed the incomes of most
retired people and the state does not provide: anyone with assets of more
than Pounds 8,000 (including their home) has to meet the full cost of their
own care.
In most cases, owners going into care have to sell their homes to cover the
fees. But simply selling up, putting the money in the building society and
paying nursing home fees out of the income and capital is not an efficient
way to proceed - it does not take many years of fees at Pounds 20,000 per
annum to consume the proceeds. Proper planning is needed.
One recent development is special schemes designed to meet the immediate
need for care and to cope with rising fees. Most use part of a cash lump sum
(usually from the sale of a house) to buy an annuity, and invest the rest to
try to replenish capital.
Insurers offering schemes along these lines include PPP Lifetime, Commercial
Union, Eagle Star, Clerical Medical and Scottish Amicable. But since these
are complicated financial products, it is essential that you obtain
independent financial advice before making any sort of commitment.
A number of financial advisers around the country now specialise in
providing advice on paying for care. Philip Spiers, a partner with the
Nursing Home Fees Agency, looks at income, assets, entitlement to benefits
and all other circumstances before working out the best way to cover fees.
This could involve one of the plans mentioned above or a tailor-made
solution. 'Every case is completely different,' he says.
Other specialists include: London-based Advisory &amp; Brokerage Services, which
offers fee-based advice on both the choice of home and funding methods;
Morton-Wilson, of Nuneaton, Warwickshire; and the Kleinwort Benson private
bank.
Many elderly people are reluctant to sell their homes to pay for care
because they want their children to inherit - but recent legislation makes
this impossible. If an elderly person does not have other assets or income
to pay for care, but does own a house, the local authority can put a charge
on the property and recoup the cost of care when eventually it is sold.
Transferring ownership of the property to the next generation does not
prevent this. If a court decides that a person has disposed of assets to
increase his entitlement to state help, he is treated as if he still owned
the property.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: If you were a loser . . . - Paul
Cooper tells what to do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of risky home-income plans late in the 1980s have led to a flood of
compensation claims. If you were advised to borrow for speculative
investment, and could not afford the risk of losing money, you should have a
valid case. Here is what to do:
Was the person who gave the advice authorised to do so? If so, compensation
should be available - but there is no compensation for unauthorised
advisers. You could sue but, in most cases, this is not worthwhile.
Negotiations with the mortgage lender might help; so might professional aid.
Ask Age Concern for its list of specialist lawyers.
Some advisers practised before their application for authorisation was
approved. The Investors Compensation Scheme (ICS) excludes pay-outs even if
the advisers qualified later - unless you can show advice also was given
after authorisation.
Was the salesman authorised by Fimbra or Lautro (the regulatory bodies)? If
the answer is Lautro, you are lucky. You will get more compensation, faster,
because the Lautro/insurance ombudsman bureau guidelines have a clear
procedure for such cases. The insurance ombudsman normally makes distress
awards of up to Pounds 5,000 (the average is around Pounds 1,500),
especially where the life company has taken a year or two dealing with the
complaint (although this is normal).
Since Lautro members in breach of the rules must ensure that clients are not
worse off because of their investments, the ombudsman does not subtract
money spent by investors when they were led to believe there were no risks
attached to doing so. Investors spent the money they received believing it
was interest on their home's capital. In reality, they were consuming the
capital itself.
If, however, the adviser was authorised by Fimbra, you are likely to receive
less since there is a compensation ceiling (of Pounds 48,000 per claim) and
there is no obligation to return people to the position in which they would
have been had they not invested.
What should I do? Having established whether the person giving the advice
was authorised or not, make a complaint about the advice received to the
insurance company or the Fimbra firm, asking for compensation.
What are the pitfalls with a Lautro firm? It might resist your claim or take
a lot of time investigating it. If there are no results after two months,
take your claim to the insurance ombudsman or the recently-started PIA
ombudsman. Do not accept any offer without insisting on a review by the
ombudsman.
What are the problems with a small Fimbra firm? There is a danger that it
might not exist, given the number of firms which Fimbra has de-recognised
over the past few years. Call Fimbra (071-538 8860) to check, giving the
firm's postcode. If the firm has ceased trading, ask if the ICS has declared
a default. If it has, write to the ICS at 2 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8SR,
registering your claim. Expect compensation within nine-18 months. If not,
tell the ICS your problem and ask for a default declaration. Expect
compensation within two years.
What are the problems with a larger Fimbra firm? If the firm is still
trading and disputes liability, you can either get legal aid and sue; apply
to the PIA ombudsman; or, in certain cases, apply for Fimbra arbitration.
What are the risks of arbitration? It is a binding legal procedure and
awards cannot usually be appealed.
Paul Cooper is principal of CLAIMS, which investigates cases of bad advice.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pensioners who are counting on the government's proposed minimum solvency
requirements as insurance that their pension benefits will be paid in full
should consider the case of Swan Hunter. The shipyard, now almost certainly
facing receivership, has had to tell its members that as much as 40 per cent
of their pension entitlement will be lost. The irony is that according to
the scheme's actuary, it technically is nearly 100 per cent fully funded as
measured by the new solvency requirement.

The Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, this week
proposed greater deregulation in the unit trust industry with a series of
measures which are to come into effect on November 1. Unit trusts will be
able to impose exit charges and will not have to publish the cancellation
price - the lowest price at which units can be sold - in the national press.
In addition the terms 'offer' - the price at which units are bought - and
'bid' - the price at which they are sold - have been removed from the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New net lending by building societies fell in August to Pounds 3.02bn from
Pounds 3.24bn in July, underlining fears of a halt in the recovery of the
housing market. Net new commitments are loans agreed but not yet undertaken
and the figure is an important forward-looking indicator, since commitments
made in one month tend to translate into loans in the following few weeks.
Building society savings levels also fell in August compared to the previous
month with net receipts down to Pounds 91m compared to Pounds 286m in July.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: The threat of October chill looms - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has proved an uneasy truce. A little over a week ago, the resolve was
there: the course was set, the direction seemed clear. So why, so soon
after, are we back to that old prevaricating uncertainty, the vacillation
and the lack of conviction?
That question is not only being asked in US foreign policy circles, after
President Bill Clinton's apparent compromise with Haiti's military leaders a
week ago. The stock market, which also seemed to have achieved a new
resolution, has performed a flip-flop of its own over the last 10 days. Was
it really less than a fortnight ago that the Dow Jones Industrial Average
put on nearly 100 points over three days to rise above 3,950, flirting with
its all-time high? By midday yesterday in New York, it was back to 3,835.
What went wrong?
The loss of nerve (Wall Street's, that is) is the latest in a series of such
twists and turns this year. Investors and traders just cannot make up their
mind about how serious the threat of renewed inflation in the US economy is
 -or how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be in trying to kill it off
before it becomes a problem.
A belief that the inflationary bogey was retreating helped fuel that
earlier, brief rise in share prices. But as last week closed, the Cassandras
were in the ascendant again.
Foremost among the pessimists were Wayne Angell, the Bear Stearns chief
economist and a former Federal Reserve Board governor, and Robert Giordano,
director of economic research at Goldman Sachs. Both said they expected
another rise in US interest rates after the Federal Open Markets Committee,
the key policy-making group which determines interest rate policy, meets on
Tuesday. If they are right, that would make the sixth interest rate increase
since the Fed started nudging rates up in February.
Their views were based on such factors as the last set of producer price
inflation numbers, which have been out for a fortnight, and a rise in
industrial production and capacity utilisation, which was announced a week
ago. Although consumer price inflation seems subdued at present, such forces
will eventually feed through into higher prices in stores, the skeptics
fear. Angell has also been sounding alarms all year about the rising gold
price, a market indicator that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said he
watches closely.
Higher interest rates hurt stock prices because they reduce companies'
profits, adding to the costs of servicing their debt while restraining
consumer demand for their products. Also, they increase the attraction of
keeping money in the bank or in short-term debt instruments, relative to
holding shares.
If the Fed committee does decide that rates should rise, it could,
paradoxically, give the stock market something of a lift. The first two US
interest rate hikes, in February and March, caught traders by surprise and
devastated share prices. Since then, though, the stock market has adapted to
this new phase of the market: by marking share prices down in anticipation
of an interest rate rise, traders leave less room for surprise. The bad
news, when it comes, is at least put behind the market.
That, at least, was the reaction to the Fed's last two rate hikes, on 17 May
(when the Dow jumped 50 points) and 16 August (when it rose 25 points.) Each
time, it seemed that the Fed would not have to act again for some months. If
rates go up for a sixth time next week, though, how confident will the
market be that this time really is the last?
Whatever the short-term reaction, it seems likely that the stock market will
have trouble rallying much until bond investors regain some of their lost
confidence. While stocks have continued to bump along close to their
all-time highs, in spite of the volatility, bonds have slid steadily. At 7.8
per cent, up around 13 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) on
the week, the yield on 30-year government bonds is at its highest level
since for more than two years (lower prices equate to higher yields.) At
yesterday's level, the yield on long-term bonds is 3 percentage points
higher than at the peak of the market's peak last October.
Over the same period, the dividend yield on shares has remained essentially
flat, at less than 3 per cent. As the gap between bond and equity yields
widens like this, it becomes ever-harder to justify holding shares: either
bond prices will have to rise (bringing the yield down,) or share prices
will have to fall (lifting the dividend yield.)
Against this background, warnings of a 10 per cent 'correction' (to you and
me, that means fall) in share prices continue to echo around Wall Street.
And, as one or two commentators are beginning to point out, it is nearly
October again - the stock market's favourite month for a collapse.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: A glimmer in the September gloom - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS, financial news editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market's black September lightened a touch near the week's end,
but equities continued to feel sore from a whiplash of shunts from the US
and bumps from Germany. There was little domestic comfort either, as it
became clear just how decisively last week's interest rate rise has
transformed the investment outlook.
Until the modest recovery on Thursday and Friday, September had developed
into the cruellest month for equities in 1994, with the FT-A All-Share index
already showing a bigger decline than the 6.78 per cent drop it suffered in
March.
As well as equinoxes and unsettled weather, those two months also mark the
high tides of corporate reporting. The September peak has passed, with most
companies providing little grounds for optimism to offset the prevailing
malaise.
On Wednesday, Kleinwort Benson Securities translated this sentiment into
hard numbers, cutting its forecast for earnings growth in 1995 from 10 per
cent to 8 per cent and counselling clients to look towards bonds rather than
equities for the time being.
It will not be easy in bonds either. The yield on 10-year gilts breached 9
per cent on Tuesday for the first time since October 1992. By yesterday,
however, it was down to 8.86 per cent. The government bonds market took in
its stride news both of a Pounds 2bn gilts auction, on the low side of
expectations in terms of size, and the German announcement of a rare issue
of floating-rate bunds. The latter proved a puzzlement, giving no explicit
pointers to the timing - or direction - of the Bundesbank's next interest
rate move. London was evenly divided between judging the move desperate or
clever.
Figures published on Tuesday showed a lower than expected rise in bank and
building society lending and a fall in lending to the corporate sector in
August. This helped to allay worries of inflationary pressures, although the
British Bankers Association also noted a jump in lending to individuals and
a fifth monthly rise in consumer credit, suggesting that the April tax
increases were beginning to be felt in household budgets.
Friday's GDP figures not only appeared to bear this out, but indicated the
squeeze had begun even earlier. According to these data, real personal
disposable income fell by 1.8 per cent between the first and second quarters
of 1994, the biggest such decline for 13 years. But some analysts noted that
the figures were contradicted by strong retail sales data in the second
quarter.
Never mind the ambiguity, equities found solace in even a hint of news that
arrested the slide. The FT-SE 100 index gained 7 to 3028.2 on Friday, to
limit its loss for the week to 36.9 points.
The worst day was Tuesday when a widening US trade deficit spooked markets
everywhere and cost the FT-SE 100 41.8 points. But the next day brought
better than expected German money supply figures, which gave London a
respite, before US housing statistics knocked shares down again.
While most of the market was in the dumps, Browning-Ferris Industries of the
US thought it could find treasure in trash. It launched a surprise takeover
bid for Attwoods, which has attracted as much attention over the years for
the colourful characters on its board and in its orbit as for the garbage
business itself. Attwoods said 'rubbish', in Cityspeak, to the Pounds 564m
bid and its shares now stand at 116p, against BFI's 109p offer.
A dawn raid by the Mirror Group picked up 14.9 per cent of Scottish
Television's shares for Pounds 37.4m. Although Mirror, as a national
newspaper publisher, faces a 20 per cent regulatory cap on its potential
stake in the ITV company, the shares of other medium-fry regional
broadcasters jumped.
Another rare pillar of support came in the electricity distribution sector
where Northern Electric helped to buoy sentiment by buying in 10 per cent of
its shares.
And drugs proved a more pleasant distraction than for the Liberal Democrats
in Brighton. Speculation about a merger between pharmaceutical giants Zeneca
and Wellcome pushed their respective shares 1.4 and 4.1 per cent higher on
the week, although their attractions faded as the general market firmed.
Spirits were not as high at Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. United
Distillers, on which Guinness relies for two thirds of its profits, saw
first-half operating profits fall by more than 4 per cent to Pounds 258m.
GrandMet devoted more than half of a Pounds 280m restructuring charge to a
shake-up at International Distillers and Vintners, the world's biggest
spirits producer. Speaking of dog's breakfasts, GrandMet also sold its US
pet food brand Alpo to Nestle for Dollars 510m (Pounds 325m).
British Aerospace trebled its interim underlying profits to Pounds 90m, but
worried the market with increased losses on commercial aircraft and a Pounds
115m cash outflow in spite of selling Rover to BMW for Pounds 800m. Its
shares initially fell 26p to 445p, but recovered most of the loss by Friday.
A BAe spin-off was one of two recent flotations whose price charts now
resemble Niagara Falls. Aerostructures Hamble, bought by management from BAe
in 1990, fell 50p to 73p after warning of problems with contracts. It
floated at 120p barely three months ago. McDonnell Information Systems,
which came to market in March at 260p, saw its price cut in half to 112p on
poor interim results.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: Singing the new-issue blues - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next few weeks, investors will be bombarded with share offers from
companies floating on the stock market as the autumn season of new issues
gets under way. Recent events may make them think harder before signing the
cheque.
On Wednesday, shares in Aerostructures Hamble almost halved when the former
British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary, which was floated in May,
issued a profits warning. The next day, there was an even more dramatic
slump at McDonnell Information Systems (MDIS), which came to market at 260p
in March. Following its admission that profits would fall this year, the
shares tumbled to 112p.
'Told you so,' said those who had warned that this year's bumper crop of
flotations contained a number of over-priced, over-hyped issues that would
soon go bad. There have been plenty of disappointments already, including
the high-profile problems of MAID and the even more spectacular flops of DRS
and Coda. But the evidence suggests that the successes still outweigh the
duds.
The table shows the best and worst performers among the 84 UK trading
companies worth over Pounds 10m which have floated so far this year. The
share price performance is measured against the FT All-Share index from the
first day of dealing until the close of trading on Thursday.
The average is a gain of 5.8 per cent. This is influenced heavily by some
spectacular increases from very small companies such as Magnum Power and
Waste Recycling. But the average, weighted by market value, would also be
ahead thanks to good increases from 3i (up 24.7 per cent) and House of
Fraser (up 19.6 per cent).
Yet, the gain is hardly impressive given that new issues are priced to give
a reasonable premium on first dealings. For private investors, the evidence
is less encouraging still. Of the top 10 performers, all but two - Inspec
and Alpha Airports - were placings with institutions, whereas half the worst
performers were marketed to the public. The average for those flotations in
the sample, where there was either an offer direct to the public or through
intermediaries, was a decline of 1.3 per cent.
This squares with most academic studies of initial public offerings which
show that, despite the initial premium, they perform much in line with
similar companies that are quoted already.
One possible explanation is that companies tend to come to market when their
profits are strong and their sector is in fashion. But fashions change - as
those investors who bought some of the flood of electronics issues early in
the 1980s found to their cost.
One of the attractions of buying shares in a flotation is that, in theory,
the company should have been scrutinised carefully by its advisers. But, as
last week shows, the fact that names likes Baring or Rothschild appear on a
prospectus does not make something a risk-less investment.
When it comes to assessing those risks, it is tempting to look for patterns
in the recent flops. Certainly, it is striking that both Aerostructures and
MDIS were recent management buy-outs, and some observers argue that the
relatively poor performance of this year's new issue crop reflects the many
MBOs. Yet, studies in the US suggest that MBOs tend to out-pace other
companies after flotation - and the fourth-best performer this year has been
Inspec, the specialty chemicals company which was a managment buy-in/buy-out
from BP.
It would also be wrong to read too much into the poor performance of
computer and technology companies. DRS, MAID, MDIS and Coda all made the
bottom 10 and Chiroscience was the latest of the bio-technology flotations
to disappoint. But Ideal Hardware, Radstone Technology, Unipalm and
Cedardata all made good progress while Magnum Power, which developed a cheap
power supply for personal computers, made the top spot.
Magnum, a four-year-old company which lost Pounds 1.23m on turnover of just
Pounds 59,000 last year, was probably the most risky of this crop of
flotations. But it has been the most rewarding. In most respects, new issues
are no different from other shares. Investors should judge them on the same
basis.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: Freeing trusts to roam the world - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investment Board's creeping overhaul of the unit trust
industry's rulebook combines deregulation with improved disclosure. The
British nanny mindset is giving way to the American idea that the investor
can be expected to look out for himself provided he is given all the
relevant information.
This week's tinkering came from two directions. The SIB itself (the top
watchdog) proposed changes to several aspects of the rulebook. And its
offshoot, the Personal Investment Authority (concerned with products sold to
the public) published its disclosure proposals for unit trusts.
The PIA's disclosure proposals are discussed on page VII, where they get a
'beta minus': generally OK but the information on the effect of charges on
your investment needs to be far more clearly set out. Charges on an average
long- term investment in a unit trust have roughly trebled in the last 15
years. And although low charges cannot turn a dud fund into a star, they can
drag a star down to earth. Would it not be helpful actually to illustrate
the effect of such charges?
The SIB's loosening of its controls on authorised trusts does three things:
it allows unit trust managers the charging freedom already enjoyed by
managers of unit trusts wrapped inside a Personal Equity Plan; it gives them
greater freedom to decide where to invest; and it simplifies the price
information which trusts are required to publish.
The price simplification gets rid of the requirement to publish the
cancellation price, and is part of 'moves to a more user-friendly
terminology'. Fair enough, although the cancellation price was actually
useful to the handful of unit trust investors who understood it. If the bid
price (what you get when you sell your units) is the same as the
cancellation price, it means you are getting the lowest possible price the
managers are allowed to pay. When share prices are generally on the rise
fund managers pay slightly more than the minimum when buying units  - so
that they can also charge the maximum permissible when selling units.
The relaxation in investment restrictions is in many ways the most
interesting change - for it may allow managers of emerging markets funds to
do a better job. At the moment authorised unit trusts have to keep 90 per
cent of their money in markets on the SIB's rather staid 'approved' list.
Only 10 per cent can go into unapproved markets.
But most of the stockmarkets in south east Asia and South America are not on
the list. So unit trust managers wanting a broad spread across markets in
these areas have two choices: they can run the trust from an offshore centre
such as Dublin or Luxembourg, which has different rules; or they can use
circuitous (and probably costly) routes to get the same portfolio spread.
The SIB change will push responsibility for deciding which markets are
suitable on to the fund managers and their trustees. They will still be
bound by the 90-safe; 10- hairy rule. But it will be up to them to define
the boundaries. It is a welcome change, but, like all freedoms, capable of
being abused. So keep a close eye on the lists of 'eligible markets' that
many funds will start publishing later this year.
Creative accountancy is like plastic surgery: it does not of itself delay
the final reckonning; but it stops the outside world noticing mortal decay
at work. And an appearance of youth may help the moribund to cut a few final
capers.
Indeed, in a company context, a hyperactive bid programme can sometimes be a
sign that the company cannot afford to slow down.
Take Coloroll. This acquisitive little conglomerate had a market value of
just Pounds 37m when it was floated in 1985. Over the next four years it
spent Pounds 400m on a raft of acquisitions, exploiting acquisition and
merger accounting techniques in order to enhance profits to the detriment of
its balance sheet.*
Its most startling ploy was spending Pounds 213m on a textile company called
Crowther, and promptly knocking Pounds 224m off its balance sheet value. The
point of this masochistic-seeming manoeuvre was that these massive
provisions were then available to absorb future costs, and so boost future
profits. Fine, but eventually the grim reaper caught up with Coloroll: in
1990 the company went bust.
This is one of the more lurid examples of the kind of abuse two new
accounting standards outlaw. The standards from the Accounting Standards
Board, catchily entitled FRS6 and FRS7, demand that provisions be charged
against profits. Most investors can spot a charge against profits; they are
less likely to notice balance sheet shenanigans.
Critics argue that charging capital costs against revenue is as bad as
sweeping revenue costs into the balance sheet. Maybe. But if that means that
managers are forced to put clearer explanations into the annual report, that
is all to the good. And if it stops them making silly acquisitions at all,
that is even better.
Creative accountancy is only necessary if the managers have something to
hide. If they remain paragons of commonsense and long-term planning, they
should have no qualms about showing all.

FT  24 SEP 94 / D-Mark, D-Mark, uber alles?: When Germany was reunified,
Europe trembled. David Marsh investigates whether those fears are being
borne out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visions of a united and aggressive Germany, economically far stronger than
the Third Reich, have worried many others besides Lady Thatcher, the former
British prime minister.
After the collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, such fears were
voiced throughout Europe. They were a strong motive behind the plan
sponsored by the French government and the European Commission to create a
single European currency under international control, and so limit the new
Germany's economic independence.
But monetary union appears increasingly uncertain, not least because of
doubts in Germany; meanwhile the German economic machine is moving once
again steadily forward. . .
So how long will it take for the eastern and western parts of the nation to
grow together? Will the Germans rediscover a sense of national identity
after 40 years of division? And then, most important, and potentially
alarming: will the Germans again dominate Europe?
Four years after the two Germanys were united, the answers are starting to
crystallise. First, although economic growth has resumed after the early
shock of unification, eastern Germany will not catch up with the west until
2010 at the earliest - far later than the optimists (including Chancellor
Helmut Kohl) forecast in 1990.
Second, national solidarity seems to have diminished rather than
strengthened since 1989. Mass unemployment in the east, and the heavy cost
to west German taxpayers of DM150bn in subsidies paid annually to the east,
have caused resentment on both sides of the Elbe.
A recent opinion poll indicated that only 28 per cent of Germans in the
east, and 47 per cent of those in the west, regarded the German nation as
'one people' - many fewer than four years ago. The poll also showed a strong
consensus that the D-Mark should not be abandoned in favour of a single
Euro-currency.
Third, united Germany is not in a dominant mood - nor does it look likely to
be. Although larger than the old Federal Republic, it is weaker in political
balance, in economic structure, in ability to govern itself, in capacity to
exert patient influence on its neighbours. Indeed, a wish to preserve the
D-Mark seems to symbolise a desire for national continuity rather than the
dominance of others.
Some of the anxieties of Germany's neighbours were allayed by the greater
than expected problems which it faced after unification. The country is
neither flourishing, as Kohl forecast, nor dominant, as Thatcher feared.
This summer, Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary told the German
magazine Der Spiegel that his former boss's fears were 'her chief foreign
policy mistake after the fall of the Berlin Wall.'
Indeed, Germany's energies will be largely absorbed by its domestic
challenges at least until the end of the century. During four decades of
division, the Federal Republic, closely integrated with the West, grew
wealthy, comfortable and indecisive. It became a country of efficiency and
self-effacement: its speciality was no longer motorised war but motorised
holidays. As the events of 1989-90 showed, it was not a country that could
carry out the radical reordering of national priorities made necessary by
the huge task of unification.
Although Kohl's stature gained greatly from the triumph of unity, it was
weakened by the difficulties which followed. If the chancellor's position is
further undermined in the October 16 general election opportunities for
vigorous government leadership could diminish further.
Those still anxious about Germany might consider the following statistics:
In 1970, West Germany accounted for 29 per cent of the total income of the
12 countries now in the European Union. In 1993 united Germany's share of
the EU's income was slightly lower at 28 per cent. United Germany's share of
world output last year was about 7.5 per cent compared with 9 per cent in
1970 for West Germany alone. (The US's share last year was 27 per cent,
Japan's 16 per cent)
The takeover of moribund East Germany has made the Federal Republic - for
the time being - a poorer country.
A good place to see how Germany has been transformed is the town of Jena, in
Thuringia, in eastern Germany, the home of Carl Zeiss, the world-famous
optical group. This was one of the successes among the German Democratic
Republic's battered industrial enterprises. Tower cranes soar over
rubble-strewn building sites, while excavators and sparkling new glass
offices glint against the still-drab background of pre-war apartment blocks.
Zeiss has benefited from DM3bn in public sector grants, yet - as the result
of mass layoffs since unification - unemployment in the town has risen to
nearly 30 per cent.
Jena's future is unquestionably brighter than five years ago. But people
shopping in the sunshine last week made no secret of their disillusionment.
A middle-aged dental assistant spoke of the 'misery' of her unemployed
friends, while a young pram-pushing mother said east Germans had been
unprepared for the hardships that followed unification.
Lothar Spath, the chairman of Jenoptik, the company set up by the Thuringian
state government to run part of the old Zeiss activities, admits that the
Bonn government underestimated the size of the task. Three years ago, Spath,
a one-time ally of Helmut Kohl and former premier of the prosperous west
German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, took on the job of trying to attract
hi-tech investment to Thuringia.
In a coolly-furnished office high in Jenoptik's renovated headquarters in
central Jena, Spath says west Germans must accept the need to subsidise the
east for 10 to 15 years, although at a declining rate.
Spath says, with a Swabian chuckle, that west Germans' reluctance to take
decisive action to help overcome east Germany's difficulties may have added
DM100bn to the reunification bill. However, this has brought some
advantages. 'Our neighbours would have been far more nervous if, with
typical German thoroughness, we had all been ready to make big sacrifices. I
am not unhappy that there was no great national enthusiasm. It is good that
we can point out to foreigners that the west Germans are speaking badly
about the east Germans, and vice versa.'
As for the worry that Germany will flex its economic muscles on its
neighbours, Spath says: 'We will be the leading economy in Europe, but we
will not be dominant. The big international corporations are taking ever
less consideration of national boundaries. In future, a lorry driver in
Australia will never know that the axle comes from Brazil, the coachwork
from Indonesia, the motor from Hungary and the know-how, perhaps from
Germany. This globalisation means that we will no longer be able to talk of
countries running dominant economic policies - which will be for the good of
Europe.'
Jochen Bergmann, the head of the Jena Chamber of Industry and Commerce,
takes a similarly internationalist line: 'I don't understand all this talk
of domination. We need a strong Germany, a strong France and a strong
Britain to stand up to the competition from China.'
The German economy now looks a great deal more healthy following the sharp
1992-93 recession in the west and the shattering 40 per cent economic
contraction in east Germany in 1990 and 1991. Germany is now on course for
2.5 per cent expansion this year, while east Germany - where per capita
income is still only 40 per cent of levels in the west  - is growing at an
annual 8 per cent to 10 per cent.
However, earlier reluctance to reduce the high costs of Germany's
manufacturing base has stored up pain for the future, according to Roland
Berger, who heads the Munich-based firm of management consultants bearing
his name.
Berger, whose company is owned by the Deutsche Bank, says high wage rises in
the early period after unification have further reduced Germany's
international competitiveness. He says west Germans need to cut their living
standards further during the next few years. And he forecasts that
manufacturing industry will become relatively less important in the economy,
as employment is switched to low-cost manufacturing sites abroad. Although
Berger forecasts an increase in employment in the under-developed service
sector, he believes that 2m jobs may be lost in the vulnerable sectors
during the next three or four years.
Herbert Henzler, chairman of the German operations of the McKinsey
management consultants, also takes a gloomy view. In spite of this year's
much better than expected German export performance, he says, 'A 30 to 40
per cent gap in production costs (compared with competitors in Asia and the
US) cannot be made up in a few months.'
Germany's economic problems reflect insufficient innovation and dynamism, he
says. 'Not enough is coming out of our research centres. For an average
young German business studies graduate, the idea of rolling up his sleeves,
starting a business with his wife and possibly working himself to death is
much too abstruse even to be considered.'
Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry
(BDI), is less pessimistic - but admits that German industry's drive to
become more competitive is taking its toll on employment.
'In two or three years' time, German industry will have recovered
brilliantly. The share of manufacturing will be lower, but we will be fully
competitive. We will preserve the heart of our economic system. But the
concept of 'Made in Germany' will be replaced by 'Designed in Germany'.'
Back in 1990, Europe's leading statesmen were so anxious about renascent
Germany's economic strength that they agreed in Maastricht that European
economic and monetary union should begin as early as 1997 or 1999. As
France's former president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing put it earlier this
year: 'We need an organised Europe to escape German domination.'
In spite of the domestic unpopularity of the plan, Kohl agreed to monetary
union. He wanted to show that united Germany would remain a firm supporter
of western European integration. Now, however, scepticism about a common
currency in the business community and among ordinary Germans, makes that
timetable highly questionble.
Karl Lamers, a Christian Democrat Bundestag deputy and foreign policy
specialist, is one of those who suggested a controversial plan earlier this
month that a common currency should apply at first to a 'core group'
excluding Italy. Even an enthusiast for monetary union like Lamers says that
prospects for a single currency will recede unless Europe's leaders make
progress towards the idea of political union and a 'federal' Europe when
they meet to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996. However, polls show that
a large majority of Germans agree with Euro-sceptics in Britain and
elsewhere that they do not want a 'United States of Europe'.
Holger Schmieding, an economist from Kiel university, now senior strategist
at Merrill Lynch's Frankfurt office, believes the original rationale for
monetary union is now outdated. There is no longer a need, he says to 'bind'
Germany to western Europe to stop it turning eastwards. 'The idea of Europe
being divided into east and west is outdated. Poland and the Czech Republic
will soon become normal countries.'
Germany might, indeed, suggest that monetary union should be postponed to
allow as many countries as possible - including those from central and
eastern Europe - eventually to join a single currency area. Under such an
outcome, in view of Germany's large and growing economic influence over the
former communist countries, the single European currency would become little
more than an enlarged D-Mark.
Would the outcome of 'D-Mark uber alles' confirm the worst nightmares of
Thatcher and Giscard d'Estaing? Or could a strong and stable D-Mark,
extended to other countries under the guiding hand of the German Bundesbank,
prove the most solid basis for expanding Europe's prosperity? German
financial and economic power will unquestionably grow rapidly during the
next two decades. Germany's task, in concert with its neighbours, will be to
ensure that, for the first time in history, the power of united Germany is
deployed benignly rather than for ill - and that the nightmares never
return.
David Marsh's book Germany and Europe: The Crisis of Unity is published by
William Heinemann on September 26. It appears in German as Der zaudernde
Riese: Deutschland in Europa (C. Bertelsmann).

FT  24 SEP 94 / The Long View: When numbers deceive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Truth is an elusive concept, in the financial markets as anywhere else.
Whatever the scope for developing measurement standards of precise technical
accuracy, the commercial pressures will often dictate a blurring of the
vision. Harsh numbers can create discontent, unless tweaked or evaded.
This week, I have spent an instructive few days in Edinburgh at a congress
of European financial analysts who are, rightly, concerned about whether the
companies in which they invest are telling the truth about their
performance. But, too often, the analysts are in turn busily pulling the
wool over the eyes of their own clients, whether pension plans or investors
in mutual funds.
The argument for accurate financial reporting by listed companies is simple
and powerful. Only if clear and honest numbers are reported can share prices
be set accurately by the markets, so that capital can flow in an efficient
way to the most attractive investment opportunities. At the same time, it
can be withdrawn from enterprises that have large quantities of capital
employed but can only achieve low returns.
In the real world, however, companies rarely produce strong and progressive
profit figures. There are awkward fluctations, even in the profits of
successful companies. So, finance directors are tempted to iron out the
variations, to generate the nice, smooth sequence of profit numbers that the
stock market appears to want.
One of the dodges employed by British companies has been to use take-overs
as a cover for profit smoothing. The rules of acquisition accounting have,
until now, permitted companies to set up large balance sheet provisions to
cover the direct costs of acquisitions and the subsequent expenses of
restructuring.
Far from mergers being expensive and disruptive, which is the economic
reality, the accounting presentation has been that takeovers often generate
immediate earnings gains. Hence the uproar this week when finance directors
attacked the restrictive new draft accounting standard, FRS7, which curbs
the ability of acquisitive companies to shuffle take-over costs from their
profit and loss accounts and bury them in their balance sheets.
In Edinburgh, the chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, Sir David
Tweedie, pointed out to the analysts that this was simply one more stage in
the process of eliminating creative accounting. Already, the 'extraordinary'
items which used to litter the accounts of British companies have been
eliminated.
The old rule was that exceptional items counted towards earnings per share
but extraordinary items did not. Oddly enough, exceptionals almost always
seemed to be positive but extraordinaries were negative. It is, however,
still possible to play a game with exceptional items, as is shown by the
practice of 'big bath' provisions.
The stock market can, perhaps, be persuaded that so-called 'charges' set up
in anticipation of restructuring expenses or redundancy costs are unusual
and do not reduce - indeed, may even improve - the future earnings
potential. Grand Metropolitan tried this one on Monday for the second time
in less than a year. But if such provisions become routine, how can they be
described as exceptional?
Fragile accounting concepts can take a terrible battering when major
commercial objectives are at stake. But do the financial analysts have their
own hostages to fortune here? Murky things can also go on when fund managers
present their own investment returns, and it is interesting that the
European analysts have set up their own commission to attempt to raise
standards in this area.
Often, the whole embarrassing subject of investment performance is avoided
carefully. During the Edinburgh conference, for instance, four Scottish
investment institutions - Standard Life, Scottish Widows, Murray Johnstone
and Baillie Gifford - outlined their achievements and their strategies. None
offered performance data of any kind, an omission equivalent to four major
listed companies giving presentations without mentioning their profits or
their returns on capital.
The uncomfortable underlying truth, of course, is that most fund managers
produce unexciting results: indeed, by mathematical principle, the average
manager cannot beat the index. Moreover, academics have shown that most
managers who do outperform for short periods do so simply by chance.
(Incidentally, on a slightly different subject, a French professor, Bertrand
Jacquillat, presented a study which indicated that analysts working for
brokers who attempt to forecast company profits also show no signs of
consistently beating the herd. Such results do not show that the analysts
are incompetent but, rather, that the markets are efficient).
The European analysts - the European Federations of Financial Analysts'
Societies, to give them their full title - are setting up a commission to
try to sort out the jungle of performance measurement. At present, it is
notorious that investment houses tend to cherry-pick their best-performing
funds and individual managers and present them as representative rather than
exceptional. Weak funds are, somehow, dropped. Everybody in the fund
management business, if you believe the claims, has a better-than-average
performance, at least over some carefully-selected period or other.
If chance and the law of averages are indeed the dominant influences, it
might be better to choose a below-average fund manager whose fortunes may be
on the turn rather than a top performer whose lucky streak is about to run
out. Ironically, the better and more reliable the performance numbers
become, the more irrelevant they may be seen to be. Truth may be less
influential than fiction.

FT correspondents around the world had no problem in letting their

Somewhere in the world is the perfect home. If you had your pick of the best
properties in major cities what would you select? A mansion? A penthouse? A
riverside palace? We asked FT correspondents to let their dreams run riot .
. .
LONDON
The best flat in London only partly exists, writes Gerald Cadogan. Even so,
it costs Pounds 15m, which buys a two-floor penthouse newly-built on top of
Fountain House, a handsome 1930s apartment block next to the Grosvenor House
Hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair.
The flat has superb views, especially westwards over Hyde Park, the
Serpentine and the Albert Memorial, which from up top looks like a rocket
about to set off from Cape Canaveral.
Grosvenor House is across Mount Street to the north. On the east and south
the immediate views are over the late 19th century red brick and white stone
mansions of Mayfair, which are becoming smarter every day as they return
from office to residential.
Skips and scaffolding cram the streets now, but enough has already been
refurbished to show how classy the resurrected Mayfair will be.
In this superb position, in the heart of London, the penthouse occupies the
whole of the top of the building. Some Pounds 15m buys a shell of 15,500 sq
ft, basement parking for 12 cars, and an express lift to get to them, and
nothing more.
There is still the cost of fitting out this huge space, 1 1/2 times the size
of even the larger Mayfair mansions, and deciding where to put the partition
walls. The top floor has mansard roof - a Parisian attic on a mega-scale,
fit for a Mayfair lady.
WA Ellis (071-581 7654) and Wetherell (071-493 6935) are joint sole agents
for a 250-year lease. If the penthouse does not sell as whole, they will
offer it as four units. But I cannot see how some person of wealth could let
this opportunity slip by.
NEW YORK
A morning stroll down Central Park South reveals something important about
living in a vertical city like New York, thinks Frank McGurty. On the north
side, the grassy verges along the edge of the park are dotted with
slumbering forms twisted into unnatural positions by the indignities of life
on the streets.
Across the way, majestic apartment towers rise out of the pavement like
genteel citadels against the travails below. Here, the wealthiest New
Yorkers reconcile their need for comfort and security with their intense
desire to be enveloped by the city's richness and vitality.
Alice Tully, a renowned patron of the arts and a generous benefactor of the
needy, was one of the most successful at achieving this balance. Before her
death last year, aged 91, she found sanctuary in an extravagant 14-room flat
which occupied the entire 27th floor of the Hampshire House hotel.
Her eyrie floats high above the very nexus of the city. Equidistant from the
up-market shops of the east side and the chamber music hall at Lincoln
Centre which bears her name, the residence offers unmatched accessibility to
New York's delights.
Yet, amid its lavish elegance, a visitor feels a comforting sense of
distance. The vista from the front terrace, situated at the mid-point of
Central Park's south face, encourages the illusion of a graceful and
purposeful city where gentle woodlands and water-courses are framed neatly
by gardens of urban architecture.
Inside, Tully created the illusion of an 18th-century Venetian palazzo. Its
eccentric ramble of rooms - both intimate and grand - stands in refreshing
contrast to the sterility of most New York flats, even at the very high end
of the market.
The music room, a sumptuous space with 18ft ceilings and double-height
French windows, lies at the heart of this whimsical maze. In its stately
elegance, the philanthropist indulged her greatest passion in a style which
every New Yorker would envy.
Alas, few of them could afford it. The asking price is Dollars 7m - plus
Dollars 22,800 a month in service charges.
PARIS
If I was going for grandeur I would chuck out the Rothschilds and move into
Hotel Lambert, their 17th century townhouse on the Ile Saint-Louis, says
Alice Rawsthorn. If I wanted something more modern, I would have to choose
between Pierre Chareau's exquisitely eccentric Maison de Verre, in
Saint-Germain des Pres, or Rem Koolhaas's cool contemporary Villa d'Alba in
Saint-Cloud.
But there is only one serious contender for my perfect Parisian pad - Villa
Savoye, the white-walled house in a buttercup field in the western suburb of
Poissy, which was the last and the loveliest of the purist villas designed
in the 1920s by Le Corbusier.
It says a great deal about the house that it could coax an unreconstucted
urbanite like me into an insalubrious suburb like Poissy. Villa Savoye would
be worth it. It is a dream of a house: the perfect blend of Le Corbusier's
architectural theory with a sensuous sense of space.
Villa Savoye was built in 1931 as the home of the Savoyes, an insurance
magnate and his wife. The exterior is the same perfectly proportioned blend
of soft curves and straight lines that is so appealing in Le Corbusier's
bigger buildings. The main rooms are raised on columns above the ground so
that the house seems to float among the trees. The columns form a circle
specially measured so that the Savoyes' chauffeur could whisk them to the
door with a single turn of their Hispano Suiza's steering wheel.
The only hitch is that Villa Savoye is not on the market, nor is it likely
to be in its guise as a French national monument.
SINGAPORE
It is much better to throw mods and cons into the tropical breeze and go for
traditional, colonial style, writes Kieran Cooke. A house in the Mount
Pleasant area, only about 15 minutes drive from the downtown business
district, would be my ideal. You crunch your way up the drive to a
two-storey black and white house. A verandah as big as a running track
stretches around the building. Here, in the hallway by the front door, is
where you sit and have a sundowner or play a rubber of bridge.
The proportions of the rooms are more than generous. Fans hanging from high
ceilings sloop away. The floors, made from the best tropical timbers, creak
underfoot. Outside, the lawn is lined with sweet smelling jacaranda trees
and hibiscus.
There are some inconveniences to living in the old style. There is little or
no air conditioning. Crawling objects might choose to climb into bed with
you and there are mosquitoes. But it is more what living in the tropics
should be about. And you do not have to be a millionaire to afford this
ideal. A three-bedroomed house, with substantial garden and pool, plus
servants quarters, could cost just SDollars 12,000 to SDollars 18,000 per
month.
TOKYO
The ideal homes that Tokyoites are madly curious to know about are the four
penthouses on the 31st and 32nd floors of a luxury condominium complex
offered by Sapporo Breweries earlier this year, writes Emiko Terazono.
The other condominiums in the complex cost between Y123.7m (Pounds 808,400)
and Y486m (Pounds 3.177m) and have been snatched up by those who can afford
it. However, the company refuses to reveal the details and prices of the
penthouses, which it says are not for sale to the public.
Property analysts say the penthouses are likely to be the most luxurious
pieces of real estate to come on to the market in the last few years.
Sapporo says the development block, Yebisu Garden Place, in which the
condominium complex is situated, is itself a status symbol. Located in a
trendier part of town, residents of the condominiums have easy access to
high-rise office buildings, luxury hotels, restaurants and a shopping mall
all inside the block.
BERLIN
Property is scare, expensive and still plagued by claims from former owners
in east Berlin, writes Judy Dempsey. But do not despair. You will soon be
able to live in Stadtmitte, the heart of old Berlin.
It is likely to become the hub of the German capital and a clutch of luxury
apartments become available next summer when Tishman Speyer property
developers complete their exclusive retailing, shopping and housing complex
on Friedrichstrasse, a stone's throw from Checkpoint Charlie. No one could
ask for a better location, backing on to the Gendarmenmarkt. Renting is the
norm and expect to pay between DM40 and DM50 a square metre. You will not
regret it.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Rebate rise will offset personal pension charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government intends to increase the rebate it will pay after 1997 to
people who take out private pensions, to compensate for the high commission
and charges levied by insurance companies.
While the move will benefit personal pension holders, it is bound to be
controversial because it protects insurance companies at the expense of the
taxpayer. The rebate returns to personal pension holders a portion of the
national insurance contribution they currently pay.
But because the government is eager to encourage contracting-out through
personal pensions, it is determined to press ahead with additional payments
to cover providers' costs.
The government Actuary's Department is working out how much additional
rebate will be paid.
'The problem is that unless a rebate incorporates the costs of the provider,
it will never be 'best advice' to urge someone to contract out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme through a personal pension,' said one
government official familiar with the discussions.
The social security department said yesterday it had decided not to use its
powers under personal pensions legislation to cap insurance company charges.
Instead, it intends to rely on the regime due to be introduced in January,
which will disclose to customers how much they are paying in charges and
commissions when they take out a personal pension.
Actuaries at William M. Mercer and Co estimate that people who make no
contribution to their personal pension other than the national insurance
rebate pay between 4 per cent and 13 per cent of it to the insurance company
in costs. However, some life insurers also impose a flat-rate monthly charge
of Pounds 2 to Pounds 4 - revised upwards annually, usually according to
inflation.
The roughly 40 per cent of personal pension holders who make additional
contributions to their fund have such monthly charges levied automatically.
In addition, they pay annual fund management fees.
A personal pension holder earning a rebate of Pounds 100 per year could lose
Pounds 61 in charges.
Money Management magazine reports this month that 15 leading life insurers
levy flat rate charges and, even assuming investment returns of 10 per cent
per year, several companies will have exhausted the entire pension through
charges well before retirement age. The increased subsidy is part of a
system of age-related rebates on the national insurance contributions of
workers with personal pension plans.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Unilever detergent comes under renewed criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, suffered a fresh attack on its
new-generation washing powder yesterday.
The influential Consumers' Association in Britain said the first version of
the detergent produced 'substantial damage to some clothes' in laboratory
tests, even when 'normal recommended low-temperature programmes' were used.
Early tests by the association have also suggested that Unilever's
reformulated version of the detergent might damage clothes.
Unilever admitted on Thursday that the detergent - sold in Britain as Persil
Power and in continental Europe as Omo Power - was 'defective', but said
trouble arose only if it was used at high temperature.
The original version was launched this spring but replaced in June after
Procter &amp; Gamble, arch-rivals in the Pounds 6bn-a-year European detergent
market, said tests by it showed the detergent could 'rot' clothes. The
latest version contains less of the manganese catalyst 'accelerator' which
is the powder's patented ingredient.
Yesterday's attack came as Unilever was attempting to play down an admission
on Thursday by Mr Morris Tabaksblat, its Dutch co-chairman, that the company
had failed to apply 'appropriate safeguards' in tests before the launch.
Unilever said yesterday that laboratory tests gave only a distorted picture
of how the detergent performed.
'The defect the chairman referred to was only evident under extreme and
destructive laboratory conditions; it was quite irrelevant in real
conditions in consumers' homes. This product underwent field tests among
60,000 consumers throughout Europe over a period of two years,' the company
said.
However, Mr Derek Prentice, Consumers' Association assistant director, said
it was 'nonsense' to claim that it was only extreme conditions that caused
damage. 'Our independent tests on behalf of the consumer have shown that
there can be substantial damage to some clothes, under far from extreme
laboratory conditions designed to imitate normal washing, as far as
possible, without wearing.'
He added: 'Thousands of consumers are still using old and new formulations
of the detergent. They deserve a little more plain speaking from Unilever.'
Later on ITN's News at Ten, Mr Prentice said early tests showed that the
reformulated product also 'caused a far greater degree of fading (in
clothes) than we would normally expect to find in a washing powder.'
The association is conducting further tests, which involve a panel of
consumers wearing clothes and then taking them for laboratory washing.
Those tests, unlikely to be complete before December, will be on the old and
new formulations of the product.
Unilever said it believed very little of the original detergent was still in
use. It was 'baffled' as to why the association had intervened when its own
tests were incomplete.
'We reiterate that any laboratory tests do not reflect real life,' it said.

FT  24 SEP 94 / US telecoms reform bill abandoned in Senate: Baby Bells'
opposition forces sponsor to give up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts to pass the most sweeping overhaul of US telecommunications laws in
60 years appeared to die yesterday when the reform bill's chief sponsor in
the Senate gave up his efforts to win passage.
Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said he
was abandoning efforts to bring the bill to a vote on the Senate floor this
year because of opposition from the regional telephone companies.
Although White House officials are still working to revive
telecommunications reform, a version of which has already passed the House
of Representatives, congressional aides said there was little chance of
success.
With only two weeks left until Congress's probable adjournment for the
mid-term election campaign, there appeared to be no time left to work out a
compromise. However, several senators are planning to sponsor similar bills
in the next session of the senate.
Mr Hollings's committee had agreed last month to a draft bill which would
have established the timetable and conditions for allowing the Baby Bells -
the regional telephone groups which have a near-monopoly on local telephone
service in their respective areas - to enter other telecommunications
markets such as long-distance telephone and cable television services.
The Bells' activities are now restricted under the terms of the court order
which created them 10 years ago by breaking up the original AT&amp;T monopoly.
Although the Bells agreed to a compromise on the long-distance market that
allowed the bill to make its way out of the commerce committee, they
promised to fight for further changes on the Senate floor, especially over
the terms of their entry into the cable market.
Senator Robert Dole, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate,
had adopted many of the Bells' demands for further deregulation.
On Thursday, he submitted a list of demands, some of them labelled
non-negotiable, to Mr Hollings.
Other senators had promised to fight other aspects of the bill, especially a
domestic content requirement that would have obliged Baby Bells which wanted
to start manufacturing telecommunications equipment - currently prohibited
by the AT&amp;T court order - to site their factories in the US and buy most of
their components there.
Mr Hollings said that the Bells' opposition was 'mystifying in light of the
number of provisions and changes we have made in the bill on their behalf'.

FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a bad week for new issues. On Thursday, the share price of
MDIS, a software group floated in March, halved after it reported profits
below expectations. The day before Aerostructures Humble, an engineering
company floated in May, saw its shares fall 40 per cent after a profits
warning. Both companies were optimistic about prospects in their
prospectuses. What should investors conclude from such fiascos? Certainly
not that new issues are to be avoided. While new issues are not the easy
route to a quick profit that many used to think, there is no need to swing
to the opposite extreme. On average, companies floated this year have
slightly outperformed the market.
Investors should also resist the temptation to call for more regulation. The
regulations are already tough enough. Under the Financial Services Act,
companies and their advisers are liable for damages if they are negligent in
preparing a prospectus. Of course, it is hard to prove negligence, meaning
investors have little practical recourse. But tighter regulation would tie
companies and their advisers up in more red tape without giving investors
any complete guarantee. Nothing will change the fact that equities are a
risky investment. The best sanction is to keep a close eye on the banks that
sponsor issues that flop and avoid their deals if a poor track record
develops. For the record, MDIS's bank is Barings, while Aerostructures' is N
M Rothschild.
