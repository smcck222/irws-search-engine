FT  12 JUL 94 / Haiti observers told to leave in 48 hours

Haiti's military-backed government has given a team of more than 100 human
rights observers, representing the United Nations and the Organisation of
American States, 48 hours to leave the country, claiming they are a threat
to national security.
The move created a flurry of diplomatic activity in New York yesterday, as
the most senior officials of the UN and the OAS gathered to consider how to
respond to it.
Mr Dante Caputo, the UN's envoy to Haiti, said that neither Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, nor the head of the OAS had yet
determined how to handle the situation. But the UN was not going to be
pushed around.
A UN official said there were 40 UN staff and 64 representatives of the OAS,
all in Port au Prince, having concentrated in the capital after withdrawing
from other locations in the country. The regime had an obligation to
guarantee their protection but was not doing so, the official said.
The ultimatum to remove the international mission within 48 hours was
delivered without previous warning and the UN knew of no recent instance
that might have provoked it.
It was issued by the military government, which overthrew President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide almost three years ago, and is likely to further
anger the US and other governments that have been pushing the regime to step
down.
Haiti is under an international economic embargo, but the military has
refused to leave office.
The expulsion order stated that the observer mission should leave the
country 'in order to avoid an incident or provocation'. The government
ordered the mission to stop its work a week ago, but the UN General Assembly
subsequently renewed the mission's mandate on Friday.
Mr Caputo said yesterday that the expulsion was an outrageous provocation.
'The reasons are quite obvious. They kill people. They torture people. They
rape people. And they don't want any witnesses in their country.'
He said the expulsion would be discussed with the governments of Argentina,
Canada, France, the US and Venezuela - the 'friends of Haiti' - ahead of a
meeting scheduled for last night between Mr BoutrousGhali and Mr Christopher
Thomas, the acting secretary general of the OAS.
The government of the Caribbean island of Grenada has denied that it has
reached an agreement with the US to provide 'safe haven' to Haitians fleeing
their country. The government said it had received the US request, but had
not yet agreed to it.
The US government said last week that Grenada, Dominica and Antigua had
agreed to grant temporary asylum to Haitians until the political crisis
there had been resolved.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Parti Quebecois softens stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quebec's Parti Quebecois has toned down its separatist message in a clear
shift of strategy ahead of forthcoming elections in the francophone
province.
The PQ is currently well ahead of the ruling Liberals in public opinion
polls. But party leaders appear to have heeded findings that the PQ's
popularity stems more from voters' desire for a change of government than
from a dream of independence from the rest of Canada.
Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ leader, and other senior officials have recently
played down their earlier pledge to begin negotiations on sovereignty with
the federal government immediately after the election.
Instead, they have indicated that these talks will only begin after an
independence referendum, which the PQ has promised to hold within a year of
taking office. Some observers predict that even this timetable may turn out
to be flexible, depending on the mood of the electorate.
Mr Daniel Johnson, the province's premier, is expected to call an election
within the next two weeks for September 12.
The Liberals have been in office for nine years. Since taking over as
premier last January, Mr Johnson has tried to overcome the protest vote by
projecting an image of solid competence and by identifying the PQ with the
economic costs of independence.
Although it is still too early to count Mr Johnson out, even some of his
officials acknowledge that nothing short of a miracle can save the Liberals.
One problem for the Liberals is that their support is heavily concentrated
in the Montreal area.
Mr Johnson received another setback last weekend when Mr Claude Castonguay,
a prominent federalist and former Liberal cabinet minister, expressed
disillusionment with Canada's existing political system.
'I have to realise my sustained commitment . . .to the cause of Canadian
unity has brought me nothing definitive but disappointment,' Mr Castonguay
wrote in an open letter.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Plan to phase in electronic bills of
lading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic bills of lading could begin to replace the paper documents
currently in use from next year if a project funded by the European Union
proves successful.
The main problems involved in moving to an electronic bill, a document which
itemises a cargo and details its destination and route, have been solved, Mr
John Reeve, senior partner at Touche Ross Management Consultants, said
yesterday.
A 15-month Ecu3.7m (Pounds 2.9m) pilot project financed jointly by the
European Union and the private sector will spend the next year testing the
Bolero project with a group of up to 30 private sector users.
If the system proves itself, it could free the log-jam currently blocking
the widespread use of electronic transfer in the field of shipping
documents. Since bills of lading are negotiable - they confer ownership on
the person holding the document - the problems of security have proved
particularly taxing.
Electronic bills of lading should provide a faster, more secure means of
communicating cargo information than a paper document which can be lost,
stolen or forged. They could also reduce errors which frequently delay
acceptance of shipping documents.
But if shippers, shipowners and others involved in seaborne cargoes can be
convinced, then electronic data interchange could be used more widely for
insurance certificates, customs documents, letters of credit and other
banking documents. The main difficulties involved ensuring that a bill of
lading in electronic form was genuine and developing the computer technology
which could be used easily by shipping clerks.
The security issue has been circumvented by Cable &amp; Wireless, the
telecommunications group and a partner in the project, which will act as
'trusted third party' to guarantee that an electronic bill is genuine.
Previous attempts to launch electronic bills foundered because potential
participants did not regard the guarantor, in one case a bank, as an
independent party.
Subscribers to the the Bolero system would require a personal computer
terminal, applications software and a card giving providing secure access.
The initial investment should amount to a few thousand pounds. which should
mean that it is affordable even by small shippers, Mr Reeve said.
Members of the development consortium include Cryptomathic, a Danish
security consultancy; Denton Hall, a UK law firm; Istev, an Italian
information technology institute; and Unisource, a Dutch business
telecommunications company.
The user group which is testing the system includes BAT, the tobacco and
financial services group; Nedlloyd Lines, Maersk Line, Chase Manhattan Bank
and United Distillers.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Boeing, Airbus in costs dogfight - Paul
Betts on the battle to make aircraft more quickly and more cheaply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, Boeing of the US and its
European rival Airbus, are dreaming of out-jumboing each other by building
the world's biggest airliner with seating for 800 or more passengers.
However, the real commercial battle between the two is to build their
current aircraft more quickly and more cost-effectively in response to
structural changes in the airline market, provoked by the biggest slump in
the history of the airline industry.
'It is no longer so much what you build but how you build it that will make
the difference,' said a senior Airbus executive. 'Aircraft manufacturing is
now shifting from a purely product-, research- and development-driven
business to one where the manufacturing process will give a manufacturer the
edge over its rival,' he added.
Although air traffic is recovering after four years in which airlines lost
more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.8bn) on international scheduled services
alone, this is unlikely to lead to a rapid rise in returns generated by
passenger numbers.
'It is becoming more and more evident that revenue, rather than traffic, is
the key to airline profitability,' says Mr Adam Brown, the head of strategic
planning at Airbus. 'In many markets, air travellers have now become
accustomed to paying a particular fare level; and if fares are increased,
they simply don't fly. So the airlines now have no choice but to find a way
to provide a service at this fare level rather than as in the past seeking
to maximise the fare charged for providing the service,' he says.
With pressure on yields continuing, airlines will have to rely increasingly
for their profits on cost reductions and operational efficiencies. In turn,
they will seek aircraft that cost less to buy and less to run.
'We are all having to adapt to this new environment,' says Mr Claude
Terrazzoni, head of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale, the
French partner in the four-nation Airbus consortium, which includes Deutsche
Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain. 'Boeing is now cutting its
production costs by 25 per cent: either they want to kill us because they
think Airbus can't match such cuts, or they are adapting to the structural
change in the airline industry with low fares, or they are trying to do
both,' he adds.
Boeing recently reaffirmed its commitment to drive down costs and
manufacturing time 'to make sure we remain the world's most competitive
manufacturer of commercial jets'. Mr Ron Woodard, the head of Boeing's
commercial aircraft operations, said in the company's staff magazine: 'We
decided to prepare for the future today, while we're number one because
number two is unthinkable'.
The Seattle-based company has already reduced the order-to-delivery time of
its wide-body aircraft, such as the 747 and the 767, from 18 months a few
years ago to around 10.5 months and wants to bring it down to eight months.
It eventually hopes to achieve the same target for the new 777 which flew
for the first time last month.
Boeing has already reduced the production cycle time for its narrow-body
aircraft, including the 737 and the 757, to nine months and is planning to
make it six months by 1996.
Airbus says it is confident it can meet the productivity challenge set by
Boeing. Although the European consortium's complex four-nation structure is
a handicap, Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, has set similar
targets for Airbus aircraft production.
'For narrow-body aircraft we are also aiming at an order-to-delivery target
of six months in 1996. Today it is 12 months, next year it will go down to
nine,' he said. For wide-body aircraft such as the A330, A340, A300 and
A310, Airbus has already reduced production cycle times from 15 months to
12.5 months and plans to go down to nine months by 1996.
Mr Woodard of Boeing said the reduction in manufacturing cycle times was
already producing big payoffs for the US company. 'One payoff is in the area
of inventory. By the end of 1993, as a result of our cycle time reduction
efforts, we had reduced our inventory by more than Dollars 1bn compared to
business as usual,' he said.
Boeing's cost-cutting drive has included extensive workforce cuts involving
28,000 people in 1993 and 1994; the application of new commuter and
automated manufacturing techniques; and new organisational structures to
improve internal working relations and practices. Some 60,000 employees have
already attended during the past three years special courses which Boeing
calls 'World-Class Competitiveness'.
The response at Airbus has been to cut up to 8,000 jobs between 1992 and
1995; maximise the use of investments in automation and computer aided
manufacturing; and simplify and streamline the consortium's complicated
manufacturing and assembly processes.
This has led to improvements in Airbus productivity. BAe, for example, now
takes 85 days to build a wing for an Airbus airliner instead of double the
time 18 months ago. Deutsche Aerospace is phasing out a number of plants and
regrouping its Airbus work on fewer and more efficient sites.
But the task for Airbus remains daunting. The challenge for the European
group is to transform what was at first conceived of as a job and wealth
creation consortium to compete against the dominance of the US aerospace
industry into an independent company, mature enough to rationalise and
restructure and stand on its two corporate feet.
It has started transforming itself, but the process is a slow and difficult
one. Unless it accelerates the tempo, it will find it hard to keep up with
the pace of change at Boeing.

<TEXT>
Vietnam has approved a Dollars 41m (Pounds 26.9m) joint venture by Swire
Pacific of Hong Kong, Crown Cork and Seal of the US and two Vietnamese state
companies to make aluminium beverage cans in the north of the country, Swire
Pacific said yesterday.
Crown Vinalimex Packaging (CVP), the joint venture, aims to produce more
than 400m cans a year for Vietnam's expanding soft drink and beer markets.
In southern Vietnam, CarnaudMetalbox and Saigon Brewery recently began work
on a Dollars 54m aluminium can factory with a capacity of some 460m cans a
year near Ho Chi Minh City.
Construction of CVP's factory in Ha Tay province near the capital Hanoi is
to start in October and should be finished within 18 months. CVP will be 33
per cent owned by Swire Pacific, 34 per cent by Crown Cork and Seal, 20 per
cent by Vinalimex and 13 per cent by Ha Tay Foodstuff Complex Factory.
Swire Pacific, which controls Cathay Pacific Airways, said the factory was
its first substantial non-aviation investment in Vietnam. Hong Kong is the
second largest foreign investor in Vietnam after Taiwan. US companies were
unable to commit funds until President Bill Clinton lifted the US economic
embargo against Vietnam in February.
Vietnam's communist government has welcomed foreign investors since it
embarked on economic reforms in the late 1980s. Investors are keen to tap
into this poor but fast-growing economy of 70m people, although bureaucracy,
corruption and rivalry between central and local authorities have delayed
some projects and restricted profits.
Last week it emerged that the State Committee for Co-operation and
Investment, the body that licenses foreign projects, had blocked plans for a
Coca-Cola bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City on the grounds that soft drink
supplies in the south were already sufficient.
A joint venture between PepsiCo PeP. N, a Singapore company and a Vietnamese
state company plans to apply for licences to build two bottling plants in
Hanoi and Danang, Reuter adds from Singapore. The joint venture has been
operating a 600 bottle per minute plant in Ho Chi Minh City for 18 months.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US seeks to curb EU aircraft moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US aerospace industry is seeking to insert into the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation, now being written in Congress, language which
would head off European Union efforts to curb indirect aircraft subsidies.
The industry has also expressed concern that a proposed 600-seat Airbus
airliner will require direct government support which would breach limits in
a US-EU bilateral agreement.
The Aerospace Industries Association has told Mr Mickey Kantor, President
Clinton's trade representative, that if the limits are exceeded, the US
should reinstate its complaint against Airbus in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Such a move would be regarded as highly provocative in Brussels, which is
increasingly angered by US refusals to negotiate curbs on indirect support
in the Gatt.
The EU claims that the US industry benefits substantially from such
assistance, in the form of research and development contracts granted by the
Pentagon. The EU is also unhappy about aid to the industry by the US
National Aeronautics and Space Association.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has promised not to negotiate
new disciplines which would be 'unacceptable' to the US industry, but the
AIA still hopes to get the policy enshrined into law.
In a proposed draft of language for the Uruguay Round implementing
legislation, the AIA calls for 'rejection of any new disciplines on indirect
supports for civil aircraft which are different or apart from those that
would apply to all industries.' The only exception would be limits agreed in
the 1992 US-EU agreement 'solely with respect to large civil aircraft.'
The US and EU agreed to 'multilateralise' the agreement but talks last week
made little progress, and the negotiators will not meet again until
September.
The bilateral pact has some limits on indirect supports and limits direct
supports to Airbus to 33 per cent of programme cost.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: EU increases quota of toys from China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has proposed a 24 per cent increase in the value of
the EU quota on toy imports from China this year, in an effort to ease
disruptions to trade caused by the abrupt imposition of the curbs in
February.
The Commission proposal, to be announced tomorrow, must be approved by the
Council of Ministers. It would raise the value of the quota by Ecu150m
(Pounds 115.5m) to Ecu780m. The increase would be retroactive to March 15,
when the quota took effect, and would run to the end of the year.
The quota, which covers items including teddy bears, was imposed as part of
a package deal under which EU members agreed to scrap about 6,500 national
import restrictions inconsistent with the single European market.
The quota was designed chiefly to mollify Spain, where toy makers are
worried about low-cost competition from China.
Toy Manufacturers of Europe, the main industry group, has said 500 jobs
would be lost in Europe, and its members' sales and profits would suffer.
Though the proposed relaxation is likely to be welcomed by the industry, it
does not fully compensate for the 50 per cent drop in imports' value
expected this year before the quotas were imposed.
Last February's decision is being challenged in the European Court of
Justice by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which sought
unsuccessfully to block it in the Council of Ministers.
Last week, China attacked the quota on toys, silk and other items.

FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: BMW sets up assembly offshoot in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW said yesterday it had established its own subsidiary to prepare for the
assembly of cars in Mexico, starting next year. The German executive
carmaker said that the new company, BMW de Mexico, was also to take over
from its Mexican importer responsibility for developing and supporting BMW's
dealer network in the country.
BMW said cars were to be assembled from next year at a rented plant at
Toluca, 60km west of Mexico City.
Only 'several hundred' 3 -Series will be produced next year. However, the
Mexican market is already the second largest in Latin America after Brazil
and, following its inclusion in the North American Free Trade Agreement, is
regarded by BMW as offering rapid growth potential.
A purchasing office is also to be set up by BMW de Mexico to create a
network of local component suppliers. The volume of cars BMW will be allowed
to produce in Mexico is geared to the percentage of domestically-produced
components it can build into the vehicles.
The new subsidiary will take over the dealership and distribution functions
of its Mexican importer, Grupo Bavaria. However BMW de Mexico is also to
establish a separate operating subsidiary to run the assembly facilities, in
which Grupo Bavaria is to have a minority stake.

Turkey's secular majority appears to have clawed back electoral ground from
a resurgent Islamic party on Sunday in a re-run of recent local elections.
The main opposition Motherland party (Anap) seized the Moslem stronghold of
Fatih in Istanbul, ahead of the Islamic Refah party (RP). Although it
increased its share of the vote to 35 per cent from 28 per cent in March,
the RP was pipped by Anap, which almost doubled its vote to take 42 per
cent. This was the first sign that supporters of Turkey's mainstream parties
may be using tactical voting to keep the Moslems out of power. The re-run at
Fatih and in three other areas follows allegations of irregularities in the
nationwide local elections on March 27, when Mrs Tansu Ciller's True Path
party won a narrow victory on a law and order platform.

French police suspect that the Irish Republican Army may have been the
beneficiary of a corruption ring during the construction of the
EuroDisneyland theme park at Marne La Vallee on the outskirts of Paris,
according to 'judicial sources' cited by Agence France-Presse, the French
news agency. The report follows the conviction of Mr Joseph Mehager, 54, a
site manager at EuroDisneyland on charges of involvement in a corruption
ring that extorted Pounds 20,000 from Spearhead, a company bidding for a
water supply system contract at the site. Mr Mehager was sentenced last week
by the Paris appeal court to eight months in prison and to pay a FFr15,000
(Pounds 1,800) fine.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Seat subsidy fixed at Pta38bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government and Catalan regional government are to provide
Pta38bn (Pounds 189m) in state subsidies for Volkswagen's heavily
loss-making Spanish subsidiary, Seat, under an agreement signed in Madrid
last night. The deal, described as conforming with EU guidelines on
subsidies, commits VW to maintaining Seat's research and development in
Spain but puts no fresh obstacles in VW's path in terms of plant and work
force restructuring. The German car maker intends to cut 4,000 jobs by the
end of this year, shut the 40-year-old Zona Franca assembly plant in
Barcelona and concentrate all car production in a new facility at nearby
Martorell. The Spanish government is providing Pta30bn of the funds over a
four-year period through the Official Credit Institute (ICO). Catalonia is
putting up the remaining Pta8bn. A key condition of the funding is that it
must be invested in Seat's development, not used to finance job cuts. 'Seat
will continue as a major vehicle assembler' as a result of the agreement, Mr
Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, Spanish industry minister, said following last
night's signing.

Defence ministers of France, Italy and Britain yesterday signed an agreement
committing themselves to further development of the common next-generation
frigate. Mr Francois Leotard, Mr Cesare Previti and Mr Malcolm Rifkind
signed the memorandum of understanding in London. It governs design,
development and production of the ship. A separate pact to begin work
fleshing out the design shortly was also signed. The frigate, Project
Horizon, is primarily for air defence and will replace Type 42 destroyers in
the Royal Navy while the French ships are intended as aircraft carrier
escorts and the Italian for general duties.
A total of 22 ships are planned, 12 for the UK, six for Italy and four for
France, at a cost of Pounds 6bn-Pounds 8bn. Three 'first of class' ships are
expected in service in 2002. The prime contract is expected to be handled by
a joint venture company comprising DCN International for France,
Finmeccanica and Fincantieri of Italy and a group headed by GEC-Marconi for
Britain.

<TEXT>
Alitalia, Italy's state-controlled airline, yesterday suffered its third big
day of disruption in less than a week, as unions protested against
imposition of a tough restructuring plan on the loss-making national
carrier. Originally an all-out strike was called by the main unions covering
flight personnel and ground staff. But Mr Publio Fiori, transport minister,
on Sunday invoked special powers that oblige operation of minimum services.
This meant Alitalia could operate 55 per cent of planned domestic flights,
65 per cent of short-haul international flights and 83 per cent of
inter-continental flights.
On Sunday Alitalia took the unprecedented step of placing advertisements in
the national press apologising to passengers under the headline: 'Thousands
of passengers cannot fly - why?' A letter was sent to employees in the name
of Mr Renato Riverso and Mr Roberto Schisano, respectively chairman and
chief executive, pointing out there was 'no alternative to the restructuring
and in no form can we give up this objective'. Negotiations on the
restructuring, which envisages loss of up to 4,000 of the compay's 18,000
jobs, were broken off last week by the unions in advance of their strike
call. On Tuesday and Wednesday last week wildcat strikes were called by
Sulta, a militant trade union, which was formed last year and was not
included in the talks. Some talks are to resume tomorrow with the main
unions, but at least two more strikes have been called later in the month.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Santer favourite to head Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The contest to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission has entered the last lap, with Mr Jacques Santer, the
long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg, emerging as a clear favourite.
The deal is not yet done; but Mr Santer has gained ground after better-known
candidates such as Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain have either been blocked or have withdrawn.
'It is a candidacy of the lowest-common denominator,' said a former senior
Belgian minister. This may be too harsh a judgment. Mr Santer is an
experienced politician who has served as prime minister since 1985 and
finance minister since 1979. He is a free-trader, supports Union enlargement
and an advocate of subsidiarity - the doctrine of devolving decision-making
to the lowest appropriate level in the Union.
'He is not Little League,' says one senior diplomat, 'he is middle-rank.'
Yet the prospect of Mr Santer coming to Brussels is viewed with some
trepidation at the Commission. Memories of the drift under Mr Gaston Thorn,
the Luxembourger who preceded Mr Delors between 1981-85, remain strong.
'Santer would mean a weak Commission,' says a senior Eurocrat.
Mr Delors will not comment on potential successors; but he is said to be
worried that a malleable president could encourage France, Germany and the
UK to 'cut the Commission down to size.'
In Brussels yesterday, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the young Luxembourg finance
minister, denied that Mr Santer was a candidate. But Mr Juncker, a likely
successor to Mr Santer, added that Mr Santer could be the candidate of other
EU member states.
This was probably a reference to Germany whose position is pivotal.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl remains determined to strike a deal before or during
a special EU summit in Brussels on Friday, so the Commission
President-designate can appear before the newly-elected European Parliament
on July 19 in Strasbourg.
Failure to break the deadlock would create a crisis with the European
Parliament, possibly encouraging MEPs to draft their own candidate. It would
reinforce an impression of disarray in the EU, undermining Mr Kohl's image
ahead of the October general election.
So who is Mr Santer, and why should he be more acceptable to the British
than Mr Dehaene, the candidate pushed by Bonn and Paris who stumbled as a
result of Mr John Major's veto at the Corfu summit last month.
A fellow Christian Democrat portrays the Luxembourger as solid, practical,
and sensible - not an idealogue. He also has a tough streak  - resisting
German pressure to scrap the Grand Duchy's tax privileges for foreign
savers.
Yet Mr Santer lacks the flair of a Felipe Gonzalez or the imagination of a
Pierre Werner, his fellow Luxembourger who in the 1970s was the father of
the project to create a European monetary union.
In Mrs Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, which run to 914 pages, Mr Santer merits
just one reference - a swipe at the enthusiasm of smaller European countries
to sign up unthinkingly to Franco-German plans for economic and political
union. She describes the Luxembourger's rhetoric on EMU as 'cloudy' and
'unrealistic' but adds, tellingly: 'We were correct in believing them to be
lacking in realism; where we were mistaken was in underestimating the
determination of some European politicians to put them into effect.'
The search for someone 'reliable' on European integration is the chief
calculation in the mind of the French and Germans as they seek agreement on
a new candidate.
The future Commission president must prepare for the Maastricht review
conference in 1996; deal with the consequences of enlargement of the Union
to 16 or more members; prepare the ground for EMU; and lay the ground for
the next five-year EU budget in 1999.
It is a daunting agenda. But member states appear to be leaning in favour of
a quieter life after 10 years of Mr Delors. A Mister or Madame X may yet
appear; but Mr Santer may just fit the bill.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Germany urges harmonisation of EU tax system

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany, keen to forge ahead with plans that would bring order to Europe's
multilayered tax system, yesterday started a debate on the vexed question of
taxes on savings and the introduction of a final, definitive system of VAT.
But at the first economic and finance ministers' meeting to be chaired by
the Germans it became clear Commission proposals for harmonising taxes on
savings - withholding tax - are unlikely to make much progress under the new
presidency because of fierce opposition from Luxembourg and the UK.
In spite of this, the Germans have identified the need for a common tax on
savings to be deducted at source as a priority for its presidency. Because
of high withholding taxes Germany, along with Belgium, is prone to heavy
flights of capital.
At yesterday's meeting, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
reminded his counterparts that when capital movements were deregulated six
years ago, member states were conscious of the need to rule out distortions
of competition and tax avoidance because of the differing tax systems on
capital income.
But Luxembourg, which does not levy taxes on savings held by non-residents
in the country, is particularly opposed to the proposal, arguing that an
EU-wide withholding tax would lead to capital flight from Europe to other
OECD countries where there were no, or lower, taxes on savings.
Yesterday Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg finance minister, said a
withholding tax would only be acceptable if it was levied in all OECD
countries, otherwise Luxembourg had only a 'staunch no' to say to the
proposal.
The UK too is opposed to a Brussels-inspired common withholding tax. It
argues that there should be a free market in taxes. 'Any European system
would drive business out of Europe to New York and Tokyo. Therefore a common
withholding tax at source would be ineffective,' said a UK spokesman.
On VAT, the battles mostly lie ahead. The commission is to present a report
by the end of the year on meeting the conditions for a switch to a
definitive system of VAT, in which the tax is levied in the country of
origin.
Under the current system, VAT is currently paid in the country of
consumption. Germany in particular supports a rapid transition to a
country-of-origin based system, which they believe would be much simpler to
administer.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French consumer prices remained stable in June, compared with May, giving an
annualised inflation rate of 1.8 per cent, according to Insee, the national
statistics office. June's figures, which were released yesterday, showed the
continued weakness of inflationary pressures in France, despite the
emergence of economic recovery. The weakness of price pressures in June was
partly the result of the food and manufactured goods sectors, both of which
saw a slip in average prices compared with May.
Unemployment in the European Union was steady at 17.7m people or 10.9 per
cent of the workforce in May, unchanged from February, the EU's statistical
office announced. In May last year the rate was 10.5 per cent, Eurostat
said. Since the start of this year the rate of unemployment has risen in
Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal but it has fallen
in Denmark, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Britain, Eurostat said.
Greek consumer price inflation fell to 10.9 per cent year-on-year in June
from 11.0 per cent in May, the National Statistics Service said.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Power shifts eastward in Ukraine: Political upheavals in
prospect after elections in two CIS states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By electing Mr Leonid Kuchma as president in Sunday's ballot, Ukrainians
have set off a political earthquake in their seemingly stagnant state.
For the first time since the country became independent in 1991, it is
Russified, industrialised eastern Ukraine, rather than the intensely
nationalist west, which will set the political tone in the nation. Moreover,
with the ousting of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the elaborate and powerful patronage
networks the president has established in Ukraine over the past three years
are set to crumble. A new guard, from the east and from the once elite and
now wilting defence sector, is about to take charge of the capital.
A balding man with an unpretentious, engaging personal manner, Ukraine's
president-elect is an ambivalent figure. The election campaign did more to
obscure than to clarify Mr Kuchma's platform, as he sought to simultaneously
win the communist vote and woo market reformers, to appeal to the
pro-Russian east while reassuring the rest of the nation that he would not
be Moscow's pawn.
What is clear is that Mr Kuchma, known as the 'chief' when he was prime
minister, will bring in a style of government very different from that of Mr
Kravchuk, a cunning strategist who has elevated vacillation into a political
philosophy. As the erstwhile director of Yuzhmash, the former Soviet Union's
largest missile factory, Mr Kuchma is a tough, decisive leader, impatient
with politicking and accustomed to instant obedience.
Western diplomats predict that Mr Kuchma, whom Mr Kravchuk sought to portray
as Moscow's yes-man, will not in fact, inaugurate a radical change in
Ukraine's relations with Russia, but will instead bring a more subtle shift
in orientation.
His aides agree, and say the new Ukraine will be wrought in the image of
east rather than west. 'Russian-speaking Ukrainians are absolutely loyal to
the Ukrainian state,' Mr Iuri Pestriakov, a Kuchma official said. 'But they
were reduced to second-class citizens by Kravchuk.'
Before he can set about forging this new, slightly different, Ukraine, Mr
Kuchma must first establish himself as the leader of this entire, and
disparate nation, and assert his control over the nation's government. Swept
into office on a pro-Russian platform, he must prove he can be the leader of
all of Ukraine. To do that, he will be compelled to balance on a tightrope
pulled taut by nationalist aspirations in the west of the country and
pro-Russian inclinations of the eastern Ukrainians who propelled him into
office.
Satisfying the east should be easier. Indeed, Mr Dmytro Tabachnyk,
mastermind of the Kuchma campaign, yesterday declared triumphantly that with
Mr Kuchma's victory the question of Crimean separatism had been put to rest
'because the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly for Ukraine's new
president'.
The second domestic challenge Mr Kuchma faces will be asserting his
authority over the state administration which, during the past three years,
Mr Kravchuk has carefully stacked with supporters.
Another source of acrimony is Mr Kuchma's relentless campaign against
corruption. In a nation in which government pay-offs are a way of life, he
is privately praised by Ukrainian law-enforcement officials as one of the
country's cleanest politicians. As president, Mr Kuchma, whose efforts to
dismiss and jail corrupt state officials when he was prime minister were
thwarted by the president and parliament, might well make a very public
example of some of the more questionable business dealings of the Kravchuk
administration and the men behind them.
He will also need to develop a modus vivendi with Ukraine's parliament and
cabinet of ministers, a task complicated by the still unresolved
constitutional debate in the country.
Although many communist voters appear to have backed Mr Kuchma, he will
inevitably come into conflict with the dominant hardline left-wing faction
in parliament if he pursues the market reforms he has promised.
Last night Mr Kuchma said he was ready to co-operate with parliament and the
recently appointed prime minister, Mr Vitalii Masol. However, the new
president's relations with Mr Masol, a long-time Kravchuk ally whom he vowed
to sack during the campaign, could be tense. Mr Masol, who gamely says he
has a deal to stay on as prime minister, has admitted privately that his
personal relationship with the new president is distant.
Even as Mr Kuchma sets his own house in order, he cannot afford to neglect
the world beyond his nation's borders. From the west, he has the enticing
offer of Dollars 4bn of aid if Ukraine begins long-delayed economic reforms.
To the east, Mr Kuchma hopes that his warm friendship with Russia's prime
minister and his more conciliatory tone will ease strained relations between
the two Slav neighbours.
But he would do well to realise that neither Moscow nor Washington is likely
to favour a faltering Ukraine with economic hand-outs; like his ousted
predecessor, voters are likely to judge Mr Kuchma by what he achieves at
home.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Italian coalition split over RAI board
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The naming of a new management for Italy's state broadcasting organisation,
the RAI, is proving a deeply divisive issue among the coalition partners in
Italy's right-wing government.
The populist Northern League has rejected a list of candidates; and the
speakers of the chamber of deputies and the senate, the two institutional
figures technically responsible for the nominations, have been seen at odds.
The RAI issue was top of the agenda for Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, following his return from the Group of Seven summit in Naples.
The dispute centres on moves by the three main partners in the government
coalition - Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the League and the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance - to ensure they all have their own nominees
represented on the board of what continues to be Italy's most influential
media network. This is a classic example of the fights to carve up influence
in a powerful state body which so discredited successive post-war
governments and which Mr Berlusconi himself has sought to avoid.
Thus his own authority is at stake. He does not wish to be seen making too
many concessions to the individual interests of his partners. This explains
his tough stance even at the Naples summit, refusing the call for a special
meeting of his coalition parties.
The one-year-old RAI board was forced to step down on June 30 following the
government's threat to refuse to accept its financial reorganisation plan
and emergency funding. The board, though installed as technicians, were
considered too close to the previous governing parties. But the government
had previously been critical of the RAI's bias against Mr Berlusconi.
Attempts to find a quick replacement have been undermined by the League. Mr
Umberto Bossi, its leader, yesterday repeated his concerns about the way the
nominations were being handled. 'The danger is that once the media are
controlled, this will allow the consolidation of a certain group's power
within the government coalition,' he said in the League's weekly newsletter.
This was a thinly veiled reference to Mr Berlusconi's existing ownership of
the Fininvest media empire, which controls more than 80 per cent of Italy's
commercial television. Mr Bossi yesterday also revealed in the same
newsletter he would shortly be submitting to parliament an anti-trust law
preventing monopolistic positions in the media.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Belarus sweeps in new broom

<TEXT>
The victory in Belarus's first presidential election of Mr Alexander
Lukashenko, an anti-corruption campaigner, threatens to aggravate the
republic's economic woes if the new president sticks to his promise of
fighting both corruption and market economics.
Official results published yesterday gave Mr Lukashenko 80 per cent of the
vote in a run-off against Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the conservative prime
minister who had tried every trick in the book - including populist economic
handouts and unabashed exploitation of the state-controlled media - to
secure his own election.
But Mr Lukashenko, a poorly-educated former collective farm boss who more
recently headed parliament's anti-corruption commission, owes his surprise
victory to his well-delivered message of 'finding simple solutions to
complicated problems'.
Victory was delivered to him on a plate by popular weariness with old-style
Soviet-era leaders who failed to conduct any coherent market reforms in
three years of independence. The failure to reform an economy dominated by
obsolete industry has meant Belarus has suffered from industrial collapse,
hyperinflation, shortages in the shops, and widespread corruption as the
state has sought to maintain an increasingly ineffective grip on the
economy.
Mr Lukashenko, 39, has promised to root out corruption by starting from the
top. 'This will end the problem at the lower level because people take their
cue from the top,' he has said. He has vowed to restore socialist-style
controls over the economy and also frightened the country's fledgling
private sector with his promise to confiscate 'ill-gotten gains'.
The main plank of Mr Kebich's programme to save the economy from
'catastrophe' was his plan for a monetary union with Russia - in effect
turning Belarus into a Russian province. In an attempt to boost Mr Kebich's
election chances after his poor showing in the first round of voting, Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, even travelled to Minsk to
confirm Russia still endorsed the draft union he cooked up with Mr Kebich
last winter.
During the election campaign, Mr Lukashenko, an unknown quantity in Moscow
endorsed only by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist, had
also supported the proposed union with Russia. He even suggested that the
alliance be extended to the political sphere.
On Sunday, however, he issued mixed signals on his plans for relations with
Russia. 'Let us stop playing up the Russian card,' he said. 'Russia has its
own interests, Belarus has its own.'
Mr Lukashenko's victory can only reinforce Moscow's growing doubts about the
benefits of a union already criticised within Russia as economically
unprofitable for it.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for the
economy, took a non-committal line on the results of elections in both
Belarus and Ukraine while acknowledging the problems which have dogged the
proposed monetary union with Minsk.

FT  12 JUL 94 / US-German link stressed by Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged
themselves to close co-ordination of their efforts to bring the countries of
central and eastern Europe into a common security system with the west, and
to provide better trade access to western markets.
On the first day of a two-day official visit, Mr Clinton underlined the
special relationship which has developed between the US and Germany, and
which has become stronger because of their common focus on the stabilisation
of eastern Europe.
'There's a way in which the US and Germany have a more immediate and
tangible concern with these issues, even than our other friends in Europe,'
he said at a joint press conference after his first round of talks with Mr
Kohl. He described their 'common partnership' as unique, precisely because
'so many of our challenges are just to Germany's east'.
Mr Clinton is expected to make the integration of eastern and western Europe
the centrepiece of his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin today,
billed by senior US officials as an important statement of US policy towards
Europe.
In Berlin, Mr Clinton and Mr Kohl will also meet Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, when a US-European Union working group
on co-ordination of policy towards eastern Europe is expected to be set up.
The aim is to strengthen direct lines of communication between the US and
the EU, which officials on both sides admit have become a relatively weak
link in transatlantic relations.
In his welcome to the US president, Mr Kohl recalled with emotion that
'American soldiers brought freedom to Germany' and then 'defended freedom
and peace and security for us here' for 40 years. He underscored the
importance of maintaining a US military presence as a pillar of Germany's
future security, reminding Mr Clinton of his promise to keep 100,000 troops
in Europe.
He also paid particular tribute to the US for its support for the German
unification process in 1989 and 1990. 'This would not have been brought
about without the assistance and help of our American friends,' he said.
Mr Clinton stressed that military and security links with eastern Europe,
such as Nato's Partnership for Peace programme, should be complemented by
better trade access for the emerging democracies. 'We recognise that trade,
as much as troops, will increasingly define the ties that bind nations in
the 21st century.'
Asked whether his 'truly unique' relationship with Germany had displaced his
country's 'special relationship' with the UK, Mr Clinton side-stepped the
issue with a laugh. 'That's like asking me to pick a team in the World Cup.
Once we were eliminated, I declined to do that,' he said - politely
forbearing to remind Mr Kohl that Germany had lasted only one round longer
than US.
He described the US-UK relationship as 'unique in ways that nothing can ever
replace because we grew out of them'. As for Germany, he said, 'What we have
shared since World War Two. . . is astonishing. . . The future we dream of
cannot be achieved without the strong, unified efforts of Germany and the
US.'
Mr Clinton said his special relationship was not only with Germany in
general but with Mr Kohl in particular. When called upon to speak at
meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations or of Nato, Mr
Clinton said, his usual response was: 'I agree with Helmut.'

FT  12 JUL 94 / Canadian tipped for OECD top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister, has clearly emerged as the
leading candidate to head the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, according to informal soundings among its 25 member
governments. These show Lord Lawson of the UK trailing in third place behind
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the French incumbent.
But it is still unclear whether or when this support for Mr Johnston will
crystallise into the consensus by which the Paris-based organisation
traditionally conducts its business. He appears to have some backing from
the divided ranks of the 19 European members as well as solid support from
the six non-Europeans.
'The decision depends entirely on the Europeans at this stage,' said a
non-European OECD envoy yesterday. 'They have got to make their views
known.' But the three European candidates - Mr Paye, Lord Lawson and Mr
Lorenz Schomerus, a German - are all from European Union members that have
yet to take their more important decision on a new president for the
European Commission. 'Until that decision, it is impossible for us (EU
members) to get together on a new OECD head', said a European diplomat
yesterday.
Ambassador Eric Rothlesberger of Switzerland, who has been given the task of
sounding out countries on their preferences, said yesterday that the OECD's
July 28-29 council meeting, the last before the summer break, was not an
essential deadline, because Mr Paye's term expired on September 30.
Ambassador Anne-Marie Doyle of Canada claimed yesterday that Mr Johnston was
gaining 'strong support across all (geographical) regions' of the
membership. The Canadian's most open supporter has been the US, which has
argued that the new secretary general should be a non-European to reflect
the expansion of the OECD which took in Mexico this year and may admit South
Korea next year.
Despite the anonymity of the soundings, Mr Johnston's supporters claim he
now has a dozen governments behind him. Mr Paye is rumoured to have the
clear support of half a dozen. Lord Lawson has apparently gained little
support, beyond that of the UK, because of fears that while he would lend
intellectual weight to the economic think-tank, his abrasive personality
might rock a body used to consensus. Mr Schomerus was never considered a
serious contender outside Bonn.

FT  12 JUL 94 / N Korea to resume talks on nuclear programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   SEOUL, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday indicated that it would resume talks with the US and
South Korea over its nuclear programme in spite of postponing meetings
following the death of its president, Mr Kim Il-sung.
Mr Kim died last Friday as North Korea began high-level discussions with the
US to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme and two weeks
before he was scheduled to meet South Korean president Kim Young-sam in an
unprecedented summit meeting.
Pyongyang notified South Korea yesterday that an inter-Korean summit would
have to be postponed, but it did not say that the meeting should be
cancelled. This followed a message to the US suggesting North Korea would
reopen talks in Geneva as early as next week, after Mr Kim's funeral on
Sunday.
The statements seemed to show that Mr Kim Jong-il, the son and designated
successor of the late president, would continue to pursue the reconciliation
with the west that his father adopted in recent weeks.
The country's borders have reportedly been sealed off to foreigners until
after Mr Kim's funeral. But the North Korean media reported messages of
condolence from world leaders, including statements by US president Bill
Clinton and former US president Mr Jimmy Carter, who met Mr Kim last month
in an attempt to break the impasse over the nuclear dispute.
Mr Clinton expressed confidence yesterday that North Korea will resume talks
with the US after 'an appropriate period' to mark the death of President Kim
Il Sung.
Asked if he was concerned about the younger Kim's character, he said: 'I
don't know the younger Kim. And I think you have to be careful in judging
people by what others say about them, one way or the other.'
South Korean officials suggested they welcomed a delay to the summit since
they want to make sure that the political situation in Pyongyang is stable
before restarting talks.
They predict it might take six months for Mr Kim Jong-il to consolidate his
power in the face of opposition from the military and other conservatives
who distrust the young generation of technocrats he is believed to
represent.
North Korea's ruling Workers' party and parliament will hold emergency
sessions this week and are expected to appoint Mr Kim as the country's new
leader.
South Korea said it could accept Mr Kim as North Korea's next leader, in
spite of his alleged involvement in planning terrorist attacks against the
Seoul government in the 1980s if his appointment ensures continued stability
on the Korean peninsula.
Officials in Seoul believe that Mr Kim may support gradual economic reforms
and improved relations with the US and South Korea in an attempt to save his
country from economic collapse.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Electricity chiefs reap high profit from share options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The managing director of Midlands Electricity, who resigned in a top-level
management shake-up last year, left with a pay-off and other benefits worth
over Pounds 1.2m, according to the company's accounts.
The publication of electricity industry annual reports yesterday also
disclosed that electricity company directors have made several million
pounds of paper profits on executive share option schemes set up at the time
of privatisation.
Mr Richard Young, who left Midlands in April 1993 when he was 50, was paid
Pounds 393,000 in compensation for loss of office plus Pounds 262,000 in
pension contributions. He also held options to buy 145,000 shares at a price
which gave him a paper profit of at least Pounds 4 each, or Pounds 580,000.
Mr Young, a lifelong electricity industry man, joined Midlands Electricity
in 1982. He was entitled to special pension payments under the electricity
industry pension scheme and received the share options along with other
Midlands executives under the company scheme.
All the privatised electricity companies set up option schemes in January
1991 to provide incentives for senior executives. For tax reasons these
could not be exercised until the beginning of this year.
But since then, dozens of executives have taken advantage of the boom in
electricity shares to cash in the options, which give the holder the right
to buy shares at prices well below those in the market.
Apart from Mr Young, five Midlands Electricity directors bought nearly
600,000 of shares at 258p at a time when the company's shares were trading
between 634p and 732p, implying a collective profit on paper of around
Pounds 2.5m.
Directors at the neighbouring East Midlands Electricity took 770,000 options
at prices which will have yielded them a paper profit of at least Pounds 2m.
Earlier this year, the company's chairman, Mr John Harris, stepped down and
the new management took a Pounds 130m write-off on new business ventures
which did not succeed. Yesterday also brought details of options deals at
Swalec, the South Wales utility, where Mr Wynford Evans, the chairman,
exercised options on 111,510 shares, netting a paper profit of just under
Pounds 500,000.
Altogether, Swalec directors' paper profits amounted to Pounds 1.1m.
A spokesman for Swalec, whose electricity prices are among the country's
highest, said the company's good performance had helped boost the share
price. But he also stressed that Swalec customers had benefited through
price freezes and rebates of Pounds 25 each a year.
At Southern Electricity, three directors including Mr Henry Casley, the
chief executive, exercised options on 240,000 shares which gave them a paper
profit of just over Pounds 1m. Directors usually acquire their share options
by taking out a bank loan and selling enough shares to repay the loan.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Input price rises threaten profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent rises in raw material prices, combined with fierce price competition
in retail markets is threatening a profit squeeze in some manufacturing
sectors, official figures yesterday suggested.
A surge in the price of metals and other imported commodities pushed the
cost of raw materials and fuel for manufacturers up by a seasonally adjusted
0.8 per cent in June, the Central Statistical Office said.
However, output prices increases were broadly flat as intense competition
prevented UK companies from increasing the price of manufactured goods.
The cost of goods leaving factory gates, measured by the core output price
index, rose by only 0.1 per cent in June compared to May. Measured over the
year to June, the index rose by 1.9 per cent - its lowest annual growth
since November 1967. The core index excludes the volatile food, drink,
tobacco and fuel sectors,
The Treasury yesterday hailed the data as 'welcome good news' ahead of the
retail price index and average earnings data which will be published
tomorrow
But with the rise in input prices higher than City forecasts, the reaction
from analysts was mixed. Some fear that input price rises could fuel
inflation later this year. A recent Confederation of British Industry survey
indicated a sharp rise in manufacturers hoping to raise prices.
British companies now face a 'very different world', warned Mr Richard
Kersley, UK markets strategist at brokers BZW. Output costs rose faster than
input costs in the past two years, but the reversal of this pattern in
recent months meant companies now needed to focus on increasing sales
volumes, he said.
Commodities are calculated to be only 5 per cent of the total costs of UK
manufacturers and most companies were already operating with historically
strong levels of profit margins.
Mr David Owen, UK economist with brokers Kleinwort Benson, warned some
sectors heavily dependent upon commodities could suffer a profit squeeze.
Businessmen yesterday echoed this picture of growing pressure on margins. Mr
Rolf Rittner, raw materials purchasing director at BASF, the German
chemicals company, said: 'It has not been possible to close the gap between
increasing commodity prices and selling prices.' Mr Jean-Luc Schwitzguebel,
managing director of Swiss-owned Ciba Pigments in the UK, said price rises
among raw materials were forcing a search for alternatives.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Coffee prices set to soar after second Brazil frost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices yesterday leapt by 30 per cent to their highest level
in more than eight years, after a second severe frost in Brazil in as many
weeks raised fears of a serious shortage of beans in the next couple of
years.
The surge in futures prices, which have climbed by 220 per cent this year,
increases the likelihood of further rises in retail coffee prices of at
least 15 per cent this year, according to manufacturers.
Sainsbury, the leading UK supermarket group, yesterday announced an increase
of 10p to 99p in the price of its own label instant coffee. A spokesman for
Nestle, which raised the price of Nescafe by 12 1/2 per cent in January,
said the rises in world bean prices would 'work their way through to the
supermarkets'.
The weekend frost prompted Brazil, which accounts for a quarter of world
output, to suspend exports until it has assessed the damage. According to
initial estimates, it could lose up to half next year's crop as a result of
the two frosts, with temperatures falling to about minus 3 degrees celsius
with ice in some places.
The freeze is not thought to have done much damage to this year's crop which
is being harvested. However, the coffee trees hit by the freeze as a result
will produce fewer beans next year. Both frosts affected southern parts of
Minas Gerais, the most important coffee-producing state.
Accu-Weather, an independent forecasting organisation, said the frost two
weeks ago damaged 30 to 40 per cent of next year's crop, which was
originally estimated at between 25m and 30m bags. Saturday's frost hit a
further 10-15 per cent of the crop.
Ms Judith Ganes, soft commodities analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York,
said coffee futures prices could regain the all-time highs of 1977, which
followed the devastating Brazilian frost of 1975. Prices then reached the
equivalent of Dollars 7,000 (Pounds 4,600) a tonne, compared with
yesterday's peak in London of Dollars 4,000 a tonne for coffee for delivery
in three months.
'We're looking at a situation where higher prices are needed to ration
demand,' said Ms Ganes.
At the close in New York, September futures prices for arabica coffee, which
accounts for the bulk of Brazil's production, were up 47 cents at 235.35
cents a pound, or 25 per cent. The September contract in London closed
Dollars 759 higher at Dollars 3,835.
The frost season can run through until early September, and cool weather is
forecast for next weekend.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Dollar driven to new lows as traders remain wary: Clinton
fails to dispel fears of policy of benign neglect on currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange traders yesterday delivered their judgment upon the Group
of Seven's unwillingness to intervene in currency markets by driving the US
dollar to record lows.
Markets ignored efforts by Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, to dispel the
impression that he favoured a policy of benign neglect towards the dollar.
He told reporters after meeting German chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn that
the US would not use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy.
The US currency resumed its slide yesterday amid disappointment in the the
markets that the G7 summit of leading industrial nations in Naples had not
agreed a plan for concerted interest rate moves and co-ordinated
intervention to support the dollar.
In Tokyo early this morning it slipped to Y97.3 amid reports of intervention
by the Bank of Japan after finishing in New York at Y97.725. In London, the
US currency fell to a postwar low of Y97.365, down from Friday's close of
Y98.575.
Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM1.54, down from DM1.5741 on
Friday. In New York it fell below DM1.52, its lowest level since October
1992, before finishing the day at DM1.5280.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, speaking at a meeting of EU
finance ministers yesterday, defended the approach adopted by the G7. He
said: 'We did enough. Now we will see what the markets will do.'
The dollar's weakness against the yen had been temporarily arrested by
worries about repercussions from the death of North Korean leader Kim
Il-sung.
However, the G7's widely predicted decision not to refer to currencies in
its communique was taken by traders as a further reason to sell the US
currency.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, and his economic team have
recently made efforts to combat the market's view that the US is prepared to
allow the dollar to drift. However, this view gained renewed credence from
Mr Clinton's comments at the weekend which gave the impression that he would
rather sanction a weaker dollar than higher interest rates.
Analysts stressed, however, that the fairly relaxed attitude of the
authorities confirmed the dollar was in gradual decline rather than facing a
crisis. Its trade weighted value also remains more than 10 per cent above
the lows it reached in 1992.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at the Industrial Bank of Japan in London,
said: 'The G7 partners at this stage do not agree that concerted
intervention could contain the dollar's decline. They have admitted
implicitly that there is very little that they can do.' He added that in the
context of the G7's strong commitment to free markets 'it would be illogical
to stand in the way of a move that is clearly a reflection of changing
market fundamentals'.
Apart from the disappointment of the G7 summit, analysts said
concern that the US Federal Reserve has not moved sufficiently aggressively
to combat inflationary pressures in the economy had also contributed to the
dollar's current weakness.

'We're looking at a situation where higher prices are needed to ration
demand,' said Ms Ganes. 'Brazil could run out of coffee by mid-1996. It's
the world's largest producer. That's a pretty scary thought.'
In New York, September futures prices for arabica coffee, which accounts for
the bulk of Brazil's production, were up 50.40 cents at 238.75 cents a
pound, or 27 per cent, in afternoon trading. The September contract in
London closed Dollars 759 higher at Dollars 3,835.
The market's nervousness is partly due to the weather outlook. The frost
season can run through until early September, and cool weather is forecast
for next weekend.
The meteoric rise in prices has prompted some producer countries to call for
a revival of the international export quotas which collapsed in 1989.
Concern is mounting about the impact of the price rises on consumption,
particularly in emerging markets such as eastern Europe.

FT  12 JUL 94 / People: Harrods' new bank manager
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The smart London district of Knightsbridge acquired a new bank manager
yesterday. He is John Simmonds, who has just become director and general
manager of Harrods Bank Ltd, which is situated in - but not controlled
by - the famous store.
Simmonds, 58, took early retirement from Lloyds Bank when it was going
through a restructuring exercise in 1992. Since then he has been acting as a
consultant for small businesses and others, including Lloyds, and has just
been approached by Harrods. Having been an area director with Lloyds, he is
looking forward to running all aspects of Harrods Bank - which has assets of
almost Pounds 25m.
With just 3,500 customers, Simmonds sees his first task as establishing a
relationship with the existing clients. Beyond that, he believes that there
is a role for the bank in offering a personal service to young professionals
who are not yet the high net worth individuals courted throughout the
financial services sector.
'We don't want to be all things to all men,' Simmonds says, 'but one of the
first priorities is to look at those who are one or two rungs up the ladder
and believe they merit a more personal service than they are getting from
the main clearing banks.'

The boards of CBS, the US television broadcasting network, and QVC, the
television shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, a top Hollywood
executive, will meet on Wednesday to consider the proposed merger between
the two groups which was announced on June 30. Both companies seem certain
to approve the transaction, which has sharply boosted their share prices.
But it will take another 90 to 120 days to complete, and a hostile bid for
CBS could emerge during that period.

<TEXT>
Jordan's King Hussein said over the weekend that he was ready to meet
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, for the first time in public, in
return for US financial aid.
He said Washington had promised to waive about Dollars 950m of debt owed by
Jordan and help with the modernisation of the kingdom's armed forces if he
met with the Israeli premier.
'If the meeting between me and the Israeli prime minister is a price to
change the picture of this country, I will not hesitate at all and consider
it a service for my country,' he told the parliament.
Israeli officials yesterday welcomed the king's statement, and suggested a
summit could take place in mid-October in Cairo. Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's
deputy foreign minister, said King Hussein's decision was 'courageous'.
Last month, the king announced that Jordan would push ahead in its peace
talks with Israel and could no longer wait for progress on the other tracks.
Frustrated with the lack of co-ordination with the Palestinians and Syrians,
he said that from now on Jordan would look after its own needs.
Next week Jordanian and Israeli negotiators are to meet in Jordan near the
1967 ceasefire line just north of Aqaba to discuss border demarcations. It
will be the first time that Israeli officials publicly enter Jordanian
territory.
Later Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher,
US secretary of state, are due to attend the opening session of another
round of talks in the Jordan Valley on economic co-operation. Subjects to be
covered include a Dollars 3bn canal project to join the Red Sea to the Dead
Sea and joint development projects in the Jordan Valley.

   MURFATLAR, ROMANIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's hardline Premier Li Peng celebrated his 36th wedding anniversary in
a Romanian vineyard yesterday and let slip rare remarks on his personal life
as he tasted wines with his wife. Reuter reports from Murfatlar, Romania.
'My wife and I are very happy, just like the day we married 36 years ago,
maybe happier,' Mr Li said.
'A family is happy when both husband and wife help each other. But a husband
especially must obey his wife's orders.'
Mr Li made the remarks as he sampled wine at the renowned Murfatlar
vineyards, where he dropped in for a tasting session during a weekend rest
on Romania's Black Sea coast.
He arrived on Saturday for a four-day trip, the highest-level visit to
Romania by a Chinese leader in 10 years.
Mr Li and his wife Zhu Lin took their hosts in Murfatlar by surprise when
they said Sunday was their anniversary.
'My wife agrees we are a happy family,' Li said, gently pressing his hand on
Zhu's arm as she sat next to him at a long wooden tasting table in the
Murfatlar cellars.
To mark the anniversary, the two sipped wine from each other's glass, to the
applause of 100 accompanying Chinese and Romanian officials and businessmen.
Mr Li's affable banter contrasted with the image he earned over the bloody
crushing of demonstrations in Beijing in 1989, for which he is widely
blamed. Earlier legs of his European tour, in Austria and Germany, were
dogged by human rights protests.
Today, Mr Li flies to the capital Bucharest to meet President Ion Iliescu,
once his classmate at a communist cadre school in Moscow. The two leaders
are to sign a joint political declaration and a set of economic and cultural
agreements.

MONDAY
Mid-East peace phase two
Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, buoyed by the completion
of the first phase of their peace process, begin talks in Cairo on the
second phase - the extension of Palestinian self-rule from Gaza and Jericho
across the West Bank.
Two working groups will meet concurrently. The first will discuss the
transfer of power to the Palestinians in the education, health, social
welfare, tourism and direct taxation. A second group considers the sensitive
issue of Israel's failure to honour its commitment to release up to 6,000
Palestinian prisoners.
Germany presents plans for its six-month presidency of the European Union to
finance ministers in Brussels. The agenda includes: a planned deregulation
committee to study whether EU and national laws are stifling job-creation;
macroeconomic guidelines for progress toward a single currency; and
proposals for closer contacts with employment ministers to discuss labour
market reform.
Nigeria's plans for democracy:
The country's constitutional conference re-starts in Abuja, after a two-week
adjournment to finish fitting out the delegates' accommodation. In the
interim, Moshood Abiola (above), the deposed winner of last year's
presidential poll, has been arrested and charged with treason, and junior
oil workers have gone on strike against military rule. On Tuesday, senior
oil staff are due to join them. The strike could spread to other unions.
Abiola's appeal for bail comes to court on Thursday.
Osaka District Court is due to rule on an appeal by central government,
Kumamoto Prefecture and Chisso Corp, a chemicals group, against a Y2bn
(Dollars 20m) compensation order awarded to a sufferer from mercury
poisoning allegedly caused by Chisso.
Alitalia strike: Staff at the Italian state airline plan a 24-hour strike in
protest at restructuring plans aimed at turning round the loss-making
national carrier.
Kazakh tax: A conference on creating an investor-friendly taxation system
for the oil-rich central Asian republic of Kazakhstan begins at the
Confederation of British Industry in London.
World Population Day has been declared by the United Nations, to highlight
demographic problems. The UN's approach to family planning has been attacked
by the Vatican as 'biological colonialism'.

TUESDAY
Auch Clinton ist Berliner
President Clinton will be treading in the footsteps of John F. Kennedy, with
a big set-piece speech in Berlin.
His audience is eagerly awaiting a repetition of President Kennedy's famous
grammatical gaffe - 'ich bin ein Berliner' - which actually means 'I am a
(Berlin) doughnut'.
If President Clinton corrects the phrase to 'ich bin Berliner', it might
mean what he wants it to mean.
German troops and the UN: The German constitutional court in Karlsruhe is
due to pronounce on the divisive issue of whether German soldiers should in
future be allowed to serve on missions outside the Nato area.
The court is expected to announce a qualified yes, with the proviso that all
future missions, including blue-helmet exercises for the United Nations,
should be individually approved by parliament.
Grim tally at Credit Lyonnais:
The French National Assembly publishes the report of its inquiry into
mismanagement at the state-owned Credit Lyonnais bank which recorded a
FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.2bn) loss last year.
According to leaked accounts, the report criticises both the former bank
president, Jean-Yves Haberer, for piling up bad loans, including more than
FFr40bn in doubtful property loans that have now been hived off into a
separate state-backed company, and the French Treasury for not stepping in
earlier.
Taiwan aid meeting: The foreign ministers of seven central American
countries are meeting in Taipei to discuss development projects in their
respective countries, for which Taiwan may consider providing funding or
technical assistance.
Hosted by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this will be the third
annual meeting of the Central American Commission, whose members are
Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Costa Rica and Panama.
All confer diplomatic recognition on Taiwan rather than on the People's
Republic. In return, Taipei offers loans for development projects and small
and medium-sized businesses and other forms of support.
UK training: Britain's 82 Training and Enterprise Councils hold their annual
meeting at Birmingham International Conference Centre (to Thursday).
The councils are responsible for delivering government-funded training
programmes and fostering economic development. The guest speaker is Prince
Charles.
FT Surveys: France and World Automotive Components.

Murder law faces overhaul
The Law Commission, the British government's law reform body, issues a
consultation paper about the future of the 16th century 'year and a day'
rule. Under the rule, an assailant cannot be charged with murder or
manslaughter if the victim dies more than a year and a day after the
assault. Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, has called for
the rule to be abolished. She disclosed that six people had escaped possible
prosecution for murder in recent years as a result of it.
Spanish economy: June's consumer price index, published today, is expected
to show a 0.1 per cent fall in headline and underlying inflation to give
year-on-year rates of 4.8 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively. The Bank
of Spain, which holds its 10-day repurchase tender of central bank
certificates today, is likely to keep its benchmark intervention rate
unchanged at 7.5 per cent.
UK economy: A spate of data today will focus attention on the pace of
economic recovery.
The figures are expected to show that seasonally adjusted unemployment
continued falling in June by some 20,000 a month - although analysts point
out that this does not appear to be matched by rises in the employment
total.
Meanwhile, May's average earnings data and June's retail price index are
expected to indicate that inflationary pressures remain subdued in the
economy, in spite of a steady industrial improvement.
An experiment in faith: More than 400 international delegates, comprising
world class scientists, philosophers, and theologians, gather for the third
annual CS Lewis Symposium at Queens' College, Cambridge. Today they will
discuss 'Ways of Knowing', in the course of a conference to explore the
relevance of Christian faith to modern science (until July 23). Simon
Barrington Ward, CS Lewis' former colleague and chaplain, will attend.
Buxton Festival: The opera festival begins today in the Derbyshire spa town
in England's Peak District (to July 31).
FT Survey: Argentina.

THURSDAY
UK in talks on Falklands oil
British and Argentine negotiators meet in Buenos Aires for two days of talks
to seek a formula that would allow development of Falkland Islands offshore
oil reserves. Argentina claims the islands and threatens to obstruct the
UK's unilateral exploitation of oil reserves. The Falklands' 2,000
inhabitants reject Argentina's participation, fearful that it will use this
as a precedent to advance its claims to the islands.
India's public sector employees have called a one-day national strike to
protest against privatisation.
UK defence spending: Big cuts in support services are expected to be
announced by Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Up to 24,000 jobs may be
lost or privatised, with the RAF support service likely to be sharply
affected. Several procurement decisions are also due.
French National Day: The annual Bastille Day parade down the Champs-Elysees
takes place in Paris. For the first time foreign soldiers, from the
four-nation Eurocorps, have been invited to take part, among them 190
regular German troops.
Golf: The 123rd Open Championship begins at Turnberry, near Ayr, Scotland
(to July 17).
FT Survey: Merseyside.
Holidays: France (Bastille Day).

FRIDAY
Delors' successor sought
German chancellor Helmut Kohl has called a summit of European Union heads of
government to find a successor to Jacques Delors as president of the
Commission. The decision follows the vetoing of Belgian prime minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene by British prime minister John Major.
The German cabinet is supposed to approve the draft budget for 1995, with
spending control and likely further restrictions on unemployment benefits,
in an effort to keep the federal government borrowing requirement below
DM70bn (Dollars 46bn) a year. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, will spend
all week negotiating final reductions.
Middle Europe redivivus: Prime ministers and foreign ministers of the
Central European Initiative, which is composed of 10 nations from the
territory of the former Habsburg Empire, begin a two-day meeting in Trieste,
the old Empire's main port.
UK infrastructure: The A14 trunk road between the A1 and the M1, the only
east-west link south of the M62 built to motorway standard, opens
officially. The road improves travel between east-coast ports and the
Midlands and the north of England.
London Proms: The 100th series of Henry Wood Promenade Concerts begins at
the Albert Hall in London (to September 10).
Holidays: France.

N Korea mourns its leader
A week of mourning for Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader who died of a
heart attack on Friday, culminates with his funeral in Pyongyang on Sunday.
Only after the funeral can dates be set for further meetings between North
Korean and US officials and for a possible unprecedented summit meeting
between the leaders of North and South Korea.
In Taipei, polls to choose provincial local government for Taiwan/Fujian
open on Saturday.
Colombo votes: The ruling United National Party begins its election campaign
with a public rally in the central Kandy hills of Sri Lanka.
Mid-East shuttle: Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, begins his
third Middle East shuttle this year on Sunday. The intention is to revive
the stalled peace talks between Israel and Syria about the giving up of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace.
Mr Christopher's visit comes in the wake of warnings by Israeli leaders that
the next three months represent a 'make-or break' period for a peace
agreement with Damascus.
Football: The final of the World Cup is played in Los Angeles on Sunday.

Monday: As markets digest the implications of the G7 policy meeting last
weekend, a spate of inflation data will be issued this week. In the UK, the
June producer price index will be scrutinised for any sign that rising
commodity prices and industrial growth are raising prices. Input prices are
expected to increase slightly on the month, but to remain below last year's
levels.
In Germany, May's retail sales data, issued early this week, may point to a
small annual improvement in spending, but consumer confidence remains
fragile.
Tuesday: With the markets now predicting that the US will be at the
forefront of any pick-up in world inflation, June's consumer price index
will be watched with interest. It is expected to to show a small monthly
rise.
Friday: June wholesale prices indices for Japan and Germany are due at the
end of the week. The German index may have risen slightly on the month; the
Japanese one is expected to be flat. May's industrial production data are
likely to provide further indication that the sharp downturn in Japanese
manufacturing last year is now bottoming out.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Results could give share prices a boost -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second-quarter corporate results season opens in earnest this week and
investors await news of company earnings with the usual mixture of hope and
trepidation.
Judging by recent buying patterns, however, some investors believe good
earnings are around the corner. If they are right, share prices will receive
a much-needed boost at a time when the Federal Reserve could be poised to
sanction another demand-sapping increase in interest rates.
The highest hopes for strong second-quarter earnings have focused on the big
industrial companies whose profits are tied closely to the movements of the
economic cycle. Because of recent evidence (including last week's June
employment report) pointing to a more expansionary second-quarter economy
than expected, investors have been buying up cyclical stocks in the past few
days.
Motor vehicle manufacturers have been especially buoyant lately, cheered by
forecasts from analysts of quarterly earnings that could be double those
seen a year ago. Wall Street is bullish on the sector because it believes
improved North American sales and a sustained focus on cost-cutting will
have combined to produce significantly improved profits.
Two other sectors likely to have benefited from the strong pace of economic
growth are long-distance telecommunications and rail transportation.
Analysts predict that at the major phone companies, overall calling volumes
will have grown about 9 per cent in the quarter.
The big railroad companies have also been reaping the benefits of a healthy
economy, with rising freight-rail traffic boosting revenue growth.
The news is unlikely to be so positive in the financial sector, primarily
because in an environment of rising interest rates, the earnings of banks
and securities brokerages almost always suffer.
Securities firms, in particular, are likely to be reporting sharply lower
second-quarter earnings than a year ago, when the lowest interest rates in
30 years were fuelling an unprecedented boom in Wall Street profits.
In the commercial banking industry, earnings growth, which has been on a
steadily upward path for the past two years, is unlikely to show as sharp a
retraction as in the securities industry. However, some sort of slowdown is
expected, particularly at the big money-centre banks which are also active
traders in the financial markets.
Overall, the outlook for corporate profits remains bright. The only question
this week is whether investors will be able to focus on earnings with the
threat of another interest rate increase hanging over their heads.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Strategists put new emphasis on growth -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If only the US dollar can at least stay in line this week, the London market
can rely on support from most of the leading market strategists, even if the
buyers still appear somewhat less convinced.
The threat to global interest rates looks less menacing than a month ago,
and dividend and earnings growth reinforce forecasts of a gain of around 11
per cent on the Footsie by the year-end.
Not that the danger of renewed upsets in the bond markets is entirely
consigned to history. BZW uses bond market doubts as its reason for cutting
its 1994 Footsie forecast to 3,400. Its previous year-end target of 3,600
was at the higher end of what may perhaps be called the serious market
range. But BZW explains its move by saying it is 'putting greater emphasis
on the momentum from growth'.
'Growth' has strengthened its role as the underlying theme of most
strategists' views as the tensions surrounding global interest rates have
appeared to lessen.
SG Warburg, sticking with its 1994 forecast of Footsie 3,500, believes that
the response to last week's industrial output statistics indicates that the
market is no longer afraid that economic growth merely threatens higher
interest rates.
Dividend prospects are stressed by BZW, which estimates dividend growth of
10 per cent this year with the likelihood of similar improvement next year.
This would put the stock market yield at 5 per cent which would widen the
yield gap against bonds substantially, even without any retracement of the
rise in gilt yields seen so far this year.
BZW also points out that this month traditionally gives the institutions
their biggest injection of dividend income for the calendar year. With
dividends already showing growth of around 6 per cent this year, suggestions
of a liquidity squeeze on the institutions could prove a snare.
Strauss Turnbull, aiming for a Footsie of 3,200 - 3,400 this year, similarly
holds to its view that strong economic growth, backed up by accelerating
dividends and corporate earnings, will wipe away memories of the uninspiring
equity market performance in the second quarter.
A heavyweight defence of the bull case is presented by Hoare Govett which,
with a Footsie forecast of 3,500, is among the more aggressive market
champions. Hoare rejects bond market worries: 'Gilts . . . more than
discount the rise in inflation over the next two years,' core inflation
'only 3 per cent at the end of next year,' and the fashion for index-linked
gilt yields 'too high'.
This is all very encouraging. The question to be answered is whether it will
stand up if the dollar gets into trouble again.

JOHANNESBURG
Investors will be hoping that last week's falls, following the resignation
of the respected finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, will prove transient and
the long bull market will resume its upward trend, writes Mark Suzman.
After outperforming all other major bourses in the three months to June, Mr
Keys' sudden departure pushed the Johannesburg market into reverse.
However, with a competent and reliable successor named, former banker Mr
Christo Liebenberg, brokers will be hoping that the focus shifts away from
government and back to the anticipated flow of foreign funds to the market
following its recent inclusion on some important emerging market indices.
Helping the return to normality will be the announcement of the latest
quarterly results from the country's gold industry.
Gold Fields, one of the big mining houses, will be reporting its June
quarter results today.
Analysts caution that although the weaker rand will have helped production,
its effect will have been offset by work stoppages at major mines over the
election period. 'Absolutely impossible to gauge,' says Mr Bruce Williamson
of JD Anderson.
FRANKFURT
Shares in Siemens, the electrical and electronics multinational, were under
pressure on Friday ahead of eight-month figures due to be announced today.
At the half-way stage, the group reported a 16 per cent fall in domestic
sales, offset by strengthening foreign business which left group net
earnings flat.
Karstadt, the retailer, holds its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday.
Last month, Germany's biggest retailer following the recent purchase of
Hertie, reported that group turnover in the first five months of this year
soared by 31.7 per cent.
ZURICH
Six-month sales figures could be on the way from Roche late this week or
early next, with analysts forecasting group sales, expressed in local
currencies, to have risen by 10 to 12 per cent in the first half, after a 12
per cent increase in the first quarter.
Expressed in the relatively strong Swiss franc, first-half sales should have
risen by 5 to 6 per cent.
An 18 per cent increase in net profit is forecast for 1994. Last week, Roche
certificates tumbled after Mr Andrew Tiverton at James Capel in London
downgraded the issue to a hold after five years on the buy list.
MILAN
The market will be hoping to regain some momentum after publication,
promised for mid-week, of the long delayed details of the government's
budget proposals.
The market also looked fragile towards the end of last week after rumours,
subsequently denied, of government splits and ministerial resignations.
Directors of Ciga are expected to bring to an end the battle for control of
the hotels group tomorrow by handing over effective control to ITT, the US
group which owns the Sheraton hotel chain and which has a direct stake of
only 17.4 per cent.
MADRID
Second-quarter results are expected from Banco Popular tomorrow. Hoare
Govette views the bank as possibly the most compelling buy case in the
European banking sector. By concentrating almost exclusively on domestic
retail business which offers the most attractive terms within the banking
industry, Popular has avoided diluting its returns by diversifying into
lower yielding activities and markets.
Far from rendering it more vulnerable to competitive pressures, this tight
focus gives Popular a significant competitive advantage, the broker says.
TOKYO
Investor confidence will largely remain dependent on the strength of the yen
against the US dollar, as a higher Japanese currency is seen as a threat to
economic recovery and to the competitiveness of the country's exporters,
writes Emiko Terazono.
Economic data expected this week will provide evidence that the country's
recovery remains weak.
In spite of a record low official discount rate, the benefits of low
interest rates are barely filtering down to the real economy, since bank
lending rates are still high due to the rise in long-term bond yields.
Meanwhile, with most investors sidelined in such an unpromising environment,
trading is likely to be dominated by technical activity led by the
arbitrageurs.
Even overseas investors, who have been the leading supporters of Japanese
shares, are starting to take profits to take advantage of the higher yen.
Foreign investors were net sellers for the second consecutive week during
June 27 to July 1 and traders expect the trend to continue as long as the
yen maintains its current level against the dollar.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Amway sparks interest in global Japanese
issues - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's global offering by Amway Japan, the Japanese arm of the US home
care products group, attracted a wide range of international buyers. As the
first international offering by a Japanese company for more than two years,
the deal has sparked interest in global issues among other Japanese
companies.
A well-known name, a stable profits record and extensive presentations to
investors have been attributed as the ingredients for the deal's success.
But securities houses point out there has recently been clear interest in
Japanese issues among international investors in the UK, Europe and Hong
Kong.
Many Japanese companies have now begun to look to overseas equity markets
for funds. According to the ministry of finance, net purchases of Japanese
stocks by overseas investors totalled a record Dollars 46.7bn during the
year ended March, an eight-fold rise over the previous year.
'We know of several Japanese companies currently looking at global deals as
a means of fundraising,' said an official at Morgan Stanley Japan.
With domestic institutions increasingly restrained in their investment risks
following sharp falls in unrealised investment profits, international
investors are likely to be wooed all the harder by leading Japanese
companies.
Earlier this month Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the country's partially
privatised telecommunications operator, announced it was applying to list on
the London and New York stock exchanges to enhance its profile among the
global financial community.
Although the listings themselves are not directly linked to a
capital-raising programme, it has given the ministry of finance, which still
owns two-thirds of NTT, the option to offer its holdings on the two markets.
Smaller Japanese companies are also trying to increase their appeal to
international investors. Overseas investors bought a net Dollars 4.17bn in
over-the-counter stocks last year, 3.6 times that of the previous year. Many
investors have picked up Japanese OTC shares with strong growth potential as
a part of their emerging market portfolios.
The increase in initial public offerings following the ministry of finance's
lifting of restrictions earlier this year, has also helped boost investments
in OTC companies.
Thomas Norton Associates, a US investment researching company specialising
in Japanese OTC stocks, which is organising a seminar introducing the
founders and presidents of Japanese over-the-counter companies to US fund
managers, said interest from both companies and investors has been high.
At the same time, analysts point out that some of the Japanese OTC companies
are looking to list on the US Nasdaq exchange to widen their capital-raising
abilities.
But in Japan, the domestic public offerings market remains tightly regulated
by the ministry of finance. The concept of pre-announcements or roadshows
does not exist, and investors looking for information are largely hedged in
bureaucracy.
Foreign investment houses point out the difficulty in selling shares in bulk
due to restrictions which limit the number an investor can acquire in a
public offering. Such regulations increase the risk for underwriters.
The restrictions, say foreign investment banks, pose a threat to Tokyo's
status as a leading financial centre.
Japanese companies have long raised capital on overseas bond markets as a
result of the tightly regulated domestic market. It may not be long before a
similar trend develops within global equity markets.

Fears of over-supply - the new Murayama administration plans to cover income
tax cuts with bond issues - are sapping investor confidence and outweighing
the impact of the strong yen.
Comments last week by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, that the
government will postpone raising the consumption tax to cover the decrease
in state revenues following from income tax cuts, hit bond prices.
Press reports of an additional fiscal spending package of around Y6,000bn to
help the economy, to be covered by deficit covering bonds, have also
depressed sentiment.
However, the outlook for the economy remains weak, and although many market
participants this week will be focusing on the aftermath of the Group of
Seven meeting, the yen's strength and economic indicators are expected to
point to low inflation and weak demand.
According to DKB International, an average dollar/yen exchange rate of Y100
this business year would mean growth would remain at around 1 per cent,
domestic wholesale prices would fall by 1 per cent and consumer prices by
0.6 per cent.
Private machinery orders for May are expected to fall, indicating a poor
outlook for investment, and bank lending for the year to June is also
forecast to show a decline.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Buyers still shy of South Africa -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's new government has worked hard to reassure international
investors of its intention to keep its budget deficit firmly under control,
and to a large extent it has been successful. But bond investors will
require further reassurance if they are to keep faith with the new South
Africa.
The government's first budget on June 22 went a long way towards doing this.
It was tough on public spending, with the budget deficit forecast to be 6.6
per cent of gross domestic product for the current financial year, down from
9 per cent two years ago.
However, the sharp rise in bond yields on Tuesday following the resignation
of Mr Derek Keys, the widely respected finance minister and the man largely
responsible for proving South Africa's fiscal credentials, is a measure of
how nervous the financial markets remain.
Investors fear the government, faced with so many demands on its resources
as it embarks on its ambitious plan of reconstruction and development, will
overshoot spending targets. To fund the growing budget deficit it might then
be tempted to print money, so fuelling inflation, or issue more bonds in
world markets, so driving up yields.
However, South African government bond yields have risen almost 3 percentage
points to almost 15 per cent since the start of the year and only part of
this increase can be explained by these fears.
The rise in yields is due mainly to the fall in world bond markets; South
Africa, like most of the world, has been buffeted by worries about
strengthening global economic recovery and rising world inflation.
This is understandable, since in South Africa it is international investors
who on the margin are the main influence on bond yields, and increasingly so
as more foreign investors are tempted into the newly open economy.
At the end of 1992, the South African public sector bond market was roughly
the equivalent of Dollars 59.4bn in size, about the same as Australia's.
Although most of the country's government bonds are owned by domestic
investors, they are constrained by foreign exchange controls and tend to
hold on to bonds to maturity rather than trade them.
It is therefore unlikely that South African bond yields will fall back until
international sentiment improves and bond yields, especially in the US,
decline.
The economy came out of a three-year recession last year and is expected to
grow by more than 3 per cent this year, boosted in part by overseas
investment and by export growth after years of an international boycott.
Inflation has fallen significantly from the double digit rates of the 1980s,
to 7.3 per cent in May, and although with renewed economic growth it may not
have further to fall, it is still declining, which will have a beneficial
impact on the bond market.
This relatively bright outlook for the South African bond market, however,
has to be tempered with caution as the situation could turn sour.
The money supply is expanding rapidly - M0 grew by a preliminary 22.8 per
cent in the year to March - an indication that inflation may be more of a
problem in the future. That could mean a serious test of the Reserve Bank's,
and governor Chris Stals', autonomy at a time when the new government will
not be keen to see a rise in interest rates.
A further risk is political. So far, the new government of national unity
has worked well. But the pressure on the administration is tremendous and
the expectations of the formerly disenfranchised population are great;
conflicts between the finance ministry and other government departments on
spending levels may be unavoidable.
The role of Mr Christo Liebenberg, who will succeed Mr Keys as finance
minister later this year, will be of primary importance. An experienced
banker, with no formal political affiliations, his appointment shows the
government intends to keep a firm hold on public spending.
However, he lacks Mr Keys' powerful personality, and without Mr Keys'
carefully nurtured relationship with top figures in the African National
Congress, he may not command the same respect in the new government.
'There may be a change of face, there may be a change of style, but there
won't be a change of direction,' Mr FW de Klerk, deputy president, said last
week.
With such unlikely bedfellows in the new government, the financial markets
will take some convincing. There is no doubt that international investors
will be watching developments closely, even more so after being unnerved by
Mr Keys' departure.
As it steps up its efforts to acquire an international credit rating in an
attempt to return to the international capital markets, the government may,
therefore, be even stricter than it would have been with its public finances
and implement the spending controls proposed in Mr Keys' last budget in
full.

A stronger than expected US employment report on Friday means that the main
question facing the US bond market this week is when, and by how much, the
Federal Reserve will next tighten monetary policy.
The June employment report, showing an economy still growing at a brisk
clip, reinforced the market's fears of inflation and meant the yield on the
30-year benchmark Treasury issue broke up out of the trading range of the
past three months to close on Friday at 7.69 per cent, its highest since
1992.
Even before the job figures, many analysts were forecasting the Fed would
tighten at the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee, on
August 16. But some now think interest rates could rise much sooner,
possibly in the aftermath of this weekend's G7 meeting.
Statistical hurdles this week include June's producer and consumer price
indices, due on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. The consensus forecast
is for a 0.2 per cent rise in the PPI, excluding the volatile food and
energy components, and 0.3 per cent for the CPI, on the same basis.
June retail sales, due out on Thursday, are expected to show a 1 per cent
rise on May, while Friday's industrial production figures could show
capacity utilisation rising to around 84 per cent, its highest reading in
five years.

Gilt markets will have the regular mid-month menu of UK economic data to
feast on this week, with figures for retail and producer prices and
unemployment all due.
However, most attention will probably be focused on Wednesday's average
earnings data. April saw an unexpected fall in average earnings growth to 3
3/4 per cent, from 4 per cent in March. Expectations are for the annual rate
to be unchanged in May but any acceleration would re-awaken inflationary
fears, as would any further signs of a knock-on effect of higher commodity
prices on the producer prices or retail prices data.
One eye will have to be kept on the international situation, in case dollar
weakness prompts either concerted G7 action, or unilateral US Fed action, on
interest rates. Also keenly watched will be the announcement of the next
gilt auction on Friday: Will the Bank return to a conventional funding
programme, or does it still believe medium to long-term gilt yields are too
high?
Gilts were one of the best performing world bond markets in June, giving
some relief to those who despaired of an end to this year's downturn. Ms
Katy Peters of Daiwa Europe says the short end of the market is still
wrongly priced, since it has discounted an early increase in base rates
which she thinks will not occur.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Spotlight falls on high-deficit
countries - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bear market in bonds took a turn for the worse last week as participants
took a closer look at the massive debt burdens and funding pressures
weighing on some European governments.
This new interest in countries' indebtedness was triggered on July 1 when
Skandia, the large Swedish insurance group and a big buyer of government
debt, said it was boycotting the Swedish bond market until the politicians
found a credible solution to the country's debt problem.
This not only sent Sweden's government bonds and currency to new lows for
the year, but drew investors' attention to other high-deficit nations -
including Belgium, which is nursing the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in Europe.
During last year's bond bonanza, worries over stubborn, structural deficits
were conveniently masked by heavy buying from foreign - predominantly US -
investors, who piled into European bonds on hopes of further falls in
interest rates. The high-yielding markets, whose yields were expected to
continue converging towards German levels, benefited from these flows.
But since early 1994, 'the withdrawal of liquidity has highlighted many of
the debt problems that were concealed by last year's heavy liquidity
inflows,' says Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS. As a
result, yield convergence has been reversed in recent months.
According to OECD estimates, the Belgian debt-to-GDP ratio this year is
likely to be a whopping 146.3 per cent. And while the country is running a
primary budget surplus, the cost of servicing its debt is keeping its
overall budget deficit at around 5.8 per cent of GDP.
While not quite in the Belgian league, Sweden's debt situation is also
deteriorating rapidly. The country's gross public debt is set to reach 92.9
per cent of GDP this year, rising to 100.8 per cent next year, the OECD
forecasts. Its budget deficit is expected to hit 10.7 per cent of GDP this
year, down from last year's 12.9 per cent but still above initial forecasts,
as rising interest rates have boosted debt servicing costs.
Political uncertainty ahead of Sweden's general election in September and
referendum on European Union membership in November is further undermining
confidence in its financial markets. In the run-up to the elections, the
government is unlikely to take the radical fiscal measures needed to restore
confidence. And if the opposition Social Democrats come to power, reliance
on one-off income sources, tax increases and attempts to preserve the
welfare state would probably heighten market fears, warns Mr Jouni Kokko,
international economist at SG Warburg Securities.
Reliance on foreign capital has made some markets particularly vulnerable to
bear market conditions. Some 48 per cent of Sweden's 1993 net borrowing was
financed by overseas buying of government bonds or foreign currency
borrowing, and heavy foreign sales this year have taken their toll on the
bond and currency markets.
'The rating agencies are likely to become a lot more wary of debt junkies in
the present situation, which (in Sweden's case) should limit the ability to
finance outside the Swedish krona,' warns Mr Mike Gallagher, director of
economic research at market analysts IDEA. 'In turn, this increases the
reliance on overseas purchases of Swedish krona denominated debt.'
While most European currencies have been weakening against the D-Mark, those
of high-deficit countries have come under particular pressure. The Swedish
krona fell to a new low of SKr5 per D-Mark last week; the Italian lira
approached the key L1,000 per D-Mark level as the Berlusconi government
continued to delay the publication of its budget plans; and the Belgian
franc - usually as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar - fell to around BF20.70
to the D-Mark, from BF20.59 only two weeks earlier.
As a result of currency weakness, short-term money market rates in countries
with perceived debt or political problems have risen sharply: Swedish
three-month money traded at 7.28 per cent on Friday, up from 6.75 per cent
two weeks before; Belgian three-month rates rose to 6.88 from 5.5 per cent;
and Italian three-month money climbed to 8.31 from 7.25 per cent.
However, raising rates to protect the currency is no solution - if anything,
it compounds the problem by increasing the debt servicing cost. 'The only
way out of the vicious circle is to undertake drastic fiscal tightening,'
says Mr Kokko. 'Many governments still don't understand how serious the
situation is, and now the markets are trying to force a solution.'
While Warburg's analysts expect steady increases in long-term yields to
continue, they say this constitutes an important part of the disinflationary
process. As such, 'real and nominal yields are rising to the point where
they may (1) cause a financial accident; (2) cramp economic recovery; (3)
force governments into more disciplined fiscal policy; or (4) bring about
some combination of all three'.

Central banks in Germany and the US met last week and did nothing to change
interest rates; finance ministers of the G7 countries met in Naples and
decided not to launch co-ordinated action to support the US dollar.
According to Mr Adolf Rosenstock at the Industrial Bank of Japan in
Frankfurt, this creates 'the imminent risk of a massive shake-out in the
foreign exchange market'.
However, with bund prices displaying 'remarkable resilience' in the face of
dollar weakness, Mr Rosenstock believes German government securities are in
a good position to weather any storm that breaks early this week.
Support from fundamentals will come from two sets of data due in the next
few days - retail sales for May and wholesale prices for June. Both figures
are likely to add to the picture suggested by recent industrial output and
manufacturing order data: that the German recovery from recession is less
pronounced than seemed the case earlier in the year, and the risk of a
corresponding upsurge in inflation that much less.
Towards the end of the week, traders may start looking ahead to June money
supply data, likely to be released next Thursday when the Bundesbank
policy-making council meets to review the development of M3 in the year to
date.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar's fate linked to G7 statement -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the general axiom that markets only respond to unexpected events holds
true, foreign exchange traders will have a quiet morning today, reading a
widely predicted G7 statement, devoid of any programme of dollar support.
A stream of statements from senior G7 figures last week successfully doused
expectations of anything more than the familiar blandishments against
currency volatility emerging from the summit. Most analysts believe the
market will respond by selling the dollar, though G7 leaders have probably
been successful in en-suring that its decline is gradual, rather than
precipitous.
But this is not a unanimous view. SBC, for example, in its latest currency
weekly, argues that the dollar may be the beneficiary of a short-term, G7
inspired bounce. Although standing by its long term bear view on the
currency, SBC said a 'G7 deal on FX should not be dismissed'.
Of similar mind is UBS which argues that 'the currency market's willingness
to sell the dollar is unlikely to go uncorrected. We expect the central
banks to undertake concerted and sustained intervention to prevent dollar
weakness causing further volatility on bond and equity markets.'
After last week's crowded agenda of policy meetings, market attention will
this week revert to statistical releases. PPI, CPI and Retail sales figures
will be released, and these should give the Fed a better picture of the US
economy. Given the strong non-farm payroll figures released last Friday,
some analysts are now arguing that the likelihood is of a 50 basis point
rise in the federal funds rate, rather than 25 basis points.
The key data release will probably be the retail sales figure on Thursday,
which will shed light on the state of demand in the economy.
Some analysts expect the Fed to move as early as this week. Others believe
it will wait until its next meeting on August 16. Whether higher rates will
help the dollar is a moot point. Four rate increases this year have done
little for its fortunes, nor falling rates in Germany, but when rates in the
two countries cross, probably towards the end of the third quarter, this may
herald a turn in sentiment.
Market attention will also focus on the currencies which have borne the
brunt of dollar weakness (or D-Mark strength) such as sterling, the Italian
lira, Belgian franc and Swedish krona. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime
minister, has promised this week to announce details of a budget deficit
reduction package.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Nervousness over Mexican election - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With less than six weeks before Mexico's presidential election, investors in
the country's stock and money markets are uneasy. The governing party may be
the clear favourite to win, but many fund managers seem unwilling to commit
money to the market before knowing the result.
While equities have recovered a little this month, they were down nearly 9
per cent in June and, over the year, the principal index has lost 19 per
cent in dollar terms. In recent weeks volume has been unusually low, and
several large and arguably ill-timed equity offerings have had to be
postponed or priced at heavy discounts, casting a further cloud over the
market.
The exchange rate has come under renewed pressure, with the peso trading at
3.40 to the dollar, its upper limit. One Mexican money manager reckons that
some Dollars 100m a day is leaving the country because of election fears.
The weakness of the peso has caused short-term interest rates to edge up to
16.5 per cent, back to the level of early June. 'People are staying on the
sidelines' says Mr Stefano Natella of CS First Boston. 'They do not want to
buy ahead of an election when there is some uncertainty over what will
happen.'
The electoral doubt has coincided with the rise of US interest rates and
poor performance on Wall Street, both of which have helped pull the Mexican
bolsa further down. Foreign investors account for the greater part of
trading in Mexican securities, making the stock market particularly
vulnerable to jitters in the US.
'The US situation is the ultimate cause of a lot of the volatility', says Mr
Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns. Higher US interest rates have added to the
pressure on the peso, and along with the election uncertainty, explain the
rise in domestic rates.
While the opposition has only an outside chance of winning the presidency,
the election is certainly closer than many had expected. After winning
Mexico's first ever television debate in May, Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos
of the centre-right National Action Party closed the gap in opinion polls
with Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party candidate, although recently his
support has slipped again.
While Mr Fernandez generally supports the pro-market economic policies of
the current administration, he and his party have no experience of
government, and there is tremendous uncertainty about how he would manage
the country in the event that he won the election. After 65 years of
continuous rule of the PRI, the handover of power to another party would not
be easy.
Even if, as likely, the PRI wins, any indications of electoral fraud or
voting irregularities could provoke a wave of electoral protests from the
opposition that might cause a serious political crisis. The 1988
presidential election was marred by widespread reports of fraud, with Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, then as now the principal candidate of the left,
claiming there had been a coup d'etat by the ruling party.
With the political system already reeling from the Zapatista revolt in
Chiapas at the New Year, and the March assassination of the PRI's
presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's ability to
withstand such protests is much reduced. Says one PRI official: 'We have
little margin for manoeuvre. Our victory will have to be credible or there
will be difficulties.'
The awkward domestic and international environment and the related increase
in interest rates has squeezed economic growth this year. In the first
quarter, the economy barely grew compared to the same period last year, and
the consensus forecast of growth for the year is about 2 per cent. Last year
the economy expanded by just 0.4 per cent.
The low growth and weak exchange rate, which has forced Mexican companies to
report large losses on their foreign debt holdings, has led to a sharp
decline in the forecast earnings growth of Mexico's leading companies.
Baring Securities has recently reduced its estimate of the average real
growth in earnings per share for Mexico's largest 36 companies from 20 per
cent to 13 per cent.
If the political uncertainty continues some analysts expect that the
government will have to devalue the currency. In spite of the low economic
growth, Grupo Moneda, a financial research house in Mexico City, reckons
that the current account deficit will reach Dollars 25.6bn this year, or 7
per cent of GDP. Even with real interest at close to 10 per cent, capital
inflows are unlikely to cover such a large deficit, forcing the central bank
to run down its reserves.
'There is a huge overvaluation of the peso' says Mr Rudiger Dornbusch, an
economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 'It is
crazy to postpone the day because of concerns of the foreign debts of
Mexican companies. The state of siege will only go away when the peso is
devalued.' Mr Dornbusch says that a 20 per cent devaluation would be
sufficient to allow a cut in interest rates, and a resumption of growth.
In spite of such warnings, many analysts are advising their clients to buy
on the grounds that most of the bad news has been discounted by the market
already and that, after the election, the situation will improve. Mexico's
stock market is currently trading at about 13.8 times this year's earnings,
and 11.1 times 1995 earnings, according to Baring Securities, making it
exceptionally cheap by historical and international standards.
'If you believe that Mr Zedillo is going to win, and that the situation will
return to normal after the elections then the market looks very attractive'
says one Mexican money manager; 'but after what has happened this year,
investors are not taking anything for granted.'

<TEXT>
Turkey
Turkey's stock exchange is to extend its settlement period, and increase
trading hours in a move to attract foreign investors, who already account
for about 40 per cent of turnover, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul.
The new chairman of the Istanbul stock exchange, Mr Tuncay Artun, is due to
announce the changes today Until now all trades have had to be settled by
the end of the next business day, or T+1.
The reforms envisage a T+2 settlement period.
On trading hours, in addition to a two-hour morning session, there will now
be two more hours in the afternoon.
The exchange's concern has been that an extended settlement system would
encourage short trading.
However, brokers say that the change should diminish the number of failed
sales, which result because, on foreign buy orders, the funding requirement,
they explain, is often not known until after the market closes.
Buenos Aires
The Buenos Aires stock exchange has modified its weighted MerVal index.
Three new issues have been added while four issues have been dropped.
Energy stocks remain the biggest sector in the MerVal, which now comprises
22 stocks in all, representing approximately 25.9 per cent of the weighting.
Two of the three companies added to the MerVal are Buenos Aires-based
thermal power utilities, Central Costanera and Central Puerto. The third
newcomer is Citicorp Equity Investments, which has stakes in
telecom-munications, natural gas, oil, and timber products concerns.
The four stocks left out of the MerVal are the petrochemicals group, Indupa,
the cement maker, Corcemar, and Banco del Sud, as well as Nabisco's local
food company, Terrabusi.
IFC Factbook
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has released the 1994 Emerging
Stock Markets Factbook*, which provides detailed information of 50 stock
markets in developing countries.
This year's factbook presents for the first time IFC's investable indices
(on stocks available to foreign investors), broken down by industry.
It also includes an introductory section with detailed information on how
emerging markets are defined, economic and stock market characteristics, and
expanded analyses of the IFC indices as well as individual markets.
IFC is a World Bank subsidiary, and the leading multilateral source of
equity and loan financing for private sector projects in developing
countries.

Israel
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, was worried this week after Tel
Aviv's Mishtanim, blue chip in-dex hit a low of 148.01 on Monday.
He said he was 'worried because I'm convinced that the economic situation is
far better than it is given expression in the stock exchange'.
Investors responded and the Mishtanim made a three-day recovery to close the
week 10.6 per cent off its lows at 163.83 - still, unfortunately, 36.6 per
cent off its high of 258.44 for the year.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Markets: Innovative technology - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, a senior Eurocrat lectured me on why Europe's future hinged
on information technology. IT was so vital, he insisted, that control over
its production would determine competition in every other business. 'If we
have no IT industries, Japan and the US will dominate our economies,' he
said.
Such extreme paranoia is rare. Yet there is a tenacious belief, even among
more sober policymakers, that high-tech is 'special' and merits attention
which they would never lavish on other industries.
In the name of investing in future prosperity, Europe has pumped billions of
Ecus into collaborative research and development efforts, such as Esprit and
Eureka, intended to strengthen the competitiveness of producers across a
range of high-tech sectors.
That Europe's high-tech trade balance has nonetheless continued to
deteriorate, and that it has been marginalised in the computer and
semiconductor markets, has caused some in Brussels to question the value of
these efforts.
But such doubts have not deterred the Clinton administration from embarking
on a similar course. In the past 18 months, it has launched a battery of
initiatives to support industrial R&amp;D and product development.
Washington has long been the world's biggest R&amp;D spender, with an annual
budget of Dollars 70bn. Most of the money has been for federal defence,
space and energy programmes. The aim now is to re-orient spending to bolster
producers in commercial markets. Whether results in the US will be any
better than in Europe is debatable. But a more basic question is why
high-tech attracts privileged treatment. Few of the most common explanations
look convincing.
One is that high-tech and other research-intensive industries matter because
they account for an above-average share of output in advanced economies. But
while that is true in the aggregate, individual industries' wealth-creating
performance vary widely.
Many leading pharmaceuticals companies are phenomenally profitable. But
value-added per worker in US electronics manufacturing is barely an eighth
of that in cigarette-making. Few jet airliner programmes ever recover their
costs, while Philips, Europe's biggest electronics group, had negative
value-added for many years.
Some high-tech enthusiasts concede that point, but argue that the real
benefits are more indirect. For instance, they say, high-tech industries
raise skill levels by employing highly trained workers at above-average
wages.
But surely, in market economies, well-qualified workforces stimulate the
creation of productive and rewarding jobs, rather than the reverse. That is
certainly the lesson of Asia's 'tiger' economies.
Another argument made in high-tech's favour is that it generates
research-based spillovers which enrich the rest of the economy. However,
generalisations are difficult. Civil aircraft makers clearly gain from
defence research, while California's Silicon Valley has prospered hugely
from the ceaseless cross-fertilisation of ideas and technology.
It is less clear who has benefited from IBM's renowned habit of investing
heavily in research which it often never exploited. In truth, spillovers
depend as much on the effective diffusion of technology as on its volume and
quality.
Governments also often claim that a strong high-tech capacity is
strategically necessary. Without local access to advanced technologies, it
is said, users will be at the mercy of foreign producers.
But in many high-tech industries, notably electronics, success often depends
less on originating research than on appropriating it through efficient
volume manufacturing. As a result, today's vital technologies can quickly
become tomorrow's low-margin commodities.
In this context, the Pentagon's recent project in flat panel display screens
seems to be tempting fate. Worried by its reliance on scarce supplies from
Japan, it has offered Dollars 500m in subsidies to persuade US companies to
make them. Yet Korean companies are now investing in so much production
capacity that the shortage may soon become a worldwide glut.
Finally, it is often argued that high-tech is special because of its
pervasive importance to industrial users. But though its application is
commercially necessary, it rarely confers decisive advantage. Indeed, a
recent international analysis of manufacturing by McKinsey, the management
consultancy, found no instance where superior use of high-tech explained a
market leader's success.
So why do high-tech industries exude such political allure? One reason may
be that many have long depended heavily on governments as customers, owners
or regulators. Such cosy relations favour clientelism and special interest
lobbying.
Second, high-tech industries' glamour and fast-changing nature have
encouraged a belief that more technology-push means more innovation.
Witness, for instance, the UK government's recent effort to ginger up
industrial performance by publishing a corporate R&amp;D 'scoreboard'.
But technology and innovation are separate things, and the relationship
between them is complex and subtle. If government policies drew the
distinction more clearly, they would avoid a lot of misdirected effort and
expensive mistakes.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Markets: Hidden casualties of the curve - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within days, companies will begin to shower Wall Street with figures on
their second quarter trading. The results season will help answer some of
the questions currently troubling world markets, notably the impact of
rising commodity prices on profit margins. It will also shed light on a
point which has attracted less attention: the damage inflicted on corporate
earnings by the shift in the yield curve.
It is no secret that corporate treasurers have been playing in the interest
rate swaps markets along with the hedge funds and the proprietary trading
desks of banks. The Dollars 102m losses on swaps contracts revealed in the
first quarter results of Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer goods group,
showed that the hedges were not alone in their exposure to this year's
interest rate hikes. But despite those examples, Wall Street may not fully
have taken on board the implications of rising interest rates for corporate
earnings.
In the past three years, corporate treasurers have enthusiastically taken
advantage of the steepness of the yield curve to cut the cost of borrowing.
Through interest rate swaps, they have replaced expensive fixed rate
long-term debt with much cheaper short-term floating rate debt.
Some, at least, seem to have believed that monetary policy would not allow
interest rates to rise to the extent implied by the curve - as P&amp;G's losses
indicated. To a large extent, P&amp;G is a special case: the two deals in
question were complex, highly leveraged swaps, multiplying many times the
effect of rises in US and German interest rates.
But if a new report by Salomon Brothers is correct, many companies employing
more straightforward swaps will also have been squeezed, although to a
lesser extent.
Salomon estimates that over the past three years, industrial companies have
swapped between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of their fixed-rate
investment-grade debt into floating rate debt. Corporate treasurers,
striking that kind of contract last autumn, would have expected to cut
annual interest charges by 150 basis points.
However the movement in interest rates since then has entirely wiped out the
expected savings. If rates rise further, companies could be forced to pay
more in interest than they would have on their original long term bonds.
One response to this argument is that it understates the degree to which
companies have taken steps to limit their exposure. It would also be easy,
given the P&amp;G spectacle, to overstate the effect. But if right, the
calculations imply that earnings expectations for the second half of this
year and for 1995 are too high.
Salomon attributes more than a quarter of the improvement in profits of the
S&amp;P industrial sector between 1991 and 1993 to the falling cost of
borrowing. If mainstream corporate America is now as exposed to rising
interest rates as Salomon argues, then the much vaunted-recovery in
corporate fortunes could be more easily undermined than much of Wall Street
has assumed.
Swedish bonds
Late last week the bravest investors began to creep back to the Swedish
markets, pointing to the success of the SKr6.5bn government bond issue amid
the turbulence. Mr Atle Bekken at Enskilda Corporate, a leading broker in
Swedish markets, even suggested that the rest of July would treat the
markets well.
It is far from clear, though, that confidence is well-founded. The bond
issue was helped by high yields, the 7-year bonds offering 10.51 per cent
and the 15-year offering 11.05 per cent.
Moreover the fundamentals remain unchanged. The points to which Skandia, the
insurance giant objected last week, in announcing that it would not
participate in government bond auctions, justify alarm. Sweden has the
fastest growing debt among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development members, at 80 per cent of gross national product at the end of
1993.
The budget deficit, which reached 13 per cent of GNP last year, may fall
slightly this year. But taxes can scarcely rise further, and public spending
cuts are politically inaccessible with the general election fast
approaching.
That is not to say that the fragility of the krona and of Swedish bonds
offer speculators a one-way bet. The government is capable of making such a
gamble expensive and it is conceivable that an incoming government would
make slashing public spending its priority.
But it would be astounding if many do not take the opposite view. You do not
need to invoke the spectre of the tattered hedge funds, which have only
partly repaired their resources after this spring's trauma in the bond
markets, to expect further pressure.
Polish strikes
The threat of an outbreak of Polish strikes in support of higher wage claims
has understandably rattled foreign investors. The four-week strike at the
Warsaw steelworks owned by Lucchini, the Italian steelmaker, has been
followed by threats of action at Fiat Auto in southern Poland. The
Solidarity union in Warsaw has also threatened a boycott of Italian goods.
But it would be too gloomy to suggest, as some have, that this could stall
the inflow of capital underpinning the Polish transformation. They have come
from workforces which stand a good chance of reaching Western European
productivity levels, producing western-standard goods.
The demands were also inevitable. Wages in a country on the German borders
were not going to stay at one eighth of western European levels for long.
The expression of union muscle represents a return of workers' confidence,
but it need not undermine that future. It does, though, mean the end of the
bargains.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Markets: Crunch time for rubber pact - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Co-operation between producers and consumers on stabilising natural rubber
prices has been under strain for some time as the two sides have clashed
over what price range should be defended by the buffer stock manager of the
International Rubber Organisation.
A decision on the future of the international market pact operated by Inro
must be taken at a meeting in Geneva on October 3-14, but members hope that
by then the deadlock may have been broken. To that end representatives from
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, the European Union and the US, among
others, begin a three-day meeting tomorrow in Kuala Lumpur.
The dispute centres on the International Natural Rubber Agreement's
reference price, which guides market interventions by the buffer stock
manager - last week he made an unspecified amount of sales because world
prices, already in the 'may buy' range, were pushing up towards the 'must
buy' level. Producers argue that the reference level should be raised to
accommodate further market strength, while consumers insist that it should
stay at or near the present level.
Hopes for a successful outcome have been encouraged by the buffer stock
manager's selling last week. 'A failure to do so could have a negative
impact on the present discussions,' an EU official had warned before the
sales were announced.
Other points of interest this week include today's publication of the
International Primary Aluminium Institute's May stocks figures, which
traders hope will show a quickening decline, reflecting recent
internationally-agreed output cuts. Today also sees the opening in Sydney of
the two-day 'Mining Summit' of the Association of South-east Asian Nations.
Tomorrow grain traders in particular will be watching for the publication of
US Department of Agriculture crop production and world supply/demand
reports.

FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: ACG set to create a global
footprint - General Motors' components business is entering a new era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' vast automotive components business has been turned into a
separate entity with greater autonomy and a brief to seek business outside
the GM group as aggressively as possible.
To talk of a new era is not over-stating the case. If the company - ACG
Worldwide - has its way, dependence on GM's North American vehicle assembly
operations will have been reduced to little more than 45 per cent by the end
of the decade from 85 per cent at the start of the 1990s.
By then, ACG intends to have created a 'global footprint' of component
manufacturing and joint venture plants, capable of supplying any other
vehicle maker with components systems wherever they might choose to set up a
vehicle assembly plant.
Despite substantial job cuts since the late 1980s, ACG still employs 178,000
people worldwide, operates 180 manufacturing plants in 23 countries and has
13 technical centres and proving grounds. Sales last year topped Dollars
25bn.
Given a business base of this magnitude, the financial implications for
rival motor components companies could be daunting should ACG manage to meet
its business goals.
ACG is more than twice as big as its largest rival component groups, such as
Robert Bosch of Germany and Japan's Nippondenso. Whereas most competitors
concentrate on specific areas, ACG's six divisions - reduced from 13 in the
mid-1980s - embrace all vehicle the key component systems.
Around 27 per cent or almost Dollars 7bn of last year's turnover was earned
from customers outside GM's North American Operations (NAO). Given that ACG
has no intention of yielding up any GM business, the planned sales ratio
targets imply a more than tripling of non-NAO sales to Dollars 22bn, at
current prices, says Mr JT Battenberg III, ACG president.
Such ambitions are likely to be regarded with some scepticism by major
European and Japanese components groups. Many of them have been moving as
fast as ACG to cut costs and raise productivity - a few much faster. And
they can point to a lacklustre past performance for many of GM's components
operations.
Yet based on contracts signed or pending, an interim target of 30 per cent
non-NAO sales by 1996 now looks certain to be exceeded.
The non-NAO business is not wholly non-GM. It includes unquantified sales to
Opel, GM's German cars division, and other GM subsidiaries. But Mr
Battenberg insists that, in the wake of the 'purchasing revolution'
instituted at GM by its controversial former purchasing director Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, ACG is having to fight for the business like
anyone else.
Of Dollars 900m in non-NAO business secured in the past year or so, only
Dollars 56m is acknowledged to have come from Opel.
ACG maintains that a number of factors are running in its favour - although
they should serve to increase the size of the cake for rivals, too.
Not least is Mr Battenberg's contention that the components business is
growing at twice the rate of vehicle sales. 'More customers want power
steering, brakes, catalysts, on-board diagnostics; there are increasing
legislative demands, in the realms of environment and safety, which will
also increase vehicle sophistication and thus component content.
'Many of the growing areas are where we're particularly good - the market's
going our way,' he declares.
ACG's specific forecasts for the period to 2000 appear startling. It
projects 5 per cent annual growth for Europe's vehicles market - but 7 to 10
per cent for components. It projects 4 per cent annual vehicle growth in the
Asia Pacific region and 6 per cent in Latin America - but 10 to 15 per cent
growth in each for components.
Shorter car and truck replacement cycles and market fragmentation - typified
by four-wheel-drives, MPVs (multi-passenger vehicles) and the return of the
sports car - are increasing the volume and variety of demand. The vehicle
industry has also become global and requires globally- capable first tier
suppliers - another point mostly to ACG's advantage.
ACG can be global partners with pretty well everyone, says Mr Battenberg.
'As Mercedes, for example, moves into the US, Mexico and Eastern Europe, we
have already got components manufacturing bases lined up wherever they are
moving.'
Only last week ACG secured the contract to supply the dashboard module,
wiring harness and other components for the leisure four-wheel-drive vehicle
Mercedes is to start producing in Alabama in 1998.
Mr Ned McLurg, a GM vice-president and general manager of the newly-formed
AC Delco Systems division, also stresses the substantial business his
division has won with Toyota.
Where GM has had clear success is in forging individual divisions into a
coherent corporate identity. Individually the names within the new ACG
empire are well known: Delco Chassis, Saginaw (steering systems), Harrison
(thermal management systems), Packard Electric, Inland Fisher Guidse and AC
Delco Systems, newly created by combining AC Rochester (engine management)
and Delco Remy (electrical energy storage and conversion).
Additionally, two other entities, ACG Europe and ACG Asia Pacific, are
charged with finding non-NAO business.
But in the outside world they have tended to trip over each other,
duplicating contacts with non-GM companies and failing to capitalise on
poolable assets. This, too, Mr Battenberg aims to redress.
He is the first to acknowledge that ACG's road ahead is rough. Vehicles
makers require sharp reductions in costs both from themselves and their
suppliers. And while ACG's precise financial performance is buried within
GM's consolidated accounts, it has been struggling to emerge from two years
of losses in the early 1990s.
To that end, some Dollars 3.5bn worth of non-core businesses are being shed.
Between 1991 and last year, hourly paid employment fell from 160,000 to
147,000, at the same time as turnover rose from Dollars 21.8bn to Dollars
25.1bn. By the end of this year, costs will have been reduced by some
Dollars 4.5bn and 12 plants closed.
ACG admits to a turnround in earnings before interest and tax of nearly
Dollars 2bn in the past two years. That it is now making profits has
prompted speculation that last week's separation of ACG from the rest of GM
may be the precursor to an eventual flotation.

FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: Former chairman faces trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Milan judge decided at the weekend to send for trial Mr Paolo Berlusconi,
brother of the Italian prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, former socialist
prime minister, Mr Roberto Mazzotta, former Cariplo chairman, and 17 others,
on charges related to bribes allegedly paid on property deals with the
Cariplo pension fund.
Investigating magistrates believe some L14bn of bribes were paid to the
Christian Democrats and the socialists. Mr Berlusconi has claimed he paid
only normal intermediary fees.
Cariplo itself says the affair is purely a personal matter for those
involved and that its inquiries show the affair will have no impact on the
bank's operations.

FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: Citibank in Dollars 165m loan to
Alcatel offshoot
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citibank of the US has agreed terms with the Turkish government for a
Dollars 165m loan to bail out Teletas, the Turkish arm of Alcatel, the
French telecommunications group.
The deal rescues Turkey from an embarrassing position, where the liquidity
crisis at PTT, Turkey's state telecoms company, had forced Teletas, which is
65 per cent owned by Alcatel, to seek court protection from its creditors.
The loan will allow Teletas to restart operations. It also goes some way to
salvage Turkey's battered privatisation image. Teletas was Turkey's first
privatised company when spun off from PTT in 1988. Parliament last month
agreed to the sale of 49 per cent of PTT next year.
The loan carries government guarantees. The credit will be paid to PTT to
settle outstanding accounts of around TL4,000bn (Dollars 120m) with Teletas
for equipment and other supplies. The facility will also allow Teletas to
settle with its own creditors - 34 foreign and domestic banks which are owed
TL2,743bn.
Around 95 per cent of Teletas equipment sales go to PTT. Alcatel has
undertaken to route more of its sourcing of supplies to its Turkish unit.
Citibank said the loan will provide PTT with cashflow, will improve the
maturity composition of PTT's debts, and allow it to continue its investment
programme.

FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cariplo will await world
recovery before relaunch
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cariplo, the Italian savings bank, hopes to relaunch its postponed
international share issue 'soon', but only when world markets recover
confidence, according to the bank's chairman.
The Milan-based bank, which claims to be the world's largest savings bank,
is the latest victim of what analysts have called 'issue fatigue' on the
Italian market.
It suspended the issue on Friday night. The shares were supposed to go on
sale today, raising as much as L1,650bn (Dollars 1.02bn) and giving Cariplo
its first stock market listing since its foundation 171 years ago.
In an interview published in yesterday's Corriere della Sera, the Milan
daily, Mr Sandro Molinari, Cariplo's chairman, said: 'We will re-table plans
for the operation when dealers are more optimistic about the markets. And
note that I'm talking about all markets. The Italian market is not alone in
being dominated by a cautious tone, and a low level of confidence.'
Mr Molinari pointed out that the bank did not need funds. He also denied
that the decision had been influenced by local politicians, in particular
the regionalist Northern League, which appoints two directors of the
foundation which controls Cariplo.
The League is unhappy about rules limiting the foundation's use of dividends
after flotation.
Italian companies had planned to raise more than L10,000bn of capital on the
Milan stock market during July.
Cariplo's decision to delay its issue came three weeks after the
postponement of a L1,500bn rights issue by Mediobanca, the influential Milan
merchant bank, and in the same week as shares in Ina, the newly privatised
insurer, began trading sluggishly.
The Ina shares, which were made available in the biggest Italian
privatisation yet, have barely risen above the issue price of L2,400.

FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BCE raises Pounds 2.5m for acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BCE Holdings, the USM-quoted distributor of snooker, billiards and pool
products, is raising a net Pounds 2.5m through an underwritten 5-for-4
rights issue at 8p a share to help pay for an acquisition.
The company, where a new management took charge in December, is buying
Keabeech, which operates amusement arcades, for Pounds 1.89m, satisfied by
Pounds 1.2m cash and the balance in loan notes.
The vendors are retaining three arcades in the north east of England leaving
BCE with the 10 London sites.
In 1993 the 10 London arcades achieved operating profits amounting to Pounds
685,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.67m. Net assets at the end of the period
were Pounds 2m.
BCE is also selling two properties for a total of Pounds 580,000. However,
the sales will result in book losses of Pounds 227,000.

FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Unit swap deal offered by City of London
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City of London Investment Management is offering unit holders in its
Emerging Markets Country trust the chance to swap their units for shares in
a parallel new investment trust.
It is also planning to raise additional capital through an issue of C-shares
in the newly-formed Emerging Markets Country Investment Trust.
This is thought to be the first time that an investment trust has been
created from a unit trust, though unitisation is a relatively common fate
for struggling investment trusts.
The move is intended to attract new investors who are barred from investing
in open-ended funds, and also give a choice of investment vehicles to
existing investors.
Unit holders in the Pounds 43m fund have until July 22 to decide whether to
exchange their units for shares, in the ratio of five units for five
ordinary shares plus one warrant.
The costs of the transfer will be covered by the investment managers rather
than the investors. The proposals for the new trust are conditional on the
exchange of at least 30m units, currently worth 53-56p each.
The C-share issue is planned for early September, and will take the form of
a placing, with no public offer. It aims to raise up to Pounds 24m before
expenses.
The articles of the new trust include a promise that if its shares trade at
a discount to net asset value of more than 5 per cent for an entire year,
proposals will be made to liquidate, restructure or unitise it. Other
emerging market investment trust shares have tended to trade at or above net
asset value, but wide discounts could be a problem if the sector fell out of
favour.
The new investment trust will follow the same principles as its forebear,
and its initial portfolio will be almost identical.

FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Busmen get a ticket to ride on road to
riches - A look at Stagecoach's offer for Busways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the tea mugs and chip butties in Busways Sunderland depot canteen, bus
driver Mr Stephen Fox is poring over a sheet of neatly pencilled tax
calculations.
At the back of Mr Fox's mind are a new car, satellite TV and a holiday in
the States.
At the forefront is how to minimise the tax liability he will attract by
taking up the offer from Stagecoach, the quoted bus group, to buy the shares
he and his 1,700 colleagues hold in Busways, an Employee Share Ownership
Plan business.
'Most people want to take the cash', says Mr Fox, whose six years with
Busways would entitle him to Pounds 8,500 gross. 'You can't turn it down.'
'It's an offer you can't refuse', agrees fellow driver Mr John Robinson.
The 1989 management and employee buy-out of Busways from the Tyne and Wear
Passenger Transport Authority turned Mr Fox and his colleagues into
shareholders, but there was no external market for their shares.
Suddenly, that has changed; to clinch its recommended share offer for
Busways, announced last month, Stagecoach is offering to buy employees'
shares, valued at around 62p each until now, for Pounds 4.58 each.
The employees, who can choose cash, Stagecoach shares, loan notes or a
mixture of all three, are being balloted by post; Busways management, which
holds 51% of the share capital, has accepted, but an overall 75% acceptance
is needed by July 21 if the deal is to proceed.
Among the Sunderland bus drivers, who earn between Pounds 175 and Pounds 244
gross for a 39 hour week, there is no question whether the deal will be
accepted; the offer of between Pounds 4,500 and Pounds 13,500 in cash,
depending on length of service, has settled that.
'Four weeks ago they were going to fight to the end', says one driver,
arguing there should have been a vote first, without a cash offer attached,
on the principle of the takeover. 'The money's swung it. Some would sell
their grandmother for a bag of sweets.'
'It's called the bird in the hand', says another driver, Mr Keith Bevans.
'Underneath all this they are frightened of what Stagecoach will do. I think
the offer is too good.'
The implications on income tax and capital gains tax are complex, for
Busways shares are held in various employee trusts; KPMG and Arthur Andersen
have been brought in to hold advice sessions at depots and man a hotline to
explain the calculations to Busways staff.
Some drivers may reduce their tax liability by taking some Stagecoach
shares, but few seem to be considering any significant holding for its own
sake. Loan notes, useful in reducing CGT liability, were felt to be for the
management.
Taking the cash, spending some and putting some into a high-interest
building society account seem the popular option. 'We aren't shares people;
we're just ordinary bus drivers', says Mr Steve Hamilton.
There are exceptions; driver Mr Colin Johnson expects to take nearly half
his Pounds 10,600 in Stagecoach shares. He also has an appointment with his
building society to discuss investment.
The drivers are intelligent he says, but for most, shares are new territory;
many would prefer to have the money, then see what happens. 'It's like
having a lucky bag, you just don't know what's going to be there.'
Stagecoach has guaranteed maintenance of basic pay rates and bonuses and no
compulsory redundancies for three years. Ironically, this has convinced some
drivers they should take the money now, lest something nasty happens once
the three years are up. 'Where there's a carrot, there's always a stick',
says one.
Despite this, Stagecoach's Mr Brian Souter, a former bus conductor with a
taste for old jeans and red loafers, has impressed the drivers at
presentations at their clubs and depots. 'He's amazing', says Mr Robinson.
'He's just like one of us, he knows what kind of hassle we put up with.'
Others doubt Mr Souter rose to become chairman of a business with a turnover
of nearly Pounds 200m a year by being one of the lads. Mr Souter, says Mr
Johnson, is a shrewd businessman. 'He could sell sand to the Arabs.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank completes US buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland has completed its six-year US acquisition spree with
the finalisation over the weekend of its purchase of Old Stone Federal
Savings Bank of Rhode Island.
It paid a premium of Dollars 134m (Pounds 88m) for the business, which
comprises Dollars 1.1bn in deposits and Dollars 450m in selected loans. The
vendor was Resolution Trust Corporation, a US government agency which took
control when Old Stone failed in January 1993.
Royal Bank has deliberately kept the acquisition trail within 100 miles of
the Providence, Rhode Island, headquarters of Citizens Financial Group, the
bank it bought in 1988. Since then, it has bought eight other institutions.
Mr Larry Fish, Citizens' chief executive, says there were four main criteria
in considering any purchase: that the location was close enough to
Providence to deepen the bank's franchise in its core areas; that the target
had a clean balance sheet; that it would make money in the first year; and
that it was accepted that Citizens would merge the back offices and choose
the management and board.
Royal Bank is not the only UK bank eyeing the US banking sector. Despite the
losses UK banks endured in the late 1980s, the fragmented and regional
nature of US banking franchises offers the attractions of being able to
establish a significant market share concentrated in a single, wealthy,
county or state.
Already this year, National Westminster Bank, the UK's second largest, has
spent Dollars 800m buying two retail banks in New Jersey - Citizens First
and Central Jersey Bancorp to add to NatWest Bancorp.
Royal Bank began adding to Citizens in December 1990. It appears to have
reaped some benefit from that early start, as prices for US banks have been
rising. The highest price Royal Bank paid has been 1.9 times book value,
while NatWest has paid 2.4 times book for both its purchases this year.
Apart from the possibility of buying a few more branches to fill in the
network, which will total more than 120 in Rhode Island, Connecticut and
Massachusetts, Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, is clear
that the time has come to consolidate the acquisitions. In terms of market
share, Citizens is now among the top five banks in New England.
It contributed Pounds 27m of the group's interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
201m, against a Pounds 21m contribution the previous year.
To fund Citizens' growth, Royal Bank is injecting Dollars 465m in capital,
of which Dollars 165m is a result of buying Old Stone.
While an end to acquisitions will mean the end of capital injections, it
will also mean intensified pressure for Citizens to deliver organic growth.
Citizens' cross-selling in Rhode Island, where some 60 per cent of its 1m or
so customers live, is an impressive average of between three and four
products per customer. From now on, greater emphasis will be put on
cross-selling in the other two states, where the average number of products
per customer is just over one.
Mr Mathewson believes that fundamental changes in US banking such as
consolidation among fewer, larger players, make it important to build value
in Citizens as well as build income.
'The changes will make the key banks more valuable and will make those which
do not give a strategic advantage less so,' he says. 'If our market share is
only 10 per cent, we could be squeezed out without anyone even needing to
buy us, but as we're the dominant bank in our areas, it's a different ball
game.'

Ashtead Group, the equipment rental company, has bought GKN Powered Access
UK for Pounds 3.35m cash.
GKN Powered was established in early 1990 and rents out an extensive range
of powered access platforms. Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 3.76m with
operating losses of Pounds 85,000. Ashtead, however, expects the acquisition
to be profitable and earnings enhancing in the current year.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Bread and butter business may
silence critics - Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate headed by Mr Greg Hutchings, reports
annual figures today which may finally silence the critics of its Pounds
990m takeover of Ranks Hovis McDougall in December 1992.
Analysts expect the food group to have contributed profits of around Pounds
100m despite the pressure on UK grocery prices, particularly in bread. The
cakes business has been weak with the performance from Mr Kipling expected
to be 'exceedingly dull' according to one analyst.
But the improvement in milling is thought to have accelerated in the second
half along with a recovery in RHM's US operations where it sells peanut
butter and ketchup.
For the group as a whole, forecasts range from Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m,
up from Pounds 171m the previous year, with earnings per share increasing by
around 15 per cent. The dividend is likely to rise to between 7.1p and
7.35p, up from 6.35p.
The old Tomkins businesses are thought to have had a mixed year in the US,
with Murray Ohio, the lawnmower and bikes business suffering from fierce
competition and poor weather, but the building products companies benefiting
from recovery and gunmaker Smith &amp; Wesson showing good growth.
The European businesses had a tougher time, but they constitute a relatively
small proportion of the total group.
Tomkins generates 60 per cent of its operating profit in dollars, and while
there should be some translation gains in the year to April, the shares have
fallen back recently as the American currency has weakened.
Cash flow is thought to have been strong and the group recently made its
first major acquisition since RHM, paying about Dollars 115m (Pounds 75.6m)
for Canadian lawnmower group Noma Industries.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Matra may buy BAe space arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent at Cape Canaveral
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace and Matra Marconi Space are to hold a new round of
negotiations in Paris this week over the possible sale of BAe's space
systems division to the joint venture company between the French Lagardere
technology and media group and the UK's General Electric Company (GEC).
Matra officials, attending the latest US space shuttle launch carrying a
space laboratory involving Matra technology, described the new talks with
BAe as 'important'.
Although the two sides appear close to an agreement after nearly two years
of negotiations, Mr Armand Carlier, Matra Marconi Space's new chief
executive, said it was still difficult to say if a deal would finally be
clinched.
'Acquisitions in the space business are difficult because you have to make
an assessment of both the past and future prospects of a proposed
acquisition. The due diligence process takes long and is complex.'
One hurdle which had delayed an agreement appears to have been resolved.
This involved the Orion satellite to provide a private communication network
for a group of large corporate users led by Chase Manhattan Bank of the US
for which BAe is the prime contractor. BAe had difficulty finding a slot on
a US rocket to launch the Orion satellite to meet the timetable of the
satellite's customers. This now appears to have been resolved with a
potential launch later this year or early next year on a Martin Marietta
rocket.
French officials indicated that Matra Marconi Space could have faced
potentially heavy financial liabilities if it had acquired BAe's space
systems division before the Orion issue was resolved.
French concerns of potentially heavy pension obligations for the 1,000 BAe
employees it would absorb also delayed agreement. Matra said that BAe's
pension scheme was more onerous than the French company's equivalent.
However, Matra appears keen to reach an agreement quickly because it sees
the acquisition as a significant step in its efforts with Marconi to create
an important European group in the space sector.
The combined companies would create a FFr6.5bn (Pounds 780m) group employing
more than 4,000. This would strengthen Matra Marconi Space's position in the
increasingly competitive commercial space business.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Employee buy-out faces bumpy
landing - United Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest employee buy-out goes to the vote in the US tomorrow
when United Airlines' shareholders decide whether they are prepared to cede
majority control of their company - the country's biggest airline - to its
staff.
The betting is that the deal will go through, but it is by no means a
certainty. Last month the Pennsylvania-based Vanguard/Windsor Funds, an
institutional investor speaking for nearly 10 per cent of United's shares,
said it would vote against the proposal, and it may not be the only one.
United's plan is to give employees a controlling stake of between 55 and 63
per cent of the company's equity in return for cost-cutting labour
concessions worth Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3.2bn) over the next 12 years. It
badly needs the proposal to succeed because it forms the basis of its
strategy for restoring profitability in the face of cut-throat competition
from smaller, low-cost US carriers s Existing shareholders will get a
half-share in the new United Airlines plus Dollars 84.81 in cash for each
share they now hold. United argues that there is no alternative to the plan,
but dissenters say that with many of the airline's problems stemming from
uppity and over-paid staff, the notion of an employee buy-out is tantamount
to giving lunatics control of the asylum.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Nerves of steel in German metals group: Metallgesellschaft's
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summing up his term of office as chairman of Metallgesellschaft, the
troubled German metals, mining and industrial group, Mr Kajo Neukirchen had
a two-pronged message last week.
The first element was that Metallgesellschaft's problems had turned out to
be bigger than he expected when he took over as chairman in the week before
Christmas last year.
The second, and marginally more optimistic point contained in a letter to
shareholders, was that more had been done to bring the Frankfurt-based
conglomerate back to financial health than he had thought possible when he
was brought in to the crisis-struck group.
Still, the negative part of the message outweighed the positive last week.
The group's losses for the year to September would be about the same level
as last year's DM1.9bn (Pounds 785m), Mr Neukirchen warned at a briefing on
Thursday night. In the first half, losses were DM1.54bn, against a pre-tax
profit of DM98.3m in the same period last year.
Mr Neukirchen also revealed that the company would have to book a new DM1bn
provision to cover further losses generated by MG Corp, the group's New
York-based US trading subsidiary.
These come on top of the DM2.3bn losses already run up by MG Corp as a
result of speculative trading in the oil futures market, bringing
Metallgesellschaft, one of Germany's biggest industrial groups, to the brink
of bankruptcy in January.
The new provision arises from the entanglement of MG Corp with Castle Energy
Corporation, a north American oil refinery. MG Corp's previous management
agreed to buy refined oil from Castle at higher than market prices for the
next five years.
The situation is complicated by the fact that MG Corp owns 40.1 per cent of
Castle, and former MG Corp directors sat on the Castle board.
The relationship between MG Corp and Castle, set out in 76 contracts from
which MG Corp has unsuccessfully tried to escape, were known about when
bankers and shareholders agreed to a DM3.4bn rescue and refinancing package
earlier this year. It only became clear that a large provision would be
needed in late May and the scale of the risk was not quantified until
Friday.
Conveniently, the new losses will be covered by the extraordinary profits
made on the disposal of Buderus, a heating equipment and engineering
subsidiary sold for DM1.2bn last month.
Mr Neukirchen said last week that Buderus, which was highly profitable, was
sold because it did not fit the group's newly defined core strategy. But the
circumstances of the disposal suggest more of an amputation: earlier this
year Mr Neukirchen was adamant that Buderus would not be sold. Buderus is
not the only part of the sprawling Metallgesellschaft empire to be sold. Mr
Neukirchen's drastic restructuring plans will cut the number of the group's
subsidiaries by half, from 655 at present.
The new Metallgesellschaft will be much smaller than the old. The
medium-term aim is a group with turnover of DM14bn a year, compared with
DM26bn last year, employing 20,000 people, a third of the near 60,000 on the
payroll in March last year.
Business will be focused on four main areas - trade, plant construction,
financial services and chemicals.
These core businesses imply an eventual withdrawal from the group's
traditional mining activities - concentrated in the Canada-based Metall
Mining, a 50.1 per cent owned subsidiary - and from its loss-making
base-metals smelting activities.
The most important measures in the first seven months include job cuts - the
plan is to shed 7,500 jobs with annual savings of DM550m - and the
introduction of a new holding structure for the group.
Announced last week, the new structure goes hand in hand with a much reduced
head office staff and a slimmer main board of five rather than seven
directors.
The group has also halved its DM1.1bn investment plans, cut working capital
and stocks, and taken the axe to its base-metals operations, closing a tin
plant and a zinc alloy works and halving zinc production at its Ruhr-Zink
smelter in Datteln.
In addition Mr Neukirchen has to date raised DM2bn from disinvestments -
DM1.2bn from Buderus and the balance from smaller disposals - and is holding
talks on further sales.
Among the assets up for sale are the group's 28,000 sq m head office site in
Frankfurt city centre, which could fetch DM750m.
The impact of the cost cuts would show through in the results for the fourth
quarter of the current financial year, Mr Neukirchen said last week.
The group's immense debts should be down to DM5bn by the end of September
next year, from DM9.4bn at the end of 1993. 'Bankers' nerves are excellent,'
Mr Neukirchen quipped.
However pleased with progress in the first seven months, Mr Neukirchen was
quite candid about how long it would take for Metallgesellschaft to get back
on its feet.
'The problems will take as long to clear up as they took to develop,' he
said. The full rationalisation would take five years, Mr Neukirchen
indicated, the length of his contract as chairman.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Fokker to receive Fl 1bn cash injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker, the loss-making Dutch aircraft maker, is to receive around Fl 1bn
(Pounds 368m) to repair its eroded balance sheet from its majority
shareholder, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, and from the Dutch government.
The long-awaited refinancing is to consist of a capital injection of more
than Fl 600m from Dasa, which bought a 51 per cent stake in Fokker in April
1993.
The Dutch government, which has a minority holding in the Netherlands' only
aerospace company, will indirectly help Fokker raise an additional Fl 400m
by agreeing to approve a 'sale and lease-back' arrangement whereby Fokker
plans to sell its aircraft-building technology to Rabobank, the big Dutch
co-operative bank.
This part of the deal required government approval because the purchase of
the patents by Rabobank is designed to reduce the bank's tax bill, depriving
state coffers of Fl 400m in revenue. A similar technology lease-back
arrangement was struck last year between Rabobank and Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, after explicit approval from the Dutch government.
In a letter to parliament, Mr Koos Andriessen, economic affairs minister,
said details still had to be worked out and approved by the supervisory
board of Dasa's parent company, Daimler-Benz, when it meets in November.
'Dasa is prepared to shoulder a substantial part of the burden (of the
refinancing),' he said.
As part of the financial restructuring, a new company will be set up at
arm's length from Fokker to group the company's leasing activities.
Customers are increasingly seeking to lease rather than buy Fokker's
aircraft, and this puts strains on the company's own balance sheet.
Fokker posted a net loss of Fl 460m in 1993 after taking a charge of Fl 275m
for the declining value of its stock of unsold aircraft. It has forecast a
recovery in the aircraft market in 1996. Until demand for its aircraft
increases, Fokker has eliminated thousands of jobs and reduced the output of
its two main products, the 50-seater Fokker 50 and the 100-seater Fokker
100.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Fund managers feel optimistic over gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK fund managers are becoming increasingly optimistic about UK gilts and
equities and Japanese equities. They also view the recent weakness in bonds
and equities as a good buying opportunity, rather than the portent of worse
things to come, according to a survey of leading UK investment funds carried
out by Gallup for Smith New Court.
A balance of 42 per cent of respondents intend to run down their cash
balances, the highest figure for around a year.
Optimism about the UK and Japanese markets does not extend to other markets,
however, with a balance of 13 per cent saying they plan to reduce their
exposure in the US and 14 per cent looking to cut their European holdings.
The balance of respondents intending to increase their holdings in UK
equities rose to 20 per cent from 8 per cent last month and that for gilts
to 19 per cent from 16 per cent. Some 69 per cent of fund managers expect
the UK economy to 'get a little better' over the next 12 months.
UK company earnings per share growth is forecast to rise 16.4 per cent this
year. Expectations for dividend growth have been revised upwards with
respondents looking for dividend growth of 8.6 per cent in 1994, up from
last month's figure of 8.2 per cent.
A quarterly inquiry into sectoral preferences reveals definite bias towards
cyclical manufacturing sectors. General engineering, building materials and
pharmaceuticals are the most popular sectors. The three least popular
sectors are food manufacturing, textiles and electricity stocks.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the perennial problems facing banks is their inability to assess and
price risk correctly. In the 1970s banks went overboard lending on low
margins to developing countries, some nearly destroying themselves in the
process. A decade later property lending brought similar pain. The trouble
is that banks tend to develop an insatiable appetite for certain types of
business, sometimes as a type of aversion therapy for past mistakes.
Property lending, after all, offered the benefit of collateral which must
have seemed a godsend after sovereign lending. It turned out to be a dubious
advantage when borrowers ran out of cash and market values slumped. By then
loan pricing bore no relation to actual risk.
A new proposal from the London-based Centre for the Study of Financial
Innovation could go some way towards correcting this problem. Its latest
paper on capital adequacy suggests techniques commonly used for assessing
risks in the derivatives market could be applied to loan assets too.
Basically this would involve using computer models to establish the market
value of each individual loan, assessing its volatility and applying an
appropriate capital ratio.
The paper's main preoccupation is with the safety of the system. But its
proposal, which admittedly is fraught with technical difficulties, would
surely have an impact on pricing too. Banks would be forced into a subtler
measurement of risk which reflected the volatility of their income. Greater
precision in setting capital requirements would make it harder to underprice
risky business. Lending to small business might become prohibitively
expensive as a result. But the banks themselves would make fewer losses.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to allow building societies to write house
structure and contents insurance is welcome. The commissions paid to
societies for selling policies underwritten by insurance companies -
anything up to 30 per cent of premium - are an unnecessary expense borne by
consumers. Direct sellers such as Direct Line are already putting
commissions under pressure. The government has now given the building
societies the choice between accepting lower commissions and going it alone.
Even if commissions come down, many societies will be loath to give up such
risk-free income and take on underwriting risk themselves. Others will not
have capital available to back new insurance ventures. But with modern
technology and adequate reinsurance cover, societies should be able to avoid
ruinous losses in household insurance. Larger societies may thus be tempted
to take advantage of their new freedom, even if it means buying
claim-handling or other services from outside.
That would be bad news for the composite insurers, which gain up to half
their household premiums through building society links. The sharp rise in
premium rates in recent years means the business is now highly profitable.
Wide margins have already tempted the direct writers to muscle in, and new
ventures by building societies would add to the competitive pressure.
Composite insurers may face a battle to defend their market share.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Southgate's comments at Thorn EMI's annual meeting on Friday will
be closely scrutinised. A demerger of the group he chairs into its music and
TV rental components is looking more and more likely. Last month part of the
troublesome defence electronics business was sold to France's Thomson. The
remainder could find a buyer soon, removing the last big obstacle to
demerger.
Splitting Thorn EMI into two looks like a good idea. Investors interested in
EMI would then be able to invest in an unadulterated music group. Given the
worldwide enthusiasm for everything multimedia, it could trade on fancy
multiples. The only major music group currently offering such a pure play is
PolyGram. EMI could be more attractive since PolyGram's rating arguably
suffers from the 75 per cent stake held by Philips.
Unencumbered by its association with the dull rental business, EMI might
also find it easier to branch out into book publishing and create a
multi-faceted entertainment software group. Alternatively, EMI could be
besieged by suitors wishing to include it in their multimedia empires.
All this is heady stuff. Thorn EMI's shares rose 4 per cent at the end of
last week as investors focused again on the demerger concept. The stock's
outperformance since the start of the year has been largely driven by the
same story. The idea is so appealing that a further rise could be justified.
But if any hitches appear, the market will be sorely disappointed.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: United they stand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines shareholders will vote tomorrow on a radical restructuring
plan which involves the workforce accepting an estimated Dollars 5bn (Pounds
3.2bn) of labour concessions in return for 55 per cent of the company's
stock. The proposal has been hailed as an imaginative experiment in
industrial democracy in an era where the distinctions between labour and
capital have been blurred.
But there are huge doubts about the deal's specific industrial and financial
logic. It is hard to make employee ownership work at the best of times as
conflicts of priority arise between employee benefits and capital
investment. Yet United operates in one of the most ferociously competitive
markets in the world. The worry is that United's cost advantage would prove
temporary anyway. If other airlines respond with similar measures then the
whole industry would experience a step change in cost structure, which would
be quickly followed by further painful reductions in fares and therefore in
total industry revenues.
Assuming United's shareholders also hold stock in other airlines, they may
make the hard-hearted calculation that it would be better to block the
United deal and allow a major airline to go bust. Only by removing excess
capacity will it be possible for other carriers to make a decent return on
capital. The distorting effects of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure have
kept too many carriers in the air for too long. If the Clinton
administration is committed to restoring the aviation industry's health it
should encourage companies to fail rather than stick financial plasters on
their wings.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Rush of business likely before summer recess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parliament's last nine sitting days before MPs disappear for their
three-month summer break will bring a flurry of ministerial statements and
policy documents on subjects as diverse as accruals accounting and the
homeless.
It is a time-honoured tradition at Westminster that the last few days of a
parliamentary session are dominated by a succession of long-awaited
government announcements. But this year threatens to break all records.
Between today, when Mr John Major reports to MPs on the world economic
summit in Naples, and July 21, when parliament's summer recess starts, at
least nine significant government announcements are expected.
A number of others, including a statement on parliamentary reform and a
Heritage Department white paper on privacy and press freedom may also
emerge.
One top Whitehall mandarin likened the situation to a queue of jets waiting
for a landing-berth at Heathrow airport. 'Government announcements are
stacked up for the next 10 days until parliament rises,' he said.
In addition to the prime minister's G7 statement and his much-flagged
cabinet reshuffle which is set to be unveiled during the next 10 days,
Westminster watchers are expecting:
An Efficiency Unit study on the future of government research
establishments. The study - to be published today by the Cabinet Office -
will recommend mergers between laboratories owned by different Whitehall
departments. It was launched after an earlier report found 'considerable'
overcapacity and overmanning in civil service research laboratories.
A white paper on the future of the civil service. To be published on
Wednesday, this will propose ending centralised pay bargaining and introduce
personal contracts for more than 2,000 top mandarins. Further privatisation
will be predicted, with the civil service to drop from 540,000 to 500,000
over the next four years.
A Treasury green paper on the shift from cash accounting to accruals
accounting. Also expected around the middle of the week, this will provide
detailed proposals on how the public sector presents its accounts, bringing
it more in line with the private sector.
A Commons statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, on defence
cuts. Expected on Thursday, this may seal the fate of the Rosyth naval base
in Scotland. However, Mr Rifkind believes he has secured a package that will
not impair the work of Britain's armed forces. New regulations setting a
stiffer residency test for EU nationals who say they are looking for work in
the UK and seek to claim benefit in the meantime. The new rules are due to
come into effect in August.
A Commons statement by Sir George Young, housing minister, on the
government's homelessness review.
The announcement of a number of recommendations by the government's
deregulation task force, including a proposal that would allow thousands of
charities to escape the requirement for an annual independent examination of
their accounts.
The Heritage Department said yesterday its white paper on privacy and press
freedom might be published during the summer recess.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new German presidency of the European Union appears to be on course for
a collision with the UK after making clear it intends to try to enact the
remaining labour market and workers' rights measures in the EU's Social
Charter.
Mr Norbert Blum, Germany's labour minister, presented the proposals in a
paper to EU labour and social affairs ministers in Dortmund at the weekend.
They are intended to set the social policy tone for the German presidency,
Foremost among the measures Germany will push for are: stalled directives
extending the rights of full-time employees to part-time workers; widening
parental leave rights; regulating the rights and obligations of employees
working outside their own country; and reversing the burden of proof in sex
discrimination cases - from the complainant to the employer.
The UK, wholly or partly, opposes all these measures, which Germany has
placed high on the agendas of Council of Labour Ministers' meetings in
September and December.
Mr Michael Forsyth, Britain's junior employment minister, said after the
meeting that 'we made it pretty clear we don't want more along the lines of
the social action programme' derived from the European Commission's 1989
Social Charter. 'We are not in favour of regulating pay and conditions and
we're not going to change that.'
Chairing the first, informal ministerial meeting of the German presidency in
his Dortmund constituency on Saturday, Mr Blum evoked the spirit of the
French Revolution, still incomplete, he suggested, in its ideals of equality
and fraternity.
Mr Blum underlined the gulf on social policy between the UK and its
partners, declaring: 'Europe will either be a social Europe - a Europe of
the masses - or it will be no Europe at all.'
The UK may resort to its opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter to avoid
being bound by most of the directives Germany wants to advance. But on
part-time work, it could face difficulties following the recent House of
Lords ruling requiring equal statutory treatment of part-time and full-time
workers.
Mr Blum's discussion paper emphasises the principle of subsidiarity, whereby
the EU should not do what member states can do better. It stresses the need
for better training, more flexible labour markets, and a crackdown on the
black economy.
The document spells out, however, that 'an essential aspect' of the flexible
labour market idea seized on by the UK was the part-time workers and
parental leave directives.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of UK housing associations will today invite German mortgage
banks to raise finance for building inexpensive homes for rent or sale.
The Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes government grants to
English housing associations, is co-hosting a seminar in Frankfurt for more
than 30 German banks in its quest for new sources of funding for housing
associations.
Associations at present raise about 40 per cent of the cost of building new
homes from private-sector borrowing. They have raised Pounds 5.5bn since
1989, including more than Pounds 1bn through sterling debentures.
The corporation estimates that associations will need another Pounds 7bn
over the next four years, and is keen to expand the investor base. It hopes
to persuade the German banks to issue sterling Pfandbriefe, long-term
fixed-interest bonds, to raise funds.
Speakers at the seminar, organised in association with Rheinische
Hypothekenbank, include representatives of the Treasury and Department of
the Environment, as well as current UK lenders.

FT  11 JUL 94 / A future in the balance: The death of President Kim Il-sung
may herald far-reaching reforms in North Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung has added a new
element of instability to an already tense situation on the Korean peninsula
caused by the dispute over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons programme.
Mr Kim personified the North Korean government for more than four decades.
Such has been his dominance that outsiders can only guess at the
consequences of his departure.
It could trigger political unrest that might eventually lead to the collapse
of the economically ailing North and its rapid and costly absorption by
South Korea.
Alternatively, his death may offer hope, for it could be the prelude to the
introduction of Chinese-style economic reforms by a young generation of
technocrats who have been held back by the heavy hand of Mr Kim. They want
to promote special economic zones to attract foreign investment and create
modern industrial facilities for North Korea.
What happens will largely depend on the fortunes of Mr Kim Jong-il, the
eldest son and designated successor to the late president. Although the
younger Mr Kim has an unsavoury reputation in the west (see below), many
Seoul-based analysts of North Korea believe that he has encouraged and
protected a cadre of pragmatic technocrats who want to promote trade and
business ties with the capitalist world.
His support for reforms, they say, is based on self-preservation. Mr Kim
realises that he needs to improve living standards if he is to gain support
from a public suffering from food shortages, falling industrial production
and a lack of oil and other energy resources.
But Mr Kim Jong-il and the technocrats are distrusted by an older generation
of party and army veterans who firmly support the doctrine of juche
(self-reliance) created by his father. They fear that opening isolated North
Korea to the outside world could cause political instability and undermine
the authoritarian government as the public becomes exposed to capitalism and
other foreign influences.
Resistance to Mr Kim Jong-il is believed to be particularly strong in the
military, whose leadership is closely aligned with conservatives in the
government. A younger generation of Chinese-trained officers, however, is
thought to harbour ambitions of spearheading a military-backed
industrialisation programme, repeating the examples of the South Korean army
after its coup in 1961 and the People's Liberation Army in China now.
Mr Kim is consequently vulnerable to a coup attempt, particularly since he
lacks the charisma that kept his father in power. He also faces potential
opposition from members of his family in a modern version of the intrigue
that used to plague the old Korean royal courts.
The biggest challenge could come from his half-brother Mr Kim Pyong-il, who
is supported by the president's widow, Ms Kim Song-ae, and possibly the late
president's younger brother, Mr Kim Yong-ju. These family members are
believed to have close links to the military.
In the short term, however, Mr Kim Jong-il appears to have the upper hand.
His appointment as head of the state funeral committee for his father is a
clear indication that he will soon take over leadership of the ruling Korean
Workers' Party and possibly the less powerful position of president.
Since Mr Kim Il-sung unofficially designated him as his successor in the
early 1970s, Mr Kim Jong-il has had two decades to build up organisational
support for his leadership by placing loyalists in the party and government.
His control over the military, however, is more problematic, in spite of his
role as commander in chief of the armed forces. One reason is that party
influence over the military has been less pervasive than in other
organisations.
Most analysts believe that Mr Kim Jong-il will have only two or three years
to consolidate his support and impose his authority over the government,
party and military if he is to avoid being overthrown.
An early test of his influence will be the two crucial decisions he faces in
the coming days: on whether to pursue talks with the US on nuclear
inspections of the North's nuclear facilities; and on whether to proceed
with an unprecedented summit with South Korean President Kim Young-sam.
His father decided to reopen negotiations with the US and start them with
South Korea shortly before he died - probably with a view to gaining
diplomatic and economic concessions in return for renouncing the North's
nuclear ambitions.
The pragmatists in the government have urged such a policy to end the
country's international isolation and save it from economic collapse,
according to recent visitors to Pyongyang.
But there are worries that Mr Kim Jong-il, lacking his father's immense
authority, may adopt a hardline stance in a tactical move to win the support
of his conservative opponents until he gains total power. This would
increase chances of a confrontation with the US over the nuclear dispute and
possibly of a conflict breaking out on the Korean peninsula.
The delicate political balancing act that Mr Kim Jong-il faces is likely to
limit the scope of any economic reforms that he may want to introduce in the
immediate future.
Moreover, he appears to lack the political skills and finesse that kept his
father in power for 46 years. His need to build political alliances may
eventually reduce Mr Kim to a figurehead or force him to share power in a
collective leadership, which would considerably undermine his authority.
Some believe that even if Mr Kim succeeds in imposing his rule, he will lack
the courage to introduce reforms far-reaching enough to reverse the
country's economic decline. He may fear that a significant opening up to
foreign investment would begin to unravel the centralised political
structure.
'The (investment) measures being discussed would only tinker with the
system, but fail to solve its fundamental flaws. They would be equivalent to
the Soviet Union's efforts in the 1970s to attract foreign investment, which
had little impact,' said Mr Yang Sung-chul, professor of political science
at Kyunghee university in Seoul.
This would be a recipe for further economic stagnation. If the economy
continues to shrink by 5 per cent a year as it has done for the last few
years, it could spark a popular revolt that would provide a pretext for the
army to impose military rule after ousting Mr Kim.
Ironically, Mr Kim's strongest support may come from North Korea's
arch-enemies, South Korea and the US. Seoul is worried that a sudden
collapse of North Korea would cripple its efforts to become an advanced
industrial nation, by forcing it to divert resources to reconstruct the
North. According to some estimates, this could cost as much as Dollars
200-Dollars 300bn (Pounds 133bn-Pounds 200bn) over 10 years.
South Korean officials indicated yesterday that they might agree to ease
restrictions on economic assistance and business ties to the North in force
as a result of the nuclear dispute. They suggested that the US could do the
same, with a view to maintaining political stability.
Unlikely as it may seem for the industrial democracies to seize on Mr Kim
Jong-il as a saviour of North Korea, Washington and Seoul may be praying
that he succeeds in achieving a smooth transfer of power. The alternative
would be a political upheaval whose effects would be felt throughout
north-east Asia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<TEXT>
Mr Kim Jong-il has already surpassed his father, the Great Leader, in one
regard. He enjoys an even worse press in the west than Mr Kim Il-sung.
Newspaper accounts have painted the junior Mr Kim as an unstable alcoholic,
a womaniser who likes to import foreign call girls, and a cinema fanatic who
maintains a library of 20,000 movies and supervises seven movie studios.
South Korean intelligence has claimed Mr Kim masterminded several North
Korean terrorist actions in the 1980s, including the mid-air bombing of a
Korean Airlines airliner in 1987 - although it has not offered convincing
evidence to substantiate this charge.
But the bad publicity does appear to contain grains of truth. Diplomats in
Pyongyang report regular sightings of all-female 'cultural groups'
travelling to North Korea under the patronage of Mr Kim.
In the late 1980s, according to well-substantiated accounts, his interest in
cinema prompted him to order the kidnapping of a South Korean film director
and his actress wife so they could make movies for North Korea.
Mr Kim cuts a strange figure, adding to his enigmatic image. He is small in
stature, bespectacled and pudgy, sports a bouffant hairstyle and his dress
resembles a Chinese factory manager.
In sharp contrast to his charismatic father, Mr Kim in his rare public
appearances has appeared unhappy and nervous. He is described by those who
have met him as being both shy and arrogant. His lifestyle is reclusive and
he avoids meeting foreign visitors. This might help explain why overseas
delegations will not be allowed to attend the funeral of his father on July
17.
But North Korean defectors claim that Mr Kim is a 'techno-freak' whose
interests range from computers to watching foreign satellite programmes,
including Cable News Network. 'Kim Jong-il is well aware of what's happening
in the outside world,' said one analyst.
There are strong psychological and political reasons for Mr Kim's
insecurity. Born in a Soviet army camp near Khabarovsk in February 1942, his
childhood included 'a dreary life in Siberia; his father's ill-treatment of
his mother and her sudden death; his father's remarriage; and a war,'
according to a South Korean government publication.
Although relations with his father appeared to be cool during his youth, Mr
Kim was groomed for power. He attended the Mangyongdae Revolutionary
Academy, an exclusive school for children of the political elite. He
graduated from Kim Il-sung university with a degree in political economy and
is reported to have studied briefly in the former East Germany.
He used his school ties in the traditional Korean manner to cultivate
friendships with people who now hold key government and party positions and
who are his chief political allies.
Mr Kim was officially appointed his father's successor in 1980, but family
conflicts still pose a challenge to his role as heir. His step-mother is
supporting her son and Mr Kim's step-brother, Kim Pyong-il, as a potential
rival.
Another challenge could come from his uncle, Mr Kim Yong-ju, who was
believed to be Mr Kim Il-sung's chosen successor until he was replaced by
the junior Mr Kim. Mr Kim Yong-ju disappeared from public view in the
mid-1970s, only to reappear suddenly as a vice-president last December.
Mr Kim Jong-il might take comfort in the official public adulation that has
enveloped him and his father. He is known as the 'Dear Leader' and the
country's extensive propaganda machine has attributed him with a long list
of extraordinary achievements, from overseeing vast construction projects to
creating a revolutionary new form of theatre.
But North Korean defectors contend that Mr Kim has expressed profound
cynicism about the cult of personality that surrounds him, even though he
helped create it. Mr Kim appears to be driven by a need to prove himself and
escape his father's overwhelming shadow. This may provide him with the
motivation to abandon his father's juche (self-reliance) ideology and open
up the country to the outside world.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Korean iceberg starts to melt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Whatever can he have meant by that?,' Metternich is supposed to have said
on learning of the sudden death of a political rival. It is tempting to ask
the same about Kim Il-sung, the founder-president of communist North Korea,
so thick was the veil of secrecy with which he surrounded himself and his
country, and so dramatic the timing of his final departure.
Only a month ago his intransigence seemed about to plunge the world into a
very dangerous crisis. Repeated prevarication over the inspection of North
Korea's nuclear facilities had forced the world to conclude that Mr Kim was
indeed concealing a nuclear weapons programme, and had left the Clinton
administration with no option but to ask the UN Security Council to impose
sanctions - a move which North Korea had served notice it would treat as an
act of war.
Then a meeting between Mr Kim and ex-President Jimmy Carter produced a
sudden change in atmosphere. North Korea agreed to 'freeze' its nuclear
activity for the duration of a new high-level meeting between US and North
Korean officials - a meeting which actually began in Geneva on Friday when
Mr Kim was apparently already dead. Meanwhile, a few days after Mr Carter's
visit, North and South Korea agreed on the first ever summit meeting between
Mr Kim and his southern counterpart, scheduling it for July 25.
Power struggle
Were these meetings a device to gain yet more time, or was Mr Kim preparing
to extract the best possible price, in economic and diplomatic concessions,
for an agreement to open up his country to full and effective nuclear
inspection? That question is now displaced by others. Will his son Kim
Jong-il be allowed the smooth inheritance of power and office which the
elder Kim so elaborately prepared, or is there already a secret power
struggle in progress such as followed the deaths of Stalin in Moscow and Mao
in Beijing? Assuming he does succeed, and goes ahead with both the Geneva
talks and the Pyongyang summit, will the younger Kim use the meetings to
bring about a more general opening up to the outside world, or will he feel
the need to prove to party and army veterans at home that he remains
faithful to his father's doctrine of juche (self-reliance)?
In the longer term, it is hard to believe that the post-Kim Il-sung era will
not be marked by an attempt at economic reform, combined with an attempt to
maintain tight political control. Both attempts will be dictated by the
small ruling elite's desire to survive, with or without Kim Jong-il. The
question that must be tormenting them is whether such a policy mix has any
hope of success in a state where till now everything has been minutely
controlled, and more especially one which comprises only part of a nation,
the other and larger part being successfully integrated into the global
capitalist economy.
Threat to stability
The division of Korea is no less unnatural and no more desirable than was
that of Germany, and no more likely to prove permanent once North Koreans
(like East Germans) acquire the freedom to vote with their feet. But Korea's
reunification may well prove even more expensive, and pose a greater threat
to regional peace and stability. The risk that the communist regime would
not go quietly is much higher, and the reaction of at least one neighbouring
power (China) is harder to predict. The next few years will provide the
South Korean leadership and the Clinton administration with a test at least
as difficult as that faced, and passed, by Helmut Kohl and George Bush in
1990.
But in the short term neither South Korea nor the wider international
community has any real choice but to wait and see what the mysterious
processes of North Korean politics produce. As much as possible should be
done to encourage Kim Il-sung's successors to put a benign and imaginative
interpretation on the enigmatic diplomacy of his last weeks. That means
continuing to refine the carrots and sticks wielded in recent weeks -
offering the prospect of increased trade and investment to encourage
compliance and reform, but maintaining the threat of further isolation
should the younger Kim prove as intransigent as his father.

Poor old Nigel Lawson. Not only does Britain's ex-chancellor of the

general, but a comprehensive school in Gateshead wants to erase his name
from the school gates. Governors of the Lord Lawson Comprehensive at
Birtley, Tyne and Wear - named after an extinct Labour baron - have voted to
rename their school the Lord Lawson of Beamish Comprehensive to avoid any
confusion with the current Lord Lawson. But why not rename it the Baron
Lawson Comprehensive, as a reminder of the time when even Labour prime
ministers handed out hereditary honours?

Bob Phillis, the BBC's increasingly powerful deputy director general, has
bowed to the inevitable. He is looking for a candidate to relieve him of his
job as managing director of the BBC World Service which he has held since he
arrived at the BBC.
In addition to being John Birt's deputy, and natural heir apparent, Phillis
has just taken on the chairmanship of the newly created BBC Worldwide so he
has more than enough on his plate. However, he is not letting go completely.
The new World Service boss will report directly to him, rather than John
Birt. Sam Younger, the World Service's new director of broadcasting, is the
obvious internal successor.
But his promotion might seem a bit too cosy, if Phillis is really intent on
exploiting the full potential of one of the Beeb's most valuable hidden
assets.

This time Michael Heseltine, Britain's trade and industry supremo, had an
excuse. When the Italian hosts at the G7 summit called a special meeting of
trade ministers on Saturday to discuss ways of freeing new areas of world
trade, Hezza was just about to set off at the head of Britain's largest ever
trade mission to South Africa. Once again Sarah Hogg, head of the prime
minister's policy unit, stepped into the breach.
It's not the first time that Hezza has failed to show up for trade talks. He
missed Marrakesh in April when the world's leading trade ministers signed
off the Uruguay Round. He sent his number three, Tim Sainsbury, who is
minister for industry, not trade. Indeed, Hezza's absence from the big trade
policy set-piece events is starting to look increasingly odd, especially
since he insists on calling himself the President of the Board of Trade.

Dino Baggio scored the first of Italy's two goals against Spain in the World

The result swept the G7's Naples summit off the Italian front pages
yesterday and even began to look like a deliberately orchestrated triumph to
deflect recent criticism of his government. Rete 4, the most pro-Berlusconi

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No sooner has one summit finished than another one opens. However, the irony
of this week's emergency European summit, called by Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
is that the organisers don't want it to take place.
It is a cunning piece of blackmail. The German chancellor is using it to
browbeat his fellow heads of government into agreeing on a common candidate
to be the next president of the European commission, after John Major vetoed
his last proposal. If they can agree in advance, no one will have to spoil
his weekend, or postpone their summer holidays, by having to sit down in
Brussels for yet another tiresome session of multilingual haggling, begging
the British to stop being beastly.
But even if there is a chance of an early deal, everyone still has to plan
for the summit. Because the Charlemagne building in Brussels, headquarters
of the Council of Ministers, no longer has enough space for the mammoth
closing press conference, the German government press office has had to hire
the theatre over the street. It is paying to have it wired up with
interpreters' cabins and microphones.
Henning Wegener, of the federal press office in Bonn, is not amused. 'It is
costing me DM130,000 from my own budget,' he said. 'And all for a meeting
nobody wants to have, and which might never take place.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Time for a defence review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, amid the familiar clamour about base closures and job losses, the
government will present what at first sight will look like welcome news. In
unveiling a new round of defence cuts it will claim, in effect, that
Britain's armed forces are to carry on doing exactly the same job at greatly
reduced cost to the taxpayer. If this strategy were sustainable, it would
indeed be welcome. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that it is not:
that in being asked to pursue a fixed set of tasks in ever more economical
ways, the forces are being stretched too thin. In the process, the
fundamental question - whether straitened circumstances dictate reordered
priorities - is left unanswered.
After this week's cuts, the forces will still be shouldering three 'defence
roles': to protect Britain and dependent territories; to insure against
threats to Britain or its allies; and to help maintain international peace
and stability. Although the government now discloses the number of forces
nominally assigned to each role, it has never explained in detail what it
understands by these tasks.
The government has its reasons for shying away from a full-blown defence
review. One is that it dare not further alienate constituents by adding the
insult of a confusing new defence philosophy to the injury of reduced
military spending. Another is the unpredictability of the subject. Nobody
can forecast how long, and on what scale, the US will be prepared to commit
money and men to the defence of Europe. Nobody can tell where Russia's new
assertiveness in Europe will lead; or which extremist regime will be the
next to acquire ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction.
Respond flexibly
Yet this very uncertainty should be a spur to think harder about how Britain
can, within the limits of its budget, enhance its capacity to respond
flexibly and rapidly to potential threats. The geopolitical challenges faced
by France and Germany are no less complex than those confronting Britain;
yet both those countries have published wide-ranging white papers on defence
this year.
Britain eschews such a theoretical approach, preferring to focus on
practical experience: its involvement in Bosnia, for example, which has
highlighted some basic vulnerabilities as well as strengths. Although the UK
contingent has played a crucial role in saving Bosnian lives and  - so far -
in preventing the conflict from spreading, its deployment has stretched
Britain's forces to the limit. In some new international crisis requiring
the despatch of another multinational peace-keeping force, it seems unlikely
that Britain would have the spare capacity to help.
Searching questions
That is one important reason why the government needs now to undertake a
fundamental review of defence policy. Such a review should be completed
before 1996, when the European Union is due to consider common security
policies as part of its next inter-governmental conference. And it should
ask searching questions about the potential threats facing Britain and the
resources available to deal with them.
How best can Britain contribute to multinational peace-keeping coalitions,
and what does this imply in particular for future levels of land and sea
forces? Is there scope for further cuts in the army's permanent strength in
Germany, without sacrificing the advantages derived from frequent training
and exercising with allies? Is the cost of defending Britain's remaining
dependent territories justified by any strategic advantage or overriding
moral commitment?
How useful is Britain's submarine-based nuclear deterrent, and how does this
compare with, say, the case for anti-missile defences? Perhaps above all,
with the US pressing Europe to develop greater self sufficiency in defence
and encouraging Germany to play a leading role, which aspects of the US-UK
relationship can be sustained indefinitely?
These are, of course, all issues of the utmost sensitivity in British
politics - and the picture is complicated further by Britain's need to
maintain a substantial presence in northern Ireland. But that is no excuse
for continuing to sweep debate under the rug. In the end, such a review
might make it easier, not harder, to muster political support for the
necessary changes in spending priorities.

This is a direct result of the flawed EU policy of encouraging the use of
unleaded petrol, with its higher aromatic content, in cars not equipped with
catalytic converters. As a consequence of removing lead from petrol, the
missing octane numbers are most commonly replaced by increasing the aromatic
content of the petrol, the highest average aromatic content being found in
the allegedly green super-unleaded.
It is to be hoped that Mr Klaus Topfer fully understands that it is not
merely the benzene content of the petrol which is important but the total
aromatic content as all aromatics can be converted to benzene in the engine
and are emitted to the atmosphere if there is no catalyst fitted.
It is unfortunate that in the political rush to remove lead from petrol we
have removed a perceived problem and replaced it by several far more
sinister threats to health and the environment.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Why vegetarians will inherit the earth: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within 50 years people who eat red meat or drink alcohol will be ostracised.
At social gatherings they will be able to indulge in these unhealthy - nay,
barbarous - habits only after seeking the express permission of their
disdainful companions. The vegetarian, teetotal majority will have enacted
stiff laws to regulate these dangerous substances and will be especially
vigilant in protecting the young. Studies will have shown that most
carnivores take up their bad habit in childhood, before they can appreciate
the force of arguments against meat.
You may dismiss this as a ridiculous fantasy. Yet who would have dreamt that
US public sentiment could shift so decisively against cigarettes? For much
of this century smoking was not merely socially acceptable: it was expected
of anybody with pretensions to sophistication. Movie stars and models
smoked. So did political leaders and financiers. It was de rigueur for
intellectuals: how many writers, artists or musicians would have refused a
cigarette in the 1950s?
Yet today smokers in the US are a furtive, pitied minority, often to be
found huddled near the entrances of buildings they dare not enter. Smoking
is a vice of green youngsters - and of apologetic old-timers who lack the
grit to kick the habit. It is already banned in military workplaces, in most
public places, in aircraft and in many restaurants. It will probably soon be
outlawed in all workplaces - except in designated rooms with independent
ventilation. States are now suing tobacco companies to recoup the vast - and
unnecessary - cost of treating smoking-related illnesses such as lung cancer
and heart disease.
The regulatory crackdown reflects changed public attitudes. People have
turned against cigarettes because they are more health conscious than in the
past and because they are more aware of the medical risks. The strength of
the global anti-smoking movement depends largely on living standards and
access to information. Not surprisingly, the US is in the vanguard, followed
by western Europe; only in the developing world and former communist
countries are cigarettes still seen as chic or desirable.
Opinion seems likely to turn against meat and alcohol for similar reasons.
The medical case against meat is damning. A recent study in the British
Medical Journal indicated that vegetarians were 40 per cent less likely than
meat eaters to die of cancer. This followed numerous previous studies
linking meat consumption with other chronic illnesses. Far more people die
of heart disease in the US and western Europe than in Asian countries, where
beans, grains and fish form the staple diet. The reason should be obvious to
any hamburger junkie: meat (especially beef) is saturated with harmful fat
and cholesterol.
Self-preservation is probably the strongest reason for abandoning meat; but
it is supported by ethical and environmental arguments that seem certain to
receive a more sympathetic hearing in coming decades.
As moral beings, how can we defend the unnecessary slaughter of millions of
animals, especially when eating their dead flesh can cause disease in us?
The basis of morality is compassion or the desire to prevent suffering.
Since it is hard to deny that cattle, pigs and lambs have a capacity to
suffer, we are necessarily acting unethically when we eat them. Moreover, if
the land now used for grazing were turned over to cereal, beans and
vegetables, we could feed millions of starving people in the third world, at
no net cost, while reducing damage to the environment.
Alcohol may have more staying power than meat, because humans throughout
history have sought an escape from reality. Many moderate drinkers will
argue that a glass of wine or beer is positively good for their health.
Perhaps. But a heavy price is paid for the social acceptability of this
dangerous drug. Because alcohol is addictive, many people are not able to
control their consumption. As they get older, they tend to drink more
heavily, despite their reduced ability to absorb the drug. A surprising
number of moderate drinkers thus end up as semi-alcoholics; the human cost
in wrecked careers, smashed marriages and premature death or disablement is
high.
The statistics are quite disturbing. In the US alcohol is one of the leading
causes of death, after heart disease and cancer (to which it contributes).
Cirrhosis of the liver alone claims more than 26,000 lives a year. Some 50
per cent of fatal car crashes are alcohol related. Drinking is known to
exacerbate many social problems - including violence on the streets and
wife-battering in the home. Conservative estimates indicate the purely
economic costs of alcohol abuse - in work days lost, premature deaths and
medical expenses - exceed Dollars 100bn a year in the US.
Lest there be any confusion, I do not support bans of any kind, except those
(such as restrictions on smoking in the workplace) that aim to protect
innocent parties. I am enough of a libertarian to believe that people should
be free to seek pleasure as they see fit, even at the risk of killing
themselves.
Nor am I in favour of hair-shirts or puritanical philosophies of life.
Public opinion has turned against cigarettes because people realise that, on
balance, they reduce rather than increase the sum of human happiness. This
is the spirit in which future generations will reject meat and alcohol. And,
in case readers are curious, it is the spirit in which I have turned my back
on these fleeting pleasures - at least for the time being.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Foreign cash for bricks and mortar: UK housing associations
are today trying to woo German bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's housing associations, which build low-cost homes largely for rent,
may have their roots in medieval alms-houses and the Victorian
philanthropists who provided homes for the working poor during the
industrial revolution. But in recent years, they have been quietly
transforming themselves into leading players in the UK housing market.
The largest now own tens of thousands of homes with assets worth hundreds of
millions of pounds. To fund their expanding programmes, they are seeking
ever-increasing amounts of finance and have become among the most active
issuers of sterling bonds.
Today, the search for new sources of finance moves overseas. The Housing
Corporation, the organisation that distributes government grants to
associations, is holding a seminar in Frankfurt to persuade German banks to
invest in UK social housing.
If the corporation is successful, housing associations could be the first UK
organisations to raise funds through the issue of Pfandbriefe, the uniquely
German bonds used by banks to finance mortgages and municipal loans.
The seminar is targeted at Germany's 26 mortgage banks, which account for 60
per cent of Pfandbriefe issued in Germany. These long-term, fixed-interest
bonds are secured on the property and also guaranteed by the issuing bank.
Loans are normally restricted to 60 per cent of the value of the property.
Germany's tough regulatory regime for the issuing of Pfandbriefe has ensured
there have been no defaults since 1900. The yields on what has proved to be
a secure form of investment are only a small margin over German Treasury
bonds and thus offer a low-cost source of finance.
The banks have been allowed under German law to issue Pfandbriefe in other
European currencies than the DM since 1991. Earlier this year, the German
Mortgage Banks Association launched a campaign to find opportunities to
issue sterling Pfandbriefe in the UK. Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of
the Housing Corporation, will suggest today that housing associations - of
which there is no equivalent in Germany  - offer just such an opportunity.
Housing associations could certainly prove attractive to the German banks,
says Mr Frank Kennedy of S G Warburg Securities, the securities house.
'Associations are closely regulated by the Housing Corporation and no lender
has lost money lending on a secured basis to a registered housing
association.'
The Housing Corporation believes that German mortgage banks could be a
useful source of funding for housing associations, which often find it hard
to raise the sort of long-term finance appropriate for residential property.
'There is a natural synergy between the terms associations are seeking and
those offered by Pfandbriefe,' says Mr Mayer.
Associations are already raising large amounts of private finance to
supplement government grants for building affordable homes for rent. Since
the 1988 Housing Act permitted private funding, more than Pounds 5.5bn has
been raised from banks, building societies and institutions.
The Corporation expects, however, that associations will need to raise even
larger amounts in the future, with the government reducing the amount of
grant from Pounds 2.4bn in 1992-93 to Pounds 1.5bn in 1994-95. It estimates
that an additional Pounds 7bn of private finance will be needed over the
next four years to fulfil their plans for building new homes and funding the
transfer of local authority homes to associations.
The increasing importance of private finance in social housing led to the
appointment of Sir Brian Pearse, former chief executive of Midland Bank, as
chairman of the Corporation earlier this year. His predecessor was Sir
Christopher Benson, a property developer. Bringing in a banker reflected the
need to open up the housing association movement to the financial markets.
Sir Brian is keen to widen the housing association's investor base, which is
currently dominated by the largest UK financial institutions.
'I hope to persuade investors to see housing associations as big business
occupying a significant sector of the economy,' he says.
'They employ 50,000 people and indirectly tens of thousands more in
construction. I am confident that they offer attractive lending
opportunities that are as safe as any other.'
To some extent a broadening of their investor base is already happening.
Since 1988, associations have raised finance from a lengthening list of
lenders, even if few yet account for substantial sums. The Corporation has
joined with the Chartered Institute of Banking, which offers training to
bankers, to run short courses on lending to housing associations to increase
familiarity with the sector.
Associations have also entered the sterling debenture market in a big way.
With more than Pounds 1bn of housing association paper issued, they now
account for about 10 per cent of the market.
Most of this has been raised through group, or 'club' issues that bring
several associations together to share costs. These also give some security
to the investors, who often find it hard to assess associations'
credit-worthiness.
But it is becoming clear that housing associations need to look elsewhere.
The markets began to choke on association paper towards the end of last
year. NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest bank, was left
with much of a Pounds 125m issue in November. Soon after, Hambros delayed a
planned issue for medium-sized housing associations and Peabody Trust, the
only housing association to have issued stock in its own name, postponed a
Pounds 50m issue.
'The markets became clogged,' says Mr Charles Arbuthnot of Hambros.
'Investors became worried that there'd be an endless flow of paper.'
Although Peabody and Hambros got their issues away earlier this year, it is
clear that the appetite for further housing association paper in the
debenture market is limited.
One alternative way of raising capital from investors would be to give them
an equity stake in social housing. Chaco Investments, a subsidiary of TR
Property Investment Trust, has already raised more than Pounds 20m for
housing associations by offering a stake in the freehold of their properties
with an indexed return linked to rental income.
'Institutions are very interested in the low risk and stable returns
available from housing associations,' says Mr Leon Clifton, managing
director of Chaco. 'The income stream and capital growth potential is
offering returns as good as anything else the institutions can go into at
the moment.'
One development that might help housing associations raise money is moves
towards giving them credit ratings. NatWest Markets has just launched a
triple-A rated issue, an insured Guaranteed Enhanced Secured Bond, to buy
out the stock left after its offering flopped in November.
'The success of the issue is very good news for housing associations,' says
Hambros' Mr Arbuthnot. 'It has brought down the margin over gilts by almost
a half, making it much cheaper for associations to raise capital. That is
more than enough to cover the cost of credit rating.'
If credit-rating catches on, financially strong associations would be able
to draw on a much wider investor base, in the UK and abroad.
Today, however, the attention of housing associations will be on Pfandbriefe
as a new way of attracting investors into social housing. The success of the
Frankfurt meeting may take some time to become clear, given that it would
represent a big step into unknown territory for the German banks. But with
the demand for housing association homes showing no sign of abating, tapping
into the global capital markets may be the only way that they can hope to
raise the funds they need.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Brazil's monetary move connected with
presidential campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID L BERNSTEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As mentioned in your article, 'Brazil expected to limit issue of new
currency' (June 28), the central bank's strict control of the 'real', that
country's new money which came into existence on July 1, 'is one of the key
mechanisms the government hopes will prevent inflation creeping into the new
currency'. But, perhaps more importantly, Brazil's new, tight monetary
policy must be seen, at least in part, as a political move intended to spark
the lifeless campaign of presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
This is not the first time Brazil's leaders have politicised economic
policy. In February 1986, President Jose Sarney introduced the Cruzado Plan
with a peremptory price freeze. Although inflation dropped from 22.4 per
cent to -0.9 per cent, after Sarney's party won 22 of 23 governorships in
November elections, the freeze was smartly lifted. Not surprisingly,
inflation sky-rocketed to 7.6 per cent in December.
In 1990, Brazil's newly-elected president, Fernando Collor de Mello, waited
until the day after his inauguration to present a Draconian
anti-inflationary plan that sent his country into a brutal recession.
Now, with leftist Workers Party's presidential candidate, Luis Inacio Lula
da Silva, threatening to dislodge the ruling Brazilian Social Democratic
Party, the current president, Itamar Franco, discovered compelling reasons
to declare the real would be pegged to the dollar at 1:1. By fixing the
exchange rate, inflation should fall because the government is essentially
making a commitment not to print additional reals to pay its bills.
But Franco already has rescinded his pledge to allow for the free
convertability of the real. If he had decided otherwise, Brazilians might
have rushed to buy dollars in fear of a potentially victorious Lula halting
payments on domestic debt. The result would be an exchange crisis far worse
than that at the end of the Cruzado plan, with Cardoso's defeat being a
foregone conclusion.
The problem with Franco's new currency strategy is not so much its contents
as its timing. By introducing the plan three months prior to the ballot,
Franco is betting that lower inflation will help defeat Lula at the polls in
October. If Franco is wrong, however, and he has to increase public spending
to pay off the special interests which traditionally have dominated
Brazilian electoral politics, inevitably inflation will re-emerge. Renewed
inflation would not only kill Cardoso's presidential aspirations, but also
demonstrate once again to the world financial community that Brazil's
economy is more often than not merely a political tool for its rulers to
manipulate.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Credit plan will push pay down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS POND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman highlights the increasing trend towards the use of Family
Credit to top up the incomes of those willing to accept low-paid employment
('Search for a way to stay afloat', July 8). The Treasury is considering
spending Pounds 1bn to extend the benefit, currently payable only to
families with children, to single people and childless couples.
In fact the cost would tend to be rather more than this over time. Employers
who found that the link between pay levels and the net incomes of many of
their staff had been broken would have every incentive to reduce pay still
further, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill. Many companies already
see Family Credit as an explicit government subsidy: if a profit margin can
be guaranteed because staff are working for state-subsidised wages, what
incentive is there to take risks or invest in training or better techniques
of production? The overall efficiency and competitiveness of the economy is
likely to suffer.
Family Credit may be a lifeline for many families trying to make ends meet
on a low wage, but it increases their benefit dependency, placing them
firmly in the sort of poverty trap which Chris Tighe describes in the
accompanying article ('Life at the sharp end'). As wages rise (or taxes are
reduced) benefit entitlement declines, leaving wage-earners little better
off, and with little incentive to earn more through their own efforts.
In his speech to Tuesday's Trades Union Congress conference, Confederation
of British Industry director-general, Howard Davies, warned that 'the rapid
growth in earnings dispersion is emerging as a more serious social and
economic problem than is yet appreciated by most politicians'. The
encouragement of low-paid employment through an extension of Family Credit
will serve only to increase that problem. Why a policy of state subsidies to
companies, which increases benefit dependency and the burden on the taxpayer
while depriving large sections of the workforce of economic incentives
should appeal to a government committed to free-market economics remains a
puzzle.

In tribute to the late Dennis Potter BBC1 begins a repeat of The Singing
Detective, one of two original television serials I have seen in 25 years as
a critic which I feel sure posterity will regard as masterpieces (the other
is 'Heimat'). The hero, a writer of cheap detective stories, played by
Michael Gambon, lies in a hospital bed experiencing life at three levels of
consciousness: in the present, surrounded by patients and medical staff; as
the detective in one of his own 1940s novels; and as a child growing up in
the Forest of Dean. Potter used his famous technique of having his
characters mime to popular songs in 'Pennies From Heaven' and 'Lipstick On
Your Collar', but it was in 'The Singing Detective' that he got it right.
His work here can be compared to a Proust novel or a Bunuel movie but, like
all great works of art, it is in the end unique. Not to be missed (10.10).
ITV begins a fresh batch of Frank Stubbs with Timothy Spall in the title
role. Stubbs, a sort of 1990s spiv, is entertaining, but it seems unlikely
that ITV's fervent hope of creating another 'Minder' will be fulfilled
(9.00).

FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts: Fanfare for tradition - As the 100th season of Henry
Wood Promenade Concerts gets underway, Antony Thorncroft talks to departing
director John Drummond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 8 o'clock this Friday evening conductor Andrew Davis will raise his
baton, the BBC Symphony Orchestra will take a deep breath and the richly
romantic music of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder will fill the Royal Albert Hall.
The 100th season of Henry Wood Promenade Concerts will have been
successfully launched and all concerned can relax into the familiarity of a
Great British Institution.
The Prom season, like Wimbledon, is a national tradition that seems to work.
Some composers complain that there is not enough contemporary music, meaning
their own; fans of music on authentic instruments have their gripes
('tonight's concert can be heard on Radio 3,' shouted waggish Promenaders
last year when a Bach harpsichord concerto blatantly failed to carry); there
are the odd criticisms about the venue, about the timing of certain
concerts, about the absence of great international soloists.
But the Proms' status as the biggest music festival in the world, and
perhaps the most successful, is secure. Even the BBC, with its current
nit-picking self-appraisal, seems to have accepted the inevitable and left
the Proms alone. There was talk of the Proms raising Pounds 2m from a
sponsor to prevent a 10 per cent cut in the funding of the BBC orchestras
but the search was fitful and when John Birt took over as director-general
he abandoned the process.
The Proms confer prestige; they offer wonderful entertainment opportunities
for BBC apparatchiks; they allow the BBC, through its commissions for new
music, to pose as a modern Medici; they are impressively popular, with
audiences of 84 per cent of capacity last year; and they provide hundreds of
hours of cheap, quality broadcasting.
The director, John Drummond, is very much the showman who loves the sound of
the turnstiles. 'Everything I buy in I pay for through the box office or
from advertising. In eight seasons I've always been in the black. About
Pounds 2.5m covers all the foreign orchestras and guest artists'. By taking
advantage of the sponsored overseas tours by foreign orchestras he reckons
he gets them at bargain prices: 11 are appearing this year, ranging from the
Berlin Philharmonic to the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
'I am not in the market for paying fortunes to tenors, large ladies, or even
conductors. Last year a major singer asked for a grotesque fee. We
negotiated it down but she wanted an affidavit signed in front of a Justice
of the Peace that we had never paid anyone more. It was ridiculous. We
recruited instead a young English singer at a tenth of the cost and helped
along her career'.
But at almost half the 68 concerts this Prom season, the musicians
performing are on the payroll of the BBC and here the costings become
trickier. Even so, according to Drummond, 'the Proms are half the cost of
Middlemarch'. Nicholas Kenyon, who succeeded Drummond as controller of Radio
3 and who, in 1996, also takes over as director of the Proms, says the
actual size of the BBC subsidy is around Pounds 2m a year. 'We've quantified
what we get from the Proms and are happy with it', says Kenyon.
John Drummond, a big man in every sense of the word, has protected his
fiefdom well. Not one for committee meetings, he has been around the musical
world, and the BBC, for decades. He seems to have been allowed a long leash
as he approaches retirement after the 1995 season, enjoying what has been
described as 'wilful isolation' inside the BBC. It says much for the
reputation of the Proms that even the slide-rule toting Birtian BBC can
still embrace, however temporarily, this maverick talent.
Drummond, though perceived as a traditionalist, has added much to the
institution - Sunday Proms late night Proms, early evening Proms, Proms in
churches, ethnic Proms, jazz Proms, even one ill fated attempt at a Show
Tune Prom with Maria Ewing. Experience has taught him that the audience for
opera is not a Prom audience - the first London production in decades of
Ethel Smyth's The Wreckers at the July 31 Prom is not selling well; that the
audience for contemporary music is totally committed but small, no more than
2,000 strong, which means that the Albert Hall would be less than half full;
that Sunday concerts are difficult to shift - Promenaders want one night
off.
Drummond has resisted the embrace of cross-over music, so favoured on the
rival South Bank, and he regularly declines evenings of film music and
flamenco. His attempts to bring over jazz legends like Oscar Peterson and
Ella Fitzgerald failed because of the demands of jazz promoters. 'They want
all the box office and I'd never give that to anyone'. He is happy to have
dropped Gilbert &amp; Sullivan from the programme; he regrets the apparent
British indifference to Haydn. He rates his greatest achievements as the
opening up of the Proms to foreign orchestras and the introduction of Sunday
concerts, even if they have to be carefully programmed to persuade the
weekday audiences to turn up once again.
Sir Henry Wood gave his first Prom in 1895, so this year marks the 100th
season and next year the centenary. Drummond is seizing on the chance to
make his own last two seasons celebratory events: nostalgic and
backward-looking this season and adventurous and forward-looking in 1995.
The fact that the raft of BBC commissions of new music in 1995, from Berio,
Birtwistle, Reich, Williamson, Weir and many more leading composers, might
lead to the Proms missing their 75 per cent break-even target and Kenyon
facing a nasty deficit, is a small price to pay for such patronage.
Certainly 1994 has struck a chord with Promenaders, especially the fanatical
550 who buy a season ticket to stand in the arena, at a bargain price of
Pounds 120, for 68 performances. Concerts like next Saturday's, a repeat of
a 1900 Prom with 18 works including Boer War ballads, and concerts in
tribute to Sir Henry Wood, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Sir William Glock and other
great Prom personalities, have helped push advance bookings 5 per cent
higher than a year ago.
Traditions like a Wagner night, a Viennese night, and the performance of all
the Beethoven symphonies, have been revived and revered performers, like
violinist Ida Haendel, who made her Prom debut in 1937, are playing again.
Music that was first heard at Proms, like Schoenberg's 'Five Orchestral
Pieces' and Vaughan William's Fifth Symphony, will be among 68 past
premieres lovingly respected.
There is one Proms institution that John Drummond has left alone - the Last
Night. His predecessor, Robert Ponsonby, tried to douse the high spirits by
programming more serious music. Drummond has gone along with the exuberant
promenaders. 'Three quarters of an hour of people being a bit silly after 68
concerts is OK by me.' He has even protected the Last Night from more
populist attack. 'I know that Shirley Bassey has always wanted to sing
there, but she won't in my time'.
In Kenyon's time, perhaps, she might. Though Drummond's successor-in-waiting
espouses 'continuity, not revolution,' change will be inevitable. There may
well be more mini festivals, more themes, weaving through seasons. Kenyon,
as a channel controller with budgets to meet, may at least look again at the
idea of attracting outside, commercial, money to the Proms. Last week's
government white paper giving the BBC a fairly clean bill of health has
removed much of the pressure for change, but commercial sponsorship remains
on the agenda.
Last week, too, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the major workhorse at the Proms
with 15 concerts this year, announced its first ever sponsorship deal, a
Pounds 300,000, three year, cash infusion from Land Rover. Kenyon might see
opportunities in reducing the hold of orchestral music over the Proms. He
might also think that rock, the great art form of the 20th century, could be
comfortably embraced as the 21st century approaches. But he still has two
years in which to plan.
Meanwhile, Drummond is focussing on the job in hand and is
uncharacteristically unclear about life after the Proms. He has done the big
jobs - running the Edinburgh Festival as well as Radio 3, but missed out on
others - like the Royal Opera House. At 60 he seems happy to take things
easy, perhaps undertaking a few consultancies. But for the next seven weeks
he knows exactly where he will be - in his box at the Royal Albert Hall. He
never misses a Prom.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts: Nightingale and the Rose - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Posthumously, Oscar Wilde has furnished the stories for any number of operas
besides Salome. Elena Firsova's new one-act piece, which opened the Almeida
Opera season on Friday, is at least the fourth treatment of The Nightingale
and the Rose. You could read Wilde's story aloud several times in the 75
minutes Firsova takes to tell it; but her intricate chamber-score is so
delicately, rapturously, expiringly romantic that we hearkened to it all
without complaint.
There are far too few events in the tale to make a stage action - and the
crucial one is scarcely stageable. Lovelorn Student needs red rose to win
Girl, but there are only white and yellow ones in his garden; in honour of
love, a Nightingale presses its breast against a rose-stem and sings its
heart out until it dies, pierced by a thorn, and the rose turns red; Student
is chucked by Girl anyway, and decides to take up metaphysics.
Instead of inventing extra episodes, Firsova has chosen to set the parable
as a chain of 'lyric scenes', in intimate, poignant focus. A grave little
chorus of Roses (some doubling as other flora and fauna) comments and
assists; the Nightingale - high soprano, of course - borrows three sonnets
from Christina Rossetti for her achingly protracted swan-song. Firsova's
chamber-ensemble of single strings and winds tingles with highly wrought
feeling, celesta and marimbas, deep-shuddering drums and gongs. There is
passionate discourse from an unorthodox string quartet, with a strong and
perfectly apt whiff of Szymanowski. (Excellent Almeida Ensemble conducted by
David Parry.)
Singers impersonating plants tend to look silly, too much like
primary-schoolers in a pageant; the director Caroline Gawn and her designer
Julian McGowan take the curse off them by letting them be slightly comic.
Gawn has found no convincing solution to the problem of representing the
thorny avian Liebestod with an ample soprano and her green-faced cohorts,
but I doubt there is one. Instead, with Carol Smith's exquisite singing as
the Nightingale - clear, sweet, elegant, every phrase completely felt - the
problem simply melts away.
Rachael Hallawell's upmarket Essex Girl is a delectable cartoon. As for the
Student, Philip Sheffield creates the ultimate gangly, preening swot,
starry-eyed and scatterbrained: a great bonus to the production, and as
sensitively sung as he is funny ('farfelu', the French would say). This
young tenor is full of curious promise.
Further performances tonight and July 16, 18 &amp; 20.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Dutch treat for big spenders - Schiphol
removes upper limit on tax-free sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you cannot resist that wide-screen multi-function television set in a
European airport tax-free shop, your biggest problem now is how to fit it
into the overhead locker. The old question of how to look innocent
sauntering through the blue channel often no longer applies, thanks to
increasing competition.
Schiphol airport in Amsterdam has just removed the upper limit on tax-free
sales for passengers flying to other European Union destinations. Schiphol
retailers will now pay the value added tax on sales above Ecu90, the current
limit on tax-free purchases for intra-EU journeys.
Until July 1, Schiphol insisted that its tax-free retailers limited intra-EU
passengers' purchases to Fl 250 - the Dutch equivalent of Ecu90 - per trip.
That limit has now been abandoned, in part because of competition from other
airports.
The Dutch initiative matches a similar offer by BAA, the UK airport
operator. BAA has paid the tax on purchases above the limit without much
fanfare since the single market came into force, but it is now seeking a
higher profile for its offer.
Before deploying credit cards too freely, travellers should remember:
The change applies only to tax-free purchases - duty-free tobacco, alcohol
and perfume allowances are unchanged.
Your tax is paid only if you are flying within the EU. If your destination
is elsewhere, you remain liable for any taxes that apply. For regularly
carried items, like laptop computers, it is worth retaining receipts to
prove their provenance.
Since some high-ticket sales are now being subsidised, it behoves the
traveller to re-examine the assumption that 'tax-free' prices are
necessarily bargains.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Airline perks in peril - A US agency plans
to save clients money by cutting out extras such as frequent-flyer schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few weeks ago this page asked whether employees travelling on company
money should be allowed to keep frequent-flyer points for themselves. Most
who responded thought they should. But the question will no longer arise if
Mr Kevin Mitchell, founder of a new US company called Business Travel
Contractors, has his way.
Mr Mitchell is the business traveller's nemesis. He believes that companies
are being ripped off by frequent-flyer schemes and other incentives offered
by airlines. So he has come up with a scheme that would slash the cost of
corporate air travel (and, incidentally, make money for Mr Mitchell) by
wiping out the perks.
It is no secret that the frequent-flyer system, where a passenger receives
points, or miles, towards free tickets for future flights, is open to abuse.
Some employees may make unnecessary business journeys to accumulate miles
for their personal use; others may choose unnecessarily long and expensive
routes; still more may travel with certain airlines to earn miles in their
frequent-flyer programmes when other airlines would have charged much less
for the same journey.
Frequent-flyer schemes, however, are not the source of concern to employers.
In the US, as elsewhere, most big companies use travel agents to handle
their air travel re-quirements. The travel agents make their money from the
standard 10 per cent commission they get on each ticket sold.
But airlines also offer loyalty bonuses, known as overrides, to travel
agents which sell enough of their tickets, plus allowances known as soft
dollars that can be exchanged for free tickets, free upgrades and other
perks. It is small wonder that companies sometimes question whether the
advice they are getting is as unbiased as they would like it to be.
Mr Mitchell says many companies believe the whole system is rotten, wasteful
and inefficient. The solution, he says, is to scrap it. He wants airlines to
introduce special fares for their corporate customers that would carry no
commissions, no overrides, no frequent-flyer points, and no other bonuses of
any kind.
Stripped bare of all the associated costs, these so-called business contract
fares would be much cheaper than today's. They would also be simpler to
understand because they would be strictly mileage-based.
In this new, perk-free era, companies would still use travel agents to make
their travel arrangements. But the agents would no longer get commissions
from the airlines: instead, they would be paid for their services by their
corporate customers.
Mr Mitchell's Business Tra-vel Contractors, which is based in King of
Prussia, Pennsylvania, would make its money by representing companies in
their fare negotiations with the airlines.
It is tempting to dismiss Mr Mitchell as an idealist. But as the former
vice-president of conference and travel management for Cigna, one of the
biggest US insurance groups, he knows what he is talking about.
Significantly, he has already signed up 17 US companies to fund the
development of his scheme, including Cigna, Bell Atlantic, Black &amp; Decker,
Chrysler, Colgate-Palmolive, General Motors, Gillette, Merck, Whirlpool and
Xerox.
Will the idea fly? Mr Mitchell says it will cut total corporate travel costs
by a minimum of 20 per cent, so companies seem likely to support it. US
travel agents are also interested, because a fee-based system could offer
them a more secure flow of income than commissions, which are vulnerable to
the downward pressure on air fares.
The biggest resistance seems likely to come from the airlines, which like to
think that incentives are a cost-effective way of putting bodies in seats.
Earlier this year, International Business Machines, the computer company,
failed in an attempt to persuade two US airlines to eliminate frequent-flyer
points for IBM employees in return for lower fares.
But Mr Mitchell claims the airlines are secretly desperate to get off the
treadmill of an ever-rising volume of overrides and frequent-flyer awards.
As soon as he has 40 companies behind him, he plans to test that theory by
making the airlines an offer they can - but possibly won't - refuse.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Swiss departure tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some travellers to Switzerland will be less hard hit by the government's new
dparture tax on flights from UK airports than they might have feared, writes
David Owen.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, has announced that flights to Basle
and Geneva will be subject only to the lower Pounds 5 duty rate when the tax
is introduced in October, and not the Pounds 10 rate applicable to non-UK or
European Union destinations.
The change is not due to a rare bout of Treasury generosity, but to the
difficulty of enforcing the higher rate.
As Sir John explains, the two airports are in 'the unusual position' of
straddling Switzerland and France - an EU member-state - allowing passengers
to choose into which country to exit the airport.
'It would therefore be impossible to charge the higher Pounds 10 duty rate,
as there is no distinction on a passenger's ticket to indicate whether he
intends to enter Switzerland or France,' Sir John reasons.

The French domestic airline Air Inter will cancel one third of its flights
tomorrow because of a one-day strike.
The airline has asked passengers to transfer bookings to today or Wednesday
when it has laid on extra capacity.
Air Inter unions called the strike, the fourth in recent months, to demand
autonomy from the loss-making carrier Air France and access to international
routes in compensation for opening the airline to foreign competition.
The European Commission ordered some of Air Inter's most lucrative domestic
routes to be opened to foreign airlines within six months.
Earlier strikes by Air Inter unions took place on May 17, June 2 and June 7.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Just how hot is Diller's sizzle? - A look at
the man behind a Dollars 7bn proposal to merge QVC and CBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of America's biggest takeover bids in the past six months have been
multi-million dollar bets on the talents of a single individual: top
Hollywood executive Barry Diller. Can he really be so very special?
The question may be raised this week at a board meeting of CBS, the US
television broadcasting network, which will vote on the recently proposed
Dollars 7bn merger between CBS and QVC, a much much smaller television home
shopping network headed by Diller. CBS would buy QVC, but Diller would
become chief executive of the combined group.
CBS shares rose strongly on the merger announcement, partly because of hopes
this might flush out a hostile bid for the company, but also in the
expectation that Diller will inject fresh vitality into the network's
programming.
What Hollywood calls the 'Diller sizzle' also enabled him to raise Dollars
10bn from investors and banks at the start of this year to support an
unsuccessful bid for Paramount Communications, the film and book publishing
company, which was ultimately acquired by media group Viacom.
This faith is based on the 52-year-old Diller's impressive track record over
the past two and half decades at master-minding commercially successful
films and television shows. Yet there is a danger of over-inflating his
reputation and creating a 'cult of Diller,' based on the proposition that
everything he touches inevitably turns to gold.
Being a successful Hollywood executive requires a rare combination of
talents: a hard head for business, a gut instinct for popular taste, and an
ability to nurture yet control creative individuals who may be wildly
unconventional, profoundly egotistical and more than a trifle paranoid.
'Barry,' says one leading Hollywood figure, 'has been able to follow that
fine line between being a responsible financial executive and allowing
talent enough room to go out and create something very special.'
The same can be said of a tiny handful of other Hollywood executives, but
Diller has achieved his track record in a much greater diversity of film and
television contexts than any of his peers - and in ways which show a
gambler's delight in proving conventional wisdom wrong.
The son of a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate developer, he dropped out of
university and joined the film industry by way of the mailroom of the
William Morris talent agency. He rose rapidly through the ranks of the ABC
television network in the early 1970s, pioneering ideas such as the 'Movie
of the Week' and the television mini-series.
In 1974, aged only 32, he was appointed chairman of Paramount Pictures, one
of the big seven Hollywood film studios. For the next 10 years he presided
over what was widely regarded as a golden age, with hit films which included
Saturday Night Fever and Raiders of the Lost Ark.
He quit Paramount in 1984 after clashing with Martin Davis, the new head of
its parent company, and joined the Fox studio shortly before Rupert Murdoch
added it to his News Corporation media empire.
Together Murdoch and Diller set out to do what most people in the industry
regarded as an impossible folly: turn Fox into a fourth national
broadcasting network, alongside ABC, CBS and NBC.
After a hesitant start they pulled it off, but in early 1992 Diller
resigned, saying he 'yearned' to be an entrepreneur like Murdoch, and wanted
to run a business of his own.
There then followed a 10-month Odyssey in which Diller cross-crossed
America, analysing the future of the converging entertainment, computer and
telecommunications industries.
It was a period in which he acquired the mystique of an entertainment
'visionary' - though his public pronouncements suggest he has little clearer
idea than anyone else where the brave new world of 'multimedia'
entertainment is leading.
The sojourn ended in a manner which shocked the Hollywood glitterati. Diller
announced in December 1992 that he would become chief executive of QVC, a
cable television shopping channel, the merchandise of which included tawdry
costume jewellery and tacky knick-nacks.
He let it be known that he saw QVC as the cutting commercial edge of a
technological revolution which would transform American television:
inter-activity, allowing viewers to summon up a cornucopia of goods and
entertainment at the touch of a remote control button. QVC, moreover, was to
be just the first step in the creation of a broad-based Diller entertainment
empire.
CBS could turn out to be the second step. Former colleagues say he would
bring to the network an extraordinary intensity of of energy and an ability
to spot creative talent, use it in a context that may not be immediately
obvious, and give it free rein.
But while his management style is generally hands-off, he also has a
tendency to swoop down on a business and ask the right questions.
He also has a reputation for impatience, intimidation and for not suffering
fools gladly. Colleagues suggest this is due in part to his tendency to play
devil's advocate, opposing ideas put up by his staff to test how well they
have been thought out.
'He likes people who are so sure of their ideas they will lay down under a
train to get them done,' says one long-time associate. 'If you're not ready
for someone to challenge your ideas, then don't work for Barry Diller.'
Diller has a great deal to prove on the much larger stage he now wants to
command. At QVC, for example, he has done much to enlarge and improve the
quality of its programming. But the group's sales growth and gross profit
margin dipped in the first quarter of this year.
Diller has yet to show that the up-market American consumer is ready for
electronic shopping, and he faces increasing competition from established
entertainment and retailing giants, who are preparing to gamble on the
sector.
Nor has he been very explicit about his plans for CBS and how a broadcasting
network fits into his vision of interactivity. Indeed, he appears to have
changed his views on broadcast television over the past year: in an
interview given not long after he joined QVC, Diller was quoted as rejecting
the idea of owning a TV network: 'It would be fun, but even as I say it, I
bore myself.'
This very private man also has to prove he has the temperament to run a
large, publicly-quoted company, and be a successful entrepreneur like his
mentor Murdoch.
First, however, he has to capture a big enough vehicle for his talents, and
he badly needs the CBS deal to go ahead: to lose one multi-billion dollar
bid may be regarded as misfortune. To lose another merger partner might
seriously dent the cult of Diller.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Investors move into Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An enduring memory for many first-time visitors to Vietnam is the sight of
apparently destitute street vendors and barrow boys squatting on the
pavement, reading books, magazines and serious newspapers.
Vietnam is poor, but nearly 90 per cent of its 70m inhabitants are literate.
The economy, furthermore, has started to expand rapidly since the communist
government embarked on a series of economic and financial reforms in the
late 1980s.
This combination of literacy and economic growth has encouraged a growing
number of foreign companies to seek investments in the potentially lucrative
Vietnamese print media.
At the end of May, Australian Consolidated Press, in which businessman Kerry
Packer and his family have a large holding, bought 46 per cent of the
company that manages and edits the Vietnam Investment Review, a periodical
published in English and Vietnamese editions; ACP did not disclose the
price, but the stake is believed to have cost more than Dollars 2m.
In June, Sondhi Limthongkul, the Thai publisher whose Manager group owns
newspapers in Thailand and the Hong Kong-based magazine Asia Inc, signed an
agreement to upgrade the state-owned English-language daily Vietnam News.
But for the time being the biggest foreign player in the Vietnamese media is
Ringier, the Swiss publishing group which was able to build on its
experience of launching business publications in post-communist eastern
Europe.
Ringier runs four titles in Vietnam, including the weekly Vietnam Economic
Times with a circulation of 37,000 and New Fashion, which sells 35,000; both
are in Vietnamese. The company also launched a monthly English-language
version of the Vietnam Economic Times earlier this year.
'The lesson we learned is that if you go very early into an emerging market
and build up a position very rapidly, then you're well set for the future,'
says Alain Jeannet, Ringier's project manager for Asia. The company has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Vietnam in the past 18 months, but
expects its two main publications to pass break-even point later this year.
The foreign partners in Vietnamese newspapers and magazines all speak of
their plans to upgrade the publications they manage. They can certainly
increase advertising revenue and improve production, distribution and
presentation, but their influence over editorial content is severely
restricted - especially when it comes to politically sensitive news.
Only state-approved organisations can own press titles in Vietnam, and
foreigners merely sign 'co-operation contracts' giving them a right to a
share of the profits.
The Vietnam Investment Review, for example, is managed by Australians but
published by the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment, while the
Vietnam Economic Times titles run by Ringier come under the auspices of the
Association of Vietnamese Economists.
Control of news by the government is unlikely to be relaxed soon, and
companies like Ringier are concentrating on areas such as business
information and fashion where they believe they can make money without
getting into trouble. New Fashion's circulation could be boosted to 100,000,
says Jeannet.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Architecture: Central Chelsea oasis - A look at a brave new
house from Anthony Collett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the rarest things to find in Britain at the moment is a newly-built,
architect-designed house. It is one of the tragedies of architectural life
in the UK that so few people build themselves a new house.
There are various reasons for this. The difficulty of finding a site,
especially in or around a major city; the endless and irksome planning
regulations that are enough to deter a potential builder; and the
inclination to buy the implied social status that comes with an old house
when new money is made.
The lure of the old is a very real problem in the UK. When you make money in
the US, Germany or Japan, the natural thing to do to build a new house. This
is wonderful for architects and very good for the progress of architecture.
Houses are the natural place for architectural expression and for that
fusion of ideas between client and architect.
In London recently I was excited to be shown an exceptional new house in an
unexpected place - a very central site in Chelsea.
Architects Anthony Collett and Associates, working closely with the
developers Toyoko Metropolitan Company, took on the conversion of Chelsea
Old Rectory into a luxurious London house and as part of the development was
able to build a new house on a long, thin site between the rectory garden
and the Kings Road.
Initially it must have seemed a very unpromising site - between the backs of
the shops and the rectory garden. Any estate agent would probably have
recommended that a routine development of mews houses was the best option.
Luckily Collett came along, an architect with imaginative and practical
ideas. He saw the potential for one remarkable house.
He and his development partners succeeded in breaking the mould by not
following estate agents advice and took a speculative risk by designing a
significant single house to a very high and original architectural standard.
It is unusual in that the major part of the house extends right to the
external boundaries of the whole long, narrow site. This not only produced
the largest floor area possible for the house, it also gave the architect
the opportunity to include in the plan three internal courtyards.
This gives the house the atmosphere of a Roman atrium house but the
architectural style does not ape classicism - it is its own clear, modern
and yet characterful idiom. From the street you see very little, two gates
in the wall - one leading through the garden to the front door, and the
other to the garage.
The first surprise is the formality of the white entrance facade with its
small dome and very tall copper clad door. Once you are inside the reason
for the dome becomes clear. It provides dramatic top light for the circular
entrance hall and certainly imparts a sense of scale and dignity to the
building's entrance.
It is light that is the key to the success of this house. It is brought in
through the courtyards and the skilful use of top light in the corridor and
double height volume of the drawing room.
Both the dining room and the drawing room look on to the first and largest
courtyard garden - which in summer is really a third reception room as it is
completely private and enclosed. These major entertaining rooms have a cool
elegance about them with their understated detailing and variety of scale.
The house would suit a collector of modern art as it would respond well to
large-scale paintings and sculpture.
At the heart of the house is a small study and library, where Anthony
Collett shows the advantages of being an architect who is also an
experienced interior and furniture designer. The library is panelled in
timber and has a simple modern, green marble fireplace - everything is
simply detailed, while retaining a sense of tradition in the use of good
materials.
This sense of solid materials and clear design continues around the second
courtyard area, which is the garden for the indoor swimming pool. The pool,
although indoors, opens into the courtyard and is lit by a large glass
skylight, which encourages a sense of being almost outdoors as you can swim
and look up at the sky. The floor of the 8 1/2 metre long pool is tiled in a
chequer-board pattern, with granite steps leading down into the water.
The third element of the house has a very different character to the lean
and elegant entertaining rooms. It is a two-storey pavilion built around
another garden and linked by an interesting staircase to the rest of the
house. This is the private realm - guest bedrooms and, on the first floor, a
complete family suite that feels entirely self contained. This has the best
views over the newly-planned rectory garden, which is one of the largest
private gardens in London.
While this is clearly a luxurious house, that needs its separate zones for
services and staff, it has many architectural lessons for urban living. It
demonstrates the virtue of the courtyard plan for allowing both privacy and
outdoor space on a confined site. Stylistically Collett and Associates shows
it is possible to provide a sense of elegance and great material comfort by
using modern design and excellent materials.
Collett's catholic approach to design allows the drama of the domed entrance
hall and the coolness of the simple high reception rooms. The use of this
oddly shaped pocket of urban land also demonstrates that it is possible to
develop imaginatively in the inner city - in a way that allows for civilised
private life in an elegant setting and architectural achievement of a high
degree.

FT  11 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Cleghorn's sugared path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has been
through a turbulent period over the past three years, writes Bernard Simon.
More upheavals are probably in store following the appointment of John
Cleghorn as the bank's chairman and ceo.
Cleghorn, aged 52, is more brusque but also more down-to-earth than his
urbane predecessor Allan Taylor, who is retiring after 45 years with the
bank. While Taylor is known throughout the bank as Mr Taylor, Cleghorn - who
frequently travels economy class - is simply John.
Cleghorn, an accountant who started working life as a sugar trader in his
native Montreal, has been with the bank for 20 years. His path to the top
became clear eight years ago when he was named president. RBC, with assets
of CDollars 168bn and 47,000 employees, was hit hard by the recession. In
particular, it took a heavy knock from sour loans to the troubled
real-estate and forest-products industries.
More recently, however, falling interest rates, a halting economic recovery
and a strong contribution from the securities business have brought a
turnround. The bank produced a 17 per cent return on equity in the first six
months of its current fiscal year.
Cleghorn spearheaded the acquisition last year of Royal Trust, a failing
trust and loan company. Although the bank swallowed a CDollars 300m charge
to cover the cost of integrating Royal Trust, Cleghorn won praise for
bringing the two institutions together in a relatively trouble-free way.
After he takes over as ceo on November 1, Cleghorn is expected to flatten
the bank's hierarchy and bring more young executives into the top ranks.
Among the issues confronting them will be RBC's failure to carry out its
goal of making a sizeable US acquisition. The bank has so far maintained
that nothing has been available south of the border at a reasonable price.

FT  11 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Graeme Hart's corporate shopping
list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graeme Hart will learn tomorrow if his audacious bid to become one of the
most powerful retailers in Australia and New Zealand is still on track,
writes Terry Hall.
Three weeks ago he launched a Dollars NZ620m bid to buy Foodland, a troubled
West Australian retailer. If the Australian Trade Practices Commission
agrees, Hart will sell its Australian food stores to Coles Myers, and keep
its substantial New Zealand operations - making him the dominant figure in
New Zealand retailing.
He is already a leading player in Australian bookselling, and has
substantial printing and stationery business in both countries.
Hart has achieved all this - plus a personal fortune of around Dollars
NZ600m - in just six years. During one of New Zealand's worse recessions he
has won control of every known target he has gone after, marking him out as
a worthy successor to Sir Ron Brierley, New Zealand's best-known corporate
predator.
Hart left school at 15 and started driving a tow-truck. A year later he
bought his own trucking business, and tried his hand at a variety of
businesses before deciding - at the age of 31 - to study for his MBA at
Otago University.
His big break came in 1988, when he beat Brierley Investments to buy the
Government Printing Office for Dollars NZ23m. Some estimates of the GPO's
more likely value were as high as Dollars 125m.
Since then Hart has not looked back. He manages his growing portfolio of
companies with a tiny head office staff of seven, including a secretary and
a receptionist. His former partner Colin Dewe says Hart customarily works 21
hours a day and his main recreation seems to be the 'three hours left for
sleep'.
For years Hart has said he would retire at 40. But with little over a year
to go, Hart's friends believe that this is one bid in which he is bound to
fail.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Monday Interview: The cup that runneth over - Why Alan
Rothenberg, Mr Soccer USA, is poised to benefit from the match between the
sport and his expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American lawyers are something else. Outside the court and boardrooms, they
populate governments past and present (two Clintons, Christopher, Bentsen,
and Baker for starters), the Congress (well over half the Senate have law
degrees), Wall Street, opera houses and charities. Some own sports
franchises. One of them is close to owning a whole sport.
That man, Alan Rothenberg, must be happy these days. But as the World Cup
approaches its climax, he might also own up to moments of nervousness, as he
and all those with a vested interest in the future of soccer in America
contemplate the next step.
The happiness of the youthful 55-year-old Los Angeles super-lawyer and past
president of the California Bar Association is easy to understand. Soccer's
quadrennial global tournament is well on the way to be a sporting and
commercial success, not a prospect necessarily held out for its first
staging in the US when Rothenberg assumed control of the operation in 1990.
He is, as the mega-TV screens in many stadiums display before and after each
match, chairman, president and chief executive officer of World Cup USA 1994
Inc.
He is simultaneously - and not uncontroversially - president of the United
States Soccer Federation, the governing body of the sport in the US, and
head of the management team behind Major League Soccer. To call him Mr
Soccer USA is these days no exaggeration.
Even if his many public interviews in recent weeks have not disclosed a deep
knowledge of what actually takes place on the field, he is no recent convert
who merely spots a quick potential profit.
His involvement dates back to the late 1970s when he was part-owner of the
Los Angeles Aztecs of the now-defunct North American Soccer League, an
investment, he has said, that he was lucky to escape from alive.
He was soccer commissioner for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, learning much
at the knee of its impresario, Peter Ueberroth, who showed how it was
possible to turn a penny from international sporting events that previously
had made vast losses (viz the 1976 Olympics in Montreal).
That track record alone made him the favourite candidate of Fifa, the
international soccer authority, to run the 1994 tournament.
Rothenberg draws no salary from World Cup USA 1994, a non-profit
organisation, but he will be paid a one-time bonus when the ledgers are
finally drawn up. This may be as little as Dollars 250,000, according to his
supporters, and as high as Dollars 5m, in the opinion of his critics.
Either way, the sum will have been richly earned, since Rothenberg thrives
on 100-hour work weeks and has had to forgo some income from his lucrative
law practice. It is also likely to be small in relation to his larger
investment plans for the sport, which, in turn, hang on the popularity and
profits generated by the World Cup.
The figures are by no means in yet, but they are already looking impressive.
Average attendance per match is around 67,000, about 19,000 more than in
Italy in 1990, with the size and quality of American stadiums only a partial
explanation.
That two Arab teams could attract 72,000 to a match held just across the
river from New York City, where few natural fans of Morocco and Saudi Arabia
can be found, is a testament to general fascination with soccer and good
national and local marketing.
Television ratings, a vital determinant in the viability of all professional
sports, have exceeded most expectations. The USA-Brazil game on the July 4
holiday, shown on ABC, the national network, was watched by about 10m
Americans, a record for soccer.
ABC and ESPN together bid a modest Dollars 23m for the domestic TV rights,
reflecting soccer's previously low national recognition, but the
international rights fetched Dollars 275m.
Ticket sales, commercial sponsorship and other forms of income could mean,
Rothenberg himself has estimated, gross revenues of around Dollars 1bn. Few
opportunities to cash in have been left unexplored. Companies, including
Coca-Cola, General Motors, Canon, MasterCard, and adidas, have paid up to
Dollars 20m each to be officially associated with the World Cup, a total
take exceeding Dollars 250m.
Even that amount is probably much lower than the cost of the promotional
activities undertaken by companies, in effect free publicity for the event.
Merchandise licensing arrangements, rock concerts and more besides have
helped swell the pot.
A critical ingredient was the involvement of the nine host cities, chosen
from a list of 26 applicants. This may have provoked some local disputes -
even in Los Angeles, of which Rothenberg is a conspicuous booster - but
appears to have been broadly successful.
The almost complete absence of violence among fans and the estimated Dollars
4bn equivalent of foreign currency spent at local hotels, shops, bars and
restaurants has more than mollified civic doubting Thomases.
So has the temporary summer employment offered to thousands of young people
serving as ushers, guards, press aides, runners, drivers and 'ball persons'.
Profits at the end of the day will be split between Fifa, the international
governing body, and the US organising operation. The domestic share may
approach Dollars 25m and therein lies the controversy which Rothenberg's
many soccer hats have generated.
The broad idea was that profits should be disbursed to the general cause of
soccer in America at the grass roots level. This will still happen.
But, according to reports in both the Los Angeles Times and New York
magazine the facts of which have not been disputed, World Cup USA 1994,
headed by Rothenberg, has already paid Dollars 500,000 for a business plan
for a new league to Major League Soccer, controlled by Rothenberg. MLS
outbid two other contenders for the right to run the new league in
submissions to the US Soccer Federation, whose boss is Rothenberg.
Further, Dollars 3.5m from World Cup USA has been paid to MLS for start-up
costs and total funding from World Cup profits may exceed Dollars 6m.
Rothenberg has also said he would like to be commissioner of the putative
12-team league, though he may then face challenges to his control of the US
Soccer Federation. But as commissioner he would control the disposition of
franchises for the new league. He may want to run one himself.
Soccer in the US is, as even his critics concede, a small and underdeveloped
pond, short on resources and competing personalities, in which Rothenberg is
a very big fish. He resolutely denies any conflict of interest or any
dealings that would not stand up to scrutiny.
If soccer is to take off in America after World Cup euphoria fades and
sports like baseball, basketball and gridiron football reassert themselves,
it is going to need a powerful man at the helm.
Once, fleetingly in the 1970s, it had Pele who, in the twilight of his
career, played for the New York Cosmos, but the Brazilian superstar's legs
faltered and so did the legs from under professional soccer. It is now
played mostly indoors and in obscurity.
Alan Rothenberg may not know how to kick a ball but the evidence of the
World Cup is that he sure knows how to set up the business of scoring goals.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Sport: Oh so nice not having to care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fun of this World Cup has been that I can take it or leave it. Caring
too much about sport can literally make me ill: I smoked 30 cigarettes in
two hours during the last frames of the snooker World Championships earlier
this year, so desperate was I for Jimmy White to win. And the 1990 World
Cup, glorious though it was, gave me perhaps one minute of pure pleasure
within far too many hours of churning stomach pains.
However good this year's competition has been, the best thing about it has
probably been the fact that England are not there.
I want to care about sport but I panic when the caring is a primitive,
unstoppable thing, as it was when I watched England in Italia 90. I cared so
much that I had no control over my feelings. The misery that this caused
made me marvel at the people who willingly submit themselves to this degree
of emotion every Saturday of the football season.
Of course, occasions such as the last World Cup are the ones that make sport
worth engaging with. Never, never shall I forget the sensation that I felt
when David Platt scored in the last minutes of England's game against
Belgium: it was as if the whole of myself had been hurled into the net along
with the ball.
Obviously this World Cup has contained nothing comparable, indeed nothing
very much at all that I shall remember. But it has produced an easy stream
of lesser emotions. Not the least of these has been a rather mean-minded
schadenfreude: a comfortable delight in observing the suffering of more
successful teams than England, and in seeing their fans go through what I
went through four years ago.
Yet one has to care a bit. Otherwise football matches, however exalted,
would be almost always unwatchable. The English - and probably every other
nation - are masters at fabricating preferences for themselves. This becomes
ridiculous when the pretence at caring turns into a reality, and people find
that they are worked up about something for which they have no real feeling
(like the tennis career of Jeremy Bates, which engages most of its followers
for only two weeks of the year). Still, to care when one can choose to stop
caring is extremely pleasurable.
Hence England's interest in the Irish team. How much do the English really
care about Ireland? Not very much at all. But the progress of the Irish gave
England a pretend stake in the World Cup: they could watch, patronise, be
generous, make jokes about the England B team, care and then suddenly not
have to care at all. A transient relationship, undemanding and thus
unrewarding - as such things always are - but far more enjoyable, in its
way, than the inescapable anguish of love.
If England had been in the World Cup how, for example, would I have felt
about those mad referees that have become the competition's talking point?
Without England, I admit that they have been a source of comedy. It is the
difference between having a row with a traffic warden, and watching somebody
else have a row with a traffic warden. The first arouses an unbearable,
frustrated anger; the second arouses sympathy, but also an appalled
hilarity.
If England had been one of the teams in that Bulgaria-Mexico match, the one
in which that Syrian referee was producing cards from his pocket like a
malfunctioning robot magician, on the following day I should have been
deliberately starting conversations with taxi drivers in order to get rid of
my molten reserves of fire. Distanced as I was, however, I could not help
but enjoy this magnificent farce that was being played out for me.
But it is all wrong, of course. Players can climb towards these few games
for four years, and then be thrown back to the ground by the whimsical
gesture of a power-crazed petty official who is probably consumed with
jealousy for their youth, wealth and talent.
And what power these officials have] In tennis, if a referee makes what a
player considers to be a bad decision, then the injured party can simply
stop the game while he says exactly what he thinks of the referee's warped
vision and warped mind.
I am not saying that this is right, yet it is surely equally wrong that if
one of those poor Bulgars or Mexicans had questioned the referee's card
tricks they, too, would probably have been off the pitch.
But it is the faith that is placed in the official judgments that is the
real problem. Cricket succumbed to the need for video evidence, to help in
the making of difficult decisions - why can't football? Referees are ageing
men who are expected to run around for 90 minutes (or, in this competition,
for far longer - at 90 minutes these games are just getting started), to
have a perfect view of every incident and to make the right judgment about
it every time. Should they really be shaping the progress of the World Cup?
But football is an unfair sport, and in the end these referees simply
reflect this.
Over a period of time, a good team will win more often than a bad one. Yet
in a single match anything can happen - not just because of mad official
decisions, but because the connection between great play and goals is
insufficiently strong.
In a competition like the World Cup, every team is as vulnerable as each
other; and it is our ever present sense of this vulnerability that makes
football so very hard on our emotions.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Condon on the money - Reading Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J D F JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Condon was a late starter in the literary stakes, into middle age
before he began writing. Now he's approaching 80, with 26 novels under his
belt, and to judge from the new one, Prizzi's Money (Michael Joseph Pounds
14.99, 241pp) he's still going strong.
This is the fourth in his series about the New York Mafia; the film of
Prizzi's Honour established his wider fame and, I hope, his fortune, But
connoisseurs of Condon would argue that the early books have never been
bettered. The Manchurian Candidate, which became a very good film, may have
been the best. A Talent for Loving - which ends with the Indians riding to
the rescue of the hero from the US Cavalry - was probably the funniest.
Sometimes the critics call Condon a satirist, sometimes a black comedian.
The hallmark of all his fiction is the outrageous energy of his imagination,
expressed in a prose which is baroque, even rococo, in its inventive
extravagance. He is never happier, more confident, than when he is building
an absurdly ornate cadenza of adjective, metaphor, paragraph. A Talent for
Loving, for example, has page after page extolling the most exotic brands of
cheese. And who can forget the wonderful scene in The Manchurian Candidate
where Janet Leigh on a train journey talks down the Frank Sinatra character
from a nervous breakdown?
Prizzi's Money has Henry Asbury, 'adviser to presidents', a Croesus who has
also been the Mafia's man in the White House for four administrations,
arranging his own kidnapping for a Dollars 75m profit on the ransom. Thanks
to his tricky wife Julia, it goes wrong, and Don Corrado Prizzi, aged 86 but
still with a healthy appetite, surrounded by his usual team of endearing
villains from the earlier books, is extremely cross.
Julia is the central figure and no doubt Hollywood's actresses will die for
the part: 'a tall woman, a statuesque grabber, with cheekbones as high as
the heads on Mount Rushmore. Her glossy, blue-black hair was arranged flat
against her head, like a flamenco dancer's, over large, dark, steady eyes
like periaktos, those triangular revolving prisms used as scenery in the
ancient Greek theater, eyes which seemed to mock the men in the huge room
for somewhere taking the wrong turning.'
Omerta clashes with infamita, international finance has rarely been
described with less respect, and Condon's prose rises to its usual excesses.
It is, of course, corn - the higher corn; clever, funny, forgettable.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Taxing thoughts and bright ideas - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next time you are asked by your employer for ideas about how to make the
business more efficient, why not suggest a staff suggestion scheme?
Companies as diverse as Toyota, the Japanese car maker, to Richer Sounds,
the UK hi-fi retailer, have all found that some of the best ideas come from
the staff. What is more, the Inland Revenue may be prepared to throw in some
tax relief for good measure.
Payments under suggestion schemes are fully liable to income tax, in just
the same way as a salary. But, according to David Cohen, partner at
London-based solicitor Paisner &amp; Co, in practice the Revenue is prepared to
waive its claim to tax as long as strict conditions designed to stop the
concession being abused are adhered to.
'Firstly, there needs to be a document setting out the scheme rules and
those rules must allow all the company's employees to participate on equal
terms. Secondly, an award can only be made for a suggestion which falls
outside the scope of the suggester's usual duties. If it is the sort of idea
which he is being paid his salary to think of, any additional payment will
be fully taxed,' says Cohen.
The Revenue must be satisfied that there is a genuine link between the
payment being made to the employee and the gains which result to the
employer's business.
'The scheme must require the employer to estimate the prospective financial
benefits and the amount of the award must not exceed 50 per cent of the
anticipated benefit in the first year following implementation, or 10 per
cent of the net benefit in a period of up to five years.
'The only exception to this is that payments of up to Pounds 25 can be made
for suggestions which are rejected, provided they do have some intrinsic
merit,' says Cohen.
The maximum tax-free award for a suggestion which is implemented is Pounds
5,000. Any payment above this amount will be taxed at the employee's
marginal rate.
Since the Revenue's conditions are complicated but do allow potentially
significant amounts of tax to be saved, a company which wants to set up a
staff suggestion scheme will be well advised to seek clearance from its
Inspector of Taxes.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: All others are but vanity - Style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHY PHILLIPS, beauty director of Tatler
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All things in fashion are cyclical. And the return of the vanity case to the
luggage of the international traveller is a perfect example.
However, the weighty 'train cases' that Phileas Fogg carried around the
world in 80 days, with their inlaid wood compartments and glass bottles, are
not quite the thing for today's pacey lifestyle.
The most interesting of the new vanity cases are those which are light and
yet functional. Although, if you can afford the Sky Caps necessary to carry
your luggage, people like Tanner Krolle and Louis Vuitton still make those
extraordinary hand-crafted pieces (which become heirlooms to a future
generation) and have done so since the Victorian times.
Supermodels, usually the first with something practical for the daily
flights, are sporting tough-looking cosmetic cases with reinforced edges by
She-umura (Pounds 150 at Harvey Nichols) or the plastic vanity case by
Bendels of New York in the store's distinctive brown and cream house stripe.
This is more squashy - more washbag than handbag - and has foldable trays
for jewellery and cosmetics. It goes inside a Prada rucksack or gets held as
an extra piece of hand luggage and only needs to accommodate the mini bottle
of Evian and a Phillipe Stark toothbrush if you travel extra light.
Gucci has a series of travel cases, including a rather serious but well
thought out tan leather case at Pounds 470. It has room for bottles and
vanity mirror, without being so heavy that you'd need a course of weight
lifting before the trip . Gucci's smaller round case (Pounds 145),
reminiscent of a 1950s design, would take all the cosmetics you'd need for
an overnight stay and fit neatly into a carry on bag.
Practical and inexpensive, Herve Chapelier provides the nylon washbag/vanity
case, either in blue Oxford stripe or in smart plain navy, mustard red or
black. (Stockists 071 589 5755). Prada, the status label of the moment, has
several practical nylon bags in every size to fit neatly inside another bag.
But Prada does not actually offer the vanity case or its modern
interpretation yet.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: The Dorchester: a bar that works - Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cosmopolitan friend, now living in Boston, Mass., always asks me whenever
she passes through London if I have made any culinary 'discoveries'.
Today, given the number of restaurant columns in newspapers and magazines,
and the publicity top chefs receive, such 'finds' are much less common than
they were. However, when she asked me the question recently, I did say that
I had had a surprisingly good lunch in the Bar of the Dorchester Hotel.
She was not impressed. She would rather not eat in hotel dining rooms, she
said, finding them, and the hotel lobbies that lead to them, cold and off
putting. The opposite was the case when I lunched at The Dorchester. The
lobby was full, with deals seemingly being done at every table. By 15.00 the
air was heavy with cigar smoke, testifying to the successful culmination of
at least some of them.
The Bar itself was busy, with quite loud entertainment being provided by two
female diners and their portable phones. These they used every few minutes
to phone the office to find out the phone numbers of Fenwicks and Harvey
Nichols, where they were obviously going to spend the afternoon.
The transformation of the Bar began a year ago, after The Dorchester ran a
successful culinary promotion with the Hotel villa d'Este on Lake Como in
Italy. The hotel's management then decided to convert what had not been the
most popular bar in town into a bar serving good Italian food.
Normally, when hotels decide on such metamorphosis they invest most heavily
on the decor. This mistake has not been made here. Instead, The Dorchester
has found in Paolo Sari, a 24-year-old from Treviso, a young, talented chef
and handed him considerable culinary freedom.
He repays this by offering a mouthwatering range of cold antipasti (Pounds
12.50 lunch only); a subtle fish broth with garlic bread, that contains
large pieces of salmon and John Dory (Pounds 12); a thick piece of turbot
wrapped in a thin skin of potatoes and then roasted (Pounds 16.50); a
Venetian speciality of pasta with a duck sauce (Pounds 12) and a coffee
cream pudding that was as strong as any espresso (Pounds 5.50).
The Bar's wine list includes some of Italy's best names, Masi, Ceretto and
Allegrini.
The Bar at The Dorchester, Park Lane, London WlA 2HJ (629 8888). Open
Mon-Sat 1100-2400, Sun 1200-22.30.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Always look on the bright side of life -
Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tired, stressed, feeling negative about your job and only capable of
mumbling 'not bad' when asked about your health.
What you may need is a dose of Jack Black, one of the UK's leading personal
development trainers, whose 'performance' before his audience is like a
secular version of Billy Graham and his evangelical Christian crusade.
Instead of redemption in the after-life Black, an ebullient Scotsman, offers
his clients, including companies such as Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group,
techniques which 'will give individuals the opportunity to get what they
want out of this life'.
Black, founder of Mindstore, is the British equivalent of Anthony Robbins,
the US guru for self - improvement and motivation. Black's message is not
new. It is that if somebody wants something badly enough he or she can
re-programme the mind to get it.
Black argues that it is no wonder most of us feel bad because we spend our
time being negative and moaning. He says that if the UK is to compete
successfully against the Pacific Rim nations it must develop a more positive
culture. If people change their thinking, he believes, they can change
reality.
Ways at looking on the bright side start fairly simply. Black urges his
clients not to say they are 'not too bad' when asked about their health.
'Instead, say you are feeling fantastic,' he urges. This may not be how one
is feeling. But say it enough times and the individual's brain ends up
believing it.
Black's more sophisticated techniques for 're-programming' concentrate on
making greater use of the right side of the brain. This is responsible for
creative and intuitive thinking. Techniques include relaxation as well as
'visualisation', which means creating images in one's imagination.
In this case Black urges his clients to build an imaginary house which would
include, for example, a shower room, where daily worries can be imaginarily
washed away.
Visualisation, he suggests, should be practiced up to three times a day for
spells of up to 15 minutes. Black says that often, before a business
meeting. he locks himself in the lavatory, or some other quiet place, to
focus his energy through visualisation techniques.
Sounds crazy? Well, his techniques have attracted a respectable portfolio of
clients, willing to pay up to Pounds 350 for a two-day seminar - individuals
such as Sir John Harvey Jones and corporate clients like Abbey National,
Texaco, Thorn EMI and Rangers football club.
Former clients speak with almost religious belief of Mindstore's techniques.
Robert Pilkington-Miksa, a partner in J Rothschild Assurance says: 'What you
think is what you get. If you think you will fail you will.'
Pilkington-Miksa adds that one does not worry about how the techniques work,
but they do. 'I was in financial services before my present job and if I
called 10 people nine did not want to talk to me. Then it all started to
change and the situation was very much reversed.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: A few days in history - Reading Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Choosing a book to read for the summer break? There are a number of
histories that are worth considering.
Frauds, crashes, insider dealing and rampant anti-semitism - the racy world
of 19th century London was the subject of David Kynaston's The City of
London: A World of its Own: 1850-1890 (Chatto), the first of a trilogy
exploring how the City came to be regarded as the world's leading financial
centre. Kynaston explains how Queen Victoria took a while to warm to the new
breed of hustling money-makers, preferring to honour, according to a
confidant, 'the men who have raised themselves by patient industry and
unswerving probity to positions of wealth and influence.'
Quite what she would have made of unadorned table legs in the dining room
was one of the themes of Michael Mason's The Making of Victorian Sexuality
(OUP), which overturns many of our most cherished stereotypes of an age
which was not that much more repressed than our own; 40 per cent of
Victorian brides, reports Mason, were pregnant on their wedding day.
More sex and violence embellish Peter Gay's The Cultivation of Hatred: the
Bourgeois Experience, Victoria to Freud (HarperCollins), the third of a
four-part series on 19th century middle class culture.
Moving up the social scale, it has been a rocky period for books on the
aristocracy. First, there was Tim Card's Eton Renewed: A History from 1860
to the Present Day (John Murray), an essentially friendly book which was
over-shadowed by disclosures that the school's former headmaster, Anthony
Chenevix-Trench, derived unhealthy pleasure from beating his boys.
This furore was accompanied by the publication of David Cannadine's Aspects
of the Aristocracy: Grandeur and Decline in Modern Britain (Yale University
Press), in which the author completed the demolition job he started with his
The Pleasures of the Past: The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy.
The pick of the history paperbacks over the last few months is Linda
Colley's epic Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837 (Pimlico) and Roy
Porter's Myths of the English (Polity Press).

FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Strategy - Buzzwords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To succeed these days in any field from business and politics to sport and
religion you need a strategy.
In the past week alone Wall Street analysts have questioned whether there is
a strategy behind the proposed merger between CBS, the broadcaster, and QVC,
the home shopping channel, and the British trade unions have called upon the
government to deliver a strategy to create jobs.
The word derives from the Greek strategia (generalship) and entered English
as strategie in 1688. It differs from tactics, which are immediate measures
in face of an enemy, according to James' 1810 Military Dictionary. Strategy
concerns something 'done out of the sight of an enemy'. The military origins
translate into a language of sport or commerce through the shared concept of
competition. Its derivatives, strategic, strategist and stratagem arrived in
1825 and 1838 respectively. The word relates to the medieval stratagem (an
artifice or trick) conjured up again in Shakespeare's most warlike play,
Titus Andronicus.
Since strategy is familiar in management, investment and politics, the
standard business lingo, it was to be expected that one sample Financial
Times last week had defensive strategy (politics), strategy for reduced
borrowings (Elf), investment strategy and long-term strategy (Schroders) and
also strategy and technique (World Cup).
The force driving technical uses of strategy is Game Theory, the
mathematical analysis of conflict, usually in war or economics. Websters
defines a game, the abstract set of rules players agree to or are forced to
follow, as: 'a procedure or strategy for gaining an end', and the OED as 'a
simulation of a contest. . . to test a strategy.'
The idea of strategy dates from the original business-school handbook, Sun
Tzu's 500BC 'The Art of War'.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Janet Reger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Janet Reger, the woman who made lingerie and luxury synonymous, is
well-prepared for working from a desert island. Having once taken a
three-week trip to Venezuela, she ended up staying three months, steering
her company via a fax.
So, with that same fax and a telephone, what else would be vital for the
Reger island office?
'I'd need a subscription to Women's Wear Daily. It's a trade paper printed
in the US but which covers the world. I didn't have it in Venezeula but
would need it for an extended period away from London.'
And for recreational reading?
'The Bible and I'd actually read it from beginning to end which is something
I've always wanted to do. There are so many stories it would keep me
interested, give me food for thought and maybe even some spiritual comfort
if I really got lonely.'
A companion would combat loneliness. Who would it be?
'I'd like him to be good looking and a good conversationalist. It would have
to be a him really. It would be difficult for two women to be on an island
together. I'd also want someone who was useful, someone who could do all the
jobs on the island.'
One item to preserve sanity is allowed.
'A Sonic the Hedgehog game. It would keep me amused during those long
tropical rainstorms when I was hut-bound. I find it absolutely compulsive to
play.'
What would you eat?
'Haagan Dazs ice cream - chocolate or coffee flavour, or preferably both.'
And drink?
'Coffee. I really love coffee. It wouldn't bother me if I didn't have
alcohol at all but I would miss coffee dreadfully.'
What film would you take?
'I'm a regular cinema-goer but I can't think of a film that I could see over
and over again. Maybe the film of my daughter's wedding would be good
because it would remind me of all my family and friends back home.'
In the office you can have one object to remind you of your early days in
business.
'A coffee pot I bought in a market in Nazareth when I was there very early
in my marriage. It was the only thing we quarrelled about in our various
comings and goings. I left him several times and kept going back only to
leave him again.'
What would you most like about desert island life?
'Seeing everything from one step away. When I was in Venezuela I was better
at making decisions. I was clearer and calmer. Here I get into a flap when
people come to me with a problem because they come to me in a state of
agitation.'
You can impose one condition to compensate for your exile.
'I would need an increase in my business so I could stay away and we could
have someone to replace me in the London office.'
Desert island attire is pretty basic but you can take one luxury item to
wear.
'Make-up, especially a bit of mascara. Once you have a suntan, you don't
need much else.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / Management: Trying to unlock the treasure within
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am a normal person. I know this because a career counsellor has just told
me so.
The other day I received a Perspex treasure chest bearing an invitation to a
'dynamic afternoon of career psychodrama and hands-on interaction using a
myriad of state-of-the-art techniques, presented by the experts, KPMG Career
Consultancy'. Thus it was that last Tuesday I found myself having my
behaviour assessed, my lifeline read, my self-image examined in the company
of solemn personnel directors from some of Britain's biggest companies.
The 'state-of-the-art techniques' revealed variously that I am impatient (I
knew this already), that I will never be the life and soul of the party
(which I was distressed to discover) that I like being in control (I have
been told as much before) and that I do whatever I'm told (which was news to
me).
My first visit was to the image counsellor, who handed me some crayons and a
large piece of paper. 'Draw anything, an island, your family, anything,' she
said. I drew a picture of myself in a taxi in a tunnel - an image I chose
because cars are the only thing I can draw and because the picture described
my most recent journey. 'That is a very strong image. It must be very
strongly felt,' she said, looking over my shoulder. She then asked if I was
'expecting', and suggested that my anger at the situation might be to do
with protecting the unborn child. I said I very much doubted it, and she
reminded me that the point of these pictures was to bring hidden emotions to
the surface.
A second expert invited me to plot my lifeline, marking the main events in
my personal and professional life as highs or lows on a chart. I had trouble
even beginning this exercise. I couldn't decide whether being born was a
high or a low point - as far as I can remember (which is not at all) it
wasn't really either.
I should have performed better with the computer, which asked me to write an
imaginary newspaper headline and story about myself. But my mind went blank
when it came to thinking up a sufficiently newsworthy future achievement.
Finally I replied to 108 repetitive questions asking whether my friends told
me their closest secrets and whether they included me in their activities.
According to this psychometric test my behaviour is 'really quite normal'.
There can be no doubt about it: this career psychodrama was more diverting
than an afternoon in the office. But I am not sure how I would have felt
about it had I been attending under normal circumstances. Usually the
exercise takes a full week, and is paid for by companies as a parting gift
to employees they are about to get rid of.
KPMG describes its exercise as follows: 'In life as in career the treasure
is really you. How to unlock it is the thing.' I am sorry to have to report
that the treasure that is really me remains as firmly locked up as ever. I
can't even open the Perspex chest they sent me.
A friend has just supplied me with a good working definition of empowerment.
His organisation has just jumped on that bandwagon, and when I saw him last
weekend he was not looking good: pale and tired and drinking heavily.
'Empowerment,' he said, 'is when your boss gives you all the boring parts of
his job to do, and works half as hard himself.'
Clare Spottiswoode may be wishing she had never heard of the job of gas
regulator. Bad enough was that nonsense a few weeks ago about her private
life, worse is the news that her architect husband has now turned down a
small contract with British Gas simply because of his wife's position.
It seems most unfair. He has worked for British Gas in the past, long before
his wife became involved in the industry. Moreover, the department which
awarded him the business this time did not know there was any link between
them.
Yet Spottiswoode understandably felt there was too much to lose. Her job
depends on being seen to be impartial, and snide remarks about her
protecting her husband's interests would not have been helpful.
This is no one-off case. There must be hundreds of couples where one is in
public life, and the other working in a related area. Equally, there must be
hundreds of potential conflicts, some of which are harmless, others less so.
To have a blanket ban on a family member working in any area in which their
other half wields power would be ludicrous. It would also make jobs in
officialdom even less attractive than they are already.
Some people, Margaret Thatcher for one, have the personality and the power
to tough it out when members of the family manoeuvre themselves into
potentially compromising positions. But lesser officials need more
protection and guidance. One solution might be to set up a body to look at
individual cases. And yet there is something about a regulator that
regulates the regulators that does not quite appeal.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Management: The retuning of Fiat's engine - The Italian
group's big losses have overshadowed far-reaching changes in its culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During its 95-year history, Fiat has often behaved as though it were an arm
of the Italian government - a strict hierarchy with diplomatic, commercial
and industrial functions parallel to those of the state, headed by a
patriarchal chairman, Gianni Agnelli.
Over the last few years, however, Fiat, in common with Italy, has been
struggling to change deep-rooted management and working habits. 'Fiat today
is a different Fiat compared with the company of five years ago,' says
Giorgio Garuzzo, chairman of Fiat's three core divisions - cars, commercial
vehicles and agricultural and construction equipment. 'We're not talking
about revolution, because we have never sought to break with the past, but
undoubtedly an evolution of far-reaching importance.'
But as the group starts to recover from last year's record loss, the same
questions are being asked about the 'new Fiat' as about the new Italy: how
deep do these changes go, and will they last?
The first indication that Fiat would attempt to change its culture came in
1989, when the group's blunt-talking chief executive, Cesare Romiti,
presented 200 Fiat managers with a highly critical analysis of the problems
facing the group, which he described as 'sad, laggardly and bureaucratised'.
Fiat Auto was the most obvious culprit. In spite of earlier efforts to
reform the Fiat car business, the group's principal operation was heading
for a new decade with an outdated product line - it was six years since the
launch of the acclaimed Uno in the popular small-car range - and a
reputation for poor quality.
That reputation was not helped by an unspoken assumption within the company
that customers were prepared to compromise on quality if the price was low
enough - a fallacy which was about to be exploded by more efficient Japanese
car manufacturers. Protected from Japanese competition at home, and coddled
by a comparatively buoyant Italian market, Fiat Auto had been able to defer
important decisions.
This was dangerous, not only for the division itself, but for the whole
group. Fiat operates in more than 60 countries and has 15 distinct
activities, including aviation, railway rolling stock, chemicals, publishing
and financial services. But Fiat Auto still accounts for more than half of
group industrial turnover and nearly 70 per cent of group revenues are drawn
from the three principal divisions (cars, trucks, farm and building
equipment). The group's top managers are almost invariably drawn from these
businesses.
Analysts now criticise Fiat Auto for moving too slowly and not anticipating
the inevitable cyclical downturn in the car industry after the years of
plenty. But Garuzzo points out that the company was working gradually on a
change of management strategy from the end of the 1980s.
For example, Fiat started to introduce the 'total quality' concept from 1989
across the group, attempting to change attitudes, reform relationships with
suppliers and involve workers more closely in devising solutions to
production problems. Garuzzo concedes this is 'not a strategy that gives
results overnight', but five years later it has spawned Fiat Auto's first
'integrated factory' at Melfi, in southern Italy, which is producing the new
Punto small car.
Melfi, which came on-stream this year, is one of the main reasons why Fiat
believes the changes introduced over the last five years will stick.
There, Fiat is trying to delegate more responsibility to units of workers
and managers. There is no separate building for central staff and the old
blue-collar/white-collar distinction is abolished: everybody wears the same
overalls, distinguished only by small coloured labels, and decisions are
made by work teams on the factory floor.
'At Melfi, the worker doesn't exist any more' read a recent headline on an
admiring article in Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business daily.
Practically, it is easier to establish an integrated factory from scratch -
on a site such as Melfi, where production lines can be mapped out for ease
of access and component suppliers located next door, for example - than
impose it on to a well-established plant such as Turin's Mirafiori,
originally built for a different production strategy.
Garuzzo admits as much: 'Undoubtedly Melfi is a workshop for (the management
strategy), because starting with a greenfield site is always more simple.
There aren't any old concepts and no psychological resistance to overcome.'
Fiat executives believe the enthusiasm of the Melfi workers, who are mostly
in their mid-20s, compared with an average age of 46 at other Fiat
factories, will infuse the whole group. However, Fiat unions claim that
although Melfi's employees - drawn from a region with high unemployment -
were keen on the project at the outset, disillusionment is beginning to set
in as some of their high expectations are confounded.
Melfi is not the only element of the Fiat Auto strategy, however. Parallel
changes in the company's approach to product development are also beginning
to bear fruit. Fiat Auto has long since abandoned the accepted wisdom that
you can introduce new basic models as rarely as once a decade and keep the
range fresh with occasional restyling. At eight to 10 years, Fiat's product
cycle in the mid-1980s was short compared with the industry average, but by
the early 1990s, the changeover period looked sluggish, particularly when
compared with Japanese competitors.
From 1991, the company began working on reducing this renewal cycle to five
to six years. The full impact of this change will be obvious in 1996, by
which time 18 new models should have been launched and the Punto will be one
of the oldest Fiat models still produced.
Alas for Fiat, this heavy investment of time and money coincided with a
reduction in the competitiveness of Italian industry, due partly to high
labour costs. The competitiveness problem was eased in 1992, when the
Italian currency was devalued and the link between wage increases and
inflation cut. But it was at that point that the European car market, and
Italy in particular, slipped further than anyone had predicted.
'We suddenly found ourselves with an extraordinary mix of problems to
manage, issues to face up to and programmes to take forward,' explains
Garuzzo. 'Our basic decision was not to stop any of the programmes which
were going on, because that would have further damaged our competitiveness.'
As a result, as Fiat has been eager to point out, although the group
recorded its largest loss in 1993 - L1,780bn (Pounds 736m) after tax,
extraordinary charges and minority interests - it also devoted a record
L8,900bn to research and development and capital expenditure, much of it to
improving Fiat Auto's sales network in preparation for the launch of new
models.
Meanwhile, the number of employees in the whole group has fallen from more
than 300,000 in 1990 to just over 260,000 in 1993, and in Fiat Auto from
133,000 to 120,000. Cuts in Italy have been eased by government-sponsored
redundancy agreements, while the number of Fiat Auto employees abroad has
increased.
But in spite of the confidence of top Fiat management, Susanna Camusso,
national secretary responsible for Fiat at Fiom, the main Italian
engineering union, believes the cultural changes have not yet permeated
through all levels of the group. 'There are people within Fiat who have
chosen this new culture, but others who still think that the old system was
fine,' she says.
'Companies develop characters like people,' agrees one analyst. 'Sometimes
after the age of 15, or even five years, or six months, there's nothing more
you can do about changing that character.'
As Fiat finally tries to reap the benefits of its painfully implemented
management strategy, it must try to dispel three main concerns.
One is the danger that complacency will again set in as the recession begins
to lift. Garuzzo and his colleagues say the risk of 'decadenza' (decline, or
decay) still exists, 'but this new system of management which increases
everybody's participation should create motivation internally to resist this
trend'. Whether this is true may not become obvious until the next downturn
in the market, by which time it could be too late to amend the strategy.
A second risk is that Fiat's foreign plants - for example in Poland, Turkey
and Brazil - begin to generate the sort of industrial relations problems
which have largely been banished from the main Italian operations. Last
week, for example, Fiat Auto's Polish workers voted to strike to try to
force a 40 per cent pay increase.
Finally, there is the open question of the Fiat succession. Gianni Agnelli
is 73 and Romiti is 71. Last year both of them decided to stay on rather
than handing on the chairmanship to Umberto, Gianni's brother, this summer
as originally planned.
Agnelli argued at the time that the market turmoil, the poor group results
and the fact that Fiat had just launched a complex L5,000bn package of
measures to raise cash meant investors did not want a new hand on the
tiller. Some now believe the real reason was that neither Agnelli nor Romiti
wanted a new chairman and chief executive to claim the credit for Fiat's
recovery.
Certainly there was no hint of impending change at last month's shareholder
assembly, where Agnelli forecast a return to profit for the group this year.
But in a company attempting to eliminate unnecessarily hierarchical
management and to create, in the words of one executive, 'a flat and wide
(management) unit', the dynastic structure of Fiat's top management is
beginning to look increasingly out of date.

FT  11 JUL 94 / New talks revive hopes for rail peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a settlement to the four-week-old signal workers' strike rose last
night after it emerged that Railtrack and the RMT Transport Union are to
resume talks at the conciliation service Acas today.
The two sides are to meet this afternoon at the invitation of Acas after
Railtrack provided 'additional information' to RMT last Friday.
Railtrack said: 'We are glad they are considering our package. If all goes
well this could prevent next Wednesday's strike.'
But RMT said the talks were complex and the talks at Acas could only be a
start to more detailed discussions. A spokesman said: 'We have been invited
to resume our search for a negotiated settlement and we are happy to do so
but I do not think the situation is any less difficult.'
'I do not realistically think we can get an agreement on a package of this
nature at Acas. It is too complex. The detail has to be negotiated in a
sensible way.'
Railtrack's most recent offer presented as a 6 per cent increase was in fact
worth 3 per cent on basic rates of pay, RMT said.
RMT said the additional information provided by Railtrack would not have a
material impact on the negotiations and consisted solely of details of
paybill costs requested earlier by the union.
RMT said that an attempt by Railtrack to contact the union's members
directly by letter last week had failed to change the minds of signal
workers.
Four days have been lost to strikes over the past month although Railtrack
has managed to increase the number of routes operating on each occasion.
Last Wednesday it provided enough signal boxes to allow the running of
between 1,700 and 1,750 trains.
The union has threatened to introduce two-day stoppages each week.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Shake-up of 'archaic' accounting moves closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals are due this week on radical changes to the way the
public sector presents its accounts, bringing it more in line with the
private sector.
The Treasury is expected to issue a green paper in the middle of the week
laying out its ideas on a shift from cash to accruals accounting.
The details follow a commitment made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
in his Budget speech last November, when he called the existing system used
by government 'archaic'.
At the time, the Treasury said it planned to issue proposals on the idea in
the first half of 1994.
The changes are likely to introduce for the first time into the accounts of
government departments' non-cash items such as depreciation of assets,
superannuation and insurance.
They will focus on outputs and results and will require information on
assets, cashflows and service agreements. They should have widespread
implications for accountability and implications for future management
practices.
Local government, privatised companies, universities and executive agencies
are among the organisations that have already begun to introduce accounting
changes to bring them more in line with practice in business.
Accruals accounting is already used by the New Zealand government. In
Australia, it has been introduced at federal level and for the state
governments of New South Wales and Victoria. The US and Canadian authorities
are both considering its introduction.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Report on Archer probe 'this week'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report on the investigation into Lord Archer's alleged involvement in
insider dealing is expected within a week, the Department of Trade and
Industry hinted strongly yesterday.
The DTI acknowledged the urgency to settle the affair as it came under
increasing pressure to provide a full explanation of the circumstances in
which it disclosed Lord Archer's name as part of the investigation.
Lord Archer publicly fended off questions about the inquiry for the second
day running yesterday when he hosted an auction to raise funds for the Globe
Theatre replica on London's South Bank.
However, Lord Archer's friends have been pressing for an early announcement
which they believe will clear his name.
Continuing uncertainty about the outcome of the investigation comes at a
time of increasing speculation about the ministerial reshuffle, expected
shortly.
Lord Archer was widely believed to be a candidate for a junior ministerial
post, such as sports minister, although his chances of achieving his
ambition of succeeding Sir Norman Fowler as Conservative party chairman were
not thought to be strong.
Mr Major, at the G7 summit in Naples yesterday, refused to say whether Lord
Archer would feature in the reshuffle if, as his friends claim, the former
party deputy chairman is exonerated by the DTI.
The prime minister said the matter must rest with the DTI and the
investigators appointed to look into allegations of insider trading. 'I
don't think it would be at all right for me to offer any further comment on
that whatsoever,' he said.
However, if the DTI gives Lord Archer a clean bill of health before the
reshuffle is announced, his chances of securing a government post are
belived to be the same as they would have been had details of the inquiry
remained confidential.
The investigation, launched in February, centres on share dealing in Anglia
TV during the run-up to an agreed takeover bid which sent shares soaring.
Lord Archer's wife, Mary, is a non-executive director of Anglia.
The DTI has refused to discuss details of the inquiry, but it is believed to
involve a single transaction involving 30,000 shares and a profit of about
Pounds 50,000.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Auditors likely to have more inspections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is poised to require that auditors are subject to far more
frequent inspections by regulators in efforts to improve quality.
In proposals likely to be announced in the next few days, accountancy firms
judged to be particularly high risk will be subject to the most intense
scrutiny.
The moves are part of an attempt to ensure that those with lower standards
are examined as quickly as possible.
The recommendations are the outcome of the first detailed evaluation by the
Department of Trade and Industry of the system of audit self-regulation that
was introduced two years ago.
They follow officials' consideration of a report commissioned from Mr Peter
Moizer, professor of accounting at Leeds University, and submitted earlier
this year.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, is expected to give a
parliamentary answer this week in which he will rule out some of the more
radical suggestions made in the Moizer report.
These included merging the three existing regulatory bodies for auditors and
opening them up to greater independent public scrutiny.
Mr Hamilton is expected to say that the present system of monitoring is
generally working well but that there is scope for improvement.
He will call for a wider range of monitoring methods, and efforts to ensure
that these methods match more closely the differing circumstances of
practitioners.
He will also ask the supervisory bodies to submit in the autumn their
proposals on how these recommendations will be implemented.
The Moizer report will be made public by putting it in the library of the
House of Commons. This is in spite of pressure from the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to suppress its findings, which
the institute felt were unfair.
The report was more in favour of the approach taken by the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants, which visits its firms more frequently
and is perceived to be more sympathetic in dealing with weaknesses.
The report also argued that the present system was unlikely to improve
standards among the larger firms.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Fewer charities to be examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of charities are likely to escape the requirement for an annual
independent examination of their accounts, under proposals to be unveiled by
the government later this month.
Charities with gross receipts of less than Pounds 10,000 year will require
no external scrutiny, while those below Pounds 250,000 a year will not be
required to conduct a full audit.
The thresholds, which were proposed by the charity committee of the
government's deregulation taskforce, have been accepted by the Department of
Trade and Industry, according to a member of the committee.
Mr Andrew Phillips, senior partner of Bates Wells and Braithwaite, the law
firm, said the DTI was due to announce them as part of the taskforce's
recommendations on July 19.
He rejected the suggestion that relaxing the requirements might encourage
fraud.
'A vast number of charities in the UK are run off someone's kitchen table,'
he said. 'Fraudsters are not going to be either encouraged or discouraged by
regulations.'
The proposals remain stricter than the audit exemption requirements being
introduced for limited companies. At present all require an audit, but
changes from this autumn will remove the requirement for those with a
turnover of less than Pounds 350,000 a year.
Charities which are also incorporated will almost certainly be required to
meet the higher standard under the charities requirement - exemption only
for those with income below Pounds 250,000.
A number of the committee's suggestions have been put forward as amendments
to the deregulation and contracting-out bill being discussed in committee in
the House of Lords.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Curb on food adverts urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertisements for fatty and sugary foods should be banned from children's
television, the National Food Alliance campaigning group says today in
submissions to the Independent Television Commission and the Advertising
Standards Authority.
The call comes as the group publishes the results of a poll conducted by
MORI which indicates that two-thirds of parents want to see tougher
restrictions on food advertising. Three-quarters of parents think that food
adverts do not encourage children to eat a healthy, balanced diet, said the
alliance.
The survey was carried out among 633 parents of children under the age of
15. Nearly half said their children persuaded them to buy advertised foods
or drinks which they would not otherwise have bought. The National Food
Alliance is an umbrella group of more than 50 organisations including the
British Dental Association, the National Farmers' Union and the Trades Union
Congress.
The submissions include proposals that:
Advertisements for fatty and sugary foods should be banned when large
numbers of children are likely to be viewing.
Advertising should provide more balanced nutrition messages.
The use of misleading or meaningless claims such as 'full of goodness' or
'wholesome' should be prohibited and health claims restricted unless
justified by sound medical evidence.
The Advertising Association, the body which represents both advertisers and
advertising professionals, said recently that children's diets may sometimes
be unsatisfactory. It added that some groups could be targeted in public
information programmes, but advertising could not solve these specific
problems.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Humber estuary sees its ship come in: A look at a port's
revival that left the Thames trailing in its wake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than Pounds 150m of investment has been committed to developing port
and trade facilities in the Humber estuary since the abolition of the
National Dock Labour Scheme five years ago.
The scheme, which gave dockers jobs for life unless they could be persuaded
to accept redundancy payments, inhibited investment because of overmanning
and uncertain returns. Since port labour markets were deregulated the Humber
has become Britain's busiest estuary, shifting 62m tonnes of cargo last
year, overtaking the Thames and accounting for 17 per cent of the UK's
seaborne trade.
The rapid build-up of investment is expected to help expand this share to 25
per cent by the end of the century. Traffic exceeded 40,000 shipping
movements last year, a growth of more than 50 per cent in 10 years.
The latest substantial piece of investment will open next month at Immingham
 -owned by Associated British Ports - on the Humber's south bank. It is a
Pounds 14.5m third berth at the port's oil terminal. A further Pounds 4m has
been spent by the users - Conoco, Petrofina and Total - on the pipework.
The new berth was handed over to the oil companies - which run two
refineries at Immingham - last month for trials. It will cut queues of ships
in the Humber waiting to load or discharge bulk oil or petrochemical
cargoes. The terminal has been handling about 100 ships a month up to now.
The Humber has four ports - Hull, Grimsby, Immingham and Goole, all owned by
ABP - 10 river wharves and about 100 other berths. ABP's commitment so far
is about Pounds 85m. Its other large investments include Pounds 13m for a
second large roll-on, roll-off terminal at Immingham, Pounds 13.5m to
redevelop Grimsby's fish dock and associated markets, Pounds 12.5m on a new
dredger, and Pounds 11m on a floating ro-ro stage in the river at Hull.
This floating stage saves two hours' sailing time locking in and out of the
port's docks and has encouraged North Sea Ferries to spend Pounds 62m on two
ships offering a dedicated overnight freight service each way between the
Humber and Rotterdam.
Cargoes passing through the Humber include iron ore, coal, oil,
petrochemicals, fertilisers, steel, cement, newsprint, timber, containers,
ro-ro trailers, fish, grain, sugar and cars. Grimsby imports VWs and Audis
and exports Toyotas from Derby. Saab, BMW and Volvo are also regular users.
The nature of the ports has changed dramatically since the 1980s. Immingham
exported 5m tonnes of coal a year before the miners' strike a decade ago.
Now it imports about 4m tonnes for electricity generation and coking.
However, a combination of manning agreements and union-controlled custom and
practice meant it used to take a week to shift a 25,000-tonne cargo of coal
through the port. Now it takes 24 hours.
No one is sure what has happened to numbers of jobs in the ports because
those for dockers are now scattered through several small independent
stevedoring companies. But Mr Geoff Kent, Immingham's port superintendent,
says there are about 5,000 jobs dependent on the port. This is growing as
more companies move in.
Previously they set up warehouses and process plant outside the port
boundary so dockers could not claim and regulate new jobs.
Mr Robert Smith, assistant port manager for both Grimsby and Immingham, says
about Pounds 40m of ABP's investment in the two ports has been made in the
last two-and-a-half years as competitiveness and prospects improved.
Investment will continue to move up steadily, if only because of the need to
keep buying cranes to cope with growth - they cost about Pounds 1m each.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Communications is to lobby the government to review the fees it pays
British Telecommunications if BT's market share falls below 85 per cent.
BT has said the fees are needed to share the cost of upgrading the network.
Mercury claims the contributions are in addition to fees it and other
competitors pay for network use. It added: 'Mercury is already paying more
than Pounds 35m to BT because we've essentially won too many customers. This
figure will nearly double in the next year.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / Labour slams fall in training cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government spending on training, enterprise and labour-market services has
fallen by more than a third in real terms since its peak in 1987-88, Mr Tony
Lloyd, Labour's training spokesman, said yester-day.
According to figures obtained through parliamentary questions, Pounds 4.3bn
was spent in 1987-88 at 1993 prices compared with Pounds 2.6bn in 1992-93.
Mr Lloyd said this showed that there had been a substantial cut in
resources, combined with a switch from spending on training to cheaper
schemes for the long-term unemployed.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Companies plan to invest more
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies' investment intentions have risen in spite of tax increases, the
finance and leasing group Lombard Business Finance said.
Many economists see increased corporate investment as vital to re-balance
the economic recovery which has so far been fuelled by consumer spending.
In June, 63 per cent of companies surveyed planned to purchase a major asset
over the next three months, up from 61 per cent in March.
Companies are mainly investing to increase efficiency, rather than to expand
capacity, according to Lombard, while the proportion of companies saying
that the tax changes had caused them to cut investment plans was just 19 per
cent in June, down from 27 per cent in March.

Most public-sector groups have settled for pay rises of between 2.5 per cent
and 3 per cent, according to Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts.
In local government the 2.9 per cent Pay Review Body award to teachers has
been a strong factor in pay decisions. Other groups have been made opening
offers of 1.75 per cent, which unions have rejected, IDS says.
In the private sector many increases are at or above 3 per cent, with many
of the highest pay rises in financial services, the analysts add.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Rules are 'too kind' to water groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers have not had a fair deal on water prices since the industry was
privatised, the National Consumer Council says today, David Lascelles
writes.
The regulatory system has been too generous to the companies, says the
report, which comes two weeks before Mr Ian Byatt, industry regulator,
announces new price controls. Consumers have had to pay an unfair amount of
the industry's costs, it adds.
Operating profits of the 31 regulated companies rose by an annual average of
20 per cent from 1989-90 to 1992-93 and profit margins increased from 28.7
per cent to 35.6 per cent. Yet water bills for domestic customers have
increased by an average 67 per cent.
Although the water companies have faced huge costs to modernise
infrastructure, most of the cost has been passed on to consumers, and
companies have made little or no use of borrowings or rights issues.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Serious safety shortfalls reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey of London employers has found serious shortfalls in health and
safety provisions for their employees.
The survey of 350 workplaces, carried out by the Industrial Society, found
that employers were failing to make changes to comply with new health and
safety legislation. The report found that only 43 per cent of employers had
held a fire drill in the past six months.
While nearly three-quarters of the respondents regularly employed
contractors, only half included health and safety in the contract or checked
the contractor's record on health and safety. Fewer than half monitored
contractors' safety performance or imposed penalties for safety lapses.
Employers are also reacting slowly to new health and safety regulations
which require a written workplace policy on risk assessment, the report
says. A year after the regulations came into force only half the
organisations questioned had introduced a policy.
In contrast almost three-quarters of the respondents had developed new
safety policies for visual display units and 60 per cent of those were
giving staff training.
Mr David Wood, the Industrial Society safety specialist who carried out the
survey, said a lack of enforcement officers was allowing many organisations
to escape prosecution.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Insurer paying Pounds 3,000 a recruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Dunbar, the insurance company, is paying its managers up to Pounds
3,000 for every new recruit who meets specific standards in an effort to
increase the quality of its sales force.
The scheme fits in with efforts in the life industry to take on more
experienced recruits who are deemed more likely to offer 'best advice' to
clients and so meet more exacting regulatory requirements.
In a scheme introduced this year believed to break new ground in the life
industry, Allied Dunbar is paying its biggest bonuses to managers who bring
into the company sales agents who have previous experience with life
products.
Smaller sums are paid for taking on people regarded as quality recruits by
dint of their age, background and previous salaries in other jobs.
Last year, in an experimental version of the scheme, about 45 of the
company's 350 managers qualified for recruitment bonuses, earning between
Pounds 3,000 and about Pounds 21,000.
While Allied Dunbar believes paying bonuses for recruits is an innovative
way to tackle some of the problems facing life insurance, some industry
critics believe that offering cash incentives to recruit sales people can
lead to managers bringing in large numbers of staff who may in some cases be
given inappropriate guidance.
Eight former sales agents and two present agents, all from Dunbar's office
in Chelmsford, Essex, have said they were given inflated promises from
company representatives about how much they could earn at Allied Dunbar and
then were given little management support to help them meet sales targets.
Allied Dunbar denies that any inflated promises were made, although it
added: 'We acknowledge that there was poor management support at Chelmsford,
and we have taken steps to change the management.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / Tory MPs to urge diluted Post Office sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory backbenchers opposed to Post Office privatisation plan to lobby the
government in favour of selling only a minority stake to keep the
corporation in the public sector.
After a series of private meetings in the Commons the MPs have accepted the
need to inject private capital into the Post Office.
But instead of the government's preferred option of selling 51 per cent of
the shares in the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, they are arguing for a
flotation of 30 per cent.
The MPs say the recent 30 per cent share sale in Koninklijke PTT Nederland,
the state-owned Dutch postal and telecommunications company, provides a good
example of how private capital can be injected without full privatisation.
More than eight Tory MPs say they oppose the government's preferred option
and have threatened to vote against it if put to a vote. This would wipe out
the government's majority of 15.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is confident he will be
able to win over the remaining Tory MPs opposed to his privatisation plans.
However the MPs, by taking the unusual step of meeting together, have made
it clear to Mr Heseltine in one-to-one meetings they are planning 'a big
fight' to prevent the corporation moving into the private sector.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, accused the DTI of
making misleading comparisons between the Dutch sell-off and its
privatisation plans for the Post Office.
'I am in favour of selling off a minority stake so long as the corporation
remains in the public sector,' he said.
Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, and Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for
Staffordshire South, have also urged Mr Heseltine to draw back from
privatising the Post Office. They favour a 30 per cent sale but Mr Cormack
said he would be happy to see up to 49 per centsold.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said he also backed a 30 per
cent sale of the Post Office. 'It would be a bad bargain for the taxpayer if
we sold 51 per cent ahead of the massive benefits that the corporation says
will flow from commercial freedom.'
Mr Robert Hicks, Conservative MP for Cornwall South East, said he would like
the Post Office to remain in the public sector with the removal of the
Treasury constraints on it.
'I would be less worked up by a 30 per cent sale,' Mr Hicks said. 'But there
is no way that I am going to commit myself to the 51 per cent sale.'
Although Mr Heseltine has committed the government to a uniform affordable
tariff, Mr Hicks pointed out that electricity privatisation led to regional
price differentials after similar assurances.
The issue of regional pricing also concerns Mr David Nicholson, Tory MP for
Taunton, who said the government would have to make 'a very strong case for
full privatisation' if it wanted to get a bill through the Commons.
Party managers are still hopeful of bringing forward a bill in November to
privatise the Royal Mail and Parcelforce after the consultation period ends
in the autumn.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Public pay 'runs ahead of guideline'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's 'clumsy' intervention in the Railtrack negotiations has
highlighted the fact that it is unsure whether its public-sector pay policy
is working, according to the independent pay analysts Incomes Data Services.
An IDS analysis of the public sector freeze on pay bills finds that most
groups have settled for between 2.5 and 3 per cent, comfortably above last
year's 1.5 per cent norm.
'The pattern of awards suggests that many public-sector employers have used
the inflation rate and the Pay Review Body awards as yardsticks for pay
increases and then aimed for efficiency savings to match,' says IDS.
In local government the 2.9 per cent Pay Review Body award to teachers has
been a strong factor in pay decisions. In the NHS, the administrative and
clerical staff have been offered 1.95 per cent. Other groups have been made
opening offers of 1.75 per cent, which unions have rejected.
IDS says private sector deals are starting to push up over 3 per cent. The
increases include performance-based rises of between 0 and 9 per cent for
38,000 retail staff at Boots the Chemist (adding 3 per cent to pay scales)
and a flat rate increase of Pounds 6 a week from July for 52,000 staff at
Marks and Spencer, worth an average 4 per cent to a sales assistant.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Junior ministerial aides suspended pending inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two junior ministerial aides were last night suspended from their
departmental duties following newspaper allegations that they had been
willing to accept money for tabling parliamentary questions.
Downing Street said Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, planned to tell Mr
David Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick that they were suspended as
parliamentary private secretaries - the lowest rung on the ministerial
ladder - pending the outcome of 'any inquiry which may be instituted by the
committee of privileges'.
If there was no inquiry by the privileges committee, the two would be
suspended while 'an internal inquiry' was conducted, Downing Street said.
Mr Tredinnick, the MP for Bosworth, is parliamentary private secretary to
Sir Wyn Roberts, a Welsh Office minister. Mr Riddick, MP for Colne Valley,
fulfils the same role for Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary.
The speed of Downing Street's reaction was interpreted as a sign of the
government's continuing sensitivity to any suggestion of impropriety in the
wake of a series of embarrassments this year.
Yesterday's move followed newspaper allegations that the pair had been
willing to table official questions in the House of Commons in return for
Pounds 1,000.
The two men, who both deny wrongdoing, were among 10 Conservative and 10
Labour MPs selected at random and approached by a Sunday Times reporter
posing as a businessman.
Mr Riddick - who the newspaper said had returned his Pounds 1,000 payment -
said yesterday he decided it would be 'inappropriate' to accept the fee
because the amount of work was very small. He said he was taking advice
'with a view to consideration of legal action'.
Mr Tredinnick said he refused to accept payment 'and in any case if I had
agreed to do so, providing I had registered that interest, I would not have
been in any way contravening regulations'.
He said he resented 'very much' that the newspaper had 'gone out of its way
to try and set up members of parliament'. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the
Labour MP for Workington, said he was planning to ask Miss Betty Boothroyd,
the Speaker, to investigate the allegations, which left him 'aghast'.

Patterns of demand for temporary and permanent staff have diverged radically
over the past few years, Reed Personnel Services, the employment agency
group, said.
Demand for permanent staff outstripped temporary demand throughout the
1980s. However, during the recession the demand for temporary staff fell
less sharply than that for permanent staff.
In the last quarter the agency's index for temporary staff rose eight points
to 97, against the 1990 base level of 100. The permanent-staff index rose
seven points to 50.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Exaggerated death of the county council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survival of county councils now looks increasingly likely in much of
England as the review of the structure of English local government
approaches the end of its first stage.
By the end of this week the Local Government Commission for England, chaired
by Sir John Banham, will have published its recommendations for all but
three counties.
Of the 20 on which proposals have been published since the beginning of
June, only four rule out retaining county councils. In the others the
existing two-tier structure of county and district councils remains an
option.
The commission must now submit its proposals for local consultation. The
options will be included in leaflets to be sent to every household in the
counties affected.
If local opinion comes out in favour of preserving counties and districts,
this would offer the government the opportunity to back away from its policy
of creating new unitary councils, combining the functions of counties and
districts.
With growing opposition to change from Conservative backbenchers, ministers
could say that the review had delivered a verdict that only minimal change
was necessary.
The legislation setting up the review requires the commissioners to state a
preferred option when they draw up their reports.
However, the commissioners have presented their latest recommendations as
the start of a consultation, emphasising that they would be happy with any
of the alternatives they present.
They insist that the exercise is not a referendum, as other factors such as
cost and viability must be taken into account. But a strong vote against
wholesale reform would make it hard for the commission to recommend change.
Commissioners' statements also reflect lack of enthusiasm for change. Sir
John told an audience in Leicestershire that 'the level of popular support
for unitary districts in England is very low indeed' and that the commission
was 'not in the business of changing for its own sake'.
The commission is also emphasising the potential costs of reorganisation in
its literature. It said annual savings could be as little as Pounds 1m from
the proposed new unitary structures in Lancashire and Surrey, while the
set-up costs could be as high as Pounds 28m and Pounds 44m respectively.
However, some changes seem certain to emerge from the process. These
include:
Unitary status for older cities such as Leicester, Nottingham, Portsmouth
and Southampton, and fast-growing newer cities such as Milton Keynes and
Swindon.
The return, with unitary structures, of some small counties, such as
Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire and Rutland.
Unitary structures for small counties which are easily split, such as
Bedfordshire.
Extension of unitary structure for towns bordering large metropolitan areas
 -such as Slough and Dartford on the edge of London and Warrington near
Greater Manchester.
But the two-tier system now seems set to survive outside major cities,
particularly in large counties which have economies of scale, such as Essex,
Kent, Hampshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire.
Proposals for nine counties will be announced this week: Devon and Essex
today (although proposals for Essex were leaked last week); Durham, and East
and West Sussex tomorrow; Northumberland and Northamptonshire on Wednesday;
and Norfolk and Suffolk on Thursday.
Proposals for the three remaining counties - Cornwall, Hertfordshire and
Shropshire - will be published in September.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Pension restarts to be made easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to make it easier for employers to take back into
occupational pension funds former employees who have chosen to opt out and
buy personal pensions.
Legislation which precludes the transfer of so-called 'protected rights'
into occupational schemes, where the member is not employed by the
contributing employer, is to be amended, Mr William Hague, a junior social
security minister, told parliament in a written answer on Friday.
The changes should allow some people who were badly advised to transfer to a
personal pension, to transfer back into their occupational scheme.
Protected rights are benefits prescribed by law and financed by rebates of
employee and employer national insurance contributions.
Reinstatement will remain at the discretion of the scheme's trustees in the
light of the scheme's rules, Mr Hague said.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Financial services sees jobs upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employment in financial services rose slightly for the first time in almost
four years during the three months to the end of June, according to a survey
published today.
The quarterly CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand financial services survey shows
business in the sector rose over the three-month period, with overall
business at its best level since June 1990.
While business growth is expected to be stronger over the next quarter,
expectations are not as positive as those reported in the last two surveys.
The results also point to a less positive mood generally within retail
financial services compared with other parts of the sector, particularly
those concerned with corporate business.
Both building societies and general insurers, for example, expect employment
to drop over the coming months. Securities traders and ven-ture capitalists
expect marked rises.
Across the sector, business with private individuals increased more slowly
than in the first three months of the year, even though a faster pace had
been expected.
Business with all categories of customer apart from overseas customers is
expected to grow much more quickly in the third quarter.
Mr Angus Hislop, financial services partner at Coopers, said that the
general optimism of the survey was tempered by the tougher environment faced
by building societies and life insurance companies in particular, for
example through the lack of a significant recovery in the housing market.
With most of the easier cost reductions having been made already, he
expected there to be greater interest in acquisitions than had been seen for
a long time as organisations looked for improvements in growth.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, CBI economics associate director, said that although the
increase in business had been less than expected once again, the survey
showed that the upturn in financial services remained firmly established.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Nuclear talks upset by death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung has suddenly complicated
efforts to resolve the dispute over international inspections of the North's
nuclear facilities.
Mr Kim died just as the US began negotiations with North Korean officials on
Friday in Geneva in what was regarded as a significant round of discussions
to break the impasse. His death also came shortly before he was scheduled to
meet South Korean President Kim Young-sam in an unprecedented summit on July
25 in Pyongyang to discuss the nuclear question.
Both the US-North Korean talks and the Korean summit have been indefinitely
postponed.
Meanwhile, the Group of Seven and Russian leaders in Naples yesterday urged
North Korea to ensure 'total transparency' for its nuclear programme and
also to go ahead with its proposed dialogue with South Korea and the US,
despite the death of its leader.
The Naples summit communique told the authorities in Pyongyang to 'remove,
once and for all, the suspicions surrounding their nuclear activities' by
complying with their international obligations.
North Korean officials had indicated stress related to tensions over the
nuclear issue in recent weeks may have contributed to Mr Kim's heart
failure.
South Korea said yesterday it has not yet heard from the North whether it
wants to hold the summit, although US President Bill Clinton said in Naples
that Pyongyang indicated to Washington that it plans to proceed with the
meeting at a later date.
Officials in Seoul expressed optimism that North Korea might take advantage
of Mr Kim's death to improve relations with the US rapidly in the hope that
it will help stabilise the new Pyongyang government of Mr Kim Jong-il, the
late president's son and designated successor. They added that a Korean
summit is unlikely to occur until the transfer of power to Mr Kim has been
completed.
The junior Mr Kim took public responsibility last year for threatening to
withdraw North Korea from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in a step
that triggered the dispute.
Some South Korean officials believe, however, that Mr Kim and his father may
have deliberately provoked the crisis as a ploy to force US to the
negotiating table and offer diplomatic recognition to Pyongyang in exchange
for full nuclear inspections.
Another hopeful sign is that North Korea is continuing to allow inspectors
from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor nuclear activity at
its Yongbyon facilities.
The late president recently agreed to suspend the North's nuclear operations
in exchange for the new round of talks with the US on possible diplomatic
recognition and economic aid from Washington. After the first session of
US-North Korean talks on Friday, both sides described the discussions as
'very useful and productive'.
An adviser to President Boris Yeltsin said Russia's main concern was that
there be no instability in North Korea. He welcomed reports that the
situation there remained calm and voiced the hope that the US-North Korean
dialogue would be soon resumed.
Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, said if Pyongyang complied
with international demands over its nuclear programme, the US would welcome
a chance to meet the new North Korean leader. He said that Kim Jong-il is
the likely successor, although nothing could be taken for granted.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Beijing hails 'close comrade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the importance Beijing attaches to its relations with
North Korea that China marked Kim Il-sung's passing with a 'personal'
message from Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, and official
condolences from the three most senior members of the Chinese communist
party.
Mr Deng, 89, hailed the North Korean dictator as a 'great leader' and a
'close comrade in arms'. This is high praise from a leader whose own efforts
in the modernisation of China's economy stand in such stark contrast to the
ideology of juche, the self-reliance that has kept North Korea isolated and
impoverished.
Mr Deng sent a telegram to the Workers' Party of Korea central committee
saying he was 'shocked and deeply grieved' to learn of the death: 'The life
of Comrade Kim Il-sung was one devoted to the national liberation of Korea
and the happiness of the Korean people, and one dedicated to the forging and
development of Sino-Korean friendship.'
To Mr Deng's condolences were added those of Mr Jiang Zemin, state
president, Mr Li Peng, prime minister, and Mr Qiao Shi, head of the National
People's Congress, presented under joint authorship.
Political specialists at western embassies in Beijing played down the
political significance of the lavish coverage, saying it was a matter of
conforming to protocol and protecting China's long and sometimes strained
alliance with North Korea.
'China doesn't want North Korea to feel alarmingly isolated, especially in
the middle of the talks about nuclear arms. So it sent a reassuring message.
And there is probably some genuine compassion by Deng and the old Chinese
leaders for a fellow Marxist revolutionary,' one diplomat said.
However, it is unclear how much influence Beijing has over Kim Jong-il,
expected to be the new leader. The younger Kim cancelled a visit to Beijing
in March last year when China refused to arrange meetings for him with
senior leaders.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Kim Il-sung: war hero, skilled politician and tyrant: A look
at the career of the 'Great Leader' who exploited North Koreans' xenophobia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of 82-year-old North Korean President Kim Il-sung ends the longest
rule of any political leader in the 20th century. His durability was based
not only on the brute force of the authoritarian regime that he created, but
also reflected his consummate political skills.
Mr Kim's strength rested on his ability to appeal to Korea's strong national
pride and his rule was deeply-rooted in Korean tradition. His policy of
juche (self-reliance), which gradually replaced Communism as North Korea's
main ideology, was based on Korean resentment against centuries of foreign
intervention.
In his 46 years as leader, he manipulated Confucian principles of filial
piety to promote his own role as Great Leader and to establish a dynastic
succession for his son, Mr Kim Jong-il.
But Mr Kim's passing is likely to prove it was the power of his personality,
bolstered by mass adoration expressed in semi-religious public ceremonies,
that was the glue that held North Korea together.
His absence will expose more clearly the faults of his policy of xenophobic
nationalism, which carries with it the seeds of North Korea's own
destruction. His efforts to create a self-sufficient Korea have taken a
heavy toll on the economy, apparently heading toward collapse.
Mr Kim's nationalist attitudes were formed in his youth under Japanese
colonial rule. He was born as Kim Song-ju on April 15, 1912, two years after
Korea was annexed by Japan. His family moved when he was seven from his
birthplace near Pyongyang to Manchuria, northern China, where he became
involved in Communist organisations in his late teens.
Mr Kim became a genuine hero of the Korean independence movement, commanding
units ranging from a handful of soldiers to 300-man forces within Manchuria
and along the Korean border. But by 1941, Japanese military pressure forced
him to withdraw to the Soviet far east.
He used his Soviet military contacts to gain a leadership position in North
Korea Communist party by December 1945 and two months later was chairman of
the North Korean provisional government.
Mr Kim introduced popular measures in late 1940s including land reform and
nationalisation of the mostly Japanese-owned industry. He become the prime
minister of North Korea when the country was officially established in
September 1948 and chairman of the ruling Korean Workers' Party a year
later, securing a dominant political position.
His main goal was then to reunite North and South Korea. He deftly played
off the Soviet Union against China to gain the support of both for an
invasion of the South. The gamble seemed reasonable, as the southern
military was weak and ill-equipped, while the US had indicated it would not
come to Seoul's defence.
But the gamble failed disasterously after the US decided to intervene in its
first main armed confrontation with the Communist bloc.
With the end of the Korean war in 1953, Mr Kim embarked on a Stalinist
policy of forced agricultural collectivisation and creation of heavy
industry. The programme relied heavily on Soviet economic aid, including
supply of plant facilities and machinery, but it initially provided the
North with faster growth than the South.
A critical turning point came with the Sino-Soviet split in 1961 and the
Soviet retreat in the Cuban missile crisis a year later. Both events
convinced Mr Kim he could not rely on either Beijing or Moscow for his and
North Korea's survival.
He began constructing a fortress state that would increasingly divert
massive resources from the rest of the economy. He built a domestic arms
industry and created one of the largest armies in the world. It was during
this period that North Korea laid the foundation for a nuclear weapons
programme that would fruition almost 30 years later.
By the early 1970s, North Korea was losing its economic race with the South,
which had embarked on its own military-led industrialisation programme in
the early 1960s. Pyongyang made one last effort to import western technology
to replace outdated Soviet and Chinese machinery, but subsequently defaulted
on international bank loans used to buy the equipment.
This was accompanied by political repression, with an estimated 100,000
persons being placed in prison camps. North Korean terrorist activities also
multiplied.
But in the late 1980s, North Korea began tentative moves to open itself to
the outside world. in 1990 it joined the UN and the prime ministers of the
two Koreas began meeting regularly. Progress was capped by the signing of
non-aggression and non-nuclear pacts with the South in late 1991.
The North's gradual opening was forced by the collapse of Soviet bloc, which
deprived Pyongyang of important export markets and source of vital oil and
food imports. The economy began shrinking at an annual rate of 5 per cent
after 1989.
North Korea's threat last year to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation
was regarded as an attempt to win Western concessions and Mr Kim appeared to
be achieving his goal of gaining US support when he died.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Sweden win as Romania pay heavy penalty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli clinched a place for his team in the World
Cup semi-finals for the first time in 36 years by saving two penalties in
the sudden-death shoot-out after a see-saw game that left the sides tied 2-2
after extra time.
Brolin gave Sweden the lead after a well-worked free-kick in the 79th
minute, but Raducioiu kept Romania in the tournament with an 89th minute
equaliser against the run of play, then scored a second goal during the
first period of extra time.
Kennet Andersson put the Swedes back on terms by making the score 2-2 in the
115th minute.
The penalty shoot-out moved into sudden death after five kicks for each side
failed to break the tie.
Each team missed one shot to leave them level at 4-4.
Dumitrescu for Romania and Larsson for Sweden scored the next two before
Ravelli turned his 115th national team appearance - which tied a Swedish
record - into a triumph.
He dived for a one-handed save on a hesitant kick by Romanian defender
Belodedici to set up a clash with Brazil - a rematch of a first-round game
that ended 1-1.
As the Swedish players leapt for joy at the end of the shoot-out, Romania's
players sat motionless in the centre circle, reliving the heartbreak of four
years ago when they were knocked out of the World Cup on penalties by
Ireland in Genoa.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilian flair and Italian fortune win the
day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<TEXT>
Nobody will ever remember the first half of Brazil vs Holland in the World
Cup quarter-finals on Saturday. Few will ever forget the second.
It went 1-0 and then 2-0 to Brazil, then 2-1 and 2-2 as the Dutch
miraculously rallied, only for Branco, the mid-fielder, to step into an 80th
minute free kick from 30 yards and bury it off de Goey's left-hand post so
that Brazil won 3-2.
It was not only the goals. The second half saw soccer at its very best, with
skill, passion and controversy of an order that deserves to be corked and
bottled by the million cases, to be opened whenever the sport goes dull as a
reminder of how it can be played.
Romario and Bebeto were the catalysts. The twin Brazilian strikers came out
after half-time determined to take the match by the scruff of the neck, and
did so. Twice in the first three minutes Romario went close, and after 51
minutes he put Brazil ahead.
It was Bebeto, inevitably, who set it up, released at top speed by Dunga's
through ball into the area. His left-foot cross bounced awkwardly for
Romario though not too awkwardly for a reflex half-volley from 10 yards that
no goalkeeper could have touched.
Brazil were rampant now and it was Romario, at a walk, who was the vital
ingredient in Bebeto's 61st-minute goal. Romario was strolling back,
unconcerned and indisputably offside, when Bebeto latched on to a headed
ball from the Brazilian half, broke one tackle, rounded de Goey and tapped
the ball home. The Dutch stood still, waiting for the flag against Romario.
But, after consultation, the referee and linesman stuck to the new letter of
the law - that the Brazilian had been 'passive' to the play in progress.
Brazil then relaxed, almost fatally. Two minutes later, a throw-in from the
left saw Bergkamp surviving one half-hearted challenge and beating Taffarel
in the Brazilian goal from close range with a hard right-foot shot.
Taffarel was under the gun now, first from Jonk, then from Winter. Yet he
seemed asleep in the 75th minute, rooted to his line as Winter rose to an
Overmars corner and headed home the equaliser from no more than six yards.
Now it was Brazil's turn to show mettle. Branco, in mid-field, unleashed a
35-yard range-finder that de Goey touched over. Satisfied, when the free
kick came moments later, following the only foul that could be described as
remotely dirty, he completed the scoring.
Saturday's other quarter-final, in which Italy beat Spain 2-1, indicated why
Italy may win next Sunday's final: not because they are the best team but
because they have a winning formula. It works like this. Play like drains;
be savagely criticised back home for performance; and allow one or other
Baggio to score the necessary minimum of goals.
Spain controlled most of the game and rarely used their fleetness while
Italy, competent defence apart, showed all the inspiration of soggy,
over-cooked penne.
But the Italian defence held, and the Baggios did their bit. In the 26th
minute, Dino, the game-winner against Norway, found himself with a bit of
room 25 yards out and bent an out-swinger past Zubizarreta in the Spanish
goal.
Spain drew level after 58 minutes on a deflected shot from Caminero and
proceeded to dominate. More than that, Salinas, a second-half substitute,
should have disposed of the increasingly tired Italians after 82 minutes
when set free alone in front of Pagliuca 10 yards out. He mis-kicked
embarrassingly.
That set the stage for Roberto Baggio. Previously, an early blocked shot
excepted, he had been a mostly marginal performer. After 87 minutes, an
instinctive flick from Signori, only introduced after the break, set him
loose on the right of the area. Baggio deftly rounded Zubizarreta and
right-footed it under the covering Abelarde from an acute angle.
Spain, a quietly impressive team throughout the tournament, with as many
goals (nine before Saturday) as anyone, must wonder why they lost a match
they played well enough to win.
For the Azzurri, these days, it matters less how they play than how it turns
out. And history is on their side. In 1982, in Spain, their early matches
were also undistinguished, but then Paolo Rossi got untracked. Two Baggios
may yet equal one Rossi.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Germany sunk by four minutes of Bulgarian
inspiration - A look at the weekend's action which decided the tournament's
semi-finalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<TEXT>
This was definitely not supposed to happen. On a clear blue New Jersey day,
Bulgaria sandbagged Germany, inflicting a 2-1 defeat on the defending World
Cup champions.
There was no luck about it. Down one to a Matthaus penalty early in the
second half, two moments of unadulterated inspiration in the span of four
minutes by Stoichkov and Letchkov, merely the brightest stars in a whole
Bulgarian galaxy yesterday, turned the match.
In the 75th minute, with Mikhailov's goalpost at the other end still
shivering from a mighty strike by Moller, Stoichkov was brought down about
25 yards out by the same player.
If he made a meal out of the foul, Stoichkov confected a banquet out of the
free kick. It was exquisitely weighted - not too hard, not too soft, nor too
high as an earlier effort from the same vicinity had been. It cleared the
leaping wall by inches before sailing just inside the angle of the crossbar
and Illgner's left-hand post. The German goalkeeper never moved a muscle.
But he was flying through the air four minutes later, though to no avail.
There did not seen much danger in Iankov's cross from the right, not with
Kohler patrolling the middle of the area. But Letchkov somehow leaped above
and around Kohler and the ball rocketed off his bald pate into the top right
corner.
This was fitting justice for Letchkov, who had played so well throughout,
almost floating out of German tackles in mid-field and nudging his
team-mates on. For it was he who was adjudged to have fouled Klinsmann after
47 minutes.
It looked a 50-50 call. Wagner's cross bounced high across the Bulgarian
area. Klinsmann touched it on but it still bounced high and he and Letchkov
went for it, feet up. But the German striker is the Olivier of the World Cup
and as contact was made he crumpled in true style.
Mikhailov, who had saved three penalties in the shoot-out against Mexico,
went to his right while Matthaus - making a record-equalling 21st appearance
in a World Cup finals game, joining his countryman Uwe Seeler, Wladislaw
Zmuda of Poland and Argentina's Diego Maradona - chose the other corner,
decisively.
That might have been it - and surely would have been if Moller's 73rd minute
cracker from a pass by Hassler had not hammered against the post. Rudi
Voller put in the rebound but was ruled offside.
But Bulgaria could point to its own bad luck against the woodwork in the
12th minute from Balakov, working off a lovely laid back pass from
Stoichkov. And for each fine Mikhailov save - the 52nd minute one from
Hassler was exceptional - Illgner was under comparable pressure
The whole match, sharply contested (eight yellow cards), featured
parry-and-thrust beyond number. Bulgaria had a wonderful purple patch about
one third the way through the first half, while Germany's best was the
opening 20 minutes of the second.
Letchkov was especially fine, but so, inevitably, was Stoichkov, removed
after 83 minutes in a sharp move by Dimitar Penev, the coach, after
Stoichkov received one yellow card for protesting too much and threatened to
get another. Kostadinov, Sirakov and Balakov all shone and the defence was
solid.
Ironically, Hamburg mid-fielder Letchkov, who was 27 yesterday, is the only
German-based player in the Bulgarian squad.
For Germany, Hassler and Moller were indefatigable, but Klinsmann and Voller
never clicked as they had against Belgium. Matthaus, again, rarely came
forward until it was very late, too late in fact. If the Germans were
complacent it was understandable. The only time in 13 matches that a West
German side lost to Bulgaria was in 1960 (coincidentally also by 2-1), and
though the Bulgarian record against East Germany was even it had never
beaten a unified team, either before the last war or since the two Germanies
came together.
When the tiny knot of Bulgarian supporters in a crowd of 72,000 heard the
final whistle they made the sort of noise that compensated for all those
lost years.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Salenko still leads goal chase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oleg Salenko still tops the World Cup scoring race though he hasn't had a
chance to add to his tally: Russia bowed out after the first round. To
overtake him, someone has to crack a six-goal barrier that has not been
broken in 20 years.
Salenko, 24, netted five goals - a World Cup record for a single game - in
Russia's 6-1 rout of Cameroon on June 28. Then he and his team went home.
Possessing the top scorer was not enough to win the World Cup trophy at the
last two tournaments, where the leading marksmen were Italy's Toto Schillaci
(1990) and England's Gary Lineker (1986).
But Paolo Rossi scored most goals when Italy won the championship in 1982,
as did Mario Kempes when Argentina won in 1978.
Grzegorz Lato's seven goals for Poland in 1974 was the last six-plus total.
Just Fontaine's 13 goals for France have stood as all-time high since 1958.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Protocol guides move quietly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Among thousands of World Cup volunteers, there is a select group that says
it is better to be seen than heard. World Cup 'protocol ambassadors' move
quietly among groups of foreign politicians and diplomats who are visiting
the US to watch their countries play soccer.
'It is a heady responsibility,' says Marianne Ward, chief of protocol for
the World Cup venue at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 'The
protocol ambassador may be the closest that these dignitaries come to an
everyday American.'
Protocol ambassadors are at each of the nine World Cup sites. They are
responsible for meeting foreign VIPs at airports and guiding them through
their visit.
Sam Destito, a lawyer, said he became a protocol ambassador because he felt
the world was issuing a challenge to America. 'I don't think the rest of the
world thought America could handle the responsibility of the World Cup
games,' Destito said. 'Now visitors compliment me on our country's ability.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Bulgaria come from behind to knock out
Germany 2-1
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Outsiders Bulgaria struck twice within three minutes in the second half to
send defending champions Germany crashing out of the World Cup at Giants
Stadium in New Jersey yesterday.
Goals by Stoichkov and Letchkov ended Germany's reign to put Bulgaria into
the semi-finals for the first time.
German captain Lothar Matthaus, making a record-equalling 21st appearance in
a World Cup finals game - joining his countryman Uwe Seeler, Wladislaw Zmuda
of Poland and Argentina's Diego Maradona - fired the Germans ahead from the
penalty spot in the 49th minute after strikers Klinsmann and Voller had both
been brought down.
Bulgaria then seized the initiative and Stoichkov curled in a free kick in
the 76th minute to bring the teams level. Three minutes later Letchkov - who
had been at fault for the German penalty - scored the winner with a
spectacular diving header.
Iankov lofted a center from the right and Letchkov dived for it with
Hassler, got there first and directed a well-placed header between the
diving German goalkeeper Illgner and the right-hand post.
Ironically, Hamburg mid-fielder Letchkov, who was 27 yesterday, is the only
German-based player in the Bulgarian squad.
It was sweet revenge for Bulgarian coach Dimitar Penev, whose team have also
beaten the other 1990 finalist, Argentina. Penev played against German coach
Berti Vogts in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, when West Germany beat Bulgaria
5-2.
Bulgaria, who last beat then West Germany in 1960 and who had not won a
World Cup game in five previous visits to the finals, now meet three-time
champions Italy in the semi-finals, also at Giants Stadium, on Wednesday.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Weightless love for spacefish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent at Cape Canaveral
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are 'astronewts' in space. They were launched, on Friday, aboard the
US space shuttle Columbia.
But in a mission loaded with 126 jellyfish, 11,200 baby sea urchin, 144 newt
eggs, 180 toad eggs and 340 fish eggs, all eyes are going to be on just four
Japanese Medaka fish.
For these orange, one-inch-long, freshwater fish may be about to provide
some answers, not just on sex in space, but on food in space too: solving
two thorny issues for manned space exploration ahead of the construction in
orbit of a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.7bn) international space station.
Due to begin in 1997, the space station should be completed by June 2002, if
governments maintain their funding commitments. The Medaka fish experiment
is aimed at developing fish breeding technology to provide the space station
astronauts with a source of high-protein food.
Scientists first tried to get rats to conceive in space, but they bounced
off one another in a zero gravity environment. However, the tiny Japanese
fish have a peculiar tolerance for weightlessness, unlike most fish, which
swim in wild looping patterns when exposed to microgravity.
They also have a short life cycle, of three months from one generation to
the next, and once fertilised, Medaka eggs hatch within eight days. This
will give the crew the opportunity to watch the fish mate and see their eggs
hatch.
But should the two amorous pairs of Medaka fish find it hard to have sex in
space, the shuttle crew will experiment with the 340 artificially
inseminated Medaka eggs also aboard the Columbia to study embryonic growth
which, some scientists say, could help research into human embryos.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Split over BCCI chief's plea-bargaining: Government wants
co-operation, New York's DA wants a longer jail term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The plea bargain involving Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of the
defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International, accepted in Washington on
Friday, has left the US Justice Department and the New York district
attorney's office at daggers drawn.
The department believes it has secured the most important BCCI conviction so
far in the US and won the co-operation in continuing investigations of the
number two official at the bank. But the district attorney's office believes
Mr Naqvi will be given an unnecessarily light sentence, with little
guarantee that he will be able significantly to advance the BCCI
investigation.
The department may have taken a calculated risk in negotiating a deal with
Mr Naqvi. It hopes his promise to co-operate will help unravel the colossal
fraud at the bank, closed by international regulators three years ago, more
than a long and possibly difficult trial would.
In unveiling the plea bargain, federal lawyers said Mr Naqvi would
co-operate with the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and any other federal or regulatory agency as directed by the US
authorities.
Mr Joseph diGenova, Mr Naqvi's lawyer, told the court his client had already
assisted the US authorities and would continue to co-operate fully,
reviewing and identifying the hundreds of thousands of BCCI documents now in
the US.
Under the deal, Mr Naqvi pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, conspiracy and
racketeering. Sentencing, likely to comprise a jail term of 6-8 1/2 years
after taking into account almost three years Mr Naqvi spent in custody in
Abu Dhabi, is due in October.
However, even before the deal was presented in court it came under fierce
attack from Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, whose
office has aggressively pursued the BCCI investigation for five years.
Mr Morgenthau wrote to the court on July 5 complaining that the sentence
called for in the plea bargain was too light and urging a jail sentence of
17 1/2 years or more. 'The defendant's crime was a long-term, calculated
crime of treachery,' the letter said.
But the objections of the district attorney's office run deeper. 'Where I
come from you plea-bargain with the little fish to get the big guy, not with
Naqvi to get the little guys,' said one official. He was sceptical about the
extent of Mr Naqvi's past and future co-operation with the US authorities.
Mr Naqvi pleaded guilty to defrauding US regulators and to engaging in a
conspiracy with Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder, secretly to control
four US banks, including Washington-based First American Bankshares.
But according to Mr Morgenthau's office, these charges ignore the true
scandal at the heart of the BCCI case - that it was a huge international
conspiracy to defraud the public. New York officials say they will pursue
charges against Mr Naqvi at state level and have expressed their
determination that he should 'serve time in New York' for his crimes.
However, Mr Naqvi's defence team is likely to argue that the New York
indictment involves charges covered in the plea bargain and runs counter to
the 'double jeopardy' clauses of the US constitution.
As far as the Justice Department is concerned, the hostile reaction from New
York is just sour grapes and the plea agreement and the proposed sentence
are fair.
In its submission to the court the department cited fears of a long and
expensive trial as one of the reasons for taking the plea-bargain route. Mr
diGenova reinforced that argument by saying that had his client come to
trial he would have challenged every document brought in evidence and the
reliability of key witnesses.
Department officials also point to the difficulties Mr Morgenthau's office
experienced in its case against Mr Clark Clifford, former US defence
secretary, and his law partner Mr Robert Altman, whom it accused of
conspiring with BCCI in the takeover of First American Bankshares.
Mr Altman was acquitted last year and charges against Mr Clifford were
dropped because of his ill health.
While the US authorities question Mr Naqvi behind closed doors, and Mr
Morgenthau tries to push him into open court, there is another court
proceeding which could throw light on the mechanics of the BCCI scandal.
In June, three former BCCI non-executive directors filed suit in the US
against Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, seeking Dollars 100m
(Pounds 65.7m) damages for the harm done to their reputations by the bank's
collapse.
Lawyers for the three are seeking access to the BCCI documents in the US,
claiming they will give a much fuller account of the fraud than has so far
emerged and throw light on the role of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nayhan,
the ruler of Abu Dhabi.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Italy ride luck and history to see off Spain
 -For the Azzurri, results are mattering more than how they are playing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The way things are going, Italy will win this World Cup: not because the
Azzurri are the best team - charitably, on current form, they would barely
scrape into the top 10 of the 24 who qualified - but because they have a
winning formula.
It works like this. Play like drains; be savagely criticised back home for
performance; and allow one or other Baggio to score the necessary minimum of
goals.
It worked against Spain in the quarter-finals on Saturday, as it had against
Norway and Nigeria. For much of the match, the presumed contest between
Italian offence and Spanish defence leavened by speedy counter-attack never
materialised.
Spain controlled most of the game and rarely used their fleetness while
Italy, competent defence apart, showed all the inspiration of soggy,
over-cooked penne.
But the Italian defence held - tenuously - and the Baggios did their bit. In
the 26th minute, Dino, the game-winner against Norway, found himself with a
bit of room 25 yards out and bent a right-footed out-swinger past
Zubizarreta in the Spanish goal. Roberto's fake run across the middle may
have momentarily screened the Spaniard from a clear view.
Spain drew level after 58 minutes on a deflected shot from Caminero and
proceeded to dominate. More than that, Salinas, a second-half substitute,
should have disposed of the increasingly tired Italians after 82 minutes
when set free alone in front of Pagliuca 10 yards out. He mis-kicked
embarrassingly.
That set the stage for Roberto Baggio; previously, an early blocked shot
excepted, he had been a mostly marginal performer. After 87 minutes, an
instinctive flick from Signori, only introduced after the break, set him
loose on the right of the area. Checking the scoreboard clock for dramatic
effect - his equaliser against Nigeria came a minute later - Baggio deftly
rounded Zubizarreta and right-footed it under the covering Abelarde from an
acute angle.
Spain, quietly impressive throughout the tournament, with as many goals
(nine before Saturday) as anyone, must wonder why they lost a match they
played well enough to win. There was less down the flanks than in previous
matches from Ferrer and Sergi, who was withdrawn after an hour and less than
a minute after helping to set up Caminero's goal. But otherwise few feet
were put wrong, and particularly not Caminero's.
The answer can only lie in history and familiarity. Spain have never gone
beyond the quarter-finals, and 16 of the players on the pitch on Saturday
had taken part in the European Cup final not so long ago between AC Milan
and Barcelona. AC's 4-0 victory was a lot more convincing than Italy's 2-1,
but the result was the same.
For the Azzurri, these days, it matters less how they play the game than how
it turns out. And history is on their side. In 1982, in Spain no less, their
early matches were also undistinguished, but then Paolo Rossi got untracked.
Two Baggios may yet equal one Rossi.

FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Flashes of beauty mark Brazil's triumph - The
three-time champions hold off an exciting Dutch fight-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<TEXT>
Nobody will ever remember the first half of Brazil vs Holland in the World
Cup quarter-finals in Dallas on Saturday. Few will ever forget the second.
It went 1-0 and then 2-0 to Brazil, then 2-1 and 2-2 as the Dutch
miraculously rallied, only for Branco, the mid-fielder, to step into an 80th
minute free kick from 30 yards and bury it, conclusively, off de Goey's
left-hand post.
It was not only the goals. The second half saw soccer at its very best, with
skill, passion and controversy of an order that deserves to be corked and
bottled by the million cases, to be opened whenever the sport goes dull as a
reminder of how it can be played.
After the team's disappointing second-round performance against the US last
Monday (Brazil won 1-0), many Brazilians feared a loss against Holland. And
many still think Brazil are not playing as well as they should.
Despite the team's unbeaten record, Brazilians sports writers had condemned
what they called 'ugly and artless' soccer and manager Carlos Alberto
Parreira was singled out for criticism.
But on Saturday, Romario and Bebeto were the catalysts. The twin Brazilian
strikers came out after half-time determined to take the match by the scruff
of the neck - and did so. Twice in the first three minutes Romario went
close, and after 51 minutes he put Brazil ahead.
It was Bebeto, inevitably, who set it up, released at top speed by Dunga's
through ball into the area. His left-foot cross was without flaw but, even
so, bounced awkwardly for Romario - though not too awkwardly for a reflex
right-foot half-volley from 10 yards that no goalkeeper could have touched.
Brazil were rampant now, Bebeto hitting the post and Romario foiled by de
Goey, running past Dutchmen as if they were lamp-posts. But it was Romario
at a walk who was the vital ingredient in Bebeto's 61st-minute goal.
Romario was strolling back, unconcerned and indisputably offside, from the
Dutch area when Bebeto latched on to a headed ball from the Brazilian half,
broke one tackle, rounded de Goey and tapped the ball home. The Dutch stood
still, waiting for the flag against Romario, but, after consultation, the
referee and linesman stuck to the new letter of the law - that the Brazilian
had been 'passive' to the play in progress.
Brazil then relaxed, almost fatally. Two minutes later, a throw-in from the
left saw Bergkamp surviving one half-hearted challenge and beating Taffarel
in the Brazilian goal from close range with a hard right-foot shot.
Taffarel had lasted the equivalent of more than three matches without having
to save a direct shot, but he was under the gun now, first from Jonk, then
from Winter. Yet Taffarel seemed asleep in the 75th minute, rooted to his
line as Winter rose to an Overmars corner and headed home the equaliser from
no more than six yards.
Now it was Brazil's turn to show mettle. Branco, in for Rai in mid-field,
immediately unleashed a 35-yard range-finder that de Goey touched over.
Satisfied, when the free kick came moments later - following the only foul
that could be described as remotely dirty - he completed the scoring.
That finally took some of the stuffing out of the Dutch. Manfully though
they tried in the closing minutes, forcing some un-Brazilian punts into the
crowd and unoccupied corners of the pitch, they created no more clear
chances.
But it was no disgrace to lose this one. There may have been moments when
Romario and Bebeto ran five yards before their markers moved one foot, but
the Dutch defence mostly compensated and covered. Koeman unleashed some
thunderbolts, blocked by Brazilians who will know it on the morrow, and
Bergkamp and Overmars showed that the Brazilian defence is far from
invincible.
Yet nobody has found a way to keep Romario and Bebeto quiet. A ball and
chain might help.

FT  11 JUL 94 / International Press Review: No fire behind smoke - South
Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a week in which the South Africa's press were unable to discover just
what were the 'personal reasons' that lay behind finance minister Derek
Keys' unexpected departure on Tuesday, there were several other fascinating
but unanswered questions.
How would President Nelson Mandela placate Mrs Marike de Klerk, the former
president's wife, whose fury at being forced to move from Libertas, the
official presidential residence in Pretoria, was disclosed by the Afrikaans
daily, Beeld?
Could Mr F W de Klerk's eviction have anything to do with the disappearance
of Dinky, the family dog, whose plight was reported in the Pretoria News?
And could the Springboks rugby team recover from their defeat against the
All Blacks? the Sunday Tribune asked.
However, for several days, a single question was uppermost for all papers:
Why did Mr Keys resign?
After much speculation, South Africa's press shared the conclusion of the
Weekly Mail, the independent paper. 'Keys: no fire behind the smoke'.
Shaun Johnson, deputy editor of The Star, the city's afternoon paper, put
the best face on the affair: Keys 'did the most difficult of things,
quitting while he was right on top . . . the retrospective portrait will be
one of unflamboyant glory,' he wrote in his weekly column.
He would be known as the man who laid down a solid economic foundation for a
new government, 'his reputation unsullied by the worst excesses of bygone
National party cabinets and untarnished by the inevitable failings of the
African National Congress controlled one'.
Keys established a psychological precedent, wrote Johnson, selling to the
middle classes 'the concept of a tax surcharge' - a reference to the
budget's 5 per cent levy on higher-bracket tax payers.
No such generous treatment from The Citizen, whose editor Johnnie Johnstone
has managed to pay generous tribute to President Mandela while maintaining a
conservative stance.
Easily the best paper of record, with a large black readership attracted -
according to conventional wisdom - by the paper's comprehensive racing
coverage, the Citizen's midweek editorial spared neither Keys nor
government.
'It's not satisfactory, Mr Keys. You should have stayed on. But as you have
resigned, you owe it to the country to say exactly why.
'As for the government, we think its handling of the matter putrid.'
Johannesburg's Business Day, which had added to the confusion by confidently
reporting that Mr Chris Liebenberg, the successor to Mr Keys, 'had already
attended (cabinet) meetings as finance minister designate', expressed city
sentiment.
The resignation 'presents the government of national unity, still basking in
the afterglow of its remarkable installation, with the most difficult test
it has faced so far', said Wednesday's editorial.
By the end of the week, however, interest had focused on another question:
Who benefitted from insider trading in the hours before the Mr Keys'
resignation became official? asked the Sunday Times.
And one question was never raised. Why did the powerful Congress of South
African of Trade Unions accuse Mr Keys of letting the side down and
'betraying Mandela's trust' by leaving early, instead of saying good
riddance to Mr Keys?
After all, he was the finance minister who advocated fiscal discipline, and
refused to bend to union pleas to extend VAT zero rating to more foods
Maybe in the answer to this question lay the secret of Mr Keys' success.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Hutus struggle to forget the horrors: Few will admit to
having witnessed the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'You understand there are certain things I cannot talk about.' The priest is
standing in the courtyard of a church which dominates the village of
Shangui, in the hills of western Rwanda. A paramilitary policeman hovers in
the background.
In front of him, children are filing obediently into a catechism class. He
avoids the far end of the courtyard, marked by the indelible evidence of a
horrendous crime. Room after room is splattered with blood, blackened by
fire, or shattered by the blasts of hand grenades.
Father Aime Mategeko says he was not present when Hutu militias invaded his
church in late April and hacked 4,000 Tutsis to death. 'I was in another
parish when the troubles began,' he says. 'I do not know who the attackers
were, or how many people they killed.'
He feels uncomfortable with the questions of prying foreigners, which force
him to confront one of the worst crimes against humanity since the Nazi
Holocaust. 'What happened here happened throughout the country,' he
ventures. 'Part of the population felt threatened by the other part and were
forced to defend themselves.'
Father Aime is not alone in offering such tortuous explanations, which
obscure the responsibility of the killers as well as the identity of their
victims.
He will not say where the dead are buried. 'As priests,' he claims, 'we did
everything possible to protect the people, but it was not enough.'
This is a claim disputed by survivors of the Shangui massacre.
'It was only thanks to the intervention of Franciscan nuns that 420 of us
survived,' says an ageing Tutsi who escaped to a Red Cross refugee camp near
Rwanda's border with Zaire.
Throughout the country, the Hutu community, the largest of Rwanda's two
ethnic groups, is engaged in a process of collective amnesia.
Hutus cannot deny knowledge of what took place. Evidence of massacres can be
found in almost every village. Yet few Hutus admit to having been present at
the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis that followed the assassination of President
Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6.
Shame weighs so heavily that the word Tutsi, like the race of tall, proud
pastoralists who once ruled over the Hutu majority, has been virtually
erased from the Rwandan vocabulary. Others prefer to describe the massacres
as a popular uprising against those who killed Rwanda's Hutu president.
Ever since Tutsi exiles launched a guerrilla war against the Habyarimana
dictatorship in 1990, the Tutsi menace has been a cornerstone of government
propaganda.
Despite the lack of evidence, Habyarimana's supporters did not hesitate to
blame the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) for shooting down the
president's aircraft. Over the government airwaves, Hutus were incited to
take revenge.
The propaganda became more strident as the rebels gained military ground.
Government radio broadcast reports of atrocities allegedly committed by the
RPF were used to blur the distinction between Tutsi fighters and civilians
and to justify their indiscriminate slaughter. There is even evidence to
suggest the genocide was planned.
Tutsi survivors speak of government officials visiting churches and stadiums
with lists of people to be executed. The first victims were educated or
wealthy Tutsis and Hutu opponents of the Habyarimana regime.
'The extermination of Tutsis was so radical, so systematic, I have no doubt
it was prepared by the Hutu extremists in the government and army,' says a
Tutsi priest whose life was spared. 'Habyarimana's death was just a pretext
to begin the massacres.'
Among the Hutu militia, who call themselves Interahamwe ('those who attack
together'), there are those who do not regret killing neighbours, friends
and children. 'You must understand that Paul Kagame (the RPF military
commander) left Rwanda when he was two years old,' explains a young militia
on the road to Shangui. 'If we allowed Tutsi children to escape, they would
return to attack us a few years from now.'
Most Hutus blame the Tutsis for their own fate. If the RPF had not invaded
Rwanda, they say, the killings would not have taken place. Hutus believe
Tutsis have been guilty of massacres in rebel-held areas. They say Tutsis
have hidden the corpses in pits 60 metres deep to conceal the evidence of
their crimes. Such beliefs are essential in a society guilty of genocide,
and few are able to distinguish the fact from the fiction.
In the Bisesero hills, overlooking Lake Kivu, Hutu villagers are terrified
of the gunfire that echoes in the distance. They say Tutsi rebels have
infiltrated this government-held zone and claim many Hutus have been killed.
Less than two miles away, small groups of emaciated and badly wounded Tutsis
stumble on to the mountain road like an apparition from hell. For the past
three months they have been hiding in the woods by day and scavenging for
food at night as the army and militia hunted them down like animals. These
were the shots the Hutu villagers heard. When French soldiers arrive to
protect the Tutsi survivors, they train their guns on Hutu militias who can
be seen on the next mountain ridge.
Soon, however, Hutus may also become victims of Rwanda's reign of terror.
'When the war ends,' says a university lecturer, 'we fear that the Hutus who
have killed will turn on those of us who have not killed because we know the
truth of what happened.'
Those who breach the conspiracy of silence receive death threats. Few
believe those who instigated the genocide will be brought to trial. The few
thousand Tutsis who survive in French-guarded refugee camps say they will
only feel safe when they are granted asylum in another country. They cannot
envisage the day when Hutu and Tutsi will live together again.
For the Tutsi rebels, currently poised to win the civil war, the victory
looks set to be a hollow one.

Mr William Gray, President Bill Clinton's adviser on Haiti, yesterday said
resolution of the republic's crisis had now become 'a vital interest' to the
peace and stability of the western hemisphere.
In an interview on ABC TV, Mr Gray gave a firm warning that the military
dictatorship - from which 10,000 Haitians fled last week - would not be
allowed to remain in power.
To allow the return of a dictatorship in the 1990s 'sends the kind of signal
to potential dictatorships in our hemisphere that cannot be tolerated
because of the instability that it would cause', he said.
Administration officials interviewed yesterday had much the same message to
deliver. Mr Gray, Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Leon
Panetta, White House chief of staff, stressed the endorsement of US policy
towards Haiti at the G7 summit, and US efforts to work with the United
Nations, and the Organisation of American States.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Israeli settlers yield to army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of militant Jewish settlers yesterday agreed to a compromise aimed
at averting a showdown with Israeli soldiers over protesters occupying flats
in the West Bank. Their conciliatory move came soon after the government
sent in hundreds of troops ready to evict the protesters with force.
The Israeli government meanwhile ordered the Gaza Strip - now under
Palestinian administration - to be sealed off from early today. The order,
depriving thousands of Palestinian labourers entry into Israel for at least
24 hours, follows clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians at a
border checkpoint.
Both moves came as Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, made further preparations
for his permanent homecoming. He is due to attend a formal farewell ceremony
in Tunis today.
Faced with an imminent clash with troops, radical leaders of Jewish settlers
promised to try to persuade protesters to move out today from the
government-built flats they have been occupying since Friday near the Kiryat
Arba Jewish settlement.
But they said it would take all their powers of persuasion to influence the
protesters, demonstrating against Israel's peace moves and the killing of a
Jewish girl by an Arab gunman. The settlers, including women and children,
have taken over vacant flats in a street peopled by Palestinians.
The despatch of soldiers to the settlement raised the prospect of the first
armed showdown with extremist Jewish settlers. If the troops force
evictions, this would signal to Jewish settlers and the PLO that the
government is prepared to take on settlers in a struggle which both sides
say is a potential 'time-bomb' in the peace process.
Mr David Libai, justice minister, said after a cabinet meeting yesterday
that the 15 families who had occupied the buildings would have to leave or
be forcibly removed. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the
settlers were a danger to democracy.
Kiryat Arba settler leaders at first warned that any use of force could end
in bloodshed. Later they agreed to talks with President Ezer Weizman to try
to avert a clash.
The Israelis said Gaza was being sealed off so that the army could
re-organise procedures for Palestinians to cross into Israel at the Erez
checkpoint. They said two Israeli officers and a soldier were injured when
several thousand Palestinians trying to enter Israel stormed the checkpoint.

endorsement of US policy towards Haiti by the industrialised countries at
the G7 summit, and US efforts to work with the United Nations, Organisation
of American States and other Caribbean countries.
Criticism of the policy's many incarnations, and the impact of sanctions on
the poor, was met with scathing indictments of the 'illegal' regime in
Haiti.
Mr Gray's line was the toughest. He seemed to warn the Haitian military that
its future rested on removal of the current leaders.
'Whether or not there is going to be any military in Haiti will depend on
the behaviour of the coup leaders: whether they step down or they push the
international community to ultimate options,' he said.
He bluntly spelt out the US 'vital interest' in removing a regime committing
human rights violations with 'thousands being killed and raped'.

Limited foreign exchange transactions will recommence in Venezuela today
after being suspended by government order for over two weeks, administration
officials said at the weekend.
President Rafael Caldera announced foreign exchange controls on June 27, but
the government and the central bank were unable to agree on final details of
a control scheme until Saturday.
Normal foreign exchange transactions at banks and exchange houses have not
been carried out in Venezuela since June 23, causing problems for importers,
travellers and companies with external debt payments that have come due.
Officials stressed that under the new exchange control scheme, funds would
be available for servicing public and private sector external debt, and for
foreign companies repatriating profits and royalties.
The presidential decree that defines the terms for approving and disbursing
foreign exchange states that private sector external debt will be covered by
the programme. High priority will also be assigned to imports of raw
materials for industry.
There were also press reports that the government intended to fine any local
news media that reported black market exchange rates, although it was
unclear whether this measure would be implemented.
Venezuela's new foreign exchange scheme requires that foreign currency
entering the country, with a few exceptions, should be sold to the central
bank. Commercial banks will handle applications for foreign currency, and
will provide funds to companies and the public.
The government will set a Dollars 500 monthly limit for those who wish to
travel overseas for pleasure, and a Dollars 250 daily limit for business
travel.

France will today step up its quest for an honourable exit from Rwanda with
an appeal by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to the United Nations Security
Council for other countries to replace French troops in the central African
state by the end of this month.
The Security Council gave France the go-ahead on June 22 to send 2,500
troops to try to prevent further massacres of refugees caught up in the
Rwandan civil war, before the arrival of the UN's planned 'Minuar'
peacekeeping force later this summer.
But Mr Balladur said from the outset that he wanted the stop-gap French
force out of Rwanda by July 31. Despite the presence of some Senegalese
troops already in Rwanda and 500 Ghanaian soldiers due next week and of some
Canadians and Australians, there is growing nervousness in France that the
full Minuar force will not be ready in time for France to stick to its
self-imposed deadline.
Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, warned the French Senate last
week that at least some French troops would have to stay on into August.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said at the end of last week that
he had been advised by UN headquarters that the new UN multinational
peacekeeping force would be ready to relieve the French by early August.
Before flying to New York, Mr Balladur said over the weekend that he hoped
to convince aid agencies to do more to help the 900,000 Rwandan refugees
estimated to be in or near the security zone in the south-west of the
country, and to persuade other countries to carry out their commitments to
supply soldiers to the Minuar force.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Peru sets out to woo investors in sell-off plan: The state
is in a tight financial corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's privatisation commission, Copri, is to launch a scheme to attract at
least 100,000 middle-income Peruvians as shareholders this year, and to
cover the unpaid state pension funds due to workers who have converted to
private pensions.
In a series of privatisations of 'low-risk businesses', such as utility
companies, Copri aims to transfer shares worth at least Dollars 300m (Pounds
197m) to small investors, who will be able to buy shares in fixed
instalments, virtually eliminating any financial risk. Investors will pay by
instalments fixed on the day of sale, but if the quoted share price falls,
the state 'guarantees' to charge instalments at the lower price.
The 'citizen participation' scheme also aims to get the state out of a tight
financial corner. A year ago, it backed the establishment of a private
pension fund system, AFPs, but it has been unable to pay the funds owed by
the virtually bankrupt state pension scheme to workers who have switched to
private cover.
Workers may now opt to take all or part of their state pension in the form
of shares in privatised companies. The AFPs will then trade the shares on
behalf of the funds they manage, giving them a long-awaited new instrument.
And Peruvians who have never owned a share in their lives will, the plan's
designers hope, acquire a stock exchange mentality.
'Citizen participation' should provide a boost both for the AFPs and for
Peru's underdeveloped capital markets, says Mr Carlos Montoya, Copri's
general manager. He predicts that the Lima stock exchange's total market
capitalisation will 'rise between two and three times' from its current
Dollars 6bn with the public offerings via privatisations due in coming
months.
The programme is due to start in September with the sale of part of the
state's holding in cement producer Norte Pacasmayo.
Copri also expects the programme to cover the privatisation of electricity
companies Electrolima (already split into three separate entities for
sell-off) and Electroperu; telecoms company Entel (in which Spain's
Telefonica already has a 35 per cent stake); another state-owned cement
producer; and the state-controlled Banco Continental.
In each case, the state will invite operators to bid competitively for a
majority or controlling stake via public auction. Part of the state's
remaining 30 or 40 per cent holding will then be offered to the Peruvian
public. There will be a holding limit of 10,000 sols (Pounds 2,960) per
company per individual, to ensure a broad ownership base.
Copri is gearing up for an massive education and promotion campaign to
launch the programme to overcome small savers' distrust of government-backed
schemes. 'We want to make it as easy as possible for the new investor,' says
Mr Montoya. Participants in the scheme will pay 10 per cent cash down for
their share package and the rest over three years at a fixed 1 per cent a
month interest rate. Local banks will hold on to shares until full payment
is made.
'We consider this (instalment-plan) mechanism extrem-ely important both for
the deepening of the process and to increase the direct identification of
the population with privatisation,' said Mr Montoya.
The programme will also help the Peruvian government with the embarrassing
dilemma of how to spend its privatisation cash. Revenue from privatisations
has already topped Dollars 1.5bn this year. The bulk of that came from the
sell-off to Spain's Telefonica of the two state-controlled
telecommunications companies, Entel and CPT.
Such sums cannot be injected into the small Peruvian economy without
jeopardising newly won control of inflation. The Dollars 1.3bn telecoms
cash, therefore, has had to be placed on deposit with the central bank
(swelling Peru's already substantial international reserves to an
unprecedented Dollars 4.7bn). Even stepped-up poverty alleviation programmes
are unable to spend more than Dollars 300m in a year.
The citizen participation scheme will not mop up all of the privatisation
cash, 'but it will allow the state to reduce its internal debt, and it will
boost Peru's capital markets growth,' says Mr Montoya.

<TEXT>
Mr Publio Fiori, Italy's transport minister, failed yesterday in an attempt
to avert an airline workers' strike that threatened to ground most Alitalia
flights and cause delays at some airports, AP reports from Rome.
The 24-hour strike scheduled for today affects all international and
domestic flights from Rome and Naples, where the Group of Seven summit
finished yesterday. It could hamper the departure of some delegations and
journalists.
But state-run Alitalia said it would guarantee a minimum number of flights,
including routes to New York, Bangkok and most European cities.
Mr Fiori also requested that Alitalia improve passenger services, such as
flight information and medical care for travellers, to help ease
inconve-niences caused by the strikes.
In a meeting called by Mr Fiori yesterday, union officials representing
flight personnel and ground crews failed to come to terms with Italy's
national carrier on job cuts.
Unions are protesting at Alitalia's cost-saving plan to shed 4,000 jobs and
rewrite work contracts. Last week, a two-day strike by flight crews forced
it to cancel half its flights. A planned walkout by air traffic controllers
was delayed until later this month.

FT  11 JUL 94 / State aid to boost Seat: VW wins battle to gain subsidies
for Spanish subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German car group, has won Pta40bn (Pounds 195m) in state
subsidies for Seat, its loss-making Barcelona subsidiary, after 10 weeks of
bargaining with the Spanish government.
The cash injection is some Pta20bn less than Volkswagen wanted, but it is a
climbdown from the government's previous refusal to bail out private sector
groups.
Other companies, particularly those in the car industry such as the troubled
Suzuki plant in the south of Spain, are now likely to press for similar
funding.
However, officials say Seat is a special case, partly because it is the
biggest domestic car producer and because it is the only manufacturer which
has a Spanish trade mark and uses a high level of domestic technology.
The Spanish government will provide Pta32bn and the Barcelona-based Catalan
government the rest. The Catalan Nationalist party, which runs the regional
government in Barcelona and supports the minority Socialist government in
the Madrid parliament, had consistently backed official subsidies for the
area's most important employer.
In the first big clash between the Spanish administration and a
multinational, Volkswagen had hinted it might wind up Seat as a separate
unit unless it got government aid. The formerly state-owned car producer,
which was acquired by Volkswagen in 1987, lost Pta151bn last year and
expects to lose Pta75bn this year.
A key element in the agreement, which will be formally signed today, is that
the funds must be invested in technology for Seat and may not be used to lay
off the company's employees. The Volkswagen subsidiary intends to shed some
4,500 jobs, a quarter of its labour force.
The government has also obtained important concessions from Volkswagen:
The proportion of Spanish-made components used by Seat is to rise from a
present 54 per cent to 68 per cent.
Seat will be maintained as a separate trade mark within the Volkswagen group
and the German parent will keep up the company's design and technology
centre together with its capacity to produce new models.
Any new manufacturing plants opened by Seat in the future will be located in
Spain.
Volkswagen will nevertheless press ahead with its plans, announced at the
end of December, to close Seat's 40-year-old plant in the port area of
Barcelona and shift production to a new factory in the town of Martorell,
30km north-west of the city.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Ukrainian rivals dispute lead as early results indicate
close race

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Early results from yesterday's Ukrainian presidential election indicated a
close race, with both candidates claiming to be in the lead.
The incumbent, President Leonid Kravchuk, was polling strongly in
nationalist western regions, while Mr Leonid Kuchma, a former prime
minister, was well ahead in the Russian-speaking east.
An adviser to Mr Kravchuk claimed early today that the president had won
with a five-point margin over his adversary. But Mr Kuchma's campaign team
claimed partial returns suggested their candidate held an eight-point lead.
The outcome was not expected to be clear until late today.
Just over 69 per cent of registered voters went to the polls in the run-off
election between the two men - about the same as in the first round of
voting last month and far in excess of the 50 per cent turnout needed for
the election to be valid.
Voting was particularly heavy in the fiercely nationalist western Ukraine,
while turnout was lower in the Russian-leaning eastern regions.
As in neighbouring Belarus, where presidential run-offs were also held
yesterday, Ukraine's presidential debate centred on national independence
and links with Russia, which still exerts a powerful influence over all the
former Soviet republics.
Mr Kravchuk has sought to shift the campaign away from his disastrous
economic record and positioned himself as the sole guarantor of
independence, while portraying Mr Kuchma as Russia's henchman because of his
wish for closer ties with Moscow.
Fighting for his job on nationalist issues could win Mr Kravchuk a second
mandate, a remarkable achievement for a leader whose reign has been marked
by deep industrial decline and hyperinflation.
But his strategy has opened a Pandora's box of potential national discord
between western and central Ukraine, which tend to back the president, and
Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Mr Kuchma's pro-Russian agenda is
highly popular.
Early results indicated that Mr Kravchuk was getting more than 90 per cent
of votes in the Lvov and Ternopil districts, strong nationalist areas.
In the east, Mr Kuchma was credited with more than 70 per cent in Kharkov
and 80 per cent in the conservative Donbass coalfield. He had 82 per cent in
the pro-Russian Crimean peninsula.
In contrast with the presidential race, which has offered Ukrainians an
often agonising choice between 'two evils', many of the mayoral and
gubernatorial elections also held yesterday throughout the country promised
real change. For example, Kiev's mayoral contest is pitting a democratic
market reformer against a presidential appointee, albeit a progressive one.

<TEXT>
Youthful populist Mr Alexander Lukashenko, who promises 'simple answers to
complicated questions' in the former Soviet republic of Belarus, appeared
close to becoming its first president after yesterday's elections, Reuter
reports from Minsk.
Victory could pit him against parliament, sympathetic to his rival,
conservative premier Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, and a bureaucracy he considers
corrupt. Provisional results are expected today.
Mr Lukashenko, favourite after the first round, had won popularity with
promises to halt inflation and clean up the state apparatus which he says is
corrupt from top to bottom.
'My first move will be to fight corruption, first of all at the top. My list
of corrupt government officials is growing and only two members of the
government leadership will be able to stay in their posts,' he said after
casting his vote in the town of Shklov, 200km northeast of the capital,
Minsk.
'In all probability Lukashenko has won,' said Mr Alexander Feduta, a member
of Mr his campaign team. 'Kebich has lost in any case because parliament has
introduced the post of the president having him in mind and it is now clear
he will not be the president.'
He has yet to announce a coherent economic programme or to name his
candidate for prime minister but says: 'It's no problem to find a prime
minister, it's easier than finding a milkman.'

FT  11 JUL 94 / Zil drives back from brink: State and free market come to
carmaker's aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zil, Russia's best known and most prestigious car-maker, is being saved from
bankruptcy by a unique mixture of state support and free market principles.
The restructuring envisages cost-cutting, diversification and international
co-operation.
The saving of the company, the 'father of the Russian motor industry', is
akin to the government bail-out of Chrysler in the US in the 1980s or the
nationalisation of Rolls Royce in Britain in the 1960s. It shows a
government determined to preserve its engineering heartlands - at heavy cost
to the budget and even to the extent of changing policy by raising tariffs
on foreign imports to protect its market.
However, it also shows that the company has entered into agreements with
foreign partners and is cutting the workforce, particularly among
administrators. It has shed a conservative top management and is trying to
create a new, young management team. It is even trying to attract Mr Lee
Iacocca, former head of Chrysler, or another senior retired car executive,
to come to Russia to advise the new management on how to rescue a sinking
company - as Mr Iacocca did with Chrysler.
Zil, which makes trucks and buses, limousines, refrigerators and other white
goods and engineering products, had virtually collapsed earlier this year
under a massive load of debts, as its state orders for its vehicles fell to
a fraction of their former volume. It currently produces 15 to 20 limousines
a year and under 100,000 lorries, from 300,000 at full capacity. Its 120,000
workforce began to desert as pay fell or was not delivered. Management
efforts to pressure the government with demonstrations produced no response.
In May, the shareholders - among which the most powerful are Moscow City
Council and two big financial groups - elected a new president of the board
in Mr Alexander Vladislyavlev, deputy head of the Russian Industrialists
Union and a prominent centrist political figure. The board last month
appointed a new chief director, Mr Valery Saikin, who replaced Mr Yevgenny
Brakov, demoted to vice president in charge of forming a new finance group.
Mr Brakov had been best known for running as the official Communist party
candidate against Mr Boris Yeltsin for a seat in the old Supreme Soviet in
1990.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Vladislyavlev said Zil was
seeking, or had reached, joint venture agreements with the US companies
Caterpillar, Paccar, General Motors and the French group Renault for the
production of trucks, buses and engines.
The government had placed orders for 24 new Zil limousines a year from now
on and promised Rbs26bn and Dollars 35m for research and development of the
upgraded model.
The company is pressing the government to erect high tariff walls to protect
its products - and with them, other products of the Russian automotive
industry.
Mr Vladislyavlev, who said he was confident that the government would agree,
said: 'We must close the market to protect its development - but within that
market, we want foreign companies to operate and to sell the products they
make with us.'
The company overall is being radically restructured into a holding company
with separate product groups, in some of which the holding company may have
only a minority share.
In the longer term, Mr Vladislyavlev says it will offer some 10 per cent of
its shares to foreign investors, at a price set at Dollars 60m (Pounds
39.4m).

FT  11 JUL 94 / Brussels set to encourage mobile telecoms networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is expected to show its determination to speed up
the liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry by forcing
through legislation that will let mobile telecoms operators build their own
networks.
Buoyed by the support for plans for deregulating Europe's telecommunications
networks at the Corfu summit last month, the commission intends to use
special powers to ensure that the liberalising of mobile telecoms
infrastructures is not delayed. The move is bound to upset some of Europe's
most entrenched telephone monopolies.
Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome allows the commission to impose
liberalisation on intransigent member states without a vote at the Council
of Ministers. It is rarely used as it is criticised for being undemocratic,
but has been used relatively frequently in telecommunications.
Few are surprised at the commission's intention to adopt article 90 to
impose the mobile telecoms green paper. Momentum for liberalisation has been
gathering pace not just in Brussels but among the member states too, who
recognise that a competitive network is crucial for European
competitiveness.
Liberalisation of mobile infrastructures would give mobile operators greater
flexibility, and enable them to avoid interconnection payments to Europe's
fixed network operators. Experts at the commission believe this could cut
the cost of long distance mobile calls by as much as 50 per cent.
But many of the big public telephone companies in countries such as
Portugal, Germany, and Spain fear a loss of revenue, and are pressing for
delays in infrastructure liberalisation in this sector until the commission
introduces plans for the deregulation of all infrastructures later this
year. They argue that they need the revenue from mobile interconnection fees
to keep up their commitment to a universal telephone service.
Recent consultations in Brussels on the mobile telecommunications green
paper attracted opposition from the public operators in Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Greece and Belgium over the pace of liberalisation.
But the commission believes it is now in a strong position to push ahead,
backed by the welcome given by member states to the recommendations of the
Bangemann group of industry leaders, which called for speedy liberalisation
of EU telecoms infrastructures and services.

pullout
</HEADLINE>

   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday agreed to meet President Lennart
Meri of Estonia in an effort to solve their dispute over the withdrawal of
Russian troops from Estonian soil.
But Mr Yeltsin said flatly, after talks with US President Bill Clinton
following his meeting with the Group of Seven leaders in Naples, that
Russian troops would not be out of Estonia by the deadline of August 31 that
Russia itself had set.
This rebuff drew a grimace from Mr Clinton but was only one of a series of
spirited but cordial disagreements between the two presidents at a joint
press conference after their meeting.
The presence of Russian troops in the Baltic republics nearly three years
after they broke free of the Soviet Union is one of the most contentious
issues between the US and Russia and is seen in the Baltics as a critical
signal of whether Russia has turned its back on its Soviet imperial past.
Mr Clinton, who met Mr Meri last week, said he believed agreement on a
withdrawal by August 31 could be reached.
Mr Yeltsin criticised the Estonian government for 'very crude violations of
human rights toward the Russian population, and especially military
pensioners'.
Mr Yeltsin, relishing his new status as a full participant in the political
discussions of the Group, also attacked the US for discriminating against
Russian exports and urged it to follow the example of the European Union,
which has agreed to lift its trade barriers.
Mr Yeltsin and Mr Clinton set a goal of agreeing on a successor organisation
to Cocom, the organisation that used to regulate miltarily sensitive exports
to the Soviet bloc, by the time they meet in their next summit in Washington
on September 27-28.
US officials welcomed Mr Yeltsin's promise to try to limit Russian exports
to terrorist countries, which has been one of the issues blocking agreement
on the Cocom successor.
The US has offered Dollars 2m to help clean up a nuclear facility in
Estonia, and will also provide vouchers worth Dollars 25,000 apiece to help
Russian officers find housing.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Delegates presented with a feast
of puns and pasta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the summit was all about increasing personal ties, Silvio Berlusconi
chose to pun himself into history by presenting each of his male guests with
a special G7 tie.
Naples has several famous handcrafted tie-makers and Mr Berlusconi with
attention to detail as host reportedly chose the design. Each one was made
to measure. To ensure a tie suited Helmut Kohl, the bulky West German
Chancellor, Mr Berlusconi decided on an extra 30cm of material.
The wives meanwhile were showered by local craftsmen with every gift
imaginable. The hangers-on were not forgotten either, with a special packet
of G7 pasta from a local company whose courtesy card boasted of its 'quality
assurance and gut standing (sic) characteristics'.
The prize for the best intentioned pun must go to Antonio Bassolino, left
wing mayor of Naples who with justifiable pride has been showing off the
marvels of his city to the summit leaders and their wives. After meeting
Britain's John Major, he remarked they had something in common: A Neapolitan
pronunciation of the premier's surname came up with a sound like 'Mayor'.
The proprietor of the Di Matteo pizzeria who managed to interest Bill
Clinton in a pizza on the US president's walkabout in the historic centre,
confessed yesterday to a certain puzzlement about Mr Clinton's gourmandise.
'He wanted a pizza Margherita topped with onions, salami and fried potatoes.
. . a little strange.' This concoction didn't seem to prevent Mr Clinton
from his habitual early morning jogging, a rite performed along the Naples
sea-front.
This has been the summit where the wives have gone their own way. Hilary
Rodham Clinton passed over 'Swan Lake' at the San Carlo opera house in the
company of Veronica Lario, Mr Berlusconi's wife. She chose instead to visit
Ravello and its most illustrious resident Gore Vidal, the American writer
who has a villa there with spectacular views over the Amalfi coast. Like
Jacqueline Kennedy before her, who also visited Vidal there, she was made an
honorary citizen of Ravello.
Health has been on the minds of everyone after the gastric complaint that
felled Japanese premier Tomiichi Murayama. French president Francois
Mitterrand looked clearly wan from the suffocating heat; and on Saturday
evening after he had braved the 116 steps of the ceremonial staircase at the
Caserta Palace for a gala dinner he looked extremely frail.
The exceptional heatwave took its toll on many of the delegates in the form
of dehydration; and the 2,700 journalists were for once at the trough only
for water and soft drinks.
By the end of the summit, the girls distributing free Coca Cola had bandages
on their fingers, raw from opening so many cans.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Clinton drops trade talks plan
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has been forced to abandon his plan to bulldoze a new
round of multilateral trade talks on to the international policy agenda.
The US backed off, this weekend, from proposals for a new round of talks on
removing trade barriers in areas such as financial services,
telecommunications and investment rules, under pressure from other Group of
Seven members. But Mr Clinton won a commitment from the Naples summit to
'continue the momentum of trade liberalisation'.
Mr Clinton floated his proposals in a letter to his colleagues just ten days
ago, but ran into strong opposition from President Francois Mitterrand of
France.
Mr Mitterrand warned the prospect of a new round of trade negotiations could
jeopardise the chances of persuading the French parliament to ratify the
free trade measures just concluded in the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said the initiative
could also raise problems for other European countries, as well as for
developing nations such as India and Morocco.
But the G7 leaders said the drive for freer trade could not stop with
ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement. They agreed the trade issues
left unresolved by the Uruguay Round should be taken up at a meeting this
autumn of the 'Quad' trade ministers - a grouping of the US, Japan, Canada
and the EU which overlaps with the G7 - and reviewed at next year's summit
in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
In fact, the country where ratification appears most in danger is the US,
and Mr Clinton's initiative, dubbed 'Open Markets 2000', appeared designed
to win over some wavering centrist members of Congress who worry the Uruguay
Round agreements do not go far enough to liberalise trade in crucial areas
such as telecommunications.
Canadian and German officials indicated that the problem with Mr Clinton's
initiative was not so much its substance, which all countries approved, as
its last minute presentation.

<TEXT>
The foreign ministers of Britain and France will head to former Yugoslavia
tomorrow with a mission to put 'massive pressure' on the warring parties in
Bosnia to accept the current peace proposals or face dire consequences.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, and his French counterpart, Mr
Alain Juppe, will be carrying a message from the Naples summit that the
warring sides must accept the peace plan by the deadline of July 19.
'If the opportunity is not seized, there is a grave risk of a renewal of war
on a larger scale,' Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and
summit host, said yesterday on behalf of the eight world leaders who
gathered in Naples.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, warned: 'The consequences of not reaching
a settlement will be very serious.'
There was general agreement at the summit that particularly strong pressure
must be put on the Bosnian Serbs, who have kept an open position on the
peace proposals while their adversaries in the Moslem-Croat coalition have
sent more positive signals.
Western diplomats said the need to put pressure on the Serbs was implicitly
acknowledged by President Boris Yeltsin despite Russia's traditional
sympathy with the Serbs.
Under the peace initiative in Geneva last week, the warring parties can
expect intensification of international sanctions if they fail to comply
with the plan, and generous economic aid if they fall into line. As
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday: 'There will be no help for
anybody who resists.'
British officials said there was a danger that the Serbs would formally
agree to the plan while failing to comply in practice. They would be told
that only full compliance would earn them relief from economic sanctions.
Mr Hurd and Mr Juppe, travelling with the blessing of the leaders who met in
Naples but not as their formal emissaries, will have a blunt message for the
Serbs. They will say that if the Serbs fail to adhere to the plan there will
be no chance of stopping the US and perhaps others from ending the arms
embargo against the Bosnian government.
In the mayhem that could ensue, the UN peacekeeping force, in which Britain
and France play a leading role, would have to be withdrawn. 'Things are not
too bad now, but the present situation is unstable and it will start to
slide back downhill quite fast if the plan fails,' a British official said.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Dollar statement fails to
convince

<TEXT>
Finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations repeated
their belief in the need for a stronger dollar, but failed to dispel concern
that they still disagree on what to do about the weakness of the US
currency.
The finance ministers, using words negotiated in advance, said they 'agreed
that the underlying fundamentals are sound, and that the conditions for an
enduring recovery with low inflation are now in place in each of our
countries'.
They expressed concern, nevertheless, over foreign exchange volatility, and
'agreed recent movements in exchange rates are not in line with the basic
conditions prevailing in our economies'.
The US resisted efforts by some G7 states to incorporate the statement in
the formal communique issued by heads of government. US officials said they
wanted to keep the communique for longer term issues, and appeared
determined to treat the dollar's weakness as a short-term manifestation of
foreign exchange markets' irrationality.
'I've quit trying to anticipate what's going to happen insofar as the
currency markets are concerned,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary,
said yesterday. The currency markets, however, have not quit trying to
anticipate what is going to happen when Mr Bentsen and President Bill
Clinton talk about the dollar.
For weeks, the US administration has tried to enforce a strict blackout on
exchange rate comments by anyone but the laconic Mr Bentsen. In the days
before the G7 meeting that blackout broke down.
The biggest breach came at the summit itself, when Mr Clinton in effect
ruled out either intervention or changes in macroeconomic policy to combat
the dollar's weakness.
'If we continue to pursue growth without inflation and to work on generating
new jobs out of that growth, then eventually the macroeconomic realities
will assert themselves and the currencies will be righted,' Mr Clinton said.
US officials assured reporters there had been no intention of presenting a
different policy on the dollar. Mr Bentsen, apparently anxious to counter
the impression the US had abandoned thought of intervention, hastened to
reopen the possibility.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Plan to create more jobs endorsed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Naples summit endorsed a seven-point plan to deal with the 'unacceptable
waste' of unemployment, which stands at 24m in the G7 countries and 35m
throughout nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister and summit chairman, said
economic recovery was already creating jobs and putting the unemployed back
to work in 'more and more' of the G7 countries.
Mr Berlusconi said the jobs plan would build on the conclusions of the OECD
Jobs Study published last month, which recommended a broadly deregulatory
path to accelerate employment creation.
The seven-point plan drawn up by the leaders calls for:
Improved skills through better education and training;
Reduced labour rigidities through lower indirect employment costs and fewer
regulations;
Active labour market policies to enhance incentives for the unemployed to
seek work;
Assistance to promote innovation and the spread of new technology, including
an integrated infrastructure for global communications;
Job creation in the leisure and environmental protection industries, which
are regarded as potential high-growth areas;
Increased competition through elimination of unnecessary regulations;
Programmes to enrol employers and trade unions in the search for new jobs.
Officials conceded that the programme adds little to the conclusions of the
OECD report and the Detroit summit on jobs, called by President Clinton,
which preceded it.
There was no binding agreement on how to implement the plan, leaving G7
countries free to decide how to apply it to such contentious issues as
minimum wage legislation and social security programmes.
However, the agreement was hailed as a break-through by Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, who set out to make job creation one of the main
themes of the summit.
Mr Major said the impact of the plan would be to commit the G7 governments
to the principles of deregulation and labour market reforms to create
lasting jobs. 'That was a very novel idea two years ago when it was produced
primarily, though not exclusively, by the British,' he said.
Mr Major said the growing pace of economic recovery and the G7 leaders'
commitment to consider further trade liberalisation measures next year would
help to raise growth rates and create more jobs.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Ukraine offered funds to close
Chernobyl nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eight years after the nuclear power plant explosion in Chernobyl disrupted a
G7 summit in Tokyo, the world's leading industrial nations agreed to offer
Ukraine an action plan that would close the plant.
The G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada, together with the president of the European Commission, agreed to
provide up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) in grants as an initial payment to
shut down Chernobyl. The funding would be additional to the Ecu500m (Pounds
390m) in grants and loans offered by the European Union after its summit in
Corfu last month to help close dangerous plants and complete replacement
capacity.
Provision of the funds will be conditional on action by Ukraine. The
country, which yesterday held a second-round run-off poll in a presidential
election, would be expected to shut Chernobyl as 'an urgent priority'.
Ukraine would also have to agree to early completion of three new reactors
with adequate safety standards, comprehensive energy reforms including
higher prices, increased energy conservation and use of other energy
sources. It is expected that talks between G7 representatives and Ukraine
will begin soon after the Ukraine election results are clear.
The G7 meeting was notable for the concern expressed about the Ukraine
economy. The leaders urged Ukraine to embark on genuine economic reforms,
promising up to Dollars 4bn in finance from the International Monetary fund
and other institutions over two years in return.
The weekend nuclear safety offer was a hard-won victory for Mr Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor. Together with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French
president, he urged other G7 members to act and solve the problem of
Ukraine's dangerous Soviet-designed nuclear power plants.
Some G7 nations, such as Japan and Britain, were reluctant to provide
large-scale funding. After an all-night working session that began on
Friday, the sherpas, senior officials who prepare the summit, agreed on a
sum of only Dollars 100m. This was raised to 'up to Dollars 200m' when the
leaders discussed the matter on Saturday, with Germany promising to provide
DM50m, or about 17 per cent of the total.
The G7 pledges, together with Dollars 115m in grants promised by the EU in
Corfu, should provide about Dollars 300m to close down Chernobyl - the
amount experts say is necessary for the first stage of the operation. It is
estimated Ukraine needs Dollars 1.5bn to deal with its nuclear safety
problem entirely.

FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Smiles all round in readiness for
a scrap next year - A look at the harmony in Naples as G7 leaders agree to
look at what world institutions are needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a case of smiles all round at this year's double decker summit in
Naples of the Group of Seven and the 'political G8,' comprising the G7 plus
Russia.
The marked improvement of the industrial world's economy, the completion of
the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks earlier this year and the
absence of any truly bruising rows made for a harmonious, if rather bland,
gathering.
Next year could be different. When they meet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the
leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will
begin reviewing the institutions of global co-operation with the intention
of making them more suitable for the post cold-war world. Taken to its
logical conclusion, this could mean big changes for some of the smaller
members of the G7 club.
The world has been transformed since the first economic summit in 1975.
Communism has collapsed and the countries of east Asia have emerged as an
economically potent force. Globalisation has greatly increased the
interdependence of industrialised and industrialising countries alike. Mr
John Major, UK prime minister, said yesterday that the international
situation was changing at 'bewildering speed'.
And yet, as President Bill Clinton pointed out on Saturday, the links among
countries are governed and regulated largely by institutions 'that we
settled on at the end of World War Two'.
With this in mind, the G7 agreed in its communique that next year's summit
will ask what institutions will be required to meet the challenges of the
21st century. 'That is a commitment to discuss in Halifax what we want the
world to look like 20 years from now,' President Clinton said.
The review will encompass those institutions which were set up to foster
co-operation in the post-war world, such as the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, which are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year, and
Nato. It will see how these fit in with newer initiatives such as the
European Union, the World Trade Organisation, and the Partnership for Peace.
Inevitably, the nature and role of the G7 will be discussed. Although
conventionally described as the group of the world's 'leading industrial
nations' it imperfectly reflects the global economy. It is heavily
Eurocentric, excludes the Hispanic nations (even though Spain can claim to
have a bigger economy than Canada) and barely represents Asia.
The Group's attempts, in recent years, to co-ordinate economic policy
closely have as often ended in failure as success. This was the case when
attempts to hold exchange rates steady after the Louvre Accord in 1987
proved detrimental to the overall goal of steady, non-inflationary growth.
On the other hand, the G7 heads of government clearly gain some benefit from
the meetings. President Francois Mitterrand of France, who at times in the
past has been scathing of G7 summitry, said they got through a 'wealth of
work in extremely fruitful discussions' at the weekend.
The G7 enhances the networking capacity of its members in other groupings.
The US, France and Britain are members of the UN Security Council. All
except Japan are in Nato. It contains four European Union members; two
signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and, with
Japan, is represented by three countries in the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum. The G7 is especially valued by Japan, which is not
represented in Nato, Nafta, the EU or the UN Security Council.
The leaders were enthusiastic about the greater informality of the weekend
summit and plan an even less scripted approach next year. Mr Major spoke of
a 'sea change' in the way the summits are conducted.
They also agreed to carry forward to Halifax this year's format of following
the G7 economic gathering with a political G8 in which Russia is a full,
equal ranking partner. According to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, this
recognition of Russia's contribution to global politics was the most
important aspect of this year's summit.
For President Boris Yeltsin, the highlight was recognition of Russia as a
partner and democratic state. If the presence of Russia at yesterday's
meeting is any guide, the G7 can claim to have exercised a positive
influence in helping the former communist countries along the difficult road
to market-based economies.
But two big doubts remain. The group is at its most effective when dealing
with short-term crises. It is unclear how far seven such different states
can reconcile national interests and achieve Mr Clinton's goal of setting
the agenda for 20 years hence.
Looking ahead to 2014, it is uncertain whether the present G7 membership can
be justified. Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday made clear
that Russia was not hurrying to join the economic G7, because of its current
difficulties, Russia's long-term ambition is to join the group. Four EU
nations in its ranks will look even more imbalanced then. There is the also
question of Chinese participation if Beijing ever moves to pluralism and
democracy.
Although Chancellor Kohl yesterday went out of his way to praise the 'better
climate of co-operation', such questions will be lurking in the background
when the leaders meet in Halifax.
As the questions involve pecking order and prestige, they could make for
much more vexing discussions than in Naples this year.

   NAPLES

<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, left Naples yesterday buoyed by
summit successes on jobs, institutional reform and debt restructuring but
regretting the G7 leaders' timidity on trade liberalisation.
No one in the British camp was describing Mr Major's performance as a
triumph. But officials said he had achieved most of his summit objectives.
Mr Major will tell MPs today the summit refused to accept the US agenda for
broad trade liberalisation in spite of strong British support for 'further
and faster' progress towards free trade in areas such as services.
But he will also have several successes to report:
The summit agreed to British proposals for a reduction in the stock of debt
owed by developing countries to the Paris Club of creditor nations. The
agreement provides for debt write-offs of 66 per cent for most debtor
countries and up to 80 for the worst hit.
The leaders adopted a broadly deregulatory plan for job creation which
reflects many of the British government's concerns about over-regulation and
inflexible labour markets.
President Yeltsin's presence at the political session yesterday followed
strong British pressure for greater Russian participation in the summit. Mr
Major said he raised the issue at last year's G7 summit in Tokyo and
discussed it with President Yeltsin during his February visit to Moscow.
The summit called on Iran to stop supporting terrorist movements after
British appeals for action to stop the flow of funds from Tehran to the
Provisional IRA.
Talks in the margins of the conference made progress towards identifying an
acceptable candidate for successor to Mr Jacques Delors as European
Commission president. Mr Major discussed the issue with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, current EU Council president.

FT  11 JUL 94 / G7 leaders welcome Russia as full partner: Summit issues
upbeat message on prospects for lasting growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Group of Seven leading industrial democracies yesterday drew a line
under the cold war era, embracing Russian president Boris Yeltsin as an
equal partner in their annual review of international relations.
The leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada,
together with the president of the European Commission, also sent a message
of heightened optimism that their countries are back on a path of sustained,
low inflationary growth. In spite of recent financial market turbulence over
a weakening dollar, the Group of Seven abstained from commenting or offering
the US currency overt support. However, G7 finance ministers stressed their
belief that the dollar's fall was not warranted by economic fundamentals.
Mr Yeltsin's full participation at yesterday's 'political G8' meeting and
his agreement to a joint statement covering international flash points was
hailed by fellow leaders as a real achievement. Mr Yeltsin said the
recognition of Russia as a democratic state was the most important aspect of
the summit for him.
On Bosnia, the most delicate issue for the G8, Mr Yeltsin joined in warning
the warring factions to agree to the latest peace plan by July 19. According
to his G7 partners, Mr Yeltsin accepted that Russia would exert maximum
pressure on the Serbs, its traditional allies.
But the Russian president fiercely defended his country's sovereign
interests in what has been described as the world's most exclusive club.
Speaking after the conference and bilateral talks with US President Bill
Clinton, Mr Yeltsin called for the lifting of restrictions against Russian
exports. 'I threw off the red cloak a good three years ago,' he said,
reminding his audience that Russia should no longer be treated as a
communist state.
Symbolising the new relationship with the industrialised nations, this
year's summit was notable for the absence of any demand for economic
hand-outs from the west. Instead, Mr Yeltsin persuaded the G7 that sharply
lower inflation and greatly reduced budget deficits showed the Russian
economy was finally responding to his reform efforts.
For their part, the G7 painted an upbeat picture of their own economic
prospects. 'They're talking about the G7 having a 2.5 per cent growth in its
GDP' this year, said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary. 'That's
sure a lot better than the 1 per cent we saw last year.'
However, the economic summit recognised that improved growth alone would not
cut the 24m unemployed in the G7 countries and the seven leaders adopted a
programme of structural economic reforms to boost employment. These
emphasised life-time education and retraining, reduction of barriers to
employment, encouragement of new technology and freer trade.
President Clinton failed to win a consensus for an early push on further
trade liberalisation in such areas as investment, technical standards and
telecommunications. However, the other main contentious issue was solved.
After difficult negotiations among officials, the G7 countries agreed to
offer Ukraine an initial payment of up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 131.5m) to
shut down the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear plant on safety grounds.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Luxembourg PM leads in race to succeed Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The contest to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission has narrowed to three candidates led by Mr Jacques Santer, the
long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg.
Mr Santer, who has solid German support, has emerged as a potential
compromise after informal contacts between the leaders of France, Germany,
Italy and the UK at the weekend summit of the Group of Seven industrialised
nations in Naples. Senior European diplomats said it was possible that an
agreement among the Twelve could be reached in the next few days, to be
ratified at the special summit in Brussels on Friday called by the German
presidency of the EU.
However, Mr Santer's success is by no means assured. He still faces
challenges from Mr Poul Schluter, an experienced former Christian Democrat
prime minister from Denmark, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Socialist
prime minister of Italy who steered his country through its recent political
upheaval.
France also has misgivings about the EU caving in prematurely to the British
veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister promoted by Paris
and Bonn. France is resentful that Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has
reaped a domestic political victory over his lone opposition to Mr Dehaene
at last month's European summit in Corfu.
But Mr Kohl appears determined to strike a deal in time for the Commission
president-designate to appear on schedule before the new European Parliament
at its inaugural session on July 19 in Strasbourg.
'The chancellor does not want a crisis with the parliament,' said one senior
EU diplomat. Further delay would disrupt the German presidency of the EU.
Mr Santer is a dark horse who has emerged after better-known candidates such
as Mr Dehaene, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, and Mr Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain have either been blocked or taken themselves out of the
running.
His appeal lies in his Christian Democrat party background and his
small-state credentials, both important factors after the 10-year reign of
Mr Delors, a French socialist. He is also a Francophone, a vital concern to
Paris.
Mr Santer's strongest card seems to be that he is unlikely to offend anyone,
although the Danes are unhappy that the Commission presidency may fall to
Luxembourg for the second time in 14 years. Mr Gaston Thorn, a former
Luxembourg prime minister, preceded Mr Delors between 1981 and 1985.
A senior Commission official warned yesterday that a deadlock between Mr
Santer and Mr Schluter may force France and Germany to reconsider Mr Lubbers
or Viscount Etienne Davignon, the former EU industry commissioner. Both Mr
Lubbers and Mr Davignon are viewed as representing a strong Commission.

FT  11 JUL 94 / IBM plunges to bottom of brand name value league

IBM has plunged in one year from the third most valuable brand name in the
world to the bottom of a league table of 290 brands, according to an annual
survey that attempts the controversial task of evaluating 'what's in a
name'.
Coca-Cola is ranked number one in the league table, with a brand name worth
nearly Dollars 36bn (Pounds 23.6bn) followed by Marlboro at Dollars 33bn,
Nescafe Dollars 12bn, Kodak Dollars 10bn and Microsoft Dollars 10bn.
The survey, to be published by the US magazine Financial World on August 2,
uses a complex formula to arrive at its rankings. After breaking down
company earnings by brand, it then subtracts what it calculates would be
earned on a basic, unbranded version of the product.
To that figure it applies a 'brand strength' multiple based on factors such
as market position, degree of internationalisation and trends in the sector.
Using the formula - which was originally developed by Interbrand, the
UK-based brand consultancy - the value of the Compaq name climbed 149 per
cent in 1993 to a value of Dollars 4bn and a league table position of 21,
compared with a position of 65 in 1992.
Meanwhile, IBM's name now has a negative value, says Financial World. That
means that plant and equipment expenses and taxes wiped out any brand
earnings.
Other brands falling into this 'negative worth' category include: Del Monte,
Siemens, Corning, Krups, Moulinex, Michelin and Pirelli. The magazine says:
'A competing generic product could have generated higher profits on the same
level of sales.'
Evaluating brands, and attempting to capitalise them as intangible assets on
balance sheets, is a controversial area. Last week Sir Michael Perry,
chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, criticised
'fancy brand accounting' in a speech in London to the Advertising
Association.
'The seemingly miraculous conjuring up of intangible asset values, as if
from nowhere, only serves to reinforce the view of the consumer sceptics,
that brands are just about high prices and consumer exploitation. At
Unilever we have consistently rejected this approach,' he said.
Financial World points to IBM's failure to switch into personal computers,
'and as PCs became more and more of a commodity, they began selling more and
more on price'. But it adds: 'The fact that PCs are still referred to as
'IBM-compatible' is something IBM can capitalise on.'
The survey identifies Green Giant, the canned and frozen vegetables brand,
as one of the 'great comebacks'. The brand went up in value by 188 per cent
to Dollars 400m.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Kim Il-sung's son set to take power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kim Jong-il appeared ready to take control of North Korea yesterday after
the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, as Radio Pyongyang urged the country's
citizens to support the son as leader.
North Korean television aired scenes of thousands of weeping citizens bowing
before the numerous statues of Mr Kim Il-sung erected around the country as
part of the personality cult that was at the centre of his 46 years of rule.
The death of Mr Kim has led to the suspension of negotiations between the US
and North Korea, which has also postponed a summit with the South Korean
leadership designed to ease tension on the Korean peninsula.
Western leaders were quick to send conciliatory signals to North Korea.
In Naples for the Group of Seven summit, US President Bill Clinton said he
had conveyed to Pyongyang his 'deep appreciation' of the role the late
leader had played in resuming a dialogue between the US and North Korea. He
emphasised his desire to avoid the 'isolation and misunderstanding' of the
past between the two countries.
The US and its allies also made clear, however, that they would continue to
press North Korea over its suspected nuclear weapons programme.
South Korean officials predicted that Mr Kim Jong-il would succeed his
father in the powerful position of general secretary of the ruling Korean
Workers' party, which controls the government and military. But he may allow
an elderly official to assume the figurehead position of president.
Mr Kim, 52, believed to represent a younger generation of technocrats, needs
to forge a political alliance with the conservative leaders of his father's
generation to ensure his control.
He lacks the revolutionary credentials of his father, and while already
commander-in-chief of the North Korean armed forces, he is believed to have
failed to achieve complete control of the military.
The KWP and the North Korean parliament are expected to hold emergency
sessions in Pyongyang as early as today to elect a general secretary and
president. Preparations continued for the funeral next Sunday of the late
president, whose death was announced at noon on Saturday, 34 hours after he
succumbed apparently to heart failure.
North Korea halted military exercises and stopped propaganda broadcasts
attacking South Korea after Mr Kim's death. But the South placed its armed
forces on emergency alert on Saturday in response to concerns that a
hardline military elite might try to oust Mr Kim from power.
Mr Kim died as North Korea began high-level discussions with the US in
Geneva on the nuclear dispute and two weeks before he was scheduled to meet
South Korean president Kim Young-sam in an unprecedented summit meeting.
North Korea said that Mr Kim died of heart failure brought on by stress
connected with the dispute in recent weeks over the international
inspections of the North's nuclear facilities.
The presence of several officials, believed to be reformers, on the
committee for Mr Kim's funeral indicates that a new generation of
pragmatists may rise to the fore.

Northern Foods has sold Mayhew Chicken to Grampian Country Food Group for
about Pounds 11.5m cash, including working capital at valuation.
The disposal of Mayhew, which produces fresh whole birds and portions,
together with a wide range of frozen added value products, ends Northern's
involvement in the poultry sector.
It is in line with the group's strategy of concentrating on sectors where it
has substantial market share and lowest cost producer status.

FT  11 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Solchaga takes up his pen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's former economy 'supremo' Carlos Solchaga, 50, who quit as
parliamentary spokesman for the ruling socialist party two months ago, is
determined to keep his name in the news, writes Tom Burns. He has been hired
by Expansion, Spain's leading business newspaper, as chairman of its
advisory editorial board and pens his first column in today's issue.
Industry minister between 1982 and 1985 and then promoted to economy and
finance minister, a post he held until he left the cabinet last year,
Solchaga played a pivotal part in many of Spain's key domestic decisions in
the past decade.
He gave the green light to partial privatisations and took the peseta into
the EMS. He was unpopular with the trade unions for social spending
cut-backs, with business for maintaining high interest rates and with the
international markets - which forced three peseta devaluations during his
last year as minister.
However, in May, Solchaga received the unkindest cut when the former
governor of the Bank of Spain, Mariano Rubio, whom he had appointed,
admitted tax evasion. Solchaga (below) did the honourable thing and resigned
from active politics. By taking up the offer made to him by Expansion, a
newspaper in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a
shareholding, he becomes the most prominent Spanish politician so far to
switch trenches and become a journalist.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw improves in most areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Better third-quarter results in the waste management, recycling and
transportation businesses of Laidlaw were slightly offset by a small decline
in hazardous waste operations. The company blamed this on landfill problems
in South Carolina and pressures on pricing.
Overall, Laidlaw, one of North America's top three waste management groups
and a Canadian Pacific associate, earned USDollars 38.9m, or 14 cents a
share, in the three months ended May 31.
This compares to a 1992-93 third-quarter loss of Dollars 33.6m, or 12 cents,
after a special Dollars 75m after-tax charge reflecting a write-down in the
value of Laidlaw's interest in ADT. Without the charge, the period showed
net profit equal to 13 cents a share.
Third-quarter revenues this time were Dollars 579m, up 6.5 per cent. The
lower Canadian dollar reduced the total by Dollars 11.5m.
Margins rose sharply in solid waste management and recycling, reflecting
North American recovery and restructuring. The bus transportation group
continued to expand.
For the first nine months of fiscal 1994, net profit was USDollars 93.9m, or
34 cents a share, against USDollars 43.4m, or 16 cents.

Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, is in talks with potential
partners in the insurance industry, with a view to marketing and
distributing non-life products.
The bank said talks were being held with a number of insurance companies,
but declined to confirm reports that Allianz of Germany was among them. Les
Echos, the French financial daily newspaper, reported yesterday that
high-level discussions had been held with Allianz.
Credit Lyonnais said it was seeking a partnership with a company which could
supply non-life products, to be marketed through the bank's retail network,
and provide after-sales service.
Initially, the partnership would concentrate on the French market, the bank
said.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, has made no secret of his
desire to find a partner in the insurance sector, and has already approached
Assurances Generales de France.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Australia goldminers seek to
simplify link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samantha Gold, the small Western Australian gold-mining company, has made an
all-shares offer for Resolute Resources, another junior miner based in
Perth. The offer is worth around ADollars 350m (USDollars 255.5m).
Samantha is offering two of its own shares for every seven in Resolute. The
two companies have been linked since August last year, when Resolute
acquired control of Equity in Industry, which in turn held a large minority
stake in Samantha, making it the goldminer's largest shareholder.
This interest now stands at around 42 per cent of Samantha's equity, and the
bidder plans to buy back and eliminate that holding if the merger is
successful.
It said this simplification of the two groups' structures was a key reason
for the deal, although increased focus on gold and possible cost savings
were other factors. The merged group would have a forecast annual gold
production in excess of 300,000 ounces for fiscal 1995-96.

FT  09 JUL 94 / ITC ruling steps up US wheat row with Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US International Trade Commission found in a 6-0 decision yesterday that
Canadian wheat imports constitute 'a material interference' with domestic
wheat price supports and recommended President Bill Clinton impose sanctions
against Canadian grain.
The ITC investigation, conducted over six months at the request of Mr
Clinton, is the first official study to find Canadian wheat had measurably
negative effects on US wheat prices.
But the commission stopped short of labelling 'unfair' the practices of the
Canadian Wheat Board - which controls virtually all wheat exports.
That has been the contention of the domestic farm lobby led Mr Mike Espy, US
agriculture secretary.
Mr Espy contends that Canadian wheat imports depress domestic prices and
force the government to pay more in price support programmes to US wheat
farmers - a theory confirmed by the ITC investigation.
The wheat row is the latest in a series of disputes between the US and
Canada over natural resources and government farm programmes.
Each of the six ITC members will submit separate recommendations to Mr
Clinton next week outlining a range of options he can take, including a
tariff of up to 50 per cent of current import values, a quota of no less
than 50 per cent of the amount currently imported or a tariff rate quota.
Although Mr Clinton has the option of taking no action against Canada, he
has previously promised to follow the ITC's recommendations.
Most of the ITC members recommended temporarily restricting Canadian wheat
imports to 900,000 tonnes a year.
Two commission members expressed reservations over the findings.
The Canadian embassy called the ITC report a 'narrow examination' and
highlighted the 'substantial qualifications' expressed by commission
members.
The embassy also said it was 'prepared to go back to the table' to
negotiate, but emphasised that its position had not changed.

FT  09 JUL 94 / BCCI chief pleads guilty in US court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of the defunct Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, pleaded guilty to three criminal charges involving
fraud, conspiracy and racketeering in Washington yesterday, as part of a
plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
Mr Naqvi pleaded guilty to defrauding US banking regulators and to engaging
in a criminal conspiracy with Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder, to take
over several US banks, including First American Bankshares in Washington.
As a result of the plea deal, which was accepted by presiding Judge Joyce
Hens Green, Mr Naqvi is likely to be sentenced in October to between six and
8 1/2 years in jail. This takes into account nearly three years that Mr
Naqvi spent under house arrest in Abu Dhabi.
The government of Abu Dhabi was BCCI's majority shareholder and Mr Naqvi is
already appealing against a 14-year sentence handed down there in his
absence for his role in the BCCI fraud. BCCI, which claimed assets of almost
Dollars 24bn, was shut down worldwide in July 1991 after regulators
uncovered massive fraud.
As part of his plea deal Mr Naqvi agreed to co-operate with the continuing
investigation into BCCI. His co-operation could be very important in federal
and other cases involving BCCI, at the regulatory level and to the bank's
worldwide liquidators, government lawyers said. As a result of the deal, two
further sets of federal charges against Mr Naqvi, in Tampa and Atlanta, were
dropped.
However, Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, wrote to
Judge Green on July 5 attacking the proposed plea bargain, on the grounds
that it failed to provide an adequate penalty. 'The defendant's crime was a
long-term crime of treachery,' the letter said.
'Tens of thousands of hard-working human beings trusted their earnings to
BCCI, only to lose them as a result of the defendant's criminal actions.
Small businessmen with goods in transit, money in the bank, children at home
and a business to run woke to find. . . the business ruined because of a
small group of thieves,' the letter said.
The New York district attorney's office, which has aggressively pursued the
BCCI case, is likely to attempt to bring Mr Naqvi to trial on separate fraud
charges in New York. The office bitterly resents the Justice Department's
strategy of negotiating a plea bargain with Mr Naqvi, who it believes holds
the key to the BCCI fraud, and yesterday expressed its determination to
pursue the matter.
The office is also sceptical of Mr Naqvi's agreement to help with the
continuing investigations.
Government lawyers in Washington said yesterday they were entirely happy
that they could have proved their case against Mr Naqvi, but concerned about
initiating lengthy court proceedings at huge cost to the US taxpayer.

FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Russia to press for more flexible
approach to debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia will use the Naples summit to press for a new and more flexible
approach among the developed capitalist economies towards the debt problem
of all former communist states, according to Russian officials.
In contrast with previous encounters between Russian leaders and the Group
of Seven, Moscow will not this time be asking its partners for any more
government-to-government credits.
The country's balance of payments improved markedly last year, and Russian
officials are confident of a spontaneous inflow of private capital, much of
it Russian-controlled but currently held abroad, now that the first phase of
a privatisation programme has been completed.
'It is the Russian capitalists we want to attract with favourable
conditions,' Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, said before his
departure for Naples.
However, Russia does want as broad and long-term an understanding as
possible with the G7 on terms of the repayment of its external debt, which
Mr Shokhin estimated at around Dollars 72bn (Pounds 46.7bn). Western
estimates are in excess of Dollars 80bn dollars.
The deputy prime minister, who had several meetings in Naples yesterday with
G7 officials, has called for a 'new mode of co-existence' between the
leading capitalist countries and states in transition from communism.
He also wants the G7 to take into account the fact that Russia is owed, in
theory at least, up to Dollars 140bn by former client states of the Soviet
Union. Moscow would like the help of western states in collecting some of
this debt.
The Russian team will also be pressing its support for plans by the
International Monetary Fund to approve the issue of several billion dollars'
worth of special drawing rights to ex-communist states.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Private View: The song of Streisand's little sister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both songbirds were hatched in the same Brooklyn nest. She was the shy one,
her sister the noisy one. She was the fat one, her sister the skinny one.
'Kids used to make fun of me,' said Roslyn Kind. 'I would go to the theatre
and they'd say: 'Oh, you'll know Barbra's sister when she comes because she
cracks the sidewalk with every step.'
'When my sister opened in Funny Girl, I was a size 20.' (That's an English
size 18: Roslyn was 14 years old.) 'People thought I was her aunt. I don't
consider that the happiest experience in anyone's life.'
Yet, whoever deals the cards dealt these two girls fairly equal hands.
Roslyn was nearly nine years younger than Barbra, but prettier. Her voice
was lower but sounded as good - some said even better. If you close your
eyes it is hard to tell them apart: the same timbre, the same attack, the
same vocal tricks. If it were not for the genes you would say Roslyn Kind,
nightclub singer, was just mimicking Barbra Streisand, superstar.
Lady Luck has not smiled on Streisand's little sister. On the first night of
her London debut at the Cafe Royal last week - cabaret tickets at Pounds 20
a head - her pianist was taken to hospital in a state of collapse. Two
months before, Barbra had filled London's 26,000-seater Wembley Arena at
prices up to Pounds 260.
Roslyn was signed by RCA while still a teenager and made her first album,
Give Me You, as soon as she left school. There was a second album, but no
third. She has appeared on Broadway. The first of her two small films was
called I'm Going to be Famous, the second The Underachievers. And her
biggest television success so far was some guest appearances in a sitcom
called Gimme A Break.
For the most part, she has soldiered round the cabaret circuit, earning some
nice reviews. And if she feels her career has been horribly handicapped, she
is careful to hide her resentment.
In spite of a sleepless night worrying about her pianist, she was able next
morning to smile sweetly through the inevitable questions and to expatiate
on what she kept calling 'the search for Roslyn Kind'.
Did you try to follow Barbra?
'I always looked up to my big sister, but I looked up to my big brother,
too.' (He is 17 years older than her, and a property developer.) 'I loved my
sister a lot and I missed her when she left home.'
Did you try to imitate her?
'When I got to see shows, I would buy the album and sing all the parts in
the mirror. I was the insecure, shy, overweight child. I got out of myself
in those moments. I would look in the mirror and I didn't see the fat,
overweight girl. I saw this other character.' She warbled a couple of
snatches.
'I didn't imitate her. I sang all the albums - it might be Petula Clark or
one of the other British singers. Barbra was just someone else who was a
performer, who happened to be my sister who I was very proud of.'
The girls are, in fact, half-sisters. Diana, their mother, married Emanuel
Streisand, who had a PhD in English and taught at a reform school for boys
in New York; he died when Barbra was a baby. Her second husband was Louis
Kind, a divorced tailor, second-hand car salesman and estate agent. The
couple separated when he was over 60 and their child, Roslyn, only four.
Barbra has blamed a loveless childhood for her determination to become a
star. One biographer claims Louis Kind called the girls Beauty and the
Beast. Was it true, I asked Roslyn, that your father rejected Barbra and
favoured you?
'I was too young to know. The only thing I know is I was Little Miss Angel,
Miss Goody Two-Shoes, and my sister was probably more rambunctious and
rebellious. But, usually, those are the ones that really break out, the ones
that grow up to be the movers and shakers.
'Whatever the case, I know my sister was in dire need of a father image
because she didn't know her father. And she needed a dad.' Roslyn said her
father loved children. Perhaps he had just failed to see how much Barbra
needed his admiration.
Although their singing talent comes from their mother (the grandfather was a
cantor in a Russian synagogue), she was protective, conventional and
untypically reserved for a Brooklyn housewife.
'She never laid compliments on us, which is maybe what made us all fight for
who and what we are, to get out there and prove ourselves. My father, may he
rest in peace, was the total opposite. I became this golden child to him. He
blew it all out of proportion and my mother never said anything. She was
only proud within - but, as a child, you don't understand that.'
Following her own divorce, Roslyn lives with her 85-year-old mother in Los
Angeles. 'My mom came from what her parents dealt her: love is having a roof
over your head, clothes on your back and food on the table and she wasn't
demonstrative. Not to me, either. She's a much different lady now.
'So my sister took it in one way and I in another. To her, I was always so
sweet and so this and that, and I had to come to a place where I felt that I
don't have to be someone's doormat in order to be loved. So that was my
lesson, you see.'
With such emotional complications in the background, it is hardly surprising
that both women should have had problems with men. Barbra married actor
Elliot Gould in her early 20s and had a son; they were divorced eight years
later. She has knocked around with Hollywood glamour boys such as Warren
Beatty and Ryan O'Neal, and last year turned up to watch Andre Agassi at
Wimbledon.
Roslyn's love life seems to have been calmer. She was in her early 30s
before she married Randy Stone, a casting director. He was younger and on
the way up but within six months, she said, things were not working out. 'He
loved my feistiness. Unfortunately, I don't think he was ready for marriage,
though he thought he was.'
Do you have children?
'Not yet. I have a little puppy.' She giggled, cutely. Roslyn now has a
boyfriend, a lawyer in Philadelphia, of whom it is clear she has hopes.
I asked her if she found men easier to handle than her sister does. 'It's
not easy when a woman is very strong. She's a strong lady. I mean, my
sister's very vulnerable but she has a very strong side also.'
Are you like that?
'I think men are intimidated by me before they even meet me. Does that make
sense? Because I am preceded by the fact that I am Barbra's sister.'
Roslyn began to describe, with a hint of bitterness now, how she had lost
roles in the past because of her sister's famously neurotic pernicketiness.
'They hear my sister is difficult,' she said, cautiously. 'My sister wants
of anybody else the best that she would ask of herself. That's all.' Then
added: 'It's not a fair position to be in.'
She describes herself as a logical person who thinks before she speaks. She
reads about psychic phenomena and stories of reincarnation. 'It started
grabbing my interest when I was on the road and searching for Roslyn Kind.'
She made it sound like someone else.
You're a bit of a New Ager?
'I am New Age.'
You have crystals and things?
'I certainly do.' She laughed, prettily. 'I carry one with me all the time.
I usually carry one on stage with me. I have a balancing disc that I lost
somewhere in my travels.'
What's that?
'If anything is ailing or you want more energy in a certain part of your
body, you lay the copper side on it for a few moments and meditate. So,
before I go on stage, I put it on my vocal chords while I'm holding my
crystal and say affirmations.'
I asked her if she envied Barbra's fame and millions. She did not answer
directly but said, softly: 'I'm very proud of my sister.'
Are you content to perform for the sort of money you get?
'The money isn't so bad.' Comparisons made with her sister's earnings were
unfair. 'Nor am I fighting to make in one night what she makes on one
ticket. That's an untruth.
'I would like to be making some more. It would be unrealistic to say I want
to do this at this level all my life. Obviously, you wanna grow. I don't
think I need to be the monumental star that my sister is: she's lost a lot
of privacy through it.'
Do you wonder sometimes why she got so much and you did not?
'Some people are meant to make it. Their destinies are making it early. My
destiny was maybe learning about myself as a person first before I could
make it in any other way, or even find the right person in my life. I had to
discover Roslyn Kind. I put a lot of years into that.
'I guess in a way I'm not totally a show business person. I'm a very real,
everyday type person who loves to perform.'
But you could have avoided all this . . .
'By not going into the business? Should I deny myself what I love doing
most? I enjoy performing. I also know what is right for me. I will stay in.'
Isn't there a point where one is just being obstinate?
'There are times I've thrown my hands in the air and said 'enough is
enough'. But the moments I've done that, some kind of project comes through.
The universe is telling me, 'Ros, don't stop'. Because you'll never know
that it was a week away if you stop now.'
Where would you like to get to?
'To the level where people appreciate my talent and come out looking for me,
instead of me fighting so hard to be seen and to be accepted. I love to
sing, I love to perform, and I would love to do it one day with my sister
and share a stage just for one day.'
Would she agree to that?
'Maybe.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: What's in a game?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was passing through the green room the other evening when Miss Lee, my
executive assistant, caught sight of me and smiled to herself. She was
wearing the sort of Japanese designer gear (Yakomoto? Kamikaze?) that shows
a great deal of flesh - the hips, for example, and the area below the
collar-bone, and the sides and lower back - yet costs a preposterous sum, at
least if you are paying in dollars.
Miss Lee said: 'There was a flurry of action today, Michael. The score is
mounting hugely. We have 473 in the red folder and 322 in the blue.'
I knew what she was talking about. Two weeks ago, burdened by compressing
what I had to say into the molecular dimensions of this column, I appeared
to indicate that I thought that a light-year was a unit of time, rather than
a unit of distance.
This slip triggered an avalanche of compassion, mainly from readers in the
furthest-flung places - Switzerland, especially. They were convinced, to a
man, that I did not really believe that a light-year was a unit of time, and
that the error must have crept in because of a warp in the fragment of
space-time which I and my brain were transversing at that particular moment.
Faxes and letters poured in. Typical was the fax from Kevan Pegley of
Haslemere, Surrey. 'How,' he asked, 'could a man of your . . .' - I'll
delete his next four words, which were deeply and movingly flattering - '. .
. have fallen prey to such a common blunder? A light-year is a unit not of
time but of distance: it is the distance travelled by light, at the speed of
very approximately 186,000 miles per second, in one year. It is, therefore,
very approximately 5.9 x 1012 miles.'
Miss Lee has spent the last fortnight collating these faxes and letters with
the zeal you would expect of a Thatcherite Yorkshirewoman whose self-esteem
has been buttressed by large purchases of Japanese designer gear.
'Yes,' said Miss Lee, as I passed through the green room. 'We now have 473
light-year faxes in the red folder and 322 light-year letters in the blue
folder. It is wonderfully exciting - far better than the World Cup.
'Michael, why does the World Cup last so long? What are they doing? If it
hadn't been for the World Cup you would not have been lured into musing
about the possibility of there being, somewhere in the galaxy, a Milky Way
World Cup for soccer-playing planets, which is how you stumbled into your
light-year error in the first place. Soccer is hideous. It's just groups of
hairy men rolling on the ground and being given red and blue cards.'
I said: 'Red and yellow cards.'
Miss Lee said: 'Be that as it may. What the world needs most is a completely
new game. The old ones are boring. I believe I read last year - probably
Vanity Fair - that the man who founded Nike - can't remember his name - I
expect he had a beard - had been told by someone in Hollywood that sports
were now a bigger business world-wide than the entertainment business, and
that this man - the one who founded Nike - had set himself the target of
inventing a new game.'
'Why?'
'Well, it would appear, Michael, that this man at Nike shares my opinion -
namely, that all sports at present, particularly those with balls - soccer,
tennis, badminton - are fundamentally silly. We need a new game. A game that
women can watch, which means games that do not involve groups of greasy men
throwing or striking a ball and rolling about on the ground.'
I said: 'Badminton is played with a shuttlecock.'
I left Miss Lee's presence and returned to the dining room, where I have
been watching the World Cup on the smaller of our screens. But I could not
concentrate. Miss Lee, I thought, was right. We need a new game.
Recently I have played some tennis with Norman Lamont, the former UK
chancellor. Norman is a naturally-gifted ball player. But the thought
crossed my mind as the ball sped to and fro that tennis, after all, is
astonishingly silly. Soccer is silly. Rugby is ugly and silly.
We need a new game. I shall spend most of next week thinking about this
game. In the meantime, faxes and letters continue to swell Miss Lee's
bulging folders. Who would have thought that a tiny light-year error could
have produced a crusade to find a new game so as to drain the mire of
silliness in which the world is bogged.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Damned lies and opinion polls: Dominic Lawson thinks he
knows why pollsters got their election predictions wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is depressingly rare for any professional association to blame its own
members for shortcomings: almost invariably, they are decreed to be the
fault of the consumer, the general public.
So hats off to the Market Research Society, which last week produced its
inquest into the failure of its members, the opinion poll organisations, to
predict the Conservative victory at the last general election.
Indeed Dr David Butler, the group's chairman, in laying the blame on the
pollsters, declared the failure 'the most spectacular in the history of
British election surveys'. Ouch.
The language of the report then becomes more technical as it seeks to find
the precise reason for the grotesquely embarrassing error.
It says it arose 'partly because quotas and weights did not reflect
sufficiently accurately the social profile of the electorate and partly
because the variables used as the basis of the quotas and in correlative
weighting were not closely enough correlated with voting behaviour.'
So there you have the answer, if you can understand it.
What the Market Research Society categorically ruled out is the excuse which
would not only have absolved them from blame, but which had also gained a
certain amount of anecdotal credibility: viz, that a significant number of
Tory voters lied about their intentions.
Yet this still seems to me a distinct possibility. One looked a little
foolish admitting, in the middle of the longest recession since the 1930s,
that one would happily endorse the governing party. And voting Labour, for
many people, has always had more of a feel-good factor: that is, one feels
better about oneself.
It is for this reason, I suspect, that in recent years polls always seem to
indicate that the vast majority of people would rather pay more taxes in
order to provide more funds for the National Health; but in general
elections this is shown to be, largely, humbug - the majority of voters have
not voted for the party which promises to carry out just such a policy,
namely Labour.
For similar reasons, and also, I must admit, out of a natural cynicism, I
find it hard to believe a much reported poll which was published at the
beginning of last week.
The survey, produced by the polling group Mintel, said that eight out of 10
sons and daughters would rather their parents left them nothing, and spent
their money instead on a more comfortable old age.
A number of newspapers took this up, saying that this showed the essential
goodness of the average British citizen. I simply do not believe it.
I think that a large proportion of Mintel's sample of 1,335 adults were
telling porkie pies. How many well-off families do you know that are not
heaving with speculation about the financial benefits of the death of a rich
parent or relative, and that do not tremble collectively at the thought that
the rich old one might suddenly decide to blow it all on some folly?
But, on the other hand, how many people do you know, who, confronted by one
of Mintel's question-and-answer men, would look him in the eye and say:
'Yes, I would rather my old parents saved as much as possible so that I can
have a large sum of money when they die'?
Mori, one of the largest of our polling organisations, has reacted rapidly
to the possibility of this sort of dishonesty at times of elections, even
though the Market Research Society has officially cleared the general public
of any habitual face-to-face dishonesty.
In its recent poll of European election voting intentions in London, Mori
experimented with a method which allowed those surveyed to write down their
intentions without showing them to the pollster. Mori's resulting forecast
turned out to be more accurate.
This leaves one question unresolved. If the Market Research Society could
reasonably have blamed the public for their embarrassment, why didn't they?
And the reason is that if they were to admit that the public lies, who would
ever again commission an opinion poll?

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Impressionist view from Brussels - William Packer
admires the work of the Belgian avant-garde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER

<TEXT>
To take issue with its title is an easy way of criticising at an exhibition,
yet it can also be a useful in clarifying the issue at the outset,
dispelling any misapprehension.
'The Belgian Avant-Garde 1880-1900', the sub-title of the show in the Royal
Academy's Sackler Galleries, has the virtue of exact description, but even
the most pro-Belgian would concede that on its own it sounds a little dull.
So what of Impressionism to Symbolism, the main title? One can see all too
well why those two big -isms were chosen - everyone has heard of them;
together they neatly suggest the period of the show; and the merest mention
of Impressionism is sure to draw the punters in.
The only trouble is that it is not quite right. Vague in its generality, it
gives the unfortunate impression that here is little more than an annexe to
the French painting of the time, so dominant still is the Franco-centric
reading of the art history of early modernism. And in its particular
conjunction, it proposes a narrative sequence, development or shift from the
one -ism to the other.
This is a pity because the show, in both material and critical content, is
so much more interesting than that. Indeed my only complaint is that there
is too little shown of a rich and fascinating subject. Between the one and
the other would have been the better choice of title.
What this exhibition actually gives us is not a sequence at all but rather
an over-view, as though looking down into a house with the roof off, and no
matter whether the contemporaneous activity revealed is complementary,
contradictory or unrelated. It is an admirable exercise for the Academy to
have taken on, for one of the most rewarding critical developments in recent
years has been the renewal of comparative interest in the national schools
in the early modern period. In this, the Academy has often taken the lead,
if not always the credit it deserves.
What is revealed, and especially in this exhibition, is that while at
particular moments certain places - for all sorts of historical, political
and cultural reasons - become the place to be, the focus of current interest
and activity, it is never the only place where significant creative work is
being done. Of course Paris was of first importance in the later 19th
century, primus inter pares, but what of Berlin, Copenhagen, Oslo, the
Hague, Turin, Barcelona, London, Glasgow, Vienna, Brussels . . . ?
It is the premise of this show, with Brussels at its centre, that we ask the
same question. What we find is that the Paris relation is evident enough,
yet what little of Impressionism there is seems closer in its robust spirit
to what was going on Holland and Scandinavia than to Monet or Pissarro.
Bartsoen's barges in the snow and Mertens' moonlit fisherman are fine,
straight-forward examples.
There is, admittedly, a lot of post-Impressionism, in the pointillism of
Lemmen, van de Velde, Finch and van Rysselberghe - indeed disproportionately
so, though with some splendid examples. A more intriguing French connection
lies in the social realism of such as Bastien-Lepage, but then again the
ramifications run throughout Europe, from Newlyn to Stockholm, Glasgow to
Turin. The Belgian view is notably represented here by the large 'Funeral
Wake' of Leon Frederic, the 'First Communion' by Emile Claus and van
Leemputten's 'Distribution of Bread in the Village'.
More particular is the reference to the social symbolism of Millet and
Puvis, which we find in Verstaete's 'Barge Haulier' and Verheden's
'Gleaners'; and to the psychological symbolism of Moreau and Redon, in the
dreamlike, haunted drawings of Fernand Knopff, and the dark, mysteriously
inhabited interiors of Xavier Mellery. Rops seems included as an
afterthought - a missed opportunity. These two aspects of symbolism come
together in the angst-ridden sculpture of Meunier and Minne. With
Spilliaert's hypnotic self-portrait, the step is forward into psychological
expressionism - again we could have done with much more of him. There are
cross-references and blurred distinctions everywhere.
With James Ensor, still the best known of the early Belgian modernists and
central to the show, such shifts are endless - expressionism, symbolism,
realism, on their own and all at once, even in the small selection here. The
comparison with Munch is inevitable, and proposes what is perhaps the
message of this show. For him the view from Brussels stretched east to
Berlin and north to Oslo quite as much as south to Paris. The artist is free
even to stay where he is. To be local is not always to be provincial.
Impressionism to Symbolism - the Belgian Avant-Garde 1880-1900; Royal
Academy, Piccadilly W1, until Oct 2. Sponsored by Societe Generale de
Belgique, Union Miniere, and Tractebel.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Out of tune on Broadway - The parlous state of new
musicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a beastly year for new musicals on Broadway. Only two of the
four shows nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award even stayed running
until awards' time - Walt Disney Theatrical Productions' stage version of
the animated feature Beauty and the Beast and Stephen Sondheim's Passion,
itself a kind of beauty and the beast story in reverse.
If Passion's sweep of the Tonys - it picked up four awards, including Best
Musical, at last month's ceremony, to Beauty's one - represented some sort
of victory of high art over big business, it proved to be short lived. The
day after the ceremony, Beauty set an all-time Broadway box-office record
for single day ticket sales. Punters were apparently drawn in by a clip from
the production and a commercial shown during the national television
broadcast of the awards. Passion's business, by comparison, was only
average.
The two productions continue to battle it out for audiences, but the real
contest between them - dire efforts both - is which of them is less suited
for the Broadway stage.
With extensive rewriting and a completely new production, Passion might make
a passable chamber opera, but its more likely fate is some back corner of
Sondheim's desk. With this project, Sondheim seems to have abandoned
completely the qualities that make his best work - Sunday in the Park with
George, Into the Woods, Company - so splendid. Gone are the soaring
melodies, the super-smart lyrics, the wry wit, the wrenching moments of
self-awareness for characters and audiences alike. Humourless, arid, and
musically unmemorable, Passion is the antithesis of entertainment, at once
overblown and undercooked, portentous and insubstantial.
Not to mention confusing. Based on Fosca, an obscure 19th century Italian
novel by Ignio Tarchetti - which was also the source of the obscure 1981
film, Passione d'Amore - Passion tells the story of an Italian army captain,
Giorgio, who is forced to leaves his beautiful mistress Clara when he is
stationed to a remote outpost. The local colonel's unattractive, sickly
cousin, Fosca, falls in love with him, and although he is initially
dismissive of her, he eventually comes to return her love, dismissing his
relationship with Clara as insincere.
The plot turns on Giorgio's change of heart, but nothing in the musical lets
us know why he would suddenly fall for a woman he has previously found so
repulsive. What Sondheim and librettist/director James Lapine seem to be
aiming for is an atmosphere of melodrama in which logic is less important
than the characters' heightened experience. But since the characters neither
compel on their own nor carry any historical or metaphorical significance,
we search for emotional truth as some kind of grounding for this story, and
find none.
Early on, for example, it is dangled before us that Fosca and Giorgio share
a love of books, but we wait in vain for scenes in which that, or some
other, common ground is explored.
Passion's most potentially interesting character is Fosca, but from her
first appearance - descending on an upstage staircase behind a transparent
scrim - it is clear that the musical is going to treat her as an object of
curiosity rather than allow us into her complex psychology. We are given no
reason to care about her, so that when Fosca throws herself at Giorgio's
feet and begs for his love, it is so embarrassing we are forced to look
away.
The element that could hold everything together - the music - is hindered by
the work's oddly halfhearted form. The subject matter seems to lend itself
to a sung-through format, but Sondheim and Lapine have laced the music
through with passages of spoken dialogue. Though lacking in identifiable
songs, Sondheim's score has lovely, melodic passages; but just as the music
begins to charge the atmosphere, the stilted dialogue sends the tone
plummeting into the banal.
Lapine's stately, dispassionate production worsens matters. One would expect
a story of fervent love to have an equally torrid pace, but except for the
aptly erotic first scene, in which Giorgio and Clara writhe naked in bed
together and sing of their love, everything about the production moves at a
monotonous glide. Jane Greenwood's nicely wrought costumes place us
specifically in the late 19th century, but Adrianne Lobel's expressionistic
sets of sliding, mottled walls strand us somewhere in contemporary design
limbo.
What sparks do fly in Passion are largely thanks to Donna Murphy's hugely
committed, beautifully sung performance as Fosca, for which she won the best
actress Tony. Jere Shea as Giorgio sings well but his acting is very bland,
only adding to the character's - and the musical's - inscrutability.
As for Beauty and the Beast, where it really belongs is on screen: the
sublime animated feature instantly earned classic status among the Disney
oeuvre when it was released in 1992. Where this stage version belongs is in
a theme park; gaudy and ham-fisted, it systematically manhandles everything
that made the screen version so memorable.
In place of Disney's lavish animation, ponderous and unattractive sets heave
hydraulically across the stage; instead of magical special effects, a dry
ice machine puffs faux fog and firecrackers fizz; for the film's delightful
enchanted characters we have third-rate performers sporting padded and
molded outfits, declaiming Howard Ashman's piquant lyrics with the delicacy
of elephants on parade.
And yet, amid this debacle, the core of the Beauty story - the taming of the
Beast (Terrence V. Mann, convincing even under a mountain of makeup) by the
lovely, bookish Belle (the winning newcomer Susan Egan) - still charms. The
inclusion of a few key scenes of character development, in which Belle and
the Beast find common ground by reading stories together - the very sort of
scenes, down to the subject matter, that Passion lacks - adds a level of
human interest to the story that shines through Beauty and the Beast's
relentless gaudiness.
Walt Disney superior to Stephen Sondheim on story structure? So goes this
Broadway season.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: All change at the Arts Council - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arts Council was quietly relaunched this week. Gone is that old Arts
Council of Great Britain which closed down arts organisations, cut their
grants and bombarded them with bureaucracy. In its place is a new
supportive, user friendly, Arts Council of England that wants all arts
lovers in the country to join its campaign to persuade the government to
give it a larger grant in 1995-96. The miserly frozen sum of Pounds 186m
that it is currently promised, warns the council, could lead to the
disappearance of some arts companies.
The new secretary general, Mary Allen, speaking on behalf of the new
chairman Lord Gowrie and bolstered by such fresh members at this week's
Council meeting as Richard Rogers and Trevor Nunn, tore up the old strategy
of picking winners and funding fewer but better arts groups, and instead
promised to fight for all.
As a first step the new music chairman, Gavin Henderson, has deferred the
planned overhaul of the regional orchestras, so no section of the arts is
currently in line for the torture chamber. The council is batting for
everyone and negative talk about the minutiae of the council's distribution
of subsidies to clients is to be discouraged - at least until the New Year.
Mary Allen has accepted the uncomfortable reality that if the council is to
make a case for a higher grant for next year it has to act now. Contrary to
rumours, Lord Gowrie had not come with a dowry: speedy lobbying of the
Treasury is essential. The urgency is inspired by the most quixotic of
reasons. By next January the National Lottery money will start to flow into
the arts at a rate of at least Pounds 100m a year, perhaps rising quickly to
Pounds 200m. With all this extra funding no one is going to take seriously
hard luck stories from whinging arts companies.
In fact the council faces an almost impossible task in trying to persuade
government and public that some arts organisations, especially the
orchestras and touring drama companies without permanent homes, will still
be facing horrendous financial difficulties next year. Lottery money is
supposed to go towards capital projects, although the heritage minister
Peter Brooke has quickly bowed to reality and allowed some grants to go
towards endowments, and funding the inevitably higher running costs that
follow from building improvements.
This is fine for the National Theatre and the Serpentine Gallery, with
capital projects in hand, but of little obvious help to transients like
English Festival Ballet or the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. The fear is
that two classes of arts company will emerge; thrusting, building based
organisations favoured by the booming lottery, and hard-pressed, touring
performers financed by an under-funded Arts Council. Still, it is impossible
to believe that if arts funding in the UK doubles next year some means will
not be found to help out the genuinely needy.
Millennium Fund hopefuls are falling into some rough kind of pecking order.
The Royal Opera House has just received a boost, with Westminster Council
finally accepting its rebuilding plans; but Albertropolis, the scheme to
give London the world's leading museum city in South Kensington, has
received a setback, with the Royal Albert Hall withdrawing from the project.
The cost, Pounds 150m plus, was always against it, and now the RAH feels
that its own renovation plan, including a pedestrianised piazza linking it
with the soon to be refurbished Albert Memorial, stands more chance as a
separate project. It also enables the RAH to apply to the arts lottery
honey-pot, rather than the Millennium Fund, if it thinks that avenue offers
a better chance of cash.
Ernst &amp; Young was very happy with its Pounds 350,000 investment in the
Picasso show at the Tate Gallery earlier this year. Not only did it attract
a record 300,000 visitors but it also enabled the consultants to profitably
wine and dine clients and contacts.
So pleased were they in fact that the company is already clamouring for
more. In 1996 the Tate will present the first major Cezanne exhibition for
years, with around a hundred of his greatest paintings, and Ernst &amp; Young is
the sponsor. It is also underwriting two smaller exhibitions, including the
display next spring of architectural proposals for the conversion of the
Bankside power station into the Tate museum of modern art.
Every time the phone rings in the Tate's development office these days it
seems to bring good news - BP is to sponsor the annual re-hangs for another
two years; Reed Elsevier is supporting the major Whistler show opening in
October; and Channel Four has signed up for three more years of the Turner
prize.
The shortlist for this most controversial of art prizes will be announced
later this month and the feeling is that painters might once again be
considered to be artists after years in which a sculptor or conceptualist
has walked off with the Pounds 20,000. Possible names in the frame include
Tony Bevan and Jenny Saville, but they might have to compete with the likes
of photographer Andy Goldsworthy, sculptor Antony Gormley, and butcher's boy
Damien Hirst.
Brian McMasters, director of the Edinburgh Festival, is feeling
schizophrenic. Ticket sales to date for the festival, which opens on August
14, are over 40 per cent higher than a year ago. But they are virtually all
for music and dance events: his ambitious drama programme, built around a
seven hour production by German director Peter Stein of the Oresteia, in
Russian, is finding few takers. Perhaps the locals, who make up 60 per cent
of the festival audience, have not quite recovered from Stein's 1993
offering - Julius Caesar in German.
With the festival on course McMasters has time to patch up his continuing
row with Timothy Clifford, director of the National Gallery of Scotland.
Clifford wants his big summer shows, in particular the significant French
painting from Monet to Cezanne, to be included in the festival, or at least
in its official programme.
McMasters has resisted, and instead suggested that the National Gallery
takes part in an autonomous visual arts festival, incorporating all 69
Edinburgh galleries, to coincide with the main event. Clifford has gone
along with the idea this year, but hardly relishes the thought of one of the
leading art museums in the UK mixing regularly with some very small fish.
The conflict between the two leading figures on the Edinburgh arts scene
remains unresolved.
But this pettiness is nothing compared to the problem facing Bill
Burdett-Coutts, who at festival time runs the Assembly Rooms, far and away
the biggest Edinburgh Fringe venue. This year he cannot sell tickets for the
shows he is presenting at the Assembly Rooms own box office. His landlord,
the City Council, insists that it only dispenses Edinburgh Festival tickets,
or tickets for future Edinburgh events.
So the 115,000 people who cram the Rooms each year will be directed to a
separate Portakabin ticket office in one of the lanes around the back.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: The haunting magic of a Russian masterpiece - Comedy
and irony prevail in the National Theatre's new production of 'The Seagull'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chekhov has become a playwright whom other playwrights like to set in
versions of their own, much as poets do with those of Racine. You can see or
read Brian Friel's Chekhov, Trevor Griffiths's, David Mamet's, Ronald
Harwood's, and (pre-eminently) Michael Frayn's, as you can see or read
Robert Lowell's Racine, Douglas Dunn's, Richard Wilbur's, Craig Raine's.
Recently, the National Theatre has started to give us Pam Gems's Chekhov:
first in the 1992 Uncle Vanya, and now in The Seagull. (Her Chekhov career
began in 1982, with The Cherry Orchard, for Leicester.) Like Griffiths and
Mamet, she does not come to Chekhov by way of having learnt Russian, but by
way of someone else's literal translation. She attends, in particular, to
directness of speech; and to hell with precision. Where Constance Garnett
(1920s) has Trigorin say 'And when I die my friends, passing by my grave,
will say, 'Here lies Trigorin . . . '' and Frayn (1978) has '. . . and when
I'm dead my friends will say as they pass my grave: 'There lies Trigorin . .
.'', Gems has 'On my gravestone: 'Here lies Trigorin . . . '' Snappy, but
not actually correct. Characterisation is vital, writes Gems, but would
Arkadina really call Nina 'darling'? Arkadina is an actress, sure, but hers
is not mere luvvy-speak. In Garnett, it is 'my dear', in Frayn 'my sweet':
both of which catch nicely Arkadina's affectionate but distant
condescension.
Well, there is nothing so wrong with these details that a good production
cannot correct. (The 1992 Vanya was first-rate.) The director on this
occasion is John Caird. With excellent actors, he gives us a Seagull that is
funny, truthful, interesting, but sometimes lightweight. There are details
in the play that have not yet acquired enough impact - there seem to be too
few pauses, too few moments when we are aware of life offstage - and too
much happens on the stage's centre-line. His two most curiously ponderous
strokes are to make the characters all walk around the stage, in separate
orbits, before and after the action (which tells us 'All these different
people - only think how Chekhov interconnects them]') and to spotlight, at
the end, the stuffed seagull (which tells us 'Think About This Ambiguous
Symbol Before You Leave'). But Chekhov was not a symbolist, and he is ironic
about the way that his young characters Konstantin and Nina employ the
symbolism of the seagull.
Nonetheless, much in this Seagull is fresh. Caird makes it a play of
impulsive women and weak men: Edward Petherbridge, marvellously playing Dorn
as a quietly elegant spectator, is forever having people throw their arms
round him; and there is a very revealing touch early on when Nina throws her
arms round Konstantin's neck and kisses him - and, even though it is he who
is in love with her, he is not assertive enough to hold her, and he keeps
his hands hovering just off her waist. I have never been so constantly aware
of the irony of the A-loves-B-who-loves-C-who-loves-D-who-loves-E (through
to H) structure of this play, nor of the fact that Masha, in marrying a man
she does not care for while loving another, is repeating her mother Polina's
story.
The most interestingly re-thought characterisation comes from Bill Nighy,
who plays the writer Trigorin as a man of remarkable diffidence and restless
nervousness. Almost too restless to keep one's mind on in Act Two, but
revealing the character's passivity. Nina rushes at him, Arkadina engulfs
him; he is their amorous pawn for a while - and then he retreats to his
writer's notebook. Judi Dench plays the dominating Arkadina to brilliantly
funny, absurd effect; and I love her daring in showing the character's most
odious, selfish side from the very first. Her hilarious masterstroke comes
in pulling Trigorin to the floor in Act Three and making love to him while
praising his literary skills. 'Impossible to read you without delight,' she
says, lying on top of him and covering him with kisses. The flattered author
and the selfish seductress achieve their horizontal climax: whereupon she,
the cat who got the cream, says slyly 'He's mine' - and he scribbles some
more notes.
Chekhov called it a comedy, and Dench helps him out wonderfully. (Just see
her doing a little run across the stage like a 15-year-old and then turning
to enjoy her effect on her audience. And watch her re-bandaging her son
Konstantin's head: she makes the little practical issues, like the
inconvenient placing of his hands and the scissors, unforgettably funny.)
Those of us who, perhaps wrongly, love Chekhov as a master of tragicomedy
may perhaps miss some of Arkadina's anguish - the violence of her changes of
mood with her son Konstantin, and the despair with which she reclaims
Trigorin. More crucially, we may find the anguish of Konstantin, who is
played by Alex Cox, only intermittently absorbing here. Cox is half so
interestingly Oedipal and intense that you wonder why the other half pales
away.
Helen McCrory, as Nina, never pales away for a moment. She is all impulsive
radiance, and her every entrance sets the play's temperature jumping. But,
again, the character's pain makes too little effect, and her rapid changes
of thought in her near-delirium in Act Four are not arresting. I could not
always believe in the moonlike starings of Rachel Power as Masha, but
everything in Anna Calder-Marshall's account of her mother Polina is
revealing. Most perfectly among the whole cast, she catches the compulsive
self-contradictions of which Chekhov's characters are made: especially when
she admires the flowers Nina has just given Dorn, suddenly insists he gives
them to her, and then rips them apart. Norman Rodway's characterisation of
Sorin is too stagey, but Robert Demeger has just the right gaucherie for
Shamrayev.
Opening night had its technical trauma, with two huge frame sets that hung
perilously in mid-air, failing to ascend and descend for ten minutes. But
John Gunter's decor offers us enough lovely realism without swarming detail.
Dominic Muldowney's music consists mainly of a rather fine valse triste. In
Act Four, Konstantin is heard playing this on the piano offstage; and Masha
and Polina - daughter and mother briefly united in sympathy as unhappy wives
and lovers - start to waltz, the vodka glasses still in their hands. Here is
the true Chekhovian magic. No modern playwright is more haunting.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: A new culture for a new society - South Africa can at
last explore the wider imaginative world beyond apartheid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African art has finally begun to recover from the struggle against
apartheid. Apartheid was bad enough, with its virtual refusal to fund any
art form which did not mimic Europe; then came the struggle against
apartheid, with its ready-made themes and powerful stories.
But in 1990, when former President FW de Klerk announced the imminent demise
of apartheid, post-struggle torpor began to set in. Artists fed on a
constant diet of apartheid atrocities - and heroic responses from the
townships - found it hard to kick the habit of political theatre and
politicised art. Now they too have been liberated by April's elections; for
the first time they are free to explore the wider imaginative world beyond
apartheid and racism. It was a rich vein, but years of struggle art have
mined it out and the country is well and truly ready for something new.
This year's Grahamstown festival - which artists used to boycott because of
its Eurocentric bias - marks the beginning of South Africa's artistic
recovery from post-apartheid ennui. Run for years by the '1820 Settlers'
Foundation' festival art used to be almost exclusively English (not even
Afrikaans) and derivative of Europe.
This year's festival, too, has its performances of recent London stage hits
(Travels with my Aunt and Arcadia), a good Traviata and some fairly standard
symphonic fare. But the best works are South African originals - and in the
new South Africa, that means anything from township theatre to dramatised
fables, African opera to two-hander tragedies of white domestic life. Of the
12 performances I saw in one short weekend at the festival, there was hardly
a moment to regret. As a hardened Edinburgh-goer, I am ruthless about
abandoning sub-standard performances; at Grahamstown, I stayed to the end of
every show.
Festival organisers, under pressure to make art reflect the complexion of
the new South Africa, say they aim for an equal mix between indigenous works
and those originating abroad. 'We don't want to lose the Western component,'
festival chairman Professor Alan Crump told the Johannesburg newspaper, the
Weekly Mail, recently. 'It is a mistake to go blindly indigenous. If it's a
question of baby and bath water, what we want to do is create a swimming
pool.'
He points out that there is no reason to believe that black South Africans
only like African art - far from it. Ballroom dancing has gained enormous
popularity in black townships, the Soweto String Quartet has an enthusiastic
following - maybe opera will take off as well, he suggests.
The challenge for South African art is not just to adapt Western forms to
African audiences, but to develop works which draw life from each of the
country's many cultures, or from several at once. To judge from the festival
offerings, non-verbal art forms such as dance do this most effectively: the
Zimbabwe modern dance troupe Tumbuka almost makes a joke of it, alternating
Strauss waltz tunes and African drums in stunning routines choreographed for
white woman and black man; and the opera Enoch, Prophet of God, performed as
a work in progress, uses traditional Xhosa church hymns and the contemporary
score of composer Roelof Temmingh to tell the powerful story of the massacre
of an Israelite religious sect in 1921. It is a haunting and lovely work
which provides hope that high-brow art forms can prove their worth in the
new South Africa.
The festival does not entirely escape from old-style moralising: for those
whose liberal guilt has survived into the post-apartheid era, there is
Emakhishini (In the Kitchen), performed by the Domestic Workers Union of
South Africa. And there are the predictable dramas of feminism, rape,
homosexuality and incest common to all Western festivals (yet even that is
welcome, as it shows South Africa at liberty to indulge its obsessions, just
like any other nation).
What is mostly gone is apartheid angst, and what has mostly replaced it is
wit and satire of a high order. Nicholas Ellenbogen's Theatre for Africa
performs several short plays based on visual wit and fable which are a
delightful break with the past; Themi Venturas' Birth of an African Day is
billed as a 'celebration of South African poetry, prose and drama' but is
far more entertaining than the blurb would allow; and the Amakhwenkwe
Cultural Group (despite its rather literal name) pokes fun at apartheid -
and even at Nelson Mandela - in its play Eita Da] Hoezit? The most
distressing performance I saw was not really about South Africa at all; a
drama of domestic violence, Vanessa Cooke's This is for Keeps, which could
be set anywhere that men abuse women, and get away with it.
After hours, there is cabaret, jazz, pasta and drink - pretty much along
Edinburgh lines, except the wine is better. Numerous craft markets sell not
only African crafts, but South Africa's own version of the traditional. And
Grahamstown's well-preserved Cape Dutch architecture is a constant pleasure.
The only disappointment was the accommodation - festival goers are put up in
some of the coldest private homes in the southern hemisphere. But despite
the cold, the sun celebrated the arrival of the new South Africa - shining
as brightly as on the day Nelson Mandela was inaugurated, and liberated art
finally from the struggle.
The Grahamstown Festival continues until Sunday.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Caribbean rhythm and blues - A bittersweet myth of
love and innocence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Broadway to Birmingham Rep: Once On This Island has opened in the
Second City after a year and a half on the Great White Way, following modest
off-Broadway beginnings. A bittersweet myth that recounts in Caribbean
rhythms and melody the ill-fated love of a peasant girl for one of the
mulatto haut monde and how she changes, like Daphne, into a tree that
shelters him throughout his life until one day they are reunited.
Despite informative, one might say didactic, programme notes on colonialism
and slavery, the piece's charm lies in its innocence and apparent absence of
preaching. The plot unfolds as a story told to soothe a frightened child in
a thunderstorm, the tale of a girl so happy that the gods decide to 'knock
some sense in her head'. The all-black cast moves from supernatural to
earthy, from historical to modern (the young dude wears a sharp suit, the
accident by a pair of headlights; but his father sports an ancien regime
cravat and waistcoat). In the production by David Toguri (choreographer) and
Gwenda Hughes, ten adults and one child make up a company of markedly
individual talents including such established West End and recording
favourites as Shezwae Powell and PP Arnold, not to mention Clive Rowe, Mr
Snow in the National's Carousel. The result is totally infectious.
Lynn Ahrens (book and lyrics) and Stephen Flaherty (music) have kept the
show to 90 minutes, without interval, with scarcely any spoken dialogue.
The score is mainstream rather than rock, in the tripping syncopations and
wistful melodic line of the Afro-Caribbean with a strong French flavour.
Poignant waltzes evoke the old Gallic influences, both in a brisk
post-Toussaint L'Ouverture history lesson and the society ball where little
Ti Moune learns that her beloved is engaged to someone else. A vein of
sombre lyricism in the more introspective ballads steers well clear of
sentimentality or Lloyd Webbery.
The show is something of a triumph for Lorna Brown as Ti Moune, who declares
of her creole lover that 'his ancestor once loved a peasant girl; this time
he will marry one'. She sets off in search of the impossible on the steep
winding ramp of Kendra Ullyart's revolving set, flanked with palms and
shanty porches. Alas, this is no road to Oz, merely the other side of the
island where she can be a mistress but never a wife. Brown looks 14, has a
terrifyingly vulnerable air of wide-eyed wonder and a radiant,
heart-touching smile, and can belt out a song with the assurance of someone
twice her age.
The same careful casting has gone into the rest of the ensemble, whether as
trees, frogs, birds, malicious gossips or all-powerful deities - Rowe hisses
out a malevolent incitement to murder as a snake-hatted god of death. The
magnificently baritonal Sharon D Clark socks a number called 'Mama will
provide' to us, resembling a cross between Jessye Norman and Carmen Miranda.
Suzanne Packer brings incisive style to the socially acceptable fiancee.
Great fun; very touching; only the jinx that traditionally hangs over
interval-less shows makes me concerned for its possible West End career.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Heritage at a price - Classing a Van Gogh as an
historic monument is costing the French government dear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, the French ministry of culture gave only half a sigh of relief
after a Paris appeal court reduced compensation, payable by the state to
Jacques Walter, the owner of a Van Gogh painting classified as an
'historical monument', from Ffr422m to Ffr150m. The tortured and
claustrophobic 'Jardin a Auvers', painted a few days before the artist's
suicide, had been classified and prevented from leaving the country in July
1989. It was sold at auction in Paris in December 1992 for Ffr55m, a sixth
of its estimated value on the international art market.
The compensation which the state must now pay, for the first time ever, is
equivalent to 18 months of the budget of all France's national museums for
the purchase of works of art. The advisers of culture minister Jacques
Toubon met immediately after the court's ruling to discuss whether the state
could avoid payment and also ponder the wisdom of taking the case a legal
step higher to the Cour de Cassation.
Alarmed by the Walter verdict, French art historians, museum curators and Mr
Toubon have called for radical legal and fiscal reforms to preserve the
nation's artistic heritage without bankrupting the state through the
purchase of works at international prices it can ill afford, or the payment
of compensation.
The ministry of culture hoping that the compensation award might be
overturned, waited for last week's verdict before deciding on its next moves
on tax reform. Toubon, who says he is very impressed by British tax
facilities in the same field, could start pressing his finance ministry
colleagues in the autumn for fiscal reforms which would constitute a
different form of compensation for the owners of national art treasures, and
one less traumatic for museum funds. Ministry advisers have been working on
proposals to waive death duty, for example, for the owners of art works
which have dropped in value because they cannot be sold on the international
market - either because the state has taken the unusual step, as with the
Van Gogh, of making a work an historical monument, or more simply, refusing
it permission to leave the country.
Jacques Walter's Van Gogh was classified before the introduction last year
of a system of 'certificates', which are required to enable works of art of
a given market value to leave France. Dismayed by the Walter verdict and
unhappy with the certificate system, Pierre Rosenberg, curator-in-chief of
paintings at the Louvre, and Francoise Cachin, head of Paris's Orsay Museum,
have demanded a new legal and tax framework to preserve the country's art
masterpieces. Both curators have praised the way in which Italy, Germany and
Spain list works which may not leave the country and have enthused over the
'pragmatic wisdom' of Britain's methods of retaining art works of interest
for a period of six months and granting tax favours to art owners.
Francoise Cachin and Pierre Rosenberg have called on the French government
as a matter of urgency to boost French museums' meagre Ffr100m annual budget
for acquiring works of art. They also recommend tax measures similar to
those under discussion by the ministry of culture to encourage art
collectors not only to preserve, but also to acquire national treasures.
Making French cultural authorities additionally nervous this summer, is
another lawsuit being pressed by Jacques Walter to obtain nothing less than
restitution of the extraordinary Walter-Guillaume art collection housed in
the Orangerie in Paris. It comprises, among many others, 24 Renoirs, 16
Cezannes, 10 Matisses and 12 Picassos, and was bequeathed to the state in
two instalments in 1958 and 1963 by Juliette Lacaze, successively the widow
of the dealer Paul Guillaume and of Jean Walter, the father of Jacques. The
Walter family claims that Juliette Lacaze donated money to the Louvre to
enable the museum to buy the paintings, thus disguising the donation as a
purchase to avoid a legal obligation to bequeath part of the heritage to her
husband's children.
Following last week's verdict on the Van Gogh compensation, Jacques Walter
also intends attacking the French state in the European courts for failing
to pay interest on the Ffr150m which he may now, at long last, receive.

<TEXT>
TWELVE RED HERRINGS by Jeffrey Archer HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 324 pages
Once upon a time, a London newspaper called the Evening News used to run a
daily short story. They were very short indeed but they offered well-turned
entertainments designed to divert the home-bound commuter for ten minutes or
so; the contributors included respectable and well-known popular authors who
knew they were not competing with Chekhov or Maupassant.
You cannot - unless you are a genius - do very much in a couple of thousand
words: you can provide a smile or a sigh; you can amuse or distract; this is
all too often the art of the anecdote.
Jeffrey Archer, when he pauses from his best-selling novels to don the hat
of the short story writer, is very much in this tradition: he tells
anecdotes. Middle-class and middle-aged. On the jacket of his latest
collection, Twelve Red Herrings, a comparison is made with Somerset Maugham.
This is a gross libel on a long-dead artist, the hem of whose garment the
noble lord is unworthy to touch. But let us lean over to be fair. Archer
takes a lot of critical stick for his books but constantly tops best-seller
lists. On the strength of these dozen tales, what are his qualities?
Without a doubt, he has the mysterious gift of persuading you to keep
turning the pages even while you protest that life is too short. He has no
gift for, and no apparent interest in, description, even when he sets his
scene in Greece; his vocabulary is minimal; his dialogue is an
undifferentiated middle-English; his prose is as flat as the fens that
adjoin his fragrant household. But I confess that I read every page of
Twelve Red Herrings.
I regret it, of course. I should have been warned by the author's own
admission that nine of these 12 stories 'are based on known incidents . .
.', which is rather odd, implying that the wells of the imagination have
been running low.
Thus, we have an old Bond Street anecdote of husband and lover unwittingly
sharing the million-pound cost of a bauble for a beautiful woman, another of
an Iraqi exile appalled to find himself on a flight diverted to Baghdad,
another of an author listening in horror as a friend rehearses to him a
draft plot of a book he himself has just finished, and yet another - yes,
anecdote is the word - of an Aids victim who tries to con the insurance
company by sending his lover to take his medical.
Very occasionally there is a flash of wit - 'like a chain-smoker, the former
Colombian model was already searching for her next spouse before she had
extracted the last gasp from the old one'. There is a well-timed twist in
the brisk story of a woman terrorised on a motorway. Cliche abounds: the
life insurance salesman licks his lips; the pickpocket jailbird is called
'Fingers', the bank manager is absurdly provincial.
Sometimes the plot is worrying: cannot doctors tell if you are faking
blindness? How likely is a murder trial without a body? Now and again there
is a mistake - the FT has never had a 'City Editor'. And the final episode
is a slight and old-fashioned parlour game in which a brief story is given
four alternative endings.
Not, I suggest, a book to sustain a vacation, or even a flight. But it might
do for the departure lounge. I now see why the chairmanship of the Party
once beckoned.

<TEXT>
WAGES OF GUILT by Ian Buruma Jonathan Cape Pounds 18.99, 330 pages
Germany and Japan lost the war but comprehensively won the peace. They are
economic giants which dominate much of the world economy. What their
erstwhile leaders failed to achieve with force they have since peacefully
conquered by commerce. Having once provoked the world's disgust, they now
command admiration. Herein lies a vibrant moral.
Their success was not of course entirely home-grown. As soon as hostilities
were over the Allies needed them in the confrontation with Moscow. Aid and
expertise poured in, and neither was burdened by defence spending.
Reconstruction at home and help from abroad make a fertile loam for their
economies.
But this peacetime success story cannot obliterate some ugly facts.
Germany's Nazis and Japan's war leaders were responsible for horrific
crimes. Unquestionably the greatest was the Nazi attempt to murder Jewry.
This endeavour was not matched, in its deliberation and vast industrial
scale, by the Japanese. Their crimes, such as the inhuman prison camps, the
use of human subjects in experiments, and the Rape of Nanking - six weeks of
rape, cruelty and murder in which a quarter of a million Chinese civilians
died at the hands of marauding Japanese soldiers - took place on a different
scale, and with less cold-blooded efficiency.
But what do Germans and Japanese now think about their recent past? Buruma
has interviewed, observed and probed, alert both to the hollowness of
excuses and the theatricalities of insincere repentance.
The result is absorbing and sometimes surprising. Buruma offers non-Germans
and non-Japanese an insight into the mentality of the heirs of blame. For
the heirs themselves his book should make highly salutary reading, because
there are still too many who deny the facts and therefore the guilt, and
that is frightening. Buruma exposes them, but at the same time honours those
in both countries who face up to the past. And he is not averse to reminding
the war's victors of their own crimes, for example at Dresden and Hiroshima.
There is a predictable divide between right and left. Liberals and
left-wingers in Germany are ridden with horror at what some among their
parents' generation did, and at the national culpability for letting it
happen. Philosemitism is common among Germans of this persuasion, as a
gesture of reparation and conciliation. But attitudes on the further reaches
of the political right range from self-exculpation to denial, together with
ugly scenes of Nazi-saluting thugs attacking foreigners. So far, at least,
the standard view is closer to the former than the latter. One good way of
avoiding a repetition of the past is to know it for what it was. Many in
Germany have swallowed hard and looked into the mirror; and they have seen
that they are the people of Goethe and Beethoven, Belsen and Auschwitz.
In Japan, matters are worryingly otherwise. Some plucky left-leaning
teachers attempt to breach the official silence about Japanese war crimes by
telling students what happened in the prison camps of Manchuria and the
streets of Nanking. Notoriously, school histories pass these matters over in
silence or a few vague sentences, for the establishment line is that Japan
was not the perpetrator but the victim of war crimes: specifically, the
atom-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The former city has become a shrine, built around a vast memorial 'Peace
Park'. It is as if the terrible flash over Hiroshima wiped blank the slate
of the preceding years, obliterating memories of Manchuria and Pearl Harbour
and Japanese soldiers using live Chinese prisoners for bayonet practice. In
Buruma's view, all but a brave few among the Japanese try either to justify
or forget the wartime past, using the large figleaf of the atom bombings to
do so.
There is nothing mealy-mouthed about refusing to allow Japan the comfort of
forgetfulness. Buruma uncompromisingly reminds us that British bombers
flattened Dresden and killed 30,000 citizens in a single air raid of no
military value. The American atom bomb attacks were horrific mass murders of
civilians. Victors do not get tried for war crimes; had Bomber Harris and
the crew of the Enola Gay been indicted, what would have made them
different? But the Allies' sins fall far short of Japanese war crimes, and
very far short of what the Nazis did. Preventing a recurrence of these evils
depends on responsibility for them being accepted in the right quarters.
Buruma shows that in this respect, Germany is far ahead of Japan.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Books: In bed with all the Clinton factions - Jurek Martin
reviews Bob Woodward's latest sleuthing venture, a perversely riveting read
for the Washington cognoscenti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AGENDA: INSIDE THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE by Bob Woodward Simon &amp; Schuster
Pounds 14.99, 352 pages
Bob Woodward really is the most amazing investigative reporter. He gets
everywhere. Here we are on the very first page of his latest book and the
famous Watergate sleuth is actually in bed with Bill and Hillary Clinton, or
perhaps under it.
We must assume he was there because the conversation between the two, in
late August, 1991, and about whether Bill should run for president, is all
in direct quotes. And they both speak in complete sentences, apart from
three 'yeahs' from Hillary, which few people, even those as articulate as
the Clintons, ever manage in the informality of their own private quarters.
There is a severe temptation to put this book down after the first page, so
preposterous is its beginning and so presumptuous is the hypothesis laid out
in the introduction. This temptation should not necessarily be resisted,
partly because of the methodology (as in his last book, The Commanders,
about the US military, conversations are 'recreated' throughout the book on
the basis of extensive but off-the-record interviews), partly because it is
so poorly written and partly because the numbing detail of the twists and
turns of the debate over US economic policy in the first seven months of the
Clinton administration can be of interest only to the truly devoted or those
with axes to grind.
But, all that said, it is a perversely riveting read for the cognoscenti. It
has been devoured in the US capital because it is all about Washington
people, processes and mores, triple navels which consume the city's everyday
life. The Washington Post, the hometown newspaper which is Woodward's
employer, spread it all over the front pages for four days in a row (cynics
believe that all the best material was in these extracts).
It also matters, given that Washington does not like the Clinton crowd and
vice versa, that it does not show the president, his wife and his government
in the best of lights. They come over as a group of disorganised well
meaning incompetents who cannot work out whether to increase taxes or cut
them and who are eternally surprised when Congress does not do their
bidding.
Woodward announces that he got interested in the economy as long ago as
1992, which suggests we must confine the collective wisdom of Keynes,
Friedman, Galbraith and several Austrians to the wastebasket. Perhaps his
newness to the business of economic policy-making and his own membership of
the Washington establishment explains why the eminence grise of his book is
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a de facto pillar
of that establishment.
It is Greenspan, we are assured, who educates an administration inclined to
be contemptuous of Wall Street, in the importance of the bond market. Lower
interest rates, he kept pointing out, took some of the pain out of necessary
cuts in public spending. Thus, so long as long term rates kept going down,
as they did during the book's time span, the bond markets became the 'new
God.'
It stretches credulity to accept that wily old pols like Lloyd Bentsen, the
treasury secretary, and Wall Street veterans like Robert Rubin and Roger
Altman were unaware of this phenomenon, even if there was a
politico-economic clique in the administration uncomfortable with it. It
also insults intelligent non-economic members of the Clinton team, like
George Stephanopoulos, to imply prior ignorance of the importance of
markets.
It also dangerously simplifies the eternally shifting and complex
relationship between the head of the independent central bank and the
government. Greenspan is a subtle operator, to be sure, with finely tuned
political antennae. But he also answers to his own board, to the markets and
to his own economic policy instincts, responsibilities which hardly square
with the quasi-Machiavellian role ascribed to him.
Where the book does hit home is in its portrayal of the factions inside the
Clinton crowd. There are, indeed, several power centres, starting with a
president of superior intellect and involvement but chronically disorganised
and indecisive.
There is a Hillary faction, an Al Gore faction, deficit versus investment
factions, and the influential group of external political advisers
technically not on the White House staff whose mission is to ensure Mr
Clinton does not forget all the promises that got him elected.
This last group - James Carville, Paul Begala, Mandy Grunwald and Stan
Greenberg - come over as prime sources for the book. Some may regret this.
Begala, for example, discloses that his nickname for Leon Panetta, then
budget director, was 'the poster boy for economic constipation.' Panetta has
just been named White House chief of staff with a mandate to shake-up the
operation which, if he bears grudges, just might include limiting Begala's
access to the presidential ear.
But this is perhaps the most remarkable thing about the book. Just about
everybody, insiders, outsiders and even, on the basis of the first page, the
Clintons themselves, appears to have talked to Bob Woodward. It is almost as
if they all felt that not to talk to him would be like a good Catholic
avoiding the confessional. Retribution might not be papal but the Washington
knife is much to be feared.
Yet, having cooperated, they find that the Woodward book, for all its
manifold faults, comes over as a mean stiletto. It is no small wonder that
its sources have greeted it mostly with a deafening silence, interspersed
with occasional mutterings that it is all about 'process' and not about
'substance'.
Mary McGrory, the salty veteran Washington columnist, suspects that the book
was the last straw for Clinton in reshuffling his White House pack.
'Plainly, people who have time to give Woodward four or five interviews -
while other calls go unreturned - and press on him internal documents of
fair sensitivity could use some reminders of their primary responsibility.'

THALBERG: THE LAST TYCOON AND THE WORLD OF MGM by Roland Flamini Andre
Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 302 pages
WALT DISNEY: HOLLYWOOD'S DARK PRINCE by Marc Eliot Andre Deutsch Pounds
17.99, 296 pages
Was Walt Disney the illegitimate son of a Spanish washerwoman? Did Irving
Thalberg, MGM's boy-wonder mogul, enjoy evenings of cross-dressing with
actress wife Norma Shearer? Did Walt himself dress up in his mother's
clothes (assuming she was his mother) during his strange, tortured
childhood?
Film biographies are a law unto themselves. Studio chieftains may be boring
administrators with one eye on the balance sheet, the other on getting home
for dinner: but not if their portraitists in print can help it. Here, in two
movie monographs, are two of the season's likeliest controversy-stirrers. Or
rather one stirrer and one gentler probe - Roland Flamini's Thalberg - with
a few gossipy grace-notes.
Irving Thalberg was the model for F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'last tycoon' and
the most meteoric figure in movie management history. A top Universal
executive at 20, he was running MGM, with a little help from LB Mayer, at
age 23. Frail of health, he was small and thin but handsome-featured, with a
faint resemblance to Fitzgerald himself. The novelist worked for Thalberg
during a brief galley-slave interlude in Hollywood and obviously saw a
mirror image in this tragic showman who would die young (37), after a life
spent trying to beat some quality into that vulgar beast called cinema.
But how much do we prize that 'quality' today? When we look at Thalberg's
movies - The Barretts Of Wimpole Street, Romeo And Juliet, Marie Antoinette
 -we seem to be talking more about Quality Street: a confectioner's parade
of literature-based period goodies, in which brave men and noble women
(usually played by his wife) stand up and accost the camera with deathless
prose.
And when not turning MGM into a movie-world Madame Tussauds, Thalberg
volunteered for critical execration when he pushed Erich Von Stroheim off
the Mayer payroll. He famously sacked the actor-director for going over
budget on his 1922 extravaganza Merry-Go-Round. Then later, when accident
brought the Teuton back into Thalberg's orbit, the young executive sliced
Erich's five-hour 'masterpiece' Greed - to posterity's horror - to 2 1/2
 hours.
But Flamini offers some counter-attacking facts. Thalberg pressed for many
projects that the prudish Mayer thought too risque. He brought writers like
Fitzgerald and Faulkner to Hollywood. And he persuaded Mayer - for which all
else might be forgiven - to sign up the Marx Brothers.
As for the private Thalberg, Flamini peers and guesses. He sees a gentle,
undersexed man who escorted Norma through a married life of such amorous
uneventfulness - apart from some sketchily-sourced garment-swapping - that
after his death Norma went on a crazed promiscuity spree.
But the book also suggests that Thalberg's repressed libido found expression
in a liking for kinkier, more 'daring' movie projects than Mayer favoured.
Thalberg approved the foot fetishism and other piquancies in Stroheim's
films - it was the prolix director's 'footage fetishism' he lost patience
with. And he encouraged Jean Harlow to bring some much-needed earthiness to
MGM. Indeed if it had not been for Norma and her costume parades, the
Thalberg filmography might be a lot more interesting and outre than it seems
today.
Can you name an illegitimate French-Hispanic American who became an FBI
informant in the brief intervals between drinking to excess and indulging
what we may call the Lady Macbeth Syndrome: obsessive hand-washing. He was
also a union-basher, a childhood cross-dresser and an anti-semite.
Yes, it is Walt Disney. And there is more. According to Marc Eliot's Walt
Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince, the creation of Donald, 'the sexually
provocative, libidinous duck,' represented 'a full-scale merging of Disney's
psychic lifeblood with his animated inkworld.' And what Eliot says about
Snow White and the dwarves we will leave to your imagination.
All this should be a surprise only to those not steeped in
now-it-can-be-told biographies. We know that JM Barrie, AA Milne, Beatrix
Potter and other children's artists were deeply sick people, who would
probably have been serial killers if not tempted sideways by literature. So
why not Walt?
Some of Eliot's book is well-sourced, though not actually new. Much of it is
wild speculation: especially the illegitimacy and the psychosexual movie
interpretations. But perhaps we are none of us harmed by the occasional
adventurist rip into the hygienic fabric of the Disney ethos.

The Halifax-Nationwide waltz has struck up again. In the May figures for
house prices, Nationwide stepped forward and Halifax back. But in June it
was about-turn, Nationwide stepping back 0.7 per cent and Halifax forward
all of 0.3 per cent.
More significant than these monthly variations is that both are more or less
in harmony on the annual change - Halifax says 1.5 per cent up and
Nationwide 1 per cent.
And their indices are not too far adrift. With a base for both of 100 in
1983, Halifax now stands at 201.9 and Nationwide at 195.6. Their figures,
and those for sales and mortgages, continue to paint a general picture of a
stumbling recovery in the housing market. But local scenes can be very
different.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's prime London residential property index shows an
average increase of 9.9 per cent, from June 1993 to June 1994, and agents'
offices in Kensington report booming business.
It does not need many City bonuses to push prices up when the recipients all
decide to spend them on the same sort of family house.
The rises in central London have spread through to the home counties,
notably along the M3 corridor. At present, a decent house in the Pounds
250,000-Pounds 500,000 range in north-east Hampshire, will have several
would-be buyers offering the asking price in days, leading to a private
auction or best and final offers - while parents are queueing to inspect the
local schools. But elsewhere in the country - Worcestershire, for example -
I still hear of price cuts.
Sterndale has converted the shell of a 17th century property into seven
spacious and stylish houses in the first stage of a 21-house development at
Lindridge Park, near Teignmouth in Devon.
The development will include the old coach house and detached houses in the
walled garden.
John Baring, of Exeter, whose son, Francis, founded Baring Brothers, the
merchant bank, bought the house in 1747 for Pounds 8,000. In the 1960s the
property burnt down.
The house is in a peaceful valley with views to Dartmoor. Its treat is the
garden, laid out in 1913 as a combination of formal, wild and water gardens,
which all at Lindridge will share. Sterndale is restoring it, cutting the
yew so that it will grow again as topiary, recovering shrubs in the dell and
clearing an elaborate (and blocked) system of watercourses.
The garden's focus is a round pond with a round temple on a round island.
Walls and buttresses of yew enclose the walk around the pond and two low
bridges cross to the temple. Prices from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in nearby
Exeter (0392-433033) range from Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 275,000.
Water is also a feature at Giffords Hall, Wickhambrook, near Bury St
Edmunds, Suffolk. This early Tudor timber house, is listed grade I. A moat
with plants dipping into the water holds the garden design together. A
three-arch bridge crosses it and leads to the unusual oak-timbered, red
brick house - many of the bricks laid in a herringbone pattern.
The house is superb, with a great hall with linenfold panelling on the
ground floor. Above that is a solar (or great chamber) with a
Perpendicular-style solid oak ceiling. The fireplace still has names and
slogans scratched in English, Greek and Latin from three, four or five
centuries ago.
The house was rewired four years ago and the double glazing in some rooms is
of the highest quality I have seen, with the inner layer encased in oak. The
local builder knows the house through and through.
Last week the garden was heavy with rose scent. Beyond the moat is a formal
trellised garden, with box hedges in a knot pattern and a rose arbour
leading to a walled garden. The views are superb.
This gem of old England is well placed for Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and
Cambridge. Pounds 1.3m buys the estate of 338 acres. The house and 95 acres,
including a wood and a medieval stew pond for keeping fish, are priced at
Pounds 850,000 from Savills, Ipswich (0473-226191).
A house which belonged to Professor Cyril Parkinson, of Parkinson's Law
fame, has just been sold by Kent agents Calcutt McLean for around Pounds
150,000. The three-bedroom home, at 36 Harkness Drive, Canterbury, was sold
to buyers from London.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Property: Signs that add kudos to your home - London's
intriguing blue plaque house scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delightful curiosities on the streets of London include oval blue plaques,
marking the place where famous people lived or worked. They can suddenly
transport the stroller, or the prospective buyer, into a world of history
and imagination.
To discover that Karl Marx or Dr Johnson 'lived here' can cause even the
busiest pedestrian to pause and speculate. And the signs can invest a
particular property, even a street, with an aura of class.
It is difficult to say whether this distinction translates into a premium
price when a property is sold - perhaps not - but they must at least help to
excite the interest of prospective buyers.
These plaques, that mark not only where London's famous inhabitants lived,
but where great moments in the city's history took place, reflect the rich
variety of capital life. People as diverse as Nancy Astor, the first woman
MP, and French writer Emile Zola are remembered by them. Many, however,
commemorate those who are less well-known, reminding or informing passers-by
of their achievements.
Sir David Low (1891-1963), the cartoonist who created Colonel Blimp, lived
at Melbury Court, Kensington High Street, London W8. Dr Charles Vickery
Drysdale (1874-1961), a founder of the Family Planning Association, opened
his first birth control clinic in 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth, London
SE17, and changed countless lives. Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) of Donovan
Court, Drayton Gardens SW10, was a pioneer of the study of molecular
structures.
The Royal Society of Arts began the blue plaque scheme in 1867, starting at
Byron's birthplace in Holles Street, W1 (now demolished). London County
Council took it over in 1901 and ran the scheme until passing it on to the
Greater London Council in 1965. Since 1986 English Heritage has run it.
Unofficial plaques also exist in London - the Dead Comics Society put one up
to mark the home of comedy actor Kenneth Williams (1926-1988) in Marlborough
House, Osnaburgh Street, NW1.
And there is nothing to stop any property owner putting up a blue plaque if
it has the necessary planning permissions, including listed building consent
and/or conservation area consent.
There are now 616 official plaques, of which the Royal Society of Arts has
put up 36 (only 13 survive) the LCC 249, the GLC 262, and English Heritage
83. Nine have been erected by other bodies.
English Heritage erects about 12 plaques a year. Its Blue Plaques committee,
part of its London advisory committee, meets twice a year to pick them from
25-30 candidates suggested by the public.
If you are famous and live in London today, however, you have no chance of
seeing your own name on a blue plaque - English Heritage will not even
consider you for the honour until 20 years after your death or 100 years
from your birth - apart from rare exceptions.
In addition to this rule, official blue plaque houses must meet the
following criteria:
There must be a surviving building (or possibly an identical replacement on
the same site); or it must be a site of special historical interest, such as
'The first flying bomb on London fell here 13 June 1944' - Railway Bridge,
Grove Road, E3.
The candidates must be thought eminent by their own profession, or have made
an important positive contribution to human welfare or happiness, and/or
have had such remarkable personalities that a well-informed passer-by
recognises their names at once, and they must deserve recognition.
Fictional characters do not qualify (Sherlock Holmes excepted).
And (since 1987) if a candidate has a plaque at one building, they cannot
have another.
Foreigners must have an international reputation or significant standing in
their own countries and have been in London at an important time in their
life and work. Prince Peter Kropotkin - 1802-1894 'theorist of anarchism' -
lived at 6 Crescent Road, Bromley, and Karl Marx at 28 Dean Street, W1.
Would-be owners of blue plaque homes may be interested in two properties
currently for sale. PG Wodehouse lived at 17 Dunraven Street, W1, now
converted into flats and maisonettes (Blenheim Bishop, 071-629 2484;
Wetherell 071-493 6935; and John D Wood, 071-408 0055). Two maisonettes and
two flats are offered at between Pounds 275,000 and Pounds 550,000.
Emily Davies, founder of Girton College, Cambridge, lived at 8 Cunningham
Place, NW8, near Lord's cricket ground. John D Wood (071-267 3267) offers it
at Pounds 475,000.
The Blue Plaque Guide costs Pounds 6.50 (Journeyman Press, 1991)

FT  09 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Real cross-border co-operation - Gardening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind every gardener stands another gardener: a parent or a partner, an
author or some poor soul on piece rates bribed to mow the lawn before Friday
evening. Behind me stands a German.
Thirty years ago, there stood a lot of Germans, because I was working in
their greatest botanic garden as one of the staff of 80. When I spill earth
on a path, I still fear German discipline. When I look at mixed hardy
planting, I see it as my German garden taught me, in terms of its countries
of origin. Chinese gentians still strike me as surprising when planted among
penstemons from the Rocky Mountains.
Last week, my old shadow came back to life in the Jodrell Lecture Theatre at
Kew Gardens in south-west London, where more than 200 high-paying visitors
had packed into an Anglo-German gardening summit. Our theme was Designing
with Perennials, under the challenging slogan of 'widespread ignorance of
revolutionary new approaches to herbacious planting, especially in Germany'.
The occasion was the brain-child of Tim Rees and Brita von Schoenaich, two
former Kew students, who showed signs of organising the landscape with all
the energy and style with which they organised five speakers, an itinerant
German task force, and a new cross-border initiative in Europe (in the full
botanical sense). As the German speakers stressed how different hardy
perennials have been classified for different ecologies, my old shadow felt
at ease.
Professional German order was back on the botanical map and we Britons were
being reminded that plants grow best in gardens when they are suited in
nature to the same geographic conditions.
Colour slides made happy reference to the flora of the steppe land. At the
sight of the Steppenheide (moorland), my old shadow started to frolic and
sprout a furry, grey coat of contentment.
This fascinating summit brought out the different strengths of German
gardening. In Britain, the best garden-makers are amateurs who are trained
privately and whose sights are raised by one another.
They view a Dip. Hort. as a short-cut to chopped bark and ground cover and,
rightly, trust their own good taste, which they bring from artistic areas of
life. German gardening strikes them as the Cinderella of Europe.
Can anyone name a private garden in Germany which a keen British aficionado
would go out of his way to visit on holiday? I wish I could, but much German
gardening is about technology and gadgets.
Germany has great gardens, but all of them are public and civic, like few of
those in the UK. I think of the rose garden at Zweibrucken near Saarbrucken
and the Weihenstephan nursery-landscaping near Munich.
Professional botanical knowledge is superbly strong in Germany, and beyond
it stretches a richer and more varied flora in the wild of moorland, the
flowery meadows of the Allgau and the high mountains of the south.
The cities have also gained from urban garden festivals. In Britain, the
festivals at Liverpool and Stoke fizzled out as gimmicks for the family. In
Germany, you still come on great legacies of festival planting, whether in
the excellent expanse of public planting beyond the main station in
Stuttgart or on a former gravel tip of hopelessness in the heart of Munich.
In 1983, Munich hosted a great Garden Festival in the city Westpark which
lay beside a housing estate in the city district of Laim.
European breeders offered dozens of their brightest irises and day-lilies
and it was left to an interior designer-turned landscaper to arrange this
challenge as a work of art.
None of her Kew audience would doubt that in Rosemarie Weisse we were
encountering one of Europe's outstanding landscape gardeners. She has
transformed the public space of the Westpark to the point where we all ought
to go and see her artistry, at its best in late May.
Munich is the place for keen gardeners to visit, when the great alpine
garden of its botanical gardens is at a peak.
What, then, of revolution? In her case, it consists in large-scale plantings
of herbaceous perennials outside the framework of a border, but in the
manner of a natural steppe among ornamental grasses for autumn colour and
seed heads.
Behind the style stands Professor Richard Hansen, now in his 80s, whose
master guide to perennials and their ecology has just been translated by
Cambridge University Press. The art is to suit perennials to the ecology of
the site so that they will persist for years and wander like dandelions.
Hansen's fine gardens at Weihenstephan put these ideas into practice in the
1950s and Rosemarie Weisse is one of his beneficiaries, adding her own
delicate sense of shape and colour.
Herbaceous perennials are often tricky and English gardeners are much more
wary of them than their image as masters of the herbaceous border implies to
foreigners. Many look beastly after flowering.
I remember hearing them described as 'gaily-coloured hay' and I did feel
that some of our professional speakers had a curious sense of what counts as
structure in a garden's planting.
Some of the most vigorous forms are a stale pink or a pussycat shade of
mauve and, in spite of the Germans' slides shown at Kew, I really do not
want big groups of dreary old polygonum bistorta, a plant which I am pleased
to have shown the red card from the garden many years ago.
In the British tradition, I thought back to William Robinson and Graham
Thomas. In the late 1960s, Graham Thomas's book, Ground Cover Plants,
pointed many of us to ways which were not so different to Hansen's results.
Readers of Robinson's Wild Garden in the 1870s will find that he was not
only thinking of dotting a plant here or there in a natural park. His
illustrations and references, to other gardens now lost, back up his
campaign for plantings of non-native plants running wild in light grass, not
yet more British buttercups, but irises, peonies, aquilegias and wisterias
up pine-trees.
He had none of the professional's knowledge of plants' persistence in these
surroundings, but personally, I am glad that he did not go in for ornamental
grasses but envisaged that style in the setting of British woodland and
meadows of modest grasses.
For Britain's gardeners our rough grass and orchards are nearest to
Steppenheide. The speaker who talked of forthcoming experiments with hardy
perennials, among less robust green grass on soil of restrained fertility,
seemed to me to be pointing Britain to a way forward.
When British gardens go back, the grass moves in, yet good things survive.
Perhaps we can reverse the traffic and put them out into roughly-mown
grasses.
In short, revolutions are often most revolutionary when they look back to
tradition and reapply them. I think that the great menace to artistic
gardening is the pedantic and increasing nostalgia for nothing but 'native'
plants.
This summit makes me even keener to resist it and much as I respect Hansen's
ecological ground-cover, it is still Robinson's challenge which stretches my
ideas for perennials in Britain. Give me another 10 years, and I too, may
know a little of what my shadows already know over there, in a growing
meadow of emphatically non-native plants.

FT  09 JUL 94 / I'm sorry - the volcano is closed: FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are now in Chile.
Smoke still billowed from the crater of the Llaima volcano, which erupted
spectacularly a few weeks ago, as we arrived to ski on its slopes.
The Llaima ski resort was closed - something we have grown depressingly used
to of late - but we were offered a lift in a rickety 25-year-old snowcat
from Utah which just about made it to the top.
Having now moved to the heart of Chile's lake district, we find there is
another huge, beautiful, smouldering volcano sitting almost in our back
garden. It is Villarica, on whose slopes we have been trying to ski for the
last few days.
But in spite of cloudless blue skies, the wind has been lashing the slopes
with venom and the resort has remained shut.
Every day we drive to the ski area through a forest of huge eucalyptus and
fronds of quilas (bamboo) growing from 20ft-high banks of red earth and
black lava beds: it is the kind of landscape used to depict Venus in the
Eagle comic of the 1950s.
Every day we buy a ticket from a park warden who tells us the ski area is
closed. Hours later we return guiltily from our improvised run wondering
whether he has noticed the fresh snow on our skis.
The rugged four-wheel-drive Lada vehicle we have borrowed from Robert and
Killy Stanton of the Passage to South America tour company can tackle the
barely-passable roads to the ski areas. But red tape threatened our plans to
take it into Argentina.
Luckily, Stanton is a pilot and flew from his village of General Lopez to
Pucon with a document allowing us to cross the border to ski in Bariloche.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Sport: South Africans happy to emphasise freshness - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-nine years after they made their last tour of England, the South
Africans are back on English soil - and are happy not to rush straight into
a Test match.
Weather permitting, they will have played five county games before the first
Test, on July 21, at Lord's. When I watched them play and lose the first of
these, a shortened match against Kent at Canterbury, I could see why their
manager, Mike Procter, wanted a long stint of 'real, tactical cricket'
before a Test.
'It's better and easier like that. County cricket gives us a chance to
practise, to get everyone used to English conditions, to choose our
players.'
At Canterbury the South Africans looked as if they needed practice, although
their two medium-pace bowlers, Craig Matthews and Hansie Cronje, looked
tailor-made for the English game. Matthews bowled off a straight run-up
close to the stumps and got some late movement, mostly into, but also a bit
away from, the batsman. In the overcast Kentish warmth he looked
threatening, although he did not claim a victim.
In the next game, against Sussex, he was upstaged by off-spinner Pat Symcox,
taking five county wickets for 29 on the last day. Procter was not excited
by his country's spin, which he rated as a minor weapon. I have only seen
Tim Shaw, not Symcox, and when I saw him he was slow without much guile.
It will be interesting to see how the visiting spinners develop next to
their more acclaimed faster companions on this tour, especially on
unpredictable wickets like the one at Canterbury, which sent occasional
balls zipping through low and fast, surprising batsmen and wicket-keepers.
The two fastest South African bowlers, Allan Donald and Fanie de Villiers,
have both played in England before, Donald for Warwickshire and de Villiers
first for Kent in 1990, unsuccessfully, then in the Devon League.
They are familiar with English conditions. Against Kent, Donald bowled fast
and, at times, loose. Against Hampshire, he bowled well enough to win the
man of the match award, taking 5 for 58 in the first innings.
The South Africans like to emphasise their freshness and freedom from the
strain of international cricket. This freshness does not mean youth. One of
the striking differences between this summer's two visiting teams is the age
of their new players.
Matthew Hart and Adam Parore, two of New Zealand's 'young guns', are 22 and
23 respectively. South African Daryll Cullinan, fresh rather than a young
gun, is 27. Procter had sensible answers ready for suggestions that his
country had to rely on older players because its younger ones were so
inexperienced.
'Age by itself isn't an issue. It is important to educate players into the
game. We need a balance between experience and youth, not one or the other,'
he says.
His is a generous definition of youth, in modern cricketing terms. He named
Cullinan as a young batsman he would like to see doing well on this tour. At
Canterbury, Cullinan made a time-honoured start to his late English
blossoming when he was caught for nought off the bowling of Dean Headley,
one of Kent's lively agents of the fast medium.
In that match nearly all the South African batting had an impulsive element
and it relied on wicket-keeper David Richardson to lead it from 64 for 6 to
221 for 7, nearly saving the game.
After an orgy of batting practice at Hove - 613 for 8 declared - the South
Africans scored in robust style at Southampton until captain Kepler Wessels
was out for 31, and the free-hitting Jonty Rhodes went for 77. A score of
227 for 6 slumped to 264 for 9 declared.
Wessels is almost too important a presence. He played Tests before South
African cricket was sentenced to solitary confinement and he is its
embodiment of international experience.
He is said to be a personal and spiritual mentor of Cronje, the young
batsman who failed at Canterbury but scored 94 at Hove. Cronje finds
Wessels' strong leadership invaluable, but it can be a weighty burden to
carry and there is a danger of team collapse if the leader fails.
Glamorgan are sometimes liable to depend too heavily on Hugh Morris, their
captain, and South Africa must be careful that Wessels encourages, rather
than overwhelms, the players in his charge.
As one who remembers some of his dogged innings in the past, I find it hard
to think of him as what the official tour programme calls 'inspirational'
and was relieved to hear Procter describe his batting as 'stolid'.
Procter then pointed out how important it was for every team to have one
stolid occupier of the crease. A view confirmed by cricket poets: 'As the
run grafters stay in nice and slow, nice and slow, Oh, my Wessels and my
Boycott long ago' (Thompson/McLean).
Oddly enough, I found myself wondering at Canterbury whether South Africa's
famous fielding might also be, at times, a heavy inheritance. Rhodes took a
breath-taking catch in the covers, leaping fast and high, to remove Neil
Taylor. He obviously revels in the comparisons made with Colin Bland, the
superb 1960s South African fielder.
Most of the South African fielding was fast, with excellent throwing, but it
had lapses, like those of a side tired of its subject. I saw several
failures to stop and to pick up. I am all for dynamic fielding, but not if
it comes at the cost of the Wesselian virtues of steadiness and
concentration. Those have never been South African specialities.
South African cricketing strength has usually been extreme and, if broken,
it can fall into extreme weakness. One among many examples is Graeme Pollock
in the 1960s, a devastating batsman but a vulnerable starter.
As the man next to me in the lunch queue at Canterbury put it: 'I like South
Africa because they have always been a bit potty. They don't play their
cricket by halves. I hope they'll be good to watch this summer and
all-or-nothing to beat. Good luck, Atherton]'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Motoring: Rover's BMW appeal - Stuart Marshall test drives
an estate-cum-tourer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Rover was still controlled by British Aerospace, its executives told
anyone who would listen that one day it would be Britain's BMW and its
products would be as good as BMW's 3-Series and 5-Series.
The take-over earlier this year must have been the last thing they had in
mind. So we have a piquant situation because the first new Rover car to
emerge since control passed to BMW earlier this year is a compact, up-market
estate, appealing to exactly the kind of buyer who now drives a BMW 3-Series
Touring.
Even the name is more or less the same. BMW calls the dual-purpose, load
carrying versions of the 3-Series and 5-Series 'Tourings', not estates. (It
thinks estate cars are rather middle-aged and boring, not youthful and
sporting.)
And what does Rover call its 400 Series estate car? You have, of course,
guessed. The 400 Tourer.
Just like its BMW counterpart, the Rover 400 Tourer is hardly the sort of
estate car that will carry worn-out washing machines to the council tip.
Which is just as well. They would be very difficult to hump aboard as the
load floor is quite a bit lower than the rear sill and this is narrowed by
the tail lights, though not so severely as the current, soon-to-be-replaced,
BMW 3-Series Touring's.
The Rover Tourer is more of a Fortnum's hamper to Glyndebourne, children to
pre-prep schools, kind of estate. One could visualise it standing alongside
a Range Rover Vogue when many a remotely-controlled double garage door is
raised.
There are three versions. The poshest one is the 136 horsepower 420 GSi,
which costs Pounds 15,995 and is pitched at users who expect an estate car
to be sporty as well as practical. As it has far more muscle than the 88
horsepower 418 SLD Turbo (Pounds 14,695) or 111 horsepower 416 SLi Tourer
(Pounds 14,495), it has firmer suspension and bigger wheels and tyres. The
leather and cloth trimmed interior is grander, too.
But all the 400 Tourers are proper Rovers inside. They have drivers'
airbags, split-fold rear seats and neat covers to prevent opportunist
thieves from seeing what is in the load space.
The only one I have driven so far is the 418 SLD Turbo, powered by an 88
horsepower, 1.8-litre turbocharged diesel bought in from PSA
(Peugeot-Citroen Group). This is slightly less powerful than the 1.9-litre
turbo-diesel used in current Citroens and Peugeots because PSA has always
made a point of selling rivals its second-best diesels, not the latest ones.
Diesel buff that I am, I thought the 418 SLD Turbo's performance and
refinement entirely satisfactory on the open road. It would not satisfy a
thrusting driver who must always be at the head of the queue and it did
sound gruffer than a Citroen Xantia or Peugeot 306 - both with the later
1.9-litre turbo-diesel engine - when accelerating through the gears.
Rover's own figures suggest the Pounds 200 price premium of the 418 SLD
Turbo over the 1.6-litre petrol-engined 416 SLi would soon be recovered
through better fuel economy.
The diesel's urban cycle consumption - a good guide to any car's real world
fuel consumption - is 42.8mpg (6.6 l/100km) compared with the 416 SLi's
28.8mpg (9.81 l/100 km) and the 420 GSi's 26.3mpg (10.74 l/100 km).
Two other new Rovers I sampled briefly last week were the 620ti and Vitesse
Sport, both with a 200 horsepower, turbocharged two-litre, four-cylinder
T-series engine and five-speed manual gearbox - there is no automatic
option.
Surrey's leafy lanes and the busy M3 motorway are not the best places to
explore handling or performance potential. I will say only that I am
confident either car would appeal to business motorists who always drive as
though their professional lives depended on getting to meetings for which
they are running very late. Prices are Pounds 19,995 for the 620ti, Pounds
20,995 for the Vitesse Sport.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Germany set to emerge from clearing smoke -
The suspicion is dawning that Berti Vogts' team could do it again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN

<TEXT>
The German teenager looked earnestly into the camera. 'I think it would be
nice,' he told viewers across the Atlantic in careful English, 'if another
country won the World Cup for a change.'
That was nice of him. In the US, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, English, French -
even Brazilian - fans must have cringed. How they would like the chance to
become bored through winning. Since 1954, Germany (or rather West Germany)
have won three of the 10 World Cups; only Brazil have won as many.
In that time, the Germans have been runners-up three times, third once and
fourth once. The last time they failed to reach the semi-finals was in 1978
when they lost to Austria and finished third in their second-round group.
The pattern is generally the same: the Germans move unspectacularly through
their group matches, winning when they have to win, drawing when they do
not. They ease through the early knock-out rounds and suddenly - when the
smoke has cleared - there they are in the semi-finals yet again.
The pattern has been repeated this time. And, with no other team producing
consistently dominating performances - the Brazilians have not scored
enough, the Dutch defence still looks creaky, Italy have been lucky - the
suspicion is dawning that the Germans could do it again.
The unconvincing manner of Germany's progress only increases that
conviction. Where Italy, in the eyes of their fans, have barely scraped
through, Germany have done just enough. Italy were fortunate, Germany
professional.
Germany are the team dubbed by one of America's Spanish-language newspapers
'the famous unknowns'. To the rest of the world they have Rudi Voller,
Jurgen Klinsmann, Lothar Matthaus and eight other guys. It is not as if men
like Thomas Helmer, Matthias Sammer and Martin Wagner are youngsters plucked
from nowhere. They are veterans: experienced, solid, utterly unspectacular.
One reason they are anonymous is that so few of them - only three of the
current squad - play in Italy. Italian clubs seem to have decided that the
top Germans, like their English counterparts, generally do not repay the
investment or lack the flair to be worth one of the precious three foreign
slots in a team.
Even Matthaus, the team's most respected and most capped player, is often
only noticed when hectoring the referee or when he is absent, as he was in
the second half against Belgium. He thumps his long range passes like an
English centre-half clearing upfield. Not for him the elegance and delicacy
of a Michel Platini or a Franz Beckenbauer. It is only when the ball drops
from the sky 60 metres away at the feet of a running team-mate that his
accuracy and vision are revealed.
Only Klinsmann, whose goals carried the team through the first round, and
Thomas Hassler, who runs at defenders from mid-field, have consistently
leavened the Germans' unspectacular approach with a touch of the unexpected.
Voller, the hero of Germany's run to the final in 1986, is a readily
identifiable character, but at 34 he is largely restricted to goal-mouth
loitering, as he showed when he was recalled for the second-round game
against Belgium and scored twice.
Germany only beat Belgium 3-2, with the help of the referee, Kurt
Roethlisberger, who has since said he should have given the Belgians a
penalty. The win against Belgium followed a 3-2 escape against South Korea.
One might have expected some post-match humility from Berti Vogts, the
German manager. But no. 'I want to thank Rudy Voller for his performance. It
was a bold decision on my part to start him, but I knew he is a great
player. I thought we saw a top-class German team today,' said Vogts.
The return of Voller lifted the average age of the 13 men who played against
Belgium to 29 years and eight months. Age has advantages. The players are
experienced and self-confident. On the other hand, their stamina is
questionable, they may find it difficult to adapt - to the heat, for example
 -and they all have strong opinions which they are prepared to express.
The Germans led Spain 1-0 and ended up the weaker team in a 1-1 draw. They
led South Korea 3-0 and then survived a late bombardment to win 3-2. They
led Belgium 3-1, but allowed their opponents to stage a second-half assault.
They have made no secret of the fact that they disliked the heat in Chicago
and Dallas during their first-round games. But, unlike the Irish, they never
turned it into an excuse for losing.
For the second-round game in Chicago, temperatures fell. Even so, the
pattern was repeated, the Germans losing the initiative in the second half.
They can expect it to be hotter in New Jersey for the quarter-finals and
semis and in the 90s if they reach the final in Pasadena.
The Germans will be carrying the effect of their early matches in their
ageing muscles. Players in their 30s, even if they are as fit as the
Germans, recover more slowly than younger men. But Vogts is not giving
Voller a rest yet. Last Monday Vogts announced his quarter-final team a week
in advance, saying the side would be unchanged (with Matthaus back) against
Bulgaria.
Vogts has problems imposing his will on players. He lacks the natural
authority of his predecessor, Franz Beckenbauer. Stefan Effenberg's obscene
gesture, when substituted, may have solved one problem. Vogts immediately
climbed on his high horse and used the opportunity to throw one of his most
persistent public critics off the squad. But things are far from sweetness
and light.
There was a full and frank exchange of views at half-time in the Belgium
game. Afterwards Voller said: 'It wasn't an argument with the coach. It was
sort of communication. After the game everything was fine. We embraced each
other.'
Bulgaria are a team the Germans, and their fans, would expect to handle
comfortably. Hristo Stoichkov and his equally industrious sidekick, Emil
Kostadinov, will test the Germans' creaky, leaky defence, but the Bulgarians
will have had two days less rest and played extra time with 10 men in the
heat last Tuesday. By the end they looked shattered. Stoichkov had run
himself into the ground. Yet they will be able to recall three defenders who
rested on Tuesday, thanks to suspensions.
If it is hot again the Germans must prove that old heads can compensate for
old legs.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Quarter-finals could hang on the ninth team -
The World Cup referees have had more of an influence on some games than the
players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are only nine teams left - seven from Europe, one from South America
and the referees. The eight World Cup teams that have made the
quarter-finals know what they must do to reach next Sunday's final. The nine
remaining referees, all eager to officiate in Pasadena on July 17, must be
pretty confused.
The referees dominated the second-round matches. Kurt Roethlisberger, the
Swiss who harboured realistic hopes of refereeing the final, fell on his
sharpened pencil after the Germany-Belgium match, confessing that he had
missed Thomas Helmer's penalty-area trip on Josip Weber.
His public mea culpa did little good. He will not officiate again in this
World Cup. Fifa, soccer's governing body, does not look kindly on officials
who miss offences that television catches.
But what of poor Arturo Pablo Brizio of Mexico and Jamal Al-Sharif of Syria,
who refereed last Tuesday's two matches like poker players pulling cards
from their pockets at every opportunity? Surely they were doing Fifa's
bidding? Apparently not; neither has been kept on for the last three rounds.
Fifa is using its referees to conduct a re-education programme of players.
All sorts of things they are used to doing are no longer allowed. Want to
kick or trip an opponent? Yellow card. Want to dive, feign injury, shoot
when I have blown for offside? Yellow card. Almost the only offence that
does not seem to attract a yellow card is waving your hand in the referee's
face to demand a yellow card for an opponent.
The effect on play can be disastrous. If a referee books a player for a
silly offence, there is a chance he will find himself with no choice but to
send him off for another silly offence later.
Al-Sharif found himself expelling Emil Kremenliev of Bulgaria for little
reason in Tuesday's match against Mexico. You could almost feel Al-Sharif's
relief when Luis Garcia, booked earlier for shirt-tugging, raised a boot a
little high in pursuit of a bouncing ball. Normally this would have been an
indirect free-kick, but Garcia was sent off. This left the match deflated
but evenly balanced at 10-a-side.
Al-Sharif was guilty of embarrassing Fifa - a cardinal sin - by doing their
bidding too enthusiastically. In big play-off games in north American ice
hockey and basketball, referees are often reluctant to call all but the most
blatant fouls. Their motto is: 'Let the players decide.' Al-Sharif and
Brizio did more to shape their matches than any player.
Whether Fifa succeeds in changing the way soccer is played depends very much
on whether the national football associations follow their lead. They
should, but it would mean a season of seven-a-side games in England while
players and referees adjusted.
Strangely, the teams that seem not to have adjusted have not suffered in
this World Cup. The Italians have had two players sent off, yet are in the
last eight. The Bulgarians have collected 16 yellow and two red cards. The
Romanians: nine yellow and one red. Yet the last two could engineer the
first-ever all-Balkan final.
In spite of the huge number of yellow cards, only four players, by Fifa's
reckoning, are suspended for the quarter-finals. Another 22, including five
Italians, carry one yellow card and will be suspended if they are booked
again.
If the last World Cup is anything to go by, the fear of missing the next
round is not as great as the fear of elimination. In Italy four years ago,
players with yellow cards still committed fouls when opponents were in
threatening positions. Some, like Paul Gascoigne, fouled even when opponents
were not in scoring positions.
The pick of the quarter-finals is Brazil's match against Holland in Dallas
today. Brazil will be without Leonardo, suspended for the rest of the
tournament following his assault on Tab Ramos of the US. Leonardo was
Brazil's best defensive mid-field player, but, given the insipid form of
that group, will not be much missed.
The Dutch attack suddenly gelled against Ireland. Dennis Bergkamp and Marc
Overmars found their most exhilarating form and Peter Van Vossen continued
to flourish. They should, at last, give the Brazilian defence a serious
examination. It seems incredible that in this World Cup of goalkeeping
bloopers, Brazil's Claudio Taffarel has not yet contributed to the
bloop-score. It is because he has not been tested.
In defence, Ronald Koeman, the one Dutchman with a yellow card, continues to
look slow, but he is the only man in the tournament who seems able
consistently to shoot the new adidas Questra ball low and with power.
Alongside him against Ireland, Stan Valckx gave a workshop on the types of
physical contact the rules still allow, leaving Tommy Coyne battered,
frustrated and flailing with his elbows. Brazil's Romario and Bebeto, even
if they receive few good balls, will be a different matter.
Neither of these teams has strung together a series of authoritative wins
combining swaggering attack with rock-solid defence. But then the same goes
for the other six. None has looked like champions, though it is not unusual
for winning teams to find their form in later rounds.
Italy did it midway through a second-round group game against Brazil in 1982
and went on to win the World Cup with Paolo Rossi hitting six goals in the
last three games. That is why Roberto Baggio's pair against Nigeria is seen
as such an omen by the normally pessimistic Italians. Today they meet Spain
in Boston. Spain lack stars, but in Javier Clemente they have an astute
manager. His team have looked more convincing with each match.
One team that has not looked convincing are Romania, who adopted rope-a-dope
tactics to beat Colombia and Argentina. Both opponents landed plenty of
blows but could not find the knock-out, while Romania were uncannily
accurate on the counter-punch. It is an approach that would inspire more
confidence if the Romanian defence did not look so porous. The Swedes, less
talented but better-drilled than either of the south American sides, are
unlikely to fall for that trick.
Bulgaria adopt a similar approach with a better defence. They are an
unappealing lot. Even so, given vaguely sensible refereeing by Al-Sharif
against Mexico they would have achieved their aim of a 1-0 win with some
comfort.
Nevertheless, the success of Luis Alves Zague in turning defenders in the
Bulgarian penalty area will have inspired Germany's Jurgen Klinsmann and
Rudi Voller. Unlike Alves, Klinsmann and Voller can shoot.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: High stakes for Tirana wives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting-wise, some of us are in better shape than others, judging by a story
from Albania this week, writes Michael Thompson-Noel.
The daily paper, Koha Jone (Our Time), reported that an Albanian short of
gambling money had lost his wife after staking her on the outcome of a World
Cup game.
The gambler - not identified - was so sure that Argentina would beat
Bulgaria in their first-round match that he bet his good woman. Bulgaria won
3-2. She disappeared with the winner, while the loser was left to complain
to the police.
Even for the rest of us, the going is about to become sticky.
My original strategy of backing Latin American teams was half-baked,
Colombia and Argentina having cost me Pounds 150 in lost stakes plus 10 per
cent tax. Only Brazil remain, and they have been at cramped odds since the
tournament started.
I lost another Pounds 22 this week by supporting Nigeria at 16-1 - just
throwing money away. As a result, my hopes are now glued to Romania. After
the Romanians thumped Colombia I backed them at 25-1 and 33-1.
If Romania win the tournament, I will be at least Pounds 600 to the good on
total stakes (so far) of Pounds 297. I have also had a saver on Brazil:
Pounds 60 at 3-1. But if Brazil and Romania win their quarter-finals, they
will clash in the semis, which means that another lump of stake money will
be lost.
Crunch-time is here. I now plan to double-up on Romania and take out a
further saver on Germany, probably. Not that Germany have impressed me. Only
Romania have done that.
If Romania are beaten, my troubles will be profound: I do not have a wife.
Latest odds in London (Ladbroke): 13-8 Brazil; 7-2 Germany; 9-2 Italy; 8-1
Spain; 10-1 Romania, Holland; 14-1 Sweden; 28-1 Bulgaria.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Political fortunes decided on the pitch -
Latin American leaders follow their country's results keenly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Latin America, where soccer is a matter of life and death, the political
fall-out from the hasty exit of four out of five Latin American World Cup
contenders could be considerable. It has probably already influenced the
result of one presidential election. The 3-1 defeat by Romania of Colombia
on June 18 kept most Colombian males sober that Saturday night. Instead of
spending the following day recovering from their hangovers, they turned out
in unexpectedly high numbers to vote.
That probably benefited Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper - seen as more
popular among male voters than his Conservative rival, Andres Pastrana,
whose support was strongest among women.
In Mexico, the team's defeat by Bulgaria prompted a rare sporting
pronouncement from President Carlos Salinas: 'Perhaps if we had strengthened
the attack after Luis Garcia was sent off, we would have had more
opportunities'.
This poke in the eye to coach Mejia Baron - who, to the mystification of
Mexican fans, left attackers Hugo Sanchez and Carlos Hermosillo on the bench
 -was probably well deserved. Mexican performance in the World Cup was
expected to produce a feel-good factor which might have helped propel
Salinas's anointed successor, Ernesto Zedillo, to victory in next month's
presidential elections.
The biggest impact, though, could be in Brazil. In the first round of
presidential elections in October, the two leading candidates are a
left-winger (political rather than footballing) known as 'Lula' and an
establishment contender, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In a recent poll, 25 per
cent of voters said they would not make up their mind about their vote until
after they knew the victors in the World Cup.
Stephen Rose, a London stockbroker specialising in the Brazilian and
Argentine markets, says: 'The feeling is that if Brazil win, people would
think things in the country are not so bad after all and that would benefit
Fernando Henrique.'
In Argentina, President Carlos Menem has more time to recover from defeat
before elections next year, in which he hopes to run again. But the
63-year-old head of state, who plays soccer himself, takes defeat badly.
Mysteriously, his team win more often than the Argentine national side these
days.

How Romanians are greeting their team's success

<TEXT>
Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's quarter-final against Sweden, it will be
a long time before anyone in Romania forgets this year's World Cup.
The success of the Romanian team, which went to the US as a rank outsider,
has at last given this Balkan country something to celebrate after nearly
five years of bruising market reforms and rising poverty and crime.
The whole country seems to have been caught up by soccer fever. With each
victory, more and more ecstatic Romanians have taken to the streets and
danced till dawn in the biggest demonstrations since the overthrow of
Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989.
'Ole, ola. We'll beat Sweden too. Argentina has said good-bye. Romania will
take the cup,' jubilant crowds in Bucharest chanted after their team's 3-2
win against Argentina last Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of fans, many
carrying the Romanian flag, cavorted through the centre of the capital for
several hours, beeping car horns, jumping into fountains and using dustbins
as drums.
Riot police were used to keep wild fans out of the Bucharest embassies of
those foreign countries unlucky enough to lose to the Tricolori, as the team
is known locally. Romania's leaders have cashed in, giving lengthy
television interviews on soccer tactics and firing off telegrams to the US
to congratulate the team on Romania's greatest sporting success since the
victory of gymnast Nadia Comaneci in the 1976 Olympic games.
'Our dear ones, no-one can describe the immense joy you have brought to the
souls of the Romanians in that memorable night of July 3,' Prime Minister
Nicolae Vacaroiu, an ardent soccer fan, wrote to the team after last
Sunday's victory.
Amid reports of Romanians of all ethnic backgrounds embracing each other
after the match, President Ion Iliescu spoke glowingly of a 'national
consensus' created by the victory.
The team - led by Gheorghe Hagi, an ethnic Macedonian - reflects Romania's
diversity and also includes representatives of the ethnic Hungarian, ethnic
Serb and Gypsy minorities.
Above all, politicians regard the team's performance as a public relations
coup. 'You have made a whole country happy, and, much more, you have made
great propaganda for our beloved homeland,' the prime minister told the
team.
Government officials say they hope the world will in future think of Romania
as a land of soccer stars rather than of club-wielding miners, inter-ethnic
violence and Aids-infected orphans - the images which filled the world's
press in the aftermath of the 1989 revolution.
Bursting with pride at Romania's three victories to date and at the torrent
of international coverage they have provoked, local newspapers are
reprinting stories about the team and its stars which have appeared abroad.
Throughout the tournament, the top-selling Evenimentul Zilei (Event of the
Day) has dedicated eight of its 12 pages to the World Cup. Other news, such
as this week's parliamentary vote on impeaching President Iliescu, have been
squeezed off the front pages by soccer.
For the Romanian press, captain Hagi, 29, the most capped player in the team
and scorer of three of Romania's eight World Cup goals, is the team's
undisputed star. 'Hagi for President', read the headline in Evenimentul
Zilei after the match with Argentina.
Next in admiration come mid-fielder Ilie Dumitrescu - 'a flash of genius, a
devil named Ilie' - who scored twice in the same match, and manager Anghel
Jordanescu. These three, like many in the national team, share a background
at Steaua Bucharest - Romania's top club since the mid-1980s.
In 1986, Steaua, with Jordanescu as player and assistant coach, beat
Barcelona to become the first team in what was then the East Bloc to win the
European Cup.
Until 1990 only a few Romanian players were allowed to play for foreign
clubs. But since the fall of communism, footballers have become a top
export.
After a good performance in the World Cup in Italy, where Romania reached
the second round, most of the country's best players won lucrative contracts
at top European clubs, including Real Madrid, AC Milan and PSV Eindhoven.
Eight of those due to face Sweden played abroad last season. If successful
tomorrow, other Romanian players could notch up rich contracts. Already,
Italian and British clubs have begun to negotiate for Steaua captain Ilie
Dumitrescu, considered the best player left in Romania.
Tottenham Hotspur and Barcelona are reportedly interested in acquiring Hagi,
who has spent the last two seasons at Italian club Brescia after a year at
Real Madrid.
The departure of top players has weakened local league football and, with
the national squad scattered all over the continent, made World Cup
preparations difficult. But commentators believe that the international
experience gained by Romanian players in the past four years is one of the
main reasons for the team's new-found success.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Travel: The spoils of archaeology - The ancient delights of
modern Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1930s Agatha Christie voluntarily played second fiddle to her
archaeologist husband, Max Mallowan, when she accompanied him to Syria in
his quest for artefacts of the past. At the end of each dig, when the local
workmen had been paid off, Agatha and Max agonised over the division of the
spoils.
One half they could bring back to Britain; the other was claimed by the
French authorities on behalf of Syria's museums. The form was long
established: Agatha and Max divided the shards, ornaments, pieces of
jewellery and small statues into two piles, knowing there would be no
quibbling about the content of each. The French official, advised by his
wife, would scrutinise the piles, point to one and have it removed intact.
The dilemma for Agatha and Max was in the dividing. Whichever pile was
chosen would inevitably be the wrong one. It would contain something they
desperately desired.
Today's visitors to the museum at Aleppo, in northern Syria, can assess for
themselves the French official's judgment. Here are Mallowan's discoveries -
unpainted pots and decorated jars from the 3rd millennium BC, a golden altar
frieze, jewellery of precious stones, gold and silver.
Such is the power and presence of the past in today's Syria that the
comfortable coach for internal travel, and the top-class hotels with the
very best of 20th century facilities, become incidental to the monuments of
a civilisation stretching back to the 10th millennium BC, believed to be the
date of the earliest alphabet, recorded on tablets discovered at Ebla, south
of Aleppo.
In the Roman city of Bosra, 3,000 men, women and children continue to live
with their animals among the basalt ruins. Elsewhere, the city would be
fenced off and tourists charged a fortune to wander its streets. But in
Bosra chickens and turkeys scuttle through the agora and goats survey
visitors from the ramparts of the Arab castle.
Children, hoping for the gift of a pen or a boiled sweet, emerge from the
canvas coverings which act as front doors to their homes among the ruins.
On the street stretching the width of the town, from the Nabataean Gate to
the Gate of the Wind, women and children queue outside the bakery for the
flat Arab bread they carry home piled high on their heads.
Following TE Lawrence's route from Aqaba to Damascus, the signposts point
left to Beirut and right to Baghdad. The abandoned, half-built houses lining
the desert road belong to the Bedouin semi-nomads, who construct frames of
stone and wood and fling canvas over to make the roof and walls.
The families had moved on, taking their canvas with them to the next
semi-structure on their route. Eventually they would return. Further on, the
true Bedouin in their canvas tents signalled that in exchange for cigarettes
we could take their photographs.
At Palmyra, a man sat cross-legged on a hillside looking down on the ruins
of the 2nd century city still known by locals as Tadmor (city of dates).
Around him his sheep gazed, too, at us and at the temple columns, the
monumental arch, the remains of the bath house and the rows of seating
leading down to the orchestra of a theatre whose white stone turned pink in
the setting sun.
An oasis in the Syrian Desert, mentioned in tablets as early as the 19th
century BC, Palmyra is there for us still, to clamber over, photograph and
savour. Its guardians regard it without awe. Our coach - the only one on the
vast site - raised dust and stones as it left the track and headed through
the ruins to the entrance of the hypogeum; in the museum the curator invited
us to touch the exhibits, to prove that the statue was of a blind man whose
eyes definitely lacked pupils.
Part of the Roman road which once stretched from Antioch to Aleppo remains,
and the desire to step on it is irresistible. From nowhere appear small
children, clutching gifts of wild flowers: purple and red poppies which
flourish in the cracks between the blocks of stone. The blocks had been cut
about a metre square by the Romans or their slaves and placed side by side
on top of the desert scrub. Amazingly, the road is not straight.
Olives grow in abundance, along with almonds and pistachios. But it is the
olive and its oil which are special to the Syrians who, for 5,000 years,
have understood its worth as a foodstuff and its usefulness - when boiled -
for keeping enemies at bay.
The guide at the Crac des Chevaliers pointed with delight to the many nooks
and crannies from where boiling olive oil was dropped on intruders by the
Crusader knights, intent on controlling trade from the ports to the Syrian
interior.
The Crac, dramatic in its domination of the only gap in a 250km mountain
range stretching from Antakya in Turkey to Beirut, housed a garrison of
4,000 when the Crusaders built it in 1150. It is extremely well preserved
and, apart from later additions in Frankish and Arabic styles, would
probably be recognised today by one of the 4,000.
Saint Simeon's monument to excessive piety, the pillar on which he lived,
ate (once a week only, and then sparingly) and slept for 40 years, is
crumbled and shortened by time, set among the ruins of the serene and
beautiful Monastery of St Sergius and Bachus - a place in which to linger
and not to ponder on how a man copes with the practicalities of living 13m
above the earth, perched in the open on a pillar at best 1m square.
In the old city at Damascus a young man approached and invited us to tea in
a cafe where, he promised, a story-teller was due to read tales from One
Thousand and One Nights.
Inside, a large man wearing a gold turban and braided jacket sat on a high
chair reading from an ancient parchment. The audience - all men, apart from
me - listened intently, smoking their hookahs and drinking tea from small
glasses.
With no knowledge of Arabic, we were caught by the atmosphere as the
story-teller's face, arms and voice dramatised events.
The souks at Aleppo and Damascus cater for modern-day shoppers. Merchants of
silk, silver, gold and semi-precious stones tempt you to their stands with
offers of tea and a sit-down. Mostly, they want to practise their English
and discuss the fortunes of Manchester United. Bartering is expected and
one-third off the asking price is the usual compromise.
Confronted with the present, it was hard to ignore the missiles on the
border roads as we drove parallel with the Israeli border from Jordan into
Syria, and we noticed that our guide preferred questions about the ancient
world rather than the modern.
Flying in at night on a Royal Jordanian aircraft, it was impossible to
distinguish the lights of Aqaba from those of Eilat. The irony was not lost
on us. Throughout the flight the route had been displayed in the cabin,
using a map on which Israel did not exist.

Traditional British wine merchants - notably Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk,
Corney &amp; Barrow of London EC1, Harveys of Bristol, Lay &amp; Wheeler of
Colchester, Essex, Peatlings, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and The Wine
Society of Stevenage, Hertfordshire - tend to offer more exciting petits
chateaux red bordeaux than the supermarkets because of their long
relationships with Bordeaux merchants.
Waitrose, however, has the richly plummy Chateau Les Tonnelles de Fronsac
1990, at Pounds 4.99, and the creditable second wine of a fifth growth Medoc
in Baron Villeneuve du Ch Cantemerle 1990 at Pounds 7.95. (In very general
terms, such 'second wines' are generally worth buying only in good vintages
such as 1990s.)
Oddbins has a particularly good selection of red bordeaux under Pounds 10 a
bottle with a list full of plums, while Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack wine
shops are good on the Lurton family's well-made wines.
Another family whose name spells wine quality is Thienpont. Their juicy but
structured Cotes de Francs wines are still good value and are available from
Tanners of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and Seckford Wines of Ipswich, Suffolk.
Specific goodies from Oddbins include Ch Tour de Mirambeau, Pounds 5.29 and
the blended Michel Lynch 1990, Pounds 5.99, a Mouton Cadet trying harder if
ever there was one; and the daringly opulent Ch Lilian-Ladouys 1990 at
Pounds 9.99.
Majestic wine warehouses have long stocked Ch de Sours (the 1990 is Pounds
5.79) and Ch Meaume (the 1990 is Pounds 4.99), both made energetically by
Englishmen keenly aware of the demands of the wine world outside Bordeaux.
Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up's best buy is probably the peppery Ch Guibon
1992 at Pounds 4.69, and oak fans will enjoy Peter Sichel's Sirius 1990 at
Pounds 5.99.
Two wines made by the owner of the celebrated Ch Le Tertre Roteboeuf, with
ambition and technique that completely ignore their humble appellations, are
Ch Roc de Cambes, Pounds 8.73 from Corney &amp; Barrow, and the cheaper Domaine
de Cambes, Pounds 66 per case ex-cellars from Mark Savage, Guiting Power,
Cheltenham (0451-850896).
Other names worth looking out for include Chx Cote-Montpezat, Fontenille, Le
Grand Verdus, de Haux, Jonqueyres, du Juge, Lassime, Monbadon, Parenchere,
Suau and Turcaud, as well as Domaine de Courteillac.
An error in transmission meant that we gave the wrong price for New Zealand
wines mentioned last week. Top bottlings of the Sauvignon Blancs, including
Cloudy Bay, Hunters, Jackson Estate, Vavasour and Wairau River, are all
under Pounds 10 a bottle.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A question of character - Great British Eating
/ Nicholas Lander meets a couple who have won their first Michelin star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout the world the restaurant industry attracts more than its fair
share of personalities - men, and increasingly women, who are prepared to
put up with the anti-social hours and unpredictable financial reward to feed
their fellows.
In Britain we feel that most of these characters exist outside our shores.
The typical, unforgettable chef or restaurateur is French, Italian or
Spanish.
In fact, the British restaurant industry is replete with characters. And, in
many respects, their achievements are even more admirable because few have
inherited renowned family restaurants and many have had to labour for years
to convince the local population that the best-prepared meals come neither
instantly nor cheaply.
Around Britain a roll call of such individuals would include: Joyce Molyneux
at the Carved Angel, Dartmouth, Devon; Tessa Bramley at The Old Vicarage,
Ridgeway, Derbyshire; Rick Stein in Padstow, Cornwall; the McCoy brothers at
The Tontine, Staddle Bridge, North Yorkshire; Barry and Dorothea Phillips at
The White Horse Inn, Chilgrove, West Sussex and, in Scotland, David and
Patricia Wilson at the Peat Inn, St Andrews and Betty and Graeme Allen at
the Airds Hotel, Port Appin, Strathclyde. And for a good food and comedy
double act, Melvyn Popham and Dennis Hawkes at Pophams, Winkleigh, Devon.
Any such list should also mention Harry and Caroline Hallam.
Harry, from Lincolnshire, spent the first 20 years of his working life as a
baker. He has spent the last six climbing the culinary league tables winning
his first Michelin star earlier this year.
His wife, Caroline, has played an equally important role in Harry's Place,
their restaurant and home, opposite a pub and social club in Great Gonerby,
just outside Grantham, Lincolnshire. It seats no more than 10 diners and is
dedicated to quality. So why do they do it and does it pay?
Harry, 47, says: 'We do it because we want to create the kind of restaurant
we would love to go and eat in ourselves. Unfortunately, because we don't
employ anyone else, we can't. But for me, as a self-taught chef, the big
thing is that in this profession I never stop learning. That makes up for
the lack of money. We don't actually pay ourselves a wage. Everything is for
the business. We pay our bills and what's left over is for us.'
The pleasure of enjoying Harry's cooking and Caroline's service is enhanced
by the attention to detail: lilies, pot pourri and ivy on the tables; lace
table mats; bone handled knives from a canteen that belonged to Harry's
grandmother; and comfortable bergere chairs that would last no more than a
week in a more hectic setting.
Our lunchtime menu choice was taken from: fish soup with an anchovy rouille;
a pastry case filled with a poached egg gratineed with hollandaise; fillet
of sea trout with sorrel; Lincolnshire pigeon breasts with lentils; cheese;
hot apricot and cognac souffle; and caramel mousse brulee.
The bread, a malted wholemeal which Hallam bakes twice a day, and the ameuse
geule, emphasise Hallam's talents.
An essential factor in their early survival, the Hallams admit, was an
understanding bank manager. 'He was the most wonderful man who believed in
us and wanted us to succeed. After he retired he used to come in here and
help us with the washing up, unpaid of course. Later, when he was in
hospital we used to smuggle in Harry's lemon tart to him.' They add,
regretfully, that the new manager has yet to go and eat there.
'Although we had always dreamt of our own restaurant we didn't want to do it
until our daughters were in their teens. Looking after customers and small
children must be just too demanding. But now every week we get letters from
customers who say how much they have enjoyed coming here and talking to us.
They usually end by saying that they do hope they haven't kept us up too
late,' says Caroline.
After six years in Great Gonerby, the Hallam character and style are
beginning to be appreciated. One customer told me: 'I ate here on the day it
opened and I must have eaten here 70 or 80 times since. I have eaten all
over France and I reckon Harry is the equal of the best of them.' Praise
indeed.
Harry's Place, 17 High Street, Great Gonerby, Lincolnshire, NG31 8JS. Tel:
0476-61780. Open Tues-Sat, lunch and dinner. Reservations only. Pounds 35
per head, excluding wine.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Travel: From rags to riches in the high Alps - The unique
Ladin mountain scenery and culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Head north from Verona and the transition from lowland Italy to the Alps
begins at once. The hot plains crumple into mountains and valleys; the air
becomes sharp and clear. The cypress trees and vines are eclipsed by pines.
Geraniums line the balconies and gothic script appears on white-washed
walls. There is an onrush of gemutlichkeit.
Gemutlichkeit comes as a bit of a surprise in Italy. I have always
associated that particular brand of cosy hospitality with the Germans, but
perhaps it is more an alpine thing.
Admittedly, part of the Dolomites used to be German - until the end of the
first world war the South Tyrol, as the name suggests, used to be part of
the Austrian empire - and so the German influence has probably had its
effect; but the Italian speakers in the mountains above Venice have a
similar way.
It was mid-evening on a cold September night by the time I found my way into
the Val di Fassa in the high Dolomites, but there was time for a bite before
the band struck up and the assembled company started to sing along to the
accordion music. Auto-suggestion had me ordering a beer, although I
discovered that the usual drink thereabouts is wine.
I joined in the spinning top games and sang along for a bit. I have not been
that keen on singing since I was asked to stop in a music lesson at school,
but it was a friendly crowd, mainly Italians and Germans, and it was easy to
join in.
The Dolomites are a ragged interface between the two languages. This is true
both of the original inhabitants and of the tourists that you now see in the
resorts. Surprisingly, there is another, uniquely alpine language wedged
between them in the high Dolomites. Ladin descends from the tongue of the
original, Celtic inhabitants of the Alps, mixed with colloquial Latin and
left to crystallise for centuries.
The Ladin people of the Dolomites were marginalised by the main European
nations, as they were elsewhere in the Alps (the fourth language of
Switzerland, Romansch, is related to Ladin). They were squeezed into five of
the highest and remotest valleys. Tax collectors and bishops' envoys were
sent to visit occasionally, but generally the inhabitants were left to lead
a poor existence as farmers.
The last two generations, though, have seen more change than the previous
centuries. Like so much of the Alps, these high Dolomite valleys have been
transformed from one of Europe's poorest regions into one of its most
prosperous. The farm plots have been sold off to provide holiday villas and
second homes and the cowherds have become builders and hoteliers.
With the exception of Cortina, the Dolomites are not that well-known to the
British, but have been discovered by the Italians and the Germans, who
arrive in their bus-borne hordes.
September is between seasons: the summer walking is just about over and the
snow has not yet arrived. It was odd to be in a ski resort out of season.
Even the noises were different without snow to damp them, although the river
still roared in the valley bottom.
The nights were already cold and there was a familiar skiing pleasure in
emerging from the stua (a Ladin adaptation of the German word stube, the
hearth of their hospitality) into the night air for an evening walk.
The mountains stood out strong and white in the moonlight high above the
valley floor. Instead of the typical triangular alpine peaks, the Dolomites
are vast stacks of white limestone that stand in clusters like craggy teeth.
The off-season is quite a good time to see the Dolomites. The colours of
autumn are exquisite, and the mountains looking their best. In the long,
angled light of sunrise and sunset they glow an extraordinarily vivid pink.
To my mind the Ladin mountains - the Sella, Marmolada and Rosengarten - are
some of the most beautiful in the Alps.
In times past, before the tourist hordes arrived, Ladin life was governed by
saints' days and the seasons of cattle herds. Summer was spent gathering hay
on the high slopes and cutting wood in preparation for the long winter. When
the cold weather came, the villagers withdrew to the valley floor.
Here they stayed in small clusters of buildings scattered a mile or so from
one another. Each has a tall, white-plastered, communal house for four or
five families, surrounded by a collection of barns, one for each family.
The hay was kept upstairs in the barn, providing insulation for the cattle
and easy accessibility when it was pitch-forked down to them as feed. Ladin
proverbs tell of life's rhythms: rain on St George's day is supposed to
bring another 40 days of winter.
In Val Badia, another Ladin valley, I stayed in a small town called San
Cassiano. Once again the welcome was courteous and hospitable. San Cassiano
sees some fairly well-heeled travellers, so there was less singing and more
subdued chat in the bar. The Ladins were lamenting the lack of television
time they were permitted in their own language, and told of the problems of
political self-determination (their valleys are divided between different
districts of Italy).
I took a day's walk up into the high meadows, where the richest grass grows
and where the villagers take their cattle for the summer. The path followed
an old route to a tiny chapel just below the massif. Each year on the first
or second weekend in June, the villagers carry a statue of Jesus on the
cross and place it above the altar in the chapel.
I set off with a slow and steady mountain plod, climbing gradually though
the pine forest and along the switchback paths. The ground was steep; it
must have been hard climbing for the farmers, loaded up with provisions. At
intervals there were crucifixes at the roadside, the stations of the
Calvary, placed so that walkers could pause for breath at the same time as
offering devotions.
When I reached the high pastures, the meadows were dotted with wooden barns
where the hay was stored and dried. High mountain grass makes the finest hay
because it is free of fertilisers and full of flowers, among them arnica. An
old farmer who was clearing up before the winter explained that it was very
good for rheumatism. He looked spritely enough. It has become popular to
have treatments in a bath of the grass in some resorts; there is even an
EU-sponsored project to investigate its efficacy.
The farmer told me that when he was young he came up here for the hay-making
season. It was their summer holiday in a way. After the evening meal,
understandably cooked in separate kitchens, everyone would get together in
one barn and tell stories, before burying themselves in the hay to go to
sleep. There were a lot of tourists now, he said, perhaps too many.
Remembering how hard the climb had been, I said that it must be a difficult
walk for him now, but he laughed and said that he drove a pick-up truck
nowadays. He asked if I had come up on the chair-lift? It seemed unjust
suddenly to discover that I had been labouring uphill almost directly
beneath a chair-lift.
James Henderson travelled to Verona with Meridiana, which flies daily from
Gatwick (reservations: 071-839 2222). A car was loaned by the Italian
hire-firm Maggiore (UK agent: Trans-Hire, tel: 071-978 1922). Small cars
start at about Pounds 210 for a week's hire, all-in.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Travel: Hit by Berlin's hammer blows of history - Adam
Hopkins grapples with a city's painful but fascinating past and finds a
great deal worth exploring in the eastern areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We left the cabin window open so as to hear the ducks and moorhens - also
the S-Bahn trundling over the iron bridge across the Spree. For this, after
all, was former East Berlin, and the hotel we had chosen was a riverboat,
retired from many years of service on the Rhine and the Moselle.
The waterbirds woke us daily before dawn, complaining and racketing about.
But the S-Bahn trains soon sent us back to sleep, pulling up in soporific
succession at Treptower Park, gateway to acre upon acre of anonymous housing
blocks and the huge Soviet war memorial hidden within the urban forest of
the park.
The Victoria Hotelschiff, our temporary home, was moored on the Treptower
side. Away among the trees behind us we could almost feel the ghostly
presence of the thousands of young Soviet soldiers killed in the last days
of the second world war and buried here, surrounded by the marble pomp of
their own empire, Babylonian in scale.
Stralau lay on the far side of the water, an industrial peninsula in the
watery maze of east Berlin. From the saloon where we took our breakfast of
herring and rye bread, it seemed to be full of abandoned vehicles and
defunct factories - its demise a product not only of 40 years of socialist
economics but, more immediately, of the rupture of the Wall in 1989.
Berlin is a place that hits you every way you turn with the hammer blows of
history, remote or recent, painful, fascinating, forcing you always to
grapple with both the city and yourself. The physical situation of the
Hotelschiff ensured that our reactions remained at the customary high pitch
induced in most visitors by Berlin.
What is more, we had a mystery on board, the kind you become aware of little
by little . . . shadowy figures sitting on the river wall when nobody was
looking, two young girls seated on a descending stairway, comparing rings
and giggling and turning their faces away, a drift of cigarette smoke from
an unexpected quarter, the sound of card-players below.
So tantalising grew the presence of these other, unacknowledged denizens of
the riverboat - clearly not ordinary guests - that we finally plucked up
courage to ask about them. Yes, as we had secretly suspected, they were
Bosnian refugees on an indefinite stay, their cabins paid for by the
powers-that-be.
The refugees seemed entirely fitting both to the oddity of our arrangements
and to the kindly face which Berlin, paradoxically, has often shown to
refugees and strangers.
Be it said that during our week deep down in the old east, we never once
caught sight of a skinhead. On the contrary, we made a friend, and a more
agreeable and kindly man you could not hope to meet - Lothar, an unemployed
translator of Portuguese. Once, he said, it had been a useful language in
the liberation struggles of Angola and Mozambique; now it was less urgently
required.
He took us home to meet his wife and children in their cosy, book-filled
flat, walking over the iron bridge across the Spree in darkness and past the
corner where the cars slow down, thus giving the local prostitutes - high
boots, tiny skirts and wild blonde wigs - a chance to interview potential
punters.
Where the Spree turns into Osthafen, the old industrial harbour, full of
latter-day dereliction, there is now a Chinese restaurant, its cheery
windows lending an unexpected exoticism.
'Even though I've lost my job, I would never go back to the old situation,'
says Lothar. 'Never, ever. Freedom of speech, freedom of movement, these are
too important.'
Heike, his wife, gave us fried bread-balls with mincemeat in the middle, the
children were put to bed, and the little home seemed to radiate peace and
even hope.
For ourselves, during the daylight hours, we would take the clanking S-Bahn
back into the city centre, to Mitte, heart of the old east, exploring with
new eyes from this entirely changed perspective.
Homing in on the old centre, we marvelled at the great grey bulk of east
Berlin, like an untidy rug thrown down across the lakes and waterlands of
Brandenburg. What an astonishing hive and hubbub of industry there must have
been here once upon a time. And what a fearful aberration to build, however
well-meaningly, the huge, unornamented, desperate housing blocks of
socialism.
Yet exploring among the inner districts of the centre, more intimately than
we had done on previous, west-based, visits, we were struck repeatedly by
how much of the grander domestic architecture of old Berlin survives.
Unter den Linden, with its majestic, oversized Prussian public buildings,
has long been restored, or mostly so, as has the elegant Nikolaiviertel hard
by. But go up to Prenzlauerberg, where new arty cafes are sprouting like
nobody's business, and you will suddenly see that houses here and there
along wide streets - Rykestrasse, for instance - are starting to be done up,
revealing a grace and amplitude previously hidden by decay.
The same is true round Oranienburger Strasse, in the area the tourist board
is pleased to call, with doubtful historical accuracy, the Scheunenviertel.
(The real thing was a little further up: the one-time jam-pocked,
crime-prone, slum and ghetto-district celebrated in Alfred Doblin's great
1920s novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz.)
Meanwhile, in the 'new' Scheunenviertel, the catalyst has been the
rebuilding of the grand New Synagogue and the takeover of such huge and
gaunt old factories as the Berolina Margarinefabrik in Augustrasse as
artists' co-operatives and so forth. Trendy cafes abound in this district,
too, serving breakfast to sleepy customers all day long on Sunday.
There was, we felt, an enormous amount worth exploring in the east, quite
apart from the grand imperial museums and architectural set-pieces.
It may have been the Victoria Hotelschiff that did it, or meeting our new
friends on the Osthafen. Or, for once, it may have been objective
observation. But we certainly felt that it is former east Berlin - and not
the west - which now holds most of the cards and, little by little, will
start to lay them on the table.
Lufthansa (tel: 0345-737747) flies from London Heathrow, Pounds 140 return
for a stay that includes Saturday night. The Victoria Hotelschiff is at
Puschkin Allee 16/17, Am Anleger 3, 12435 Berlin, tel: 010-49 30 272 370. A
cabin for two costs Pounds 85 per night; cheaper at weekends.

reports from beleaguered Bordeaux

The Bordeaux wine trade, plagued by la crise (economique), a run of three
difficult vintages, and accusations that its basic bread-and-butter bottles
could do with at least a smear of nice fruity jam to attract the modern wine
drinker, has been sleeping a bit easier since June 25.
At this year's exceptionally soggy Fete de la Fleur at Chateau Lilian
Ladouys in St Estephe, one of the guests honoured with the pomp and crimson
velvet traditional at such gatherings was France's clairvoyant, Madame
Yaguel Didier. Asked to forecast the quality of the 1994 vintage, she wisely
predicted: 'It will be a great, great year.'
The Bordelais need a vintage of irresistible quality, and the vine
flowering, which the Fete de la Fleur celebrated, did nothing to preclude
such an outcome. But international competition has never been tougher - even
Bordeaux's own airport cafe, Le Millesime, is committed to a festival of
beers of the world.
The Bordeaux trade still has an embarrassing amount of the light 1992 wines
and the better 1993s to sell, even at classed growth level. And in the
all-important lower ranks, which represent the bulk of Bordeaux's produce
and the world's greatest single unit of controlled appellation wine, far too
many of the region's thousands of wine producers still believe that the name
Bordeaux is sufficient to guarantee them a sale (which it is - in France).
The merchants' problem has been to energise and educate these smallholders,
to convince them that it is worth cutting yields, harvesting later,
improving vinification techniques, and generally keeping up to scratch with
international competition in order to sell outside France.
Increasing numbers have seen the light, but they represent a small minority.
The difficulty for the consumer is to identify, from thousands of labels,
which generic bordeaux and petits chateaux reds can now deliver fruity,
supple, exciting wines that are so much more attractive than the
unappetising combination of vapidity and tough tannins typical of basic
Bordeaux wines made in the image of the great classed growths.
Even Hugues Lawton, seventh generation Bordeaux wine merchant and one of the
city's most respected figures, admits that at petit chateau level he finds
it impossible to tell the goodies from the baddies by the label.
Bordeaux does have many good value reds to offer, however, with considerably
more subtlety than many of their New World price counterparts. Now is the
time to stock up on the attractively plump and well-balanced 1990s in order
to sit out most 1991s and 1992s (see box, next page, for specific
recommendations).
Weighed against this vintage character argument, however, is the fact that
winemaking techniques are improving all the time. A recent tasting of 1990
crus bourgeois in London, for example, showed that a good number even of
these properties, wedged promisingly between the classed growths and the
petits chateaux, are asleep at the wheel.
Of the 40 wines shown, only nine - Chx Biston-Brillette, Deyrem-Valentin, La
Tour de By, Lamothe-Cissac, Lestage, Lilian-Ladouys, Mayne-Lalande, an oaky
Poujeaux and Tour-Haut-Caussan - convinced me that their owner or winemaker
realised how competitive the market is.
As for the Sauternais, life is bleak. They too had an exciting run from 1988
to 1990, but very little sweet wine was made in 1991, and practically none
in 1992 or 1993. It is they who must hope most fervently that Madame Didier
has a direct line to the future.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Judge not, that ye be not judged: John Willman has a
biblical text to dispense, freely, to Mark Santer, Bishop of Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For some time, the Church of England has been a business in decline.
Customers ebbing away, outlets closing, growing competition from foreign
imports, disastrous investments on the stock markets leading to a serious
shortfall in income. It's a familiar story.
Given this record, however, it is a bit rich for a leading cleric to start
dispensing advice to the government on how to run the health service. Yet
that is exactly what the Right Reverend Mark Santer, Bishop of Birmingham,
chose to do last Sunday.
He told doctors' leaders that the government's health reforms were
unchristian and morally wrong. In a sermon on the eve of the annual meeting
of the British Medical Association, he attacked 'the culture of competition'
bred by the business model applied to the health service.
'The patient is reduced to the status of a unit of consumption and
exchange,' he said. 'That in the Christian view must be wrong.
'The culture of competition has set doctor against doctor, hospital against
hospital, colleague against colleague. Priorities and policies come to be
determined not on the basis of human need, but in accord with the accounting
policies of the National Health Service.'
Powerful criticisms, indeed. FT readers, no doubt, will experience an added
frisson in the bishop's choice of 'business model' as a term of abuse.
Yet in comparison with the church, the health service is a success story. It
is treating more people every year and reducing the average waiting times
for treatment. And while it is hard to be confident about the moral health
of the nation, people are living longer, healthier lives than ever.
Some of the credit for that improvement rightly belongs to medical science
and advances in forms of treatment. But if the government's reforms are the
disaster portrayed by the bishop, then surely this would have interrupted
the record of progress in recent years.
Without doubt, the health service prior to the reforms wasted scarce
resources on a massive scale. This was partly because there were no serious
incentives to treat more patients or to choose the most economical forms of
treatment. Some hospitals treated far fewer patients than other hospitals of
similar size, yet they would both receive similar funding.
As a result, people had to wait longer for operations than they do now.
Worse, tens of thousands waited more than two years for treatment which
their doctors did not regard as urgent, an unChristian practice that has
thankfully all but ceased.
Another cause of waste was that no one in the health service had an idea of
what anything cost. Doctors and nurses never had to stop and ask whether
particular procedures were cost-effective - or even needed. The Audit
Commission found that some consultants and family doctors ordered eight
times as many pathology tests per patient as others, for example. Money
thrown away on unnecessary tests was money not available to relieve
suffering.
The NHS reforms have simply tried to create a system within which those who
use resources most effectively get more while those who waste them get less.
The solutions are not perfect - too much power remains in the hands of
bureaucrats who show a high-handed contempt for the customer, as this week's
report from the ombudsman shows. But the reforms are pretty similar to what
is going on in a lot of other advanced economies.
That is hardly surprising: market incentives may have some unpleasant side
effects, and these need to be guarded against. But they are the best
mechanism devised by man for producing desired outcomes. The lesson of the
20th century is surely that alternatives to market arrangements are
invariably worse. And, bishop please note, it is the individual who suffers
the most from the consequences.
Indeed, one predictable consequence of the sort of command economy that
existed in the pre-reform health service was that it gave power to the
professionals, rather than the customers.
A hospital appointment used to mean taking at least half a day off work to
join dozens of other patients in waiting to see a doctor. Now, five out of
six outpatients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time.
There was, of course, nothing to stop hospitals making such improvements in
patient care under the old system. But in the absence of incentives to meet
the customer's needs, consultants organised the hospitals to meet their
needs. Another Audit Commission report found that patients were often kept
in hospital over the weekend unnecessarily because the consultant was
unwilling to come in on a Friday to discharge them.
The bishop's accusation that patients have been turned into units of
exchange might have more force if it were not for the fact that before the
reforms, they were units of treatment at the whim of doctors.
The health reforms have certainly shaken up the medical profession, and
about time too. No professional group likes change (journalists are no
exception either). So it is hardly surprising that the bishop has found that
the reforms have been 'deeply distressing' to those who are forced to change
their ways.
Yet the health service continues to provide treatment according to need,
largely free at the point of use - the blueprint of Aneurin Bevan, the
Labour politician who launched it.
If those basic principles were to be jettisoned, Santer would be justified
in his philippic. Until then, that bible text about motes and beams seems
more relevant.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Lunch with the FT: The immaculate Lord Parkinson - Is he a
cad? Is he a dilettante? Lucy Kellaway tries to find out over the monkfish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am sitting alone at the worst table at The Square, a very expensive, very
designer restaurant in St James's, London. For 20 minutes I have been trying
to look relaxed about the non-appearance of my guest, filling the time
wondering if baked skate wings with lemon-wilted spinach sound nicer than
herb-crusted cod on grilled aubergines with couscous.
Eventually, I see a white head whisking past the window, and a minute later
Lord Parkinson is sitting down opposite me, immaculate and apologetic.
Some say Cecil Parkinson is a lightweight, a dilettante. Others, recalling
that unfortunate business with Sara Keays and the love child (which cost him
the position of foreign secretary), think him a cad, a bounder.
But I have always had a sneaking admiration for this man. I remember a lunch
with him seven years ago when he had just become energy secretary. We sat in
the Savoy River Room, and discussed nuclear privatisation. Instead of the
cliches and distracted manner you expect from a secretary of state, Cecil
Parkinson seemed to be thinking about the subject, and actually listening to
what my colleague and I were saying. On oil rig visits he used to work the
same magic, winning round even the most surly offshore workers.
I reminded him of our previous acquaintance. He clearly did not remember me,
but felt it would be ungentlemanly to say so.
We are interrupted by the maitre d' who suggests we would be more
comfortable by the window. A delegation of waiters escorts us to the best
table in the restaurant. It seems Parkinson has not just charmed everyone
from Margaret Thatcher to Financial Times journalists to roughnecks, but
also the entire staff of The Square.
Yet, so far, the lunch is not going especially well. He seems vague about
what we are supposed to be doing and looks blank when I mention the Lunch
with the FT series. Nevertheless, he is impeccably polite and still has the
knack of appearing to give you his fullest attention.
Near our new table is a well-known journalist whom Lord Parkinson has not
seen for some time. He comments that the man has lost a little hair, and got
a little whiter, adding gratuitously: 'When I first met him your parents
were still deciding what secondary school to send you to.' From most people
the remark would have been crass, but Lord Parkinson just gets away with it.
In spite of myself I am almost flattered when he underestimates my age by
eight years, and says: 'At the risk of being personal you are wearing your
age a great deal better than I am.'
To get the conversation on to a sounder footing, I ask him about the mess
the government has got itself into. He complains that the word 'mess' is a
bit strong, and says the chief problem is that the public will not give the
government any credit for the recovery. 'The public still can't accept the
government was right before we left the ERM and right afterwards. There was
a total change of policy, but the government still tries to pretend its
economic policies are a seamless web.'
But surely Conservative problems are more fundamental than that? Reluctantly
he admits that Major et al have had a 'poorish run', but proceeds to hand
out generous bouquets to them all. 'A lot of it has been unfairly
personalised against John Major. I think he has a strong team and is just
the man to steer economic policies through. I think Howard is a good home
secretary and Hurd is obviously an excellent foreign secretary.'
So far, so lacklustre: I had hoped that as a political outsider Cecil
Parkinson would be more provocative. I ask him about the reshuffle, and he
talks about the importance of the job of party chairman, a position in which
he once shone. He bemoans the fact that Michael Heseltine, his chosen
candidate for the job, has no interest in it. 'Being party chairman for the
next two years is infinitely more important than being president of the
Board of Trade,' he says.
Suddenly he stops eating his salad of roast monkfish tail to give a big
wave. I turn, and outside the window is a smiling woman carrying an armful
of lilies. 'Who was that?' I ask.
'She's a sweet girl,' he says warmly, and then pauses. 'You know, I can't
remember her name. A very nice girl.' He then proceeds to tell me with
evident disapproval about a man who was a 'mysterious figure who got himself
quite well ingratiated with Margaret at one point. He was alleged to have
played a quite major role in the miners' strike. This girl has been his
partner for some years. Everyone thought they had parted, and then suddenly
she had his baby.'
He interrupts himself to make polite noises about how nice the restaurant
is, how good the food is, and how in all the time he and his wife have been
coming here they have never had a bad meal.
Acquiescing briefly, I persist with the matter in hand, and ask if the man
has stuck by her. 'No,' he says, frowning. 'He's a tricky guy.'
I can scarcely credit the innocent way in which he is discussing the issue.
I start to wonder how best to point out the parallels with his own
situation. He solves the problem for me by spotting over my shoulder a
newspaper headline screaming: 'ME, WOMEN AND SEX BY ANTONY BUCK.'
'Poor old Antony, he's gone completely off the rails. He became very
frustrated and bitter about his career. It really corroded him. He drank
rather a lot, and then he got mixed up with this awful woman.'
I ask whether, because of his own past, he can sympathise with Sir Antony
over this unflattering glare of publicity. Lord Parkinson turns down the
invitation to be bitter himself; indeed he is admirably sanguine. 'If you
spend time trying to get the public interested in your views, you can't tell
them when to stop their interest,' he says.
We discuss whether in general he is glad to be out of the public eye, and
whether his quieter life in the Lords and pursuing his half a dozen or so
business interests suit him. He tells me how he never looks back, never has
regrets, how relentless is the job of an MP (especially in a government with
a majority of only 15).
He tells me about how wonderful it will be if some of his infrastructure
projects (he is involved in the Dartford river crossing and the Midland
Expressway, as well as the Channel Tunnel Rail link) come off.
'A lot of my contemporaries felt like I did, that they had done quite a
stint. It was time to leave while we can still do something else. Having
been in cabinet, watching the government from the backbenches is a pretty
tame way of passing the time.'
He admits that being in the Lords is even tamer. 'It is a very charming
place. I pop in once a fortnight.' If he has a political point to make,
these days he makes it to the media: 'In a short radio interview you can get
to a lot more people than in a long speech in the Commons,' he says.
That is all very well, but I am left with my doubts. There is something
sadder about him than there was seven years ago, as if in spite of all his
protestations, he is longing to be back at the centre of things.
To judge by the brevity of the lunch, out of Parliament certainly does not
mean idle. He has two swallows of his coffee, and leaves for an afternoon
board meeting. Again he tells me how enjoyable the lunch has been. I hold
out my hand, and he bends forward to peck me on the cheek. I pay the bill
and the maitre d' thanks me for coming and for bringing my guest.
In the next post I receive a hand-written note on Lords stationery thanking
me for the lunch one last time, and saying how much he is looking forward to
reading the article.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Do we want religious toleration?: Truth of the Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidei Defensor. Defender of the Faith. It has the chivalrous ring of
authentic heritage. Even these new-fangled decimal coins with their angular
shapes and banal names are lent a spurious air of history.
A 20p piece. Huh] Where is our golden ducat, our crown, half-crown or
florin? Where our angel or our guinea? Where is our sovereign? Even the
humble shilling had its history. Fidei Defensor lends a kind of continuity
to the currency between Henry VIII and Charles III. But does it mean
anything?
The faith Henry was defending was the unreformed Roman Catholic Christianity
of the early 16th century. He published a tirade against the Protestant
Christianity which was sweeping through northern Europe and won the Pope's
accolade.
Since, frankly, it has been something of an embarrassment for the head of
the Church of England, which so staunchly rejects Papal claims. Most people
assume it means the duty of the sovereign to defend the established church.
In these more liberal and ecumenical days, of course, The Faith no longer
means the doctrines of one particular Christian denomination. It is far more
likely to mean Christianity as opposed to the 'other faiths' - Islam or
Judaism or Buddhism.
But the future Charles III now wants to broaden the scope of Fidei Defensor
still further to embrace all religious faiths. Defender of Religion is his
preferred role.
The sentiment is fine, well-tuned to the liberal tolerant society we would
like to become. But what, in practice, can it mean?
Parliament can make laws against religious or racial discrimination or -
possibly - against blasphemy (which are incidentally difficult to enforce),
but what can a single person with a royal role do to 'defend' all religions
with conviction and impartiality?
Elizabeth II, our present monarch (may her reign be long and glorious) has
not taken a notably active role in defending the Christian faith of the
Church of England against its enemies, internal or external. True, she sets
a good example by going to church.
However, Elizabeth I was far more pro-active. A doughty scholar and
theologian, she was well up to rebuking prelates in public or preachers in
mid-oration. We are used to smooth prevarication about contentious issues;
Elizabeth would have been robust in her comments on the ordination of women
and forthright with Dr David Jenkins. She would have been scathing, no
doubt, with 'Jews and Infidels'.
Such royal intolerance would be intolerable today. But is tolerance what we
want in Britain? Do we want our head of state to be tolerant of a religion
which demeans and oppresses women? Or one which inflicts 'cruel and
inhumane' punishments in defiance of a UN Declaration of Human Rights? Or
one which issues fatwahs against a British citizen and forces him into
hiding?
Secular humanism is a kind of faith; so is Scientology. Roll up all Moonies.
I wonder what Fidei Defensor could do in Northern Ireland? The essence of
many faiths is their claim to exclusive truth and hostility to other faiths.
How will Religionis Defensor cope with that?
For religions are not like ice creams, different flavours for different
tastes. We may hope for a time - it is centuries away I fear - when there
will be sufficient convergence in the self-understanding of the great faith
traditions for tolerance without compromise to be a real possibility. As
things are, there are seemingly unbridgeable gulfs of both belief and
practice and a growing paranoid fundamentalism.
For the leaders of the different faith communities to have 'access' to the
Crown, as Prince Charles suggests, would no doubt signal publicly that they
are here to stay. But that could be arranged tomorrow by suitable
invitations and no implicit comment on their relative acceptability need be
inferred.
The Establishment of the Church of England is a rather different matter. The
Queen is also 'head of the church', but establishment reaches in intricate
ways into many other areas of public life, into the law and parliament and
education and on into our common rites of passage and the parochial system.
Arguably the crown could abandon that title without unpicking the whole
complex interweaving of church and state.
But if the object of the exercise is to declare an intention to defend the
free exercise of religion in our society she should be doing that as a
matter of principle as head of the church. For the Church of England is
theologically committed to religious toleration; our own Bishops have
frequently been eloquent advocates for the rights of other faith
communities.
In Northern Ireland the Church of Ireland has struggled to bridge the gap
between Roman Catholic and Protestant communities. As head of the church the
Crown is no less free to be the advocate of other communities than it is of
the Church of England.
Disestablishment offers no extra freedom of action to the crown. It is
arguable that it offers the church more than it offers the state -
principally visible freedom to choose and appoint its own bishops and deans.
On the other side it is likely to weaken the monarchy by cutting the last
vestiges of sacral legitimation which the coronation and all the great state
rituals in Westminster Abbey and St Paul's still symbolise for a majority of
the British people.
Messing about with the currency, or the Royal Mail, is deeply unpopular
because, at a gut level, people feel they are organic to our national
identity - veins and arteries to our connectedness. The Queen's head on our
coins and postage stamps says something reassuring to the average person.
Having her as head of the church may serve a similar function - not only for
members of the C of E but for other Christian denominations, other faith
communities and for the large majority who do not want an atheistic, secular
republic.
As Dr Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, pointed out, the Establishment of the
C of E is a guarantee for Jews as well as for Sikhs and Moslems that the
state is constitutionally committed to safeguard basic spiritual values and
the common moral decencies to which most religious communities subscribe. If
that is the price we have to pay for the humiliating business of having the
prime minister advise the Queen on the appointments of bishops and deans it
is a price I, for one, am willing to pay.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Hooked on glassblowing - Simon
Walsh on one woman's return to apprenticeship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON WALSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1979, Siddy Langley was running a successful clothes shop, earning enough
to run a Morgan car and take six-week holidays in the Far East.
One weekend something happened to change her lifestyle to that of a Pounds
20-a-week apprentice having to find Pounds 22 a week for train fares. Yet
she has never once regretted that change.
'I heard that Peter Layton was giving weekend glassblowing courses at his
London Glassblowing Workshop in Rotherhithe. I thought it would be fun.
'That was it, I was hooked. On the Monday morning I put my shop on the
market, and committed myself to a three year apprenticeship.'
Today, she and Alchemy Glass, the business she established in Maidenhead,
Berkshire, in 1987, are known by top department stores from London to Tokyo
for the exclusive designs in glass which she creates in her studio.
'During my apprenticeship I was on Pounds 20 per week and it was costing me
Pounds 22 per week to travel up to London every day.
'The craft council sponsored me for a while, which made life an awful lot
easier, and I waitressed in the evenings. After a certain time, I was able
to sell my own work and that also helped.
'Everybody thought I was crackers. Now everybody says aren't I lucky,
because I'm doing something I love.'
In the first year of trading, Alchemy Glass showed a turnover of around
Pounds 28,000 to Pounds 30,000. By April of 1994 that figure was nearer to
Pounds 70,000.
'After three years of apprenticeship I worked with Peter for another six on
a self-employed basis, so when I came to set up my own studio I had a
rapport with the galleries, because they knew my work.
'That was a very good period for me, as it helped me get my name known
relatively painlessly. If I had had all the expenses of my own studio to
cope with then, it would have been a lot harder.
'I borrowed a lot of money because I wanted to buy good equipment from the
outset. Financially that has paid off hands down. I have had very few
occasions when production has been held up for repairs or maintenance.'
The original loan from Midland Bank was Pounds 50,000. The studio was built
from scratch, and the furnace alone cost around Pounds 10,000, but it was so
well designed by Peter Howard, its maker, that it cuts gas consumption by 50
per cent - just as well, as it has to burn 24 hours a day every day of the
year.
'I currently pay my gas bill by monthly standing orders, so I get no nasty
shocks, and they come to Pounds 254 per payment. I know of another studio
just starting up and using a cheaper, conventional furnace, and they are
paying nearer Pounds 1,000 a month.'
In 1990, Siddy made a first approach to the Japanese market, and is now
selling to Takashimaya and Matsuzukaya, two prestige department stores in
Tokyo.
'I had one contact in Japan as my brother lived there at the time. So having
accommodation made life a lot easier.
'I hired an exhibition room in Yokohama and had invitations printed. It was
a little bit daunting because the costs are enormous. If I had realised how
expensive it was going to be, I might not have started.'
Shipping her work to Japan was enormously expensive, as
was hiring the room and providing a buffet.
'I had an enormous bill from the florist, getting on for a couple of hundred
pounds. That was something I hadn't worked into my calculations.'
But once again, a heavy initial outlay proved to be money well spent.
'It was an enormous success, it was a sell-out show, and it drew enormous
orders which kept me busy all through the summer of that year'.
Takashimaya and Matsuzukaya are still regular customers, ordering twice a
year, at around Pounds 10,000 a time - but a minor cultural difference had
to be ironed out first.
'The Japanese wanted everything to fit in particular sized boxes. That
seemed strange to me, because they were effectively paying a premium for the
uniqueness of the one-off pieces.
'At first this made doing business very difficult, but eventually they
accepted that some of the pieces were individually crafted, and they have
certainly been very pleased with them.'
Japan has been very good to Langley, so good that she is learning Japanese.
She began out of necessity, using a very amateur style tape. Now she is
going to proper classes and learning to read and write.
'When you are in Japan it's not too bad, but telephoning can be very tricky.
When I have got some more Japanese under my belt I will find it much easier
to approach some of the other stores,' she said.
While Siddy prided herself on being very efficient, answering letters by
return and keeping a good filing system, this proved to be a false economy.
When she thought about how many saleable items she could have spent the time
making, it became obvious that it was time to employ someone part-time to do
the paperwork.
She made the right choice, and Cheryl Owen is still looking after the
administration.
In 1992, the birth of her daughter compelled Siddy to take on one full and
one part-time assistant glassblower. But she found they quickly paid for
themselves.
'Richard Price, my full-time assistant, is prepared to sit down and make 30
identical pieces. I couldn't do that - after the first three I'd get bored.
Now I can market in different ways.
'The way that I saw the business developing, is that I would concentrate on
the larger more time-consuming one-off pieces, whereas the more uniform
pieces would be done by Richard, and my part-timer, Julia Donnelly.'
Meanwhile, history could repeat itself in Europe: Siddy's brother is
planning to move to Zurich.
'Once my brother is living in Zurich, I will have my base in Europe, so it
will be a lot easier for me to go over there and tackle Germany and
Switzerland.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / As They Say in Europe: The good old days of cheating are
over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government that sets about exposing corruption reveals that it exists. The
sterner the measures, the more corrupt the country appears. The opposite is
also true.
I recall a press conference on this matter given by the Home Affairs
Minister of Malaysia many years ago. He argued that there was little
corruption in that country because, in spite of setting up an
anti-corruption agency, there had been few arrests. The local media patted
the government on the back.
And then definitions of corruption change. When I finished my education,
many of my contemporaries were forced into banking and the City, consoling
themselves with the expectation of hearing useful rumours, getting a good
tip, or having access to some kind of inside knowledge that might enable
them to compensate for the modesty of their official earnings.
And so to France where there has been the arrest of another highly-placed
personality - Pierre Suard, the boss of the engineering giant Alcatel
Alsthom.
Everybody is asking: is France another Italy?
This scandal comes after the arrest of the boss of another industrial giant,
Schneider, the successive waves of the Tapie affair and allegations about
President Mitterrand.
In fact France, maybe, is not more, or less, corrupt - it is the world that
has changed. The good old days, when one could rob shareholders and cheat
customers without one's integrity being called into question have, for
better or worse, disappeared.
Thus Les Echos, the leading business paper, wrote: 'Justice is crashing into
the business world . . . Company bosses will from now on have to grow
accustomed to this new rigour and to the collapse of a certain number of
barriers behind which they thought themselves protected.'
As the innocent industrialist emerges, rubbing his eyes, facing up to this
new, harsh dawn, he may be comforted by the experience of Bernard Tapie, the
millionaire leftwinger. The more the accusations pile up, the more popular
he becomes. He secured one vote in eight in the recent Euro-elections and is
seen as a kind of foul-mouthed Robin Hood.
'So,' wrote Le Quotidien, 'the boss of Alcatel need only present himself at
the next elections. He will be a roaring success and Tapie will be President
of the Republic. Thus it will have been willed by a justice which has sworn
to be just.' Le Quotidien, having delivered itself of this epigram, expired,
never to be quoted again.
On the day Suard was arrested, in an unusual piece of serendipity, Le Monde
brought out a survey of corruption. Its most interesting contribution was a
theoretical review which decided two pre-conditions were essential - rent
and regulation.
Now 'rent' is a difficult word in English and here is meant economic rent.
The example given is the case of a house whose real value is transformed as
a result of the construction of an underground railway station nearby.
Should the landlord benefit from the increased value of the residence, or
the tenant or the municipality?
Real corruption takes place when the site of the station is decided
beforehand by potential beneficiaries. There are concrete examples of how
this works in France today: Le Monde cites the notorious Loi Royer of 1973
which gives local business committees the power to decide whether a new
supermarket can be opened in their district. 'As might be expected, the
members of these committees have sold their votes.'
The French economy was often dominated by the system of permits and
licences: it provided support for the ancien regime and thus promoted the
events of 1789. The aristos were in fact rent snatchers.
Among the accusations against Pierre Suard is an allegation of a form of
rent-snatching: an Alcatel subsidiary allegedly over-invoiced France
Telecom.
The public sector in France is there partly to ensure the existence of
substantial and successful private sector enterprises. So there is a system
of fruitful mutual dependence between monopoly buyer and monopoly supplier.
In such circumstances it may not be all that odd if Pierre Suard enjoyed, as
alleged, the services of France Telecom free of charge at his private
residence. It is just, as Les Echos noted, that everything is much stricter
these days. What was once normal becomes egregious and is now stamped on.
And any attempt to compensate for the loss takes on more overtly criminal
forms.
So the question - is France another Italy? - is hardly relevant. The world
of licences and permits shrinks and we are probably witnessing the collapse
of the old order rather than the arrival of the new.
In France many regret the zeal of a new breed of law enforcement officers.
In the world of the electronic criminal, the tales of Tapie, Alcatel and
Schneider have enormous sentimental appeal.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Fashion: Let's join the pyjama game this summer - Wear your
night clothes in the street and no one will turn a hair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a classic nightmare in which you imagine you are walking in the
street dressed only in undies or nightwear. You are covered in confusion but
no one else is turning a hair.
This summer, however, you will not be embarrassed and the dream will be for
real, as the pyjama game is being played in some of the world's most
fashionable spots.
Pyjamas are the acceptable face of this year's generally not very wearable
fashion. At the catwalk shows, the barrage of shutter-clicking when
minuscule minis or schoolgirl slip-dresses appeared was counterpointed by
the approving sighs of the fashion press as loose shirts and trousers
appeared.
You can guess what made the headlines, but pyjamas have sneaked into the
shops as the season's commercial success. Managers in middle-market
companies which have not produced any are now kicking themselves.
A loose shirt and drawstring trousers can be worn by virtually anyone but,
choose carefully if you want them to flatter. Try them on and look
critically (particularly at your rear view) before you buy.
In coarser fabrics they can be easier on the waist than on the eye. A
crinkly polyester version of drawstring trousers has, for years, been the
basic fodder of outsize and even maternity departments.
This is, quite sensibly, because they are blissfully comfortable whatever
your circumference. But if you would prefer not to look as if you were an
habituee of either place, you should choose a very soft fabric, such as
silk, fine cotton jersey or delicate linen that will gently wrap and drape
itself round your form rather than camouflage it or make your hips look
enormous. Pre-washed or crushed fabrics have the softest touch of all.
Because drawstring trousers are not new, designers have had to freshen them
up in order to make them look like this year's hot number and not last
year's cold potage. The abiding image that lingers in the mind (even from
designers as commercial as Ralph Lauren) is of trousers drooping below
navel-level and worn with a cropped top scarely bigger than a bra. This is
only to be recommended if there is not even a finger's pinch of spare tyre
anywhere, which in practice means on very few people.
The point of drawstring trousers is that they free you from the rigours of
high fashion and allow you to relax. They are therefore not suitable office
wear unless you work in a particularly relaxed environment. But they are
wonderful for holidays, weekends and entertaining at home. In St Tropez,
always the cradle of Mediterranean trends, pyjamas were already de rigueur
by May, worn over swimsuits, protecting skin from the midday sun.
The smooth line of a swimsuit, or fine knit or jersey body is the most
flattering partner to pyjamas, with the shirt or jacket worn open to show
off the drawstring knot. Donna Karan matches fine-knit body-vests to
narrow-shouldered, fluted, silk pyjamas for a monochrome, simple yet dressy
look that would suit a summer party.
An alternative is a soft waistcoat or slip top to match the trousers, with
the shirt contrasted or in a print. If you are young and fit and your tum
can take it, go for the crop top - the loose shirt will give some
camouflage.
Accessories take an equally relaxed approach. The rediscovery that some high
heels look good with some trousers does not apply to pyjamas.
Espadrilles, natural-looking lightweight sandals - even thongs if you are
tall - or, at most, small-heeled mules look better. Jewellery and even
sunglasses need the same light, minimal look.
Plain, fine-rimmed tortoiseshells from Giorgio Armani, a period-looking mix
of tortoiseshell and burnished metal from Calvin Klein or 1970s-style fine
metal rims with softly coloured lenses from Romeo Gigli are effective and
comfortable to wear.
An advantage of the pyjama suit is that it is concealing enough to be
acceptable wear for women travellers even in sensitive areas. Our pictures
were taken amid the little pastel-washed houses and verandahs of the
picturesque Malay quarter in Cape Town, South Africa, a strongly Moslem area
where young girls wear headscarves and men are more likely to sport pyjama
suits.
Yet even the veiled mothers, watching over their children playing cricket in
the quiet streets, smiled and approved as our model posed. Not for them, of
course, and the bare midriffs not, perhaps, for anyone. But the shirts and
trousers for their teenage daughters? Yes, perhaps one day.

FT  09 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Where to spot top talents of the future -
Commercial products and works of art from the latest crop of bright young
British designers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can tell it is July by the flurry of activity in art schools up and down
the country. Invitations to student shows from Aberdeen to Penzance arrive
daily.
For those with time and leisure nothing could be more rewarding than doing
the rounds and seeing just what the most creative youngsters are up to.
For most of us, however, taking in anything more than a couple of student
shows is hardly practicable. This is where the New Designers exhibition at
the Business Design Centre, Islington, London N1 comes in. Under one roof
you can find a broad range of the most interesting work from colleges all
over the UK.
The exhibition has come to serve as a marketplace, bringing together the
talents of the bright young things emerging from the colleges and
industrialists and manufacturers in need of new ideas and new designers.
As the exhibition has grown it has become more unwieldy so, this year, it
has been divided into two. The first week (hurry, just today and tomorrow
left) is devoted to commercial design and should be of particular interest
to any industrialist or small businessman looking for new products or new
talent. Here is a selection of what is on offer:
Hamish Pitt, a student at Brunel, has developed a dual-drive system which
allows cars to be driven on the left or the right. Alison Swabey, also from
Brunel, has come up with an alcohol tester so that those having one too many
in the pub can see for themselves just what their alcohol rating is. Her
design takes the form of a booth which could be installed in restaurants and
pubs making it a simple matter for people to see just how much they have
been affected by drink.
Mark Cornwall, of De Montfort University, has designed a fly-tying device
for night-fishermen.
A Sheffield Hallam University student has come up with a heart defibrillator
which can be carried by mountain rescue teams.
All these new ideas - and many more - can be seen today and tomorrow at
Islington's Business Design Centre (Saturday from 10am to 6pm, Sunday from
10am to 4pm).
The exhibition then closes until Thursday when it reopens to focus on
one-off, limited-edition designs - you will find ceramics, glass,
accessories, textiles such as rugs and wall-hangings, and one-off pieces of
furniture and lighting as well as avant-garde jewellery.
Most things in the second exhibition will be for sale, with prices ranging
from about Pounds 5 to Pounds 5,000, and it is a great opportunity to look
for idiosyncratic presents as well as for designers who could carry out a
special commission.
Also at the Business Centre is a One Year On exhibition for designers who
have graduated to the workplace. This year there are several youngsters I
wrote about two years ago, all blossoming, several with companies of their
own, others departed to exciting jobs abroad.
Jonathan Hoad, who made a stunning clothes unit-cum-silent valet, has his
own shop, Lime Design in Archway. Marianne Buus, whose hand-blown and
studio-blown glass is colourfully memorable, is working in Sweden. Adrian
Reynolds, a metalworker, has taken private commissions and works from a
converted chapel in Ironbridge Gorge, in Coalbrookdale, (tel: 0952-433222)
while Eleanor Kearney is designing cutlery and tableware in Sheffield.
The exhibition is opens on Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10am to 6pm,
and on Sunday (July 17) from 10am to 4pm. Entrance fee, Pounds 5 for adults,
Pounds 3.50 for students.

The Anglepoise lamp, now 60 years old, is a design classic. It is as
sturdily attractive and practical today as when it first came on the market.
The original Anglepoise lamp was a trail-blazer in its day, offering, as it
did, flexible lighting using hinges based on the bending of the human arm.
The same company has now produced an updated version - equally flexible but
using a system derived from studies of the human spine.
The Artikula lamp is, indubitably, of a different generation. It looks
clean, spare, almost space-age in its uncompromising modernity. It, too, is
a reading or working lamp, designed to sit on a table or desk top or be
clamped to the side of furniture or shelves.
Made from a mixture of nylon, polycarbonate and stainless steel, it is
available in slate grey with a choice of other colours on the top of the
shade. It has a reach of 1 metre and its chief practical claim is that it is
highly flexible. There is a single or double-jointed model. The
double-jointed version will be on sale at the end of the month and will cost
about Pounds 105, the single later in the year.
For details of stockists apply to Anglepoise, Enfield Industrial Area,
Redditch B97 6DR. Tel: 0527-63771.
Regular readers of How To Spend It and Jancis Robinson's wine column will
have heard of Riedel wine glasses and of the intense care that has gone into
developing a glass for each grape type, thus enabling the imbiber to enjoy
to the full the particular properties of each.
Now Riedel has produced a glass for ordinary everyday use. The Gourmet
glass, with a tulip-shaped bowl, is designed for drinking anything from
mineral water to claret. It is just 6in tall, so can fit into the top drawer
of a dishwasher and costs Pounds 5.95. Most department stores and wine
merchants sell them.

FT  09 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: The New Designer's Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Claire Norwood is a splendid example of what can happen to young students
whose work is shown at the New Designers' Exhibition.
Just a year ago she was graduating from the Cordwainers' College and her
individual interpretation of what footwear could be like was on view. One
year on finds her with her own workshop at 398 St John's Street, London EC1,
creating idiosyncratic made-to-measure shoes.
Her customers include sculptors, journalists, a rehabilitation officer, a
fashion photographer, a magazine editor, a financial analyst, shop
assistants, Glenys Kinnock's speech writer, and a make-up artist and
stylist.
Although her shoes are all made to order she does have a consistent
aesthetic. For new customers she has a portfolio of previous work which
customers can refer to and order from.
Like many designers her career got off the ground by chance. Vogue magazine
asked her to make some footwear reminiscent of the 1950s for a picture they
had in mind.
She often uses old leather and materials which give her work a special air.
'I rummage around,' she tells me, 'and find old things which I re-use - like
old stiletto shoes or an old green leather coat which I found in a flea
market for about Pounds 5 and cut up to make five or six pairs of shoes.
'I know several old shoemakers on their last legs and I go in and raid their
workshops and they think it is great to have their backrooms cleared out. I
also scout around in markets for buckles, bits of leather, buttons, bits of
jewellery which I use to give individuality to the shoes.
'I made some wonderful boots from old used leather which have a splendid
patina to them which makes them look different.' Claire will take green
patent leather or gunmetal organza and make them into mules for the 1990s.
She makes shoes simple and wearable but makes them special by using
beautiful detailing. 'If I'm not using old materials I go to Northampton to
buy the top quality leather, which is beautifully soft,' she says.
Prices range from Pounds 90, for a pair of mules from the existing
collection, up to Pounds 250 for a pair of knee-high boots (but these will
be made to suit your own contours).
She takes measurements - and prefers to see her customers, but adds: 'I have
had a lady in Gloucestershire who just sent in her measurements after seeing
the piece in Vogue and I'm making her a pair of sandals.'
A small collection of her work can be seen at the Islington workshop (tel:
071-837 2355), from which you may order, and at Yvonne Damant, 2 The Square,
Richmond, Surrey.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Old theme, new variation - The
Prudential's latest offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life assurance-linked savings policies such as endowments have been
criticised by almost everybody - except those selling them - as expensive,
inefficient and inflexible ways to save. Yet, that has not stopped the life
companies, their sales forces, tied agents and commission-driven independent
financial advisers (IFAs) from carrying on selling.
Now, at last, the UK's largest life insurer has come up with a new variation
on the old endowment theme which goes some way towards answering the main
criticisms.
The new Prudence savings account, from the Prudential, is a with-profits
savings vehicle but there are several important differences between it and
conventional with-profits endowment plans. These include:
No fixed term. Savers are not tied to the standard terms of 10 or 25 years.
Contributions can be regular monthly amounts, or occasional lump sums, or
both.
Regular savings amounts can be increased or decreased at any time so long as
they stay above the Pounds 30 minimum.
Contributions can be suspended if personal circumstances change - for months
or years, if necessary. The only condition is that if, after 10 years, the
account contains less than Pounds 1,000 and regular contributions are not
being made, it will be closed down.
The life assurance element is minimal, so single or childless people are not
forced into paying for large amounts of unnecessary life cover. A separate,
flexible term assurance policy is available if wanted. Partial withdrawals
can be made if savers need access to the money - they do not have to choose
all or nothing.
There are drawbacks, though. Withdrawals are discouraged heavily during the
first five to 10 years; inside this period, charges may mean you do not get
all your money back. And if you have saved less than Pounds 3,000, there
could be a withdrawal fee of up to Pounds 180.
With-profits funds invest in shares, property, and fixed interest
securities, so long-term returns should be better than a building society.
But the actual returns paid to savers are at the discretion of the company
actuary, rather than linked directly to stock market growth.
Interest is paid in the form of annual 'bonuses'. Initially, these will
start at 4.75 per cent, going up to 5.75 per cent on amounts over Pounds
4,000 and 7 per cent over Pounds 6,000. While these rates are no better than
those available from building societies, there is also the possibility of
additional bonuses on withdrawal or death.
The company reserves the right, however, to make 'market value adjustments'
when you withdraw large amounts. This means it can reduce the value of your
investment if it misjudged the level of bonuses awarded earlier, or the
market has fallen recently.
Charges are slightly more transparent than with conventional endowments -
there is a 6 per cent initial levy on contributions - but others are
deducted from the fund before bonus levels are set, rather than being stated
and fixed openly. The actuarial involvement makes the overall charging
structure opaque, and costs generally will be higher than for more
straightforward investment vehicles.
Prudence is designed to appeal to unsophisticated or extremely risk-averse
small savers. As such, it is a definite improvement on conventional life
assurance-linked savings plans. But it will not attract more sophisticated
people willing to take an active interest in their investments.
Even if they only have small amounts to save, they should go for more direct
equity-linked investments, such as unit or investment trust savings schemes,
which provide better returns with lower costs and even greater flexibility.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Loans hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of more, and cheaper, fixed rate mortgage loans was held out
this week by Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, as he announced
changes to the way building societies can operate. But societies themselves
were rather more doubtful that the rise in the ceiling on the amount of
funds they can raise on the wholesale money markets would have that effect,
at least in the short term.
They did say, however, that the new powers which are planned - including the
right to full ownership of a general insurance company - would enable them
to compete more effectively. This suggests some benefits to customers in
terms of pricing and services.
Direct Line's entry into the mortgage market - albeit just as a pilot scheme
at the moment - might also have a downward effect on pricing.
In the Treasury's review of building societies' legislation, the other side
of the coin from greater flexibility is greater accountability to members.
Societies will soon have to give their members more information in the
annual report and accounts. This will include such areas as payments to
directors.
Later, when the government finds time to legislate, the boards of societies
will have to tell members at the next general meeting of any
non-confidential take-over offers from organisations other than societies.
Nelson also said that a government consultation paper to be issued in the
autumn would look at other ways of making societies more accountable, such
as reserving certain seats on boards for members' representatives.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting losses against gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have incurred capital losses on share dealings. The shares were bought
from a joint account with my wife but are held in my name only.
My wife has property which, when sold, will produce significant capital
gains. It was bought solely by her with her own money although it could be
transferred to joint ownership before sale.
Can the losses on shares be set against the gains on property?
We take it you mean that the shares belonged to you exclusively (as distinct
from being held in your name as nominee for your wife and yourself, or as
nominee for your wife alone).
That being so, the allowable losses on the shares can only be set against
gains which accrue to you (and not against gains which accrue to your wife).
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT 15 (Capital gains tax: a guide
for married couples).
If she has not already done so, your wife should seek guidance from her
solicitor on the possibility of mitigating the prospective CGT bill on her
property. (We can make no further comment, in the absence of relevant data).
She should ask her tax office for the free pamphlet CGT 4 (Capital gains
tax: owner-occupied houses): its scope is wider than the title suggests.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Would it be in order, during March 1995, to pay in advance the electricity
and gas bills due during the period April 1995 to end-March 1996? This would
avoid paying the full rate of 17 1/2 per cent VAT which comes into force
during that time.
Yes. You will avoid the increase to the extent you make payments in advance
and there is no restriction in relation to bills for which any advance
payment is made.
You can make a payment of estimated bills for as many years as you wish but
the amount of any saving will depend on interest rates applying after the
advance payment has been made.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The inspector is right
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I were partners in a farm which we sold in 1988. A small capital
gains loss was established and agreed with the Inland Revenue dealing with
my returns at the time. I had assumed this was in my name to add to my
allowances to be carried forward from year to year should the need arise.
After some correspondence with my Revenue office, the tax inspector told me
I was entitled to only 50 per cent of the loss as I was in partnership with
my wife at the time.
Is this ruling correct? If so, can my wife claim the other 50 per cent to
set against any capital gains she may have in the future?
Yes, your tax inspector is right; and yes, your wife can set the allowable
loss on her share of the property against her future chargeable gains.
Ask the tax office for the free leaflet CGT 15 (Capital gain tax: a guide
for married couples).

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Independent child of a powerful
parent - The Professionals / Seeing how the professionals look after their
clients' money gives an insight into managing your own better. That's the
theory behind Joanna Slaughter's series on private client investment
managers. Today: BZW Portfolio Management Ltd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BZW Portfolio Management Ltd (PML) is the investment and financial
management division of the BZW Group, the international investment banking
arm of the Barclays Group, and the advantages of this parentage are
considerable.
Take analysts: BZW has more than 200, who are a major source of research for
PML's portfolio managers, while Barclays provides an extensive distribution
network to assist the search for new clients. Well over half PML's private
clients are introduced through the bank's high street branches, or through
the Barclays Group as a whole.
The obverse of this particular coin is that PML must work hard to reassure
its private clients that there are no conflicts of interest, and that it is
not the poodle of either the Barclays Group or BZW.
PML was established as a separate legal entity; it has its own board of
directors, which is separate to those of the BZW trading companies; and it
distances itself physically by occupying a separate building. Peter
Saunders, head of portfolio management, says: 'We are independent - we do
what is best for the client.
'For instance, we wouldn't necessarily take a view that agreed with BZW
Securities because a great deal of the output from securities houses is
aimed at institutional investors and we have to interpret research for the
private individual.'
PML also thinks hard before using any group product for private clients.
Saunders explains: 'If we go into a Barclays unit trust, we have to be able
to prove that it is positively better than any other.'
The directors describe PML's investment style as 'conservative but
pro-active, aided by our direct line access to research and sophisticated
technology'. This technology includes a pilot scheme with a system devised
by James Bevan, a PML director.
With this, market forecasts are fed into a computer programme that has the
history of markets and currencies already in it. The system then produces a
suggested asset allocation. 'It is a tool, not a full answer,' says
Saunders. 'It rationalises history into a reasoned view of the world, and it
takes into account more circumstances than you could keep in your head.'
Saunders adds: 'We have a house view on pretty much everything on the world
markets and on the right allocation for general categories of clients.'
Portfolio managers are asked to interpret the house view in relation to
their clients.
Insight into the firm's thinking can be found in the latest asset allocation
guidelines for private clients who are looking either for 'wealth growth' or
for 'wealth preservation'.
For clients wanting income from a wealth growth portfolio, the guideline
allocations are UK cash, 10.53 per cent; conventional gilts, 25 per cent;
convertibles, 21.60 per cent; UK equities, 40 per cent; and emerging
markets, 2.86 per cent.
For clients who are seeking capital appreciation, the suggested split is UK
cash, 12.61 per cent; conventional gilts, 10 per cent; index-linked gilts,
7.5 per cent; UK equities 46.14 per cent; North America, 2.5 per cent;
Continental Europe, 10 per cent; Pacific Rim and Japan, 3.75 per cent; and
emerging markets, 7.5 per cent.
On wealth preservation portfolios, more emphasis is placed on gilts for
income and UK equities for growth. The suggested income divide is UK cash,
12.50 per cent; conventional gilts, 30 per cent; index-linked gilts, 1.65
per cent; convertibles, 16.67 per cent; UK equities, 32.93 per cent; and
overseas equities, 6.25 per cent.
The growth guideline allocations are UK cash, 11.91 per cent; conventional
gilts, 10 per cent; index-linked gilts, 10 per cent; UK equities, 52.50 per
cent; North America, 4.34 per cent; continental Europe, 2.50 per cent;
Pacific rim and Japan, 3.75 per cent; and emerging markets, 5 per cent.
PML prides itself on providing bespoke investment management within
parameters set by the private clients themselves. The 20 portfolio managers
who deal with private client money meet each morning at 8.15 to discuss
global economic or political developments, overnight market movements and
specific stocks.
Traditionally, PML held a buy/hold/sell stock list, but this has been
developed recently to include the measurement of technical factors. The
stock selection list is reviewed constantly and the performance of its
shares is used to demonstrate the firm's investment track record.
Charles Pinney, the director in charge of offshore portfolio services, says:
'There is no edict saying these are the stocks managers must hold for
clients, but they are a recommendation to a manager if he is buying now. If
he gets very enthusiastic about a stock, he can get it put on the list.'
Currency hedges are used to a limited extent, and 'individually tailored'
derivatives' programmes are available through BZW. The firm also has access
to group expertise if clients want management of other assets, such as
property.
Portfolio performances are monitored rigorously, and PML is reviewing its
information technology to assist the process. 'Anyone can have a streak of
bad luck,' Saunders points out, 'and we encourage managers to come and tell
us if anything is going wrong.'
Average turnover within the portfolios is 30 per cent, and Saunders says:
'Whenever we make changes in a portfolio, we write to the client. It has
become part of the service, although some of our competitors have given up
doing this.'
PML also differs from some competitors in its willingness to take clients on
an advisory, as well as a discretionary, basis. Saunders describes
investment houses that will not offer an advisory service as 'arrogant'. He
argues: 'It is not client-sensitive. What is important is that you give
advisory clients just as much attention as your discretionary clients,
rather than making them tail-end Charlies.'
PML manages Pounds 1.3bn on behalf of private clients, and the average
portfolio of new clients is Pounds 750,000. But the directors will not say
how many private clients there are. Perhaps some professional secrecy is
required from even the most independent arm of a large banking group.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Back to the futures - Commodities /
Investment prospects as markets rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of coffee futures have more than doubled since the start of the year
as world supplies have become tight. The increase has been followed by other
markets - such as base metals, cocoa and even cotton  - as commodity prices
improve in line with the world economic recovery.
Peter Swete, managing director of Sabre fund managers - which launched a
commodity investment fund this week - says: 'It's a good time to invest in
commodities because they are very, very cheap compared with any other asset.
Over the next two to three years, we could see the markets go up
substantially.'
The last time coffee prices soared, late in the 1970s, consumers stockpiled
supplies to beat price increases. There are, however, other ways commodity
investors can benefit from rising markets, depending on their capacity to
take on risk.
Probably the riskiest is to become involved directly in futures trading.
This, though, is only for the most sophisticated and wealthy investors who
can afford to lose money if things go wrong. GNI, a London brokerage firm
which takes on a number of private clients, usually demands they have a
minimum Dollars 20,000 available as risk capital.
Commodities trading should be seen as a way to diversify a traditional
portfolio with holdings of equities, bonds and foreign exchange - not as a
way to make easy profits on a core investment. Advisers say individuals
should not put much more than 5 per cent of their investment capital into
commodities.
Investors can buy a large market exposure with a small down-payment in the
futures business, but prices can be fast-moving and volatile. GNI's Nigel
Avey says: 'If someone is not 100 per cent sure that they want an active
dealing relationship with the firm - that is, with a broker who wants
instructions on a daily basis - we would steer them away from futures
trading.'
Two indices, both of which trade as futures contracts, offer a way to play
on a wide range of commodities by investing in one product. The Goldman
Sachs commodity index and the Commodity Research Bureau index both provide a
spread of risk across the markets.
But a much 'safer' and traditional investment method has been through
putting money into such natural resource companies as those in mining and
oil.
Many retail brokerage firms offer commodity and energy unit trusts or
investment funds, such as the M&amp;G Commodity and General unit trust which has
attracted Pounds 28m. Such investments can provide some of the potential
gains from rising commodity prices without the huge swings associated with
the futures market.
But investors who want direct exposure to commodities, with some of the
up-side offered by futures, can go for a managed futures fund. These have
become very popular in the US but are relatively small in the UK, where
futures and options funds were sanctioned by the investment authorities only
four years ago.
Sabre's commodity recovery fund is an offshore vehicle designed to limit
some of the risk associated with futures. Its aim is to invest in rising
markets but liquidate its holdings as soon as a fall in prices seems
imminent. The fund also has limits on the amount of cash it can put into
each market sector at any one time, as well as the amount of gearing it can
take.
This cautious approach means it does not risk calamity in any one market,
but it also cuts out some of the benefit of large market moves.
Before coffee rose by another Dollars 1,000 a tonne last week after frost
damaged crops in Brazil, Sabre had halved its exposure to this commodity
because its technical charts signalled that the surge in prices was
overdone. 'That's okay,' said Swete. 'It had already doubled in price.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A tremor on the veldt . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of being told by eager brokers that South Africa was now an
excellent place to put money, this week's surprise resignation by respected
finance minister Derek Keys proved something of a shock to investors.
Although his official statement stressed his decision arose from personal
and not policy concerns, the suddenness of the announcement and the lack of
a detailed explanation led to widespread fears that a serious clash inside
the cabinet actually was responsible and that economic policies might soon
be jettisoned.
As the news reached the markets, gilts soared (moving above 15 per cent),
stocks tumbled and the financial rand, the barometer of international
financial confidence, dropped sharply. South African stocks in London were
hit particularly hard, and market sentiment will be tested on Tuesday when
the first global launch of a convertible bond issue by a South African
company, life assurer Liberty Life, is priced.
Yet, despite the government's inept handling of the affair, it seems
increasingly clear that Keys' move does not signal any change in direction.
The appointment of an apolitical career banker, Christo Liebenberg, as his
successor and strong statements by both President Mandela and deputy finance
minister Alec Erwin, stressing their commitment to fiscal discipline, have
helped to reassure the markets.
While there is lingering disappointment that a man as capable as Keys has
decided to go, and some fears that Liebenberg might not be up to the
political challenges, there is general relief that the spirit of the
coalition government of national unity is intact and its public commitment
to cutting the budget deficit unchanged.
'I think it has served as a wake-up call,' said one Johannesburg dealer.
'Everyone knew things couldn't go perfectly forever, and the overall picture
still looks pretty good.'
This month sees the launch of the UK's first South Africa unit trusts by
Credit Suisse and Save &amp; Prosper, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
The fund managers are unperturbed by this week's events. 'It is a glitch and
does not change the investment case,' said Neil Gregson, Credit Suisse fund
manager.
'The markets were initially in turmoil on rumours of the resignation and,
although bonds may stay weak, the currency will probably soon be back to
where it started.'
Marina Lloyd, Save &amp; Prosper's fund manager, added: 'We have stressed that
political risk will remain in the short and medium term, but we do feel
there is huge potential for the economy.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Pibs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies take pride in their solid, reliable image. Imagine then,
popping in to your nearest branch to buy its irredeemable debt paper - one
of the riskier investments around.
Yet, the Building Societies Commission, which supervises the societies, has
sent a letter to their chief executives outlining the procedures it would
expect if they decided to sell permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs).
To be fair, the letter aimed to highlight 'the need for special care in
selling investment products', but at least one society was surprised that
the commission was allowing the sale of Pibs over the counter.
Pibs are a way for building societies to raise money. They have no maturity
date, so the investor's capital cannot be guaranteed, and they are bought
and sold in the market.
In theory, they pay a fixed rate of interest indefinitely, but missed
interest payments do not mount up for payment at a later date.
Those holding Pibs are last in line for repayment in the event of a wind-up
and are not covered by a compensation scheme.
Leeds was the first to issue Pibs in July 1991. With a minimum denomination
of Pounds 50,000 - roughly, the cost of a Mercedes 280SL - the issue was
aimed at institutions. The market has since grown to Pounds 1bn.
Private investors have been attracted to the shares because of their
relatively high yield, as the table shows.
The societies themselves are cautious about the idea of retailing Pibs.
Martin Ritchley, the Coventry's chief executive, says: 'I would not want
traditional building society investors to mistake Pibs for a traditional
building society investment.'
Bristol &amp; West says, however: 'We would be keen to see changes to widen
customer choice and convenience, but we would want to make sure that
customers understood them.'
Michael Dyson, director of BZW Capital Markets, adds: 'Private investors
should ignore the speculative motives for buying Pibs but, if they require a
high income, concentrate on those that give the best combination of yield
and quality.
'At present, these are Britannia and, for the large investor, the Leeds.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mood set last week in terms of a toiling market and enthusiastic buying
by company directors has continued.
An increase in selling, however, may be explained in part by the desire of
directors to dispose of - or, at least, lighten their exposure to - their
company's shares before the market weakens their price as a part of its
overall mark-down.
Bluebird Toys is a company where the directors appear to be behaving in
anticipation of the market. The share price has outperformed the market by
200 per cent over the past 12 months. Torquil Norman, the chairman, has
taken the opportunity afforded by the pre-closed period to sell 305,000
shares at 201p.
His residual holding accounts for almost 7 per cent of the company, and his
statement at the time final results were announced was resolutely up-beat.
In much the same vein, selling by David MacDonald, non-executive director of
distillers group MacDonald Martin, follows a period of outperformance by the
shares. His holding of 'A' shares has been considerably reduced, but he
still holds more than 900,000 'B' shares.
TGI makes small loud-speakers for cars, as well as marketing other consumer
electronic products. The revival of fortunes for the car industry has led to
a knock-on improvement at TGI, and four directors bought some of their own
stock during the week at 76.5p a share.
While the total transaction was not large, directors' buying in the past has
been spot-on in terms of timing. Thus, the present activity would seem to be
particularly noteworthy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, reports annual figures on Monday which
may finally silence the critics of its Pounds 990m takeover of Ranks Hovis
McDougall in December 1992. Analysts expect the food group to have
contributed profits of around Pounds 100m despite the pressure on UK grocery
prices. For the group as a whole, forecasts range from Pounds 255m to Pounds
265m, up from Pounds 171m.
Improved margins in North America and signs of increased volumes in
continental Europe are expected on Monday to lift Low &amp; Bonar's interim
pre-tax profits for the six months to May 31 by about 22 per cent to Pounds
17.5m. The international packaging and materials group has shed non-core
businesses and shored up its mainstream activities with acquisitions such as
Cereal Packaging, the former Kellogg company.
Owners Abroad, the package holiday company, is expected on Wednesday to
announce a first-half pre-tax loss of about Pounds 35m, compared with Pounds
38.6m last time. There is nothing alarming about a first-half deficit for a
holiday company, though. More important will be the management's assessment
of the summer market and the prospects of a price war.
HP Bulmer, the Hereford-based cider-maker which is withdrawing from the soft
drinks market, is expected to report operating profits rising from Pounds
19.6m to Pounds 21.5m on Wednesday. But the pre-tax profits are likely to be
around Pounds 4m following exceptional charges for re-structuring.
Cray Electronics Holdings, the data communications and software systems
group, is expected on Wednesday to report annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
25.5m. This compares with Pounds 29m in 1992-93 when exceptional items
included Pounds 12.6m from selling Malvern Instruments.
Great Universal Stores, the mail-order, retail, financial services and
property group, which last year enfranchised its shareholders, is expected
to report a 46th year of uninterrupted growth on Thursday. Pre-tax profits
are forecast at Pounds 510m for the year to end-March, ahead from Pounds
475m.
The Rank Organisation, which announces first-half results on Thursday, is
expected to reveal profits before exceptional charges of between Pounds 111m
and Pounds 115m. The exceptional charges of Pounds 112m relate to US video
distribution closure costs and Rank's share of the re-structuring of Rank
Xerox.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Trusts with real appeal - Gillian
O'Connor discovers how a professional analyst picks them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Picking unit trusts often seems harder than picking individual shares -
perhaps not surprising, as there are more than 1,500 authorised UK trusts to
choose from. Fund Research analyses trusts for professional financial
advisers. We asked managing director Peter Jeffreys how he picks the good
ones.
Question. What percentage of unit trust funds do worse than the market?
Answer. At least three-quarters of all funds normally do worse than the
FT-SE-A All-Share index.
Q. How useful are historic performance tables in picking future top
performers?
A. Only one in five of the funds in the top quarter of a five-year league
table are likely to remain in the top quarter over the next five years. For
my money, that's not good enough.
Q. Is there an alternative selection method?
A. We use a combination of quantitative analysis and qualitative appraisal.
Only 15 per cent of funds pass the initial statistical screening. This
breaks the five-year periods down into five separate one-year periods in
order to find the funds which do consistently well.
If you give each of those one-year periods an equal weighting in your
analysis (as we do in our retail guide*), you improve the odds. That gives
you a one in three chance of picking a fund which will be in the top quarter
in future.
Our actual selection method is weighted towards the last three years. To get
through our screen, a fund has to have an average percentile of 37.5 or
better, with the later years counting more.
Q. Once a fund gets through the initial screen, what then?
A. We divide funds into A, AA and AAA. The statistical analysis accounts for
40 per cent of the overall rating. Our assessment of the fund manager
carries 30 per cent. The fund management group and team account for the
remainder.
Q. What are you trying to find out about the manager?
A. First and foremost, whether it was luck or judgment that produced the
good performance. Was it produced responsibly? Was it produced by a
high-risk strategy or a low-risk strategy? What types of company was he
buying and what was his buying like?
Has he done serious research - either himself, or using his house analysts
or stockbrokers' analysts? Has he satisfied himself of the security of the
company he is buying before he buys it - or is he just buying on the basis
that it looks good and the story sounds good?
But the manager is only part of the management group. We also look at the
resources, disciplines and the investment process. Is it a disciplined
process or ad hoc? If, in two or three weeks' time, somebody says to him:
'Why did you buy that', will he know?
Q. You prefer a disciplined process?
A. We find it works best. There will be a structure - a top down process.
Currency, politics, economics, what impact that has on the economy, on
sectors and the types of companies which will do well.
Q. But I thought that Fidelity, for instance, tended to work from the bottom
up: identify a company and then try to find reasons why you are allowed to
buy it.
A. Yes indeed, and Templeton's the same. Mark Mobius, their emerging markets
specialist, is rigorous in his defence of the bottom up approach. We have
run numbers over a full market cycle of top down versus bottom up, and find
that each tends to do better in one part of the cycle. The bottom up
approach does better at the end of the cycle.
Q. So, should investors switch from one fund manager to another as the cycle
progresses?
A. If the investor has got the ability to detect when in the market cycle it
is right to make that kind of switch. But we encourage investors to take a
long-term view and back a particular approach for the full cycle.
Q. And do you prefer fund managers to take a long-term view, too, or can
they act as traders?
A. In 25 years in the business, I have not met any consistently successful
traders. So, I am a little suspicious of trading activity for the sake of
trading activity. But there are certainly times in the market cycle when it
is appropriate. Say, at the extremes of the market cycle.
But remember, it is possible for someone to invest for the long term and
still end up with a portfolio turnover of 100 or 200 per cent because things
happened more quickly than he expected and he had to respond to events.
That's quite understandable, particularly in the current market environment
where you've got massive volatility, a lot of it now induced by derivatives
and by people who are not really investors.
Q. Soros &amp; co?
A. No, they are investors. But there are a lot of people on the fringes who
are going in with very sophisticated quantitative models to exploit
anomalies created by investors.
Q. Does unusually high turnover normally produce a poor performance?
A. We've done some work on that, and it showed very little correlation
between high turnover and poor performance.
Q. How does the size of a fund affect its performance?
A. A fund has to have critical mass. It doesn't matter how good the fund
manager is, if you've got a 9 or 10 per cent expense ratio against you every
year, it quickly moves you down the performance scale.
But the paradox is that, at the other end of the scale, a fund can get too
big so that it ceases to perform well. Take Fidelity's Magellan fund in
America, now worth Dollars 30bn. Its performance now is not what it was in
1980 when it was a Dollars 200m fund.
Q. So, what size will allow a fund to perform well?
A. Where a fund manager has reasonable flexibility to trade, whatever he
decides is his unit of size. Say it's a Pounds 300m fund and he wants to
invest in units of, say, 2 per cent: ie, 50 holdings of Pounds 6m apiece. He
needs to be aware of how long it will take him to buy - or sell - that unit.
Obviously, if it's a blue chip stock, it's going to be easy; but if it's a
mid-cap stock, it might take him a bit of time.
But size as such doesn't frighten us. Look at Perpetual or Schroders, both
of which have seen massive increases in funds under management over the past
two to three years. We feel comfortable about both. What we ask ourselves is
whether the fund's size is now such that it can't replicate its past
performance.
Q. So, are you saying that it is hard to perform at either Pounds 5m or
Pounds 1bn.
A. Actually, at Pounds 5m you can get some good performances. But when we
see a Pounds 5m fund with a good performance, we ask ourselves how much of
that superior performance is due to the smallness of the fund. Was it being
piggy-backed by bigger funds in the group? Were all the new issues being
poured into this fund?
Q. Are there any pointers the investor can usefully consider when looking at
new launches? The fund management group or the fund manager himself, for
instance?
A. Definitely. Has the fund manager got relevant experience. Is he a
greenhorn straight out of university or the analysts' department?
One of the times to watch out is when a particular segment of the stock
market suddenly becomes fashionable. And a group with no previous expertise
in that field decides it has to launch a fund, and it doesn't matter who
manages it. That doesn't always work] Emerging markets have been a classic
over the past few years.
Q. What are the signs of a bad fund manager?
A. Someone without discipline, and without a thorough investment process.
Anybody who has not read Galbraith's The Great Crash.
*The Unit Trust Analysis Guide, Pounds 162 a year. Telephone 071-404 4233
In the chart, the higher the consistency ratio, the better the fund's
performance as measured by its consistency relative to its competitors.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: Jobs data keep interest rates on the boil - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wall Street market ended a difficult, holiday-shortened week well aware
that if the weakness of the dollar was not enough to prompt the Federal
Reserve into raising interest rates, the surprisingly strong June employment
report released yesterday might just do the trick.
The Labor Department's announcement that non-farm payrolls had risen by
379,000 last month, and that the national unemployment rate had remained
steady at 6.0 per cent, stunned economists and sparked an immediate retreat
in bond prices. Forecasters had been looking for a gain in payrolls of
around 280,000, and for a rise in the unemployment rate to 6.2 per cent.
The data, which showed how Wall Street continues to under-estimate the
strength of the economy, sent dealers in the Treasury market rushing to
off-load bonds in the expectation that the Fed would be sufficiently
concerned by the pace of growth in jobs to sanction another tightening in
monetary policy.
The selling of bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government
bond close to 7.7 per cent, its highest level since the bear market in
Treasuries began earlier this year.
While the bond market expressed its unhappiness with the jobs figures, the
reaction of the stock market was puzzling. After posting an immediate
15-point decline on the news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied
quickly, and by late morning was up almost 20 points. Other, secondary,
indices also recovered from early weakness, although they failed to match
the Dow's performance.
At first, analysts struggled to explain the stock market's insouciance, but
it soon appeared that equity investors had latched on to a qualification in
the June jobs data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In response
to questioning from a congressman, a BLS official said about 100,000 of the
increase in non-farm payrolls could be attributed to the June reporting
period being spread over five weeks instead of the usual four.
Investors reassured themselves that if those 100,000 extra jobs were removed
from the numbers, the increase in non-farm payrolls last month would have
been bang in line with forecasts. This, however, was clutching at straws.
Even taking into account the extra reporting week in June, the breakdown of
the employment data still pointed to a rapidly-expanding labour market.
The BLS also revised upwards its estimate of growth in May non-farm
payrolls, from 191,000 to 252,000. From almost every angle, 'the numbers
were extremely, extremely strong for the economy', said an analyst at Daiwa
Securities in New York. Strong enough, at least, to convince many analysts
that the Fed would raise interest rates next week to slow down an economy
that may now have grown by as much as 4.5 per cent or 5 per cent in the
second quarter. So, why did the stock market - which normally turns tail at
the first hint of higher interest rates - rise after the jobs data were
released?
Well, any evidence of economic growth is, traditionally, good news for
stocks because it means higher earnings for public companies, especially
those with profits tied closely to the economic cycle. This explains why the
shares of companies like Caterpillar, International Paper, and General
Motors were all up handily yesterday.
Cyclicals, in fact, were in demand all week, outpacing every other sector in
the market. Investors' renewed interest in cyclicals was the result of a
shift in sentiment about second-quarter earnings. Last month, the perception
in the market was that the expected slowdown in the economy during the
quarter would produce disappointing corporate earnings for the period.
Yet, recent evidence that the economy was stronger between April and June
than widely-realised persuaded many investors that second-quarter earnings
might not be so bad after all. So, but still playing it safe, they moved
back into cyclicals, providing the Dow with a lift this week that other
indices, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the American Stock Exchange
composite and the Nasdaq composite, were unable to enjoy.
Next week, however, investors may come to regret their enthusiasm for
cyclicals. The June inflation figures will be released on Tuesday and
Wednesday - and it is possible that the only reason the Fed refrained from
raising rates this week was that policy-makers did not want to make a move
until they saw the June producer and consumer prices data.
If there is any hint of a resurgence in inflation, it is likely the central
bank - with the weak dollar and the strong jobs market fresh in its mind -
will again push the 'higher interest rates' button.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: So many charges and so little time - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disclosure of life insurance commissions next January will give fresh
impetus to the investment revolution. Most people reckon that the guys in
the tumbrils are the traditional life insurance companies. But that is where
the consensus stops.
Talk to a unit trust salesman, and he argues that all insurance companies
will lose large chunks of their investment-related business. Talk to an
insurance man, and the losers will be the other insurance companies,
particularly the smaller mutuals.
Talk to a mutual, and you get a spiel about their fine traditions. But every
marketing department is working overtime to bring out new product
blueprints.
The challenge for the life companies is to present unacceptably high costs
in a palatable way. Initial costs on a typical life policy are around Pounds
600, while running costs nibble away at the investment proceeds thereafter.
And most companies reward customers who stay the full term at the expense of
early leavers.
A recent report from the Office of Fair Trading (Weekend FT, June 18) showed
even the best companies do little more than give you your money back if you
drop out after five years; the worst knock off up to 50 per cent. Many give
you nothing if you leave after year one.
Spreading costs and investment returns more evenly - both over the duration
of individual policies and between different policyholders - would look
fairer. But dividing the cake differently cannot increase its size. Thus,
those appetising payments to policyholders who hang on to maturity look set
to fall.
So do total life insurance sales. And since the big banks are grabbing a
larger market share, sales of several of the 101 different life insurance
companies are likely to drop sharply. The question is - which ones? And the
answer is of more than academic interest to customers.
Say, for example, that you have a policy with one of the smaller mutual life
companies which are finding new business increasingly elusive. In a sensible
world, the life fund would be closed to new business and the money paid out,
gradually, to policyholders.
In practice, unless the directors all fall on their swords, the company is
likely to stagger on for several years with its overheads eating steadily
into the profits available for policyholders.
Yet, even if you suspect your company might be among the walking wounded,
there is little you can do. Cashing in your policy prematurely to avoid a
possible future reduction in pay-out merely ensures that you incur the
certain penalties of early surrender.
Potential customers are in an altogether happier situation. If your choice
of investments is getting wider by the day, it seems foolish to make major
commitments now. Bide your time: there is little immediate cause to worry
that stock markets will race away from you.
There are two sides to every revolution. Bank shares tumbled last week as
analysts concluded that a lending rate war would hurt the lenders. Life
insurance shares had fallen already. But the upheavals in the market may
actually benefit customers. Aux armes, citoyens]
Should you try to pick your own unit trusts? The problem, as so often, is
that you do not have access to the same information as the professional. One
interesting point about Fund Research's approach to analysing funds (see
page III) is that, although it is based on a quantitative initial screen,
more than half the total score comes from qualitative appraisal.
True, the analysts collect large numbers of statistics: the basic portfolio
spread, number of stocks, portfolio turnover, stock concentration,
volatility, standard deviation. And most of these are available in the
firm's Unit Trust Analysis Guide.
But the analysts themselves are more interested in the explanations for the
numbers than the numbers themselves. They are like examiners who prefer
essays to multiple choice tests: what matters is not the answer, but how you
got there.
Armed with the guide, you should have a fair idea of which trusts to avoid.
A couple of hours comparing trusts in the same sector will give you some
useful yardsticks. If you then send off for the past few years' reports from
interesting trusts, you will understand far more than most unitholders. But
what you cannot do is quiz the managers.
One reason many private investors remain uninformed is that quality
information is costly. The guide has an annual sub of Pounds 162 while John
Cuthbert, another analyst whose research has been reported in the Weekend
FT, is charging Pounds 175 for his study of Japan trusts (tel: 0742-339
618). Yet, neither is expensive if it helps you make better investments.
We call them home income plans. The Americans call them reverse mortgages.
Both schemes allow elderly home-owners to mortgage their homes to supplement
their income.
Now, though, Barron's reports from California that some retirees have found
their home equity wiped out in five years; others are paying effective
annual interest rates of 40 per cent. Different name, same story?

FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: Bank shares - 'don't panic' - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National and Midland Bank have fired some warning shots at their
competitors in retail banking over the last couple of weeks, and shares in
UK banks have been looking slightly wounded.
Despite the advancing gunfire, however, the message for investors seems to
be 'don't panic'. It is hard to find an analyst who does not think the
market has been 'oversensitive'.
Bank shares first fell sharply at the end of last month after Abbey, the
former building society turned bank, said that it was reducing the annual
percentage rate (APR) on overdrafts from 18.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent.
Another front was opened by Midland last Tuesday, when it launched a
campaign aimed explicitly at overcoming the inertia in the personal
financial market and attracting customers from other banks.
And on Wednesday, the government announced that building societies would be
given new powers to enable them to compete more effectively.
Fears that these are the first signs that banks will use - or will have to
use - the capital they have started to accumulate to compete for business on
price have caused the bank sector to underperform the FT All-share price
index by more than 2 per cent since late June.
Shares in National Westminster Bank fell from 456p on 29 June to 435p on
Thursday. Over the same time, TSB shares fell 12p to 198p, Barclays shares
fell 6p to 529p, and Lloyds Bank shares lost 1p to 538p.
Even the aggressors have not remained unscathed: HSBC Holdings, which owns
Midland, fell from 702p to 692p while Abbey dropped from 406p to 393p.
But fears of an all-out price war seem exaggerated, as the moves by Abbey
and Midland may in practice amount to no more than marketing skirmishes.
Abbey has made little secret that the cut in overdraft rate is directed
towards increasing its 1.4m of the estimated 33m personal current accounts,
and some analysts doubt that the 10 per cent overdraft will remain a lasting
feature of retail banking once some advance has been made.
The Midland initiative of a pledge of Pounds 10 for every error it makes in
the course of setting up a new account is perhaps even an encouraging sign
for the banks in terms of the direction competition may take. As Peter
Toeman, banking analyst at Hoare Govett, put it: 'Competition on service
quality is much more lenient than competition on price'.
He points out that the barriers to moving current accounts remain quite
high, and that the number of those who change accounts in any one year could
double to 1m and still represent only 3 per cent of the customer base.
Competition on price is unlikely to be structural and more likely to take
the form of temporary, special offers - perhaps on personal loan rates or
credit cards.
Even if banks did feel obliged to cut margins on core services to personal
customers, they are aware of ways of cushioning the blow.
During 1989, for example, when Abbey National and Nationwide building
society forced the sector towards giving interest on current accounts, the
banks responded by introducing a new product into which existing customers
could transfer.
This not only spread the cost over time but meant they also obtained more
information about their customers.
Despite Midland, the continuing reluctance of personal customers to change
banks makes competition weak, leading analysts to believe that banks will be
able to avoid substantial cuts in their wide margins on most retail
business.
Instead, they believe that retail margins can afford to fall slightly
without damaging the banks' business, because they will be reflecting
realistically the lower costs of lending in a less risky environment.
As Hugh Pye, banking analyst at BZW, put it: 'Margins are incredibly fat,
and likely to remain so.' Good news for those who invest in banks - less
good news for them in their capacity as customers.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: Dollar takes Neapolitan limelight - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
See Naples and dive may be the fate of the dollar after this weekend's Group
of Seven summit.
Little if any concrete support for the US currency is expected from the
heads of state at their Neapolitan meeting. Consequently the dollar could
weaken further, unsettling bond and equity markets around the world.
But any adverse reaction might be short-lived, judging by the dollar's
behaviour this week. It coped with US and German authorities leaving their
monetary policies unchanged despite some market players hoping for interest
rate help for the currency.
The relative stability of the dollar gave some firmness to European stock
and bond markets. In London, the FT-SE 100 index mustered a net gain of 26
points on the week with two strong up days more than compensating for three
mildly weak ones. Yet again share trading volume was light as investors
waited for clear evidence that the markets had bottomed.
The index stubbornly refuses to climb back above 3,000 while the dollar
takes the limelight. But the determination of the markets to be driven by
the dollar rather than domestic factors may be waning after a trying
fortnight. Investors are coming to accept that the dollar's weakness, deeply
rooted in US economic trends, will defy quick fixes by governments or heavy
intervention by central banks.
If authorities tried to ambush foreign exchange markets next week with a
post-summit surprise, battle would be joined. But once the skirmish was
over, investors would try to get back to domestic considerations.
'Markets have slowly come to realise that the world doesn't end if the
dollar goes below Y100,' says Tim Brown, UBS's chief UK market strategist.
'The dollar may go a little lower but it will have no marked effect on
markets.'
There was little of domestic consequence for the markets to chew on this
week. Economic growth is on track with industrial output rising 4.6 per cent
in the three months to May from a year earlier. Inflation remains subdued.
M0 might have risen by 6.8 per cent in June from a year earlier, but this
rapid expansion of cash in the economy was explained away by factors ranging
from changing bank technology to a thriving black economy.
With the flow of corporate news slowing for the summer, the equity market is
already looking for inspiration to September's interim results season. A
year ago, the interim results were worse than expected because the economy
was failing to gather momentum. This time, there is greater confidence that
the interim results will build on the strong earnings and dividend trends
shown in this spring's full-year figures.
Investors have tended to overlook one question in their general enthusiasm
for generous dividend increases this year - which companies offer the best
prospects for dividend growth?
BZW notes that interest rate changes have had a marked effect on the way the
market prices dividend growth. When interest rates were high, as they were
before the UK left the ERM, a large number of stocks offered high yields and
the yield range was wide. As interest rates fell, the range of yields
compressed and high yielding stocks performed strongly.
But with interest rising again since February, high yielding stocks have
performed badly. Once again, the market is beginning to differentiate
between the stocks depending on the prospects for the dividend growth.
Within the largest 200 stocks, there is still nearly 10 per cent of them
which are likely to show zero or declining dividend growth over the next two
years. 'Strong dividend growth is a must for income stocks to combat this
general de-rating,' BZW says.
As the accompanying BZW chart shows, there is a wide range of companies
offering yields of 4 per cent to 6 per cent coupled with an acceptably brisk
rate of dividend growth. It recommends a number of such companies including
Royal Insurance, Wellcome, Abbey National, Glaxo and Lloyds Bank.
Conversely, it identifies a number of high yield stocks offering little hope
for higher payouts. These include Blue Circle Industries, MEPC, BICC, GKN
and Redland.
Modest dividend growth was certainly one element in this week's results from
GEC which disappointed the market. The full-year payout rose 5 per cent to
10.82p. Pre-tax profits were ahead only Pounds 3m to Pounds 866m while
operating profits in its three main divisions - power systems, electronics
and telecommunications - actually fell. Once again, it was GEC's famous cash
mountain that flattered the bottom line with an increased contribution from
interest receivable.
The disappointing results from the divisions were attributable to a wide
range of influences and had been flagged at the interim stage. Nonetheless,
the profit and dividend figures, coupled with a cautious trading statement,
knocked the shares. They now stand at their lowest level since December,
1992.
GEC also signalled the next small step in finding successors to Lord
Weinstock, its managing director who turns 70 shortly. He said he hopes to
continue in office for another couple of years. Meanwhile, the managing
directors of the three main divisions are joining the group board to bring a
more collegiate style.
The other big result of the week was year-end figures from Dixons the
electrical goods retailer. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items were
down slightly at Pounds 73.3m. After previously disclosed costs of closing
down some Comet shops in the UK and selling its US operations, it ran up a
loss of Pounds 238.5m. However, this masks the progress Dixons has made on
its Comet and Dixons chains. The dividend for last year was raised to 6.6p.

Investing some money overseas is not just a form of risk-spreading - it is
also a way of getting a stake in economies that appear to have strong
prospects for growth, and it allows investors to participate in industries
which do not exist at home.
The summer issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, to be
published with next Friday's paper and repeated with Saturday's, considers
the best ways of investing overseas - and where. The survey section of the
Review takes a critical look at Personal Pensions, in the light of recent
bad publicity.

FT  09 JUL 94 / The Long View: Some bitter home truths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An engine of the British economy has lost power. The housing market, which
gave such a spectacular push to the economic boom of the late 1980s, has
failed to gather momentum during the past year's economic recovery. The
Nationwide and Halifax building societies, which publish the two leading
house price indices, are at odds over whether house prices rose or fell
slightly in June, but they are united in calculating that the rise over the
past 12 months has been only 1 per cent.
Forecasts are being trimmed. Halifax has cut its 5 per cent estimate of 1994
house price inflation to 2 or 3 per cent and John Wriglesworth, of the City
investment bank UBS, has halved his 7 per cent forecast. My own
cautiously-wide forecast of 0 to 5 per cent, which I made here in October,
is still on track but I am surprised at the weakness of prices in the past
few months.
Opinions in the London area have been influenced by the mini-boom which has
been proceeding in some areas in reflection of soaring incomes in the City.
Up-market property in the more desirable areas of London and the south-east
has been shifting quite fast, and at rising prices. But, plainly, that is
not true of the country as a whole.
Generally, personal incomes have been far from buoyant and the tax increases
effective in April have, obviously, made people more reluctant to take on
big new commitments. That was evident, too, in the relative weakness of
consumer credit in May.
Moreover, mortgage interest rates have gone up sharply since February - at
any rate, if you look at the fixed-rate loans which have become popular.
Mortgages fixed for five years now cost about 9 rather than 7 per cent
(measured by the annual percentage rate); and although variable rate loans
are available at about 8 per cent, no less a figure than Bank of England
governor Eddie George has given notice that such rates linked to short-term
money market rates may go up quite soon.
Long-term measures of the fundamental value in housing are now giving
reasonably positive messages. The ratio of average price to average income
is under 3.5, and close to a 'normal' level. The TSB first-time buyer
'affordability' index is significantly more favourable than it has been
since the early 1980s. But the average first-time buyer must take on a 90
per cent mortgage of Pounds 41,000. And a great many home-owners have been
through a terrible experience since 1989.
A recent survey, financed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that a
third of householders in Luton knew someone whose home had been repossessed.
The statistics of housing market agony, such as those of repossessions and
negative equity, are moderating but the failure of the forecasts of rising
prices to come true will come as a bitter disappointment to those still
trapped in over-mortgaged homes.
Although negative equity has been declining since its estimated peak of
Pounds 12bn in the first quarter of 1993, it was still Pounds 7.6bn at the
beginning of this year, according to the Bank of England. Some 70 per cent
of that was concentrated in London and the south-east.
Mortgage lenders expressed disappointment this week with the Pounds 1.5bn
level of net new lending in May, less than in April and little higher than
May last year. But outstanding mortgage debt is now Pounds 365bn, about 50
per cent higher than at the peak of the boom in mid-1989. Mortgages account
for most of the UK's comparatively high level of personal sector
indebtedness (debt is 80 per cent of income, twice as high as in Germany).
There is a limit to the burden that ordinary people will take on. They now
know that inflation will not bail them out: those who borrowed themselves
into a financial trap in 1988 or 1989 are mostly still stuck there. Real
interest rates are high, and the tax relief on interest payments is now
fairly trivial: the cost to the government of Miras peaked at around Pounds
8bn in 1990-91 and is expected to be down to just Pounds 2.5bn next fiscal
year.
The exposure to this debt burden is highly skewed: it is borne mostly by
young people, especially in the south of the country. Only 50 per cent of
northern home-owners have a mortgage, compared with 60 per cent in the
south.
In the past, southerners have been ready to borrow more - both absolutely
and as a proportion of the house price - than their northern counterparts.
This was the price of taking part in the booming southern economy; and,
anyway, the more you borrowed, the more profit you would make - wouldn't
you?
Some of the forecasts of house price recovery have been based on the
supposition that the southern differentials would be, at least partly,
restored. But suppose, instead, that southerners act like cautious
northerners in future?
Moreover, the Rowntree Foundation report (called The Challenges for Housing
Policy) argues convincingly that home ownership has been a disaster for too
many young people and families, and that first-time buyers continue to be
lured into the market with loan-to-value ratios still as high as at any time
since 1982. More housing for rent, and the deferment of house purchase until
later in life, as in Germany, might reduce the risks to individuals of
future housing market booms and busts.
Booms and busts are, of course, what chancellor Kenneth Clarke is aiming to
avoid. But the loss of momentum in the housing recovery is one of the early
effects of the rise in long-term interest rates, and it poses a threat to
the pace of the economic upswing in general. Clarke might also wonder how
the Tories will be able to win the next general election without a feel-good
contribution from some degree of house price buoyancy within a year or two.
One of the more curious statistics in the Rowntree survey is that most
homeowners, when questioned in 1993, thought their houses were worth more
than in 1989. But buyers, it seems, have a very different view. That is why
the price recovery is scarcely happening.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Let's get down to business, comrade: As Russia's old system
collapses, a dynamic market economy is taking its place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL YERGIN and THANE GUSTAFSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivan is one of the new Russian businessmen who seem to have come from
nowhere. Six years ago, he was a special education teacher. Now he is owner
or director of 20 companies, which range from insurance to manufacturing of
clothes, furniture and china to trading and importing.
It was the importing that interested the mafia.
Ivan's offices are at the top of a worn-out office building. The water often
goes off and hallways are dingy. But Ivan's own suite is a world of stylish,
modern furniture.
On the day the mafia called, six of the gangsters stayed downstairs, while
five took the elevator up to his office. They knew that Ivan had received a
shipment of cigarettes worth Dollars 200,000 from the west. It was on
consignment, meaning that he had not yet paid for it. They wanted those
cigarettes.
To make sure Ivan knew they were serious, two of them ostentatiously put
guns on the table.
'They're not mine,' said Ivan. 'I can't give them away.'
The gangsters did not care. They wanted the goods.
Ivan asked for time, excused himself and went into another office. He was
shaking. He hurriedly called a friend who was an officer in the FSK, the
successor to the KGB.
An FSK squad arrived quickly: on the way up, they arrested the six men
downstairs. They then met Ivan, who had not yet gone back to his own office,
and put a recording device on him.
Ivan returned to the room where the gangsters waited for his answer. They
said their patience was not endless; they threatened him and his family.
They described the different ways they had killed people. Ivan asked for
more time.
The mafia boss stood up to leave. He made it clear that he expected the
matter to be resolved very soon. Some of his men remained, to keep up the
pressure. Then, on a pre-arranged signal, Ivan said: 'There's no need for
you to be here.'
At that moment, the FSK men broke in with their guns drawn. They scooped up
the guns on the table and ordered the gangsters up against the wall, frisked
them, removing other guns, and then took them away in handcuffs.
Recalling the scene a few weeks later, Ivan was still shaken: 'It looked
like an American film.'
That is one face of emerging Russian capitalism - a combination of the wild
west, America's 19th century robber barons, and Chicago in the 1930s. But it
is only one face of the new market economy that is developing in Russia much
faster than is generally recognised.
In our book Russia 2010, we try to offer a preliminary sketch of how
Russian-style capitalism might look in the year 2010.
It might bear more resemblance to Italian or Latin American capitalism
(before privatisation) than the US or Japanese versions. But whatever its
final shape, elements of Russian capitalism are already in place. Early in
the next century, people may even be talking about 'a Russian economic
miracle'.
Russians are as surprised as anyone. 'The market is developing much more
rapidly than I would have thought possible even a year ago,' said Evgenii
Yasin, one of the chief economic advisers to President Boris Yeltsin.
'Unlike socialism,' Yasin added wryly, 'you don't have to 'build'
capitalism. It builds itself.'
Russia is certainly going through wrenching changes: industrial output
continues to plummet; many workers are not receiving their salaries; and
many enterprises are not being paid.
Savings have been wiped out by inflation and well-trained professionals are
today earning only the equivalent of Pounds 60 or Pounds 70 a month. A
distinguished musicologist, for instance, now sells mineral water on the
streets of Moscow. Meanwhile, people who would have been regarded as 'social
parasites' in Soviet days drive around in Mercedes, with personal
bodyguards. Crime is pervasive: by one estimate, a third of all bank
employees are security guards.
Yet what one sees does not match the dismal numbers. Colour is appearing on
buildings and in shop windows, enlivening the drabness of even a year or two
ago. The billboards extolling the achievements of Soviet communism have been
replaced by signs advertising American candybars, Korean electronic goods,
and Russian banks.
The residential construction boom on the outskirts of Moscow and other
cities is so strong that it has caused a shortage of bricks. And Moscow even
has its own version of Wall Street - a long row of interconnected office
buildings two miles from the Kremlin.
'The country is supposed to be in a deep economic crisis, but the traffic
jams in Moscow get bigger and bigger,' a foreign diplomat commented
sardonically.
Which is the 'real' Russia - that of the great depression or the emerging
market?
The answer is both. Even while the old system continues to collapse, with
perhaps the worst yet to come, a dynamic market economy is beginning to take
its place. Will it ever be fully functioning? Boris Fedorov, the former
Russian finance minister, answered that question only half facetiously: 'Why
not? We already have a malfunctioning market economy.'
No one has any idea of how big this market economy is. The statistics of the
Great Russian Depression capture only the official, measurable economy.
Industrial production should be declining, as the lop-sided
military-industrial economy runs down. But there are no accessible numbers
on the private economy.
In the Soviet era, managers had every incentive to exaggerate their economic
performance, to meet their targets. Today, the incentive is just the
opposite - to minimise figures to avoid the taxman (whether from the
government or the mafia) and to evade regulations.
Visit Astrakhan, the caviar capital of the world, and ask how much caviar is
being produced these days: 'Officially, 550 tons a year,' said a local
caviar expert. And unofficially? 'Maybe twice that, maybe five times - who
knows?'
Beyond the visible and the anecdotal, there is some circumstantial evidence
of the rapid growth of the private economy. Real incomes are growing by 10
per cent a year, and reported consumption levels have almost recovered to
1990 levels.
At this point, Russian-style capitalism is capitalism at its rawest. It is,
as some Russians say, the era of 'primitive accumulation of capital'. After
all, you cannot have capitalism without capitalists.
The country is caught in a great battle to gain control of the resources,
property, and political power that are being set free by the collapse of the
old order.
'Crime cannot be controlled,' said one deputy in the Duma, the new
parliament, 'until the struggle for property is finished.'
The distance Russia has to go to develop a modern market economy is
highlighted when one considers the common features that underlie the many
different 'brands' of capitalism around the world.
One is a competitive price system; a second is a system of agreed-upon
'rules of the game'. The latter extend from general values, such as that the
market should not be a corrupter, to specific laws and regulation. They also
include norms - for instance, a dispute over a contract should not be
settled by murder but by a court. And a market system is embedded in a
legal, cultural, and institutional context that supports its workings.
By these criteria, Russia has a long way to go on the road to a mature
market system.
This is what Russians mean when they say that what they have is 'a bazaar,
not an economy'. A body of rules and laws is yet to be written. Even lawyers
are in short supply and good independent judges are even more scarce. The
concept of property, fundamental to a market system, is far from worked out.
Moreover, things could go badly wrong over the next few years. Conflict
between Russia and its newly-independent neighbours is an obvious risk; a
severe unemployment crisis - promoted by the eventual collapse of the old
military industrial enterprises - could provide fertile ground for
demagogues and civil unrest. And if unchecked, crime could prevent
development of the market, destroy the morale and ambition of entrepreneurs,
and undermine the legitimacy of the state.
Russians themselves, we have found, are fascinated, if also amused, by the
very idea of writing a book called Russia 2010. They hardly have any
framework for thinking about the future.
Uncertainty and insecurity characterise their lives. Everything they took
for granted has disappeared - economic security, the dictatorship of the
Communist Party and the control of the KGB, the predictability of life and
the delivery of food by the enterprise that employs them, the stupefying
cant of Marxism, safety in the streets, a yearly holiday in the Crimea and
the Soviet Union as a superpower.
Thus, it is hard to find anyone who will describe themselves as optimistic.
A distinguished academician, who is also deeply engaged in the private
sector, is asked what he expects for the future. He replied: 'I think of the
last line in a letter my grandfather wrote from Stalin's gulag: 'Hope for
the best, and expect the worst'.'
Yet it is remarkable how much has been accomplished in the brief time since
communism collapsed. A driving force of change has been the voucher
privatisation programme, celebrated last year in the hit song 'Wow Wow
Voucher'. Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said the objective of
this hectic programme was to make the destruction of socialism
'irreversible'.
However imperfect, it may well have worked. Most small shops and enterprises
are now in private hands and an estimated 40 per cent of the workforce now
works in the private economy.
Over the next two years, the newly-elected Duma has the challenging job of
privatising land, and writing the laws and creating the financial structures
for a market system.
A new phase of the market system begins this month as 'voucher
privatisation' gives way to a system under which state property will be sold
for cash. In short, despite all the dangers ahead, Russian capitalism is
already a reality.
But to understand the direction of Russian capitalism, one must look beyond
the 'Red Barons' - the Soviet industrial managers turned businessmen - and
seek out younger people, such as Ivan, who are part of a post-communist
generation that will build the market society.
Ivan never knew his father; his mother was a cleaner. He did poorly at
school. When Gorbachev started to encourage private business, he decided to
make weight-lifting equipment.
His workshop was so low he could not stand fully upright; at night, he
worked as a taxi driver to support himself. He borrowed metalworking
equipment and small tools from factory workers. He began with seven
employees - by the end of the first year, he had 50.
He stayed in the weight-lifting equipment business for three years. 'It's
difficult to be a boss,' he said. 'I believed in communism. I was educated
in it. The feeling of comradeship was very important. But, as a boss, you've
lost your chains. You have a feeling of responsibility for those who come to
work for you.'
Now the groups Ivan either heads or is involved with employ 3,000 people.
'The fashion is over for weight-lifting,' he said. 'The fashion today is to
work with finance and money. I now work day and night. I start at seven in
the morning and go to 11 at night.'
He owns his own apartment and five cars, but he keeps them locked in garages
to prevent theft.
To explain how business works in Russia today, Ivan told this story: 'Two
people meet. The First one says: 'You want to buy a cartload of sugar?' The
second one replies: 'Yes, fine.' They agree on price.
'Then the first one goes to see if he can buy a cartload of sugar, and the
second goes to see if he can find some money.
'Business here is a gamble. You can make money one day, and it can all go
wrong the next. You've got to risk. The biggest lesson of business for me is
that you have to defend and attack.'
He had a specific meaning in mind. He opened his coat, to reveal a glimpse
of something that looked like a gun.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK may relax curbs on beef sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is discussing easing the controls on beef cattle
sales that were introduced four years ago in response to the epidemic of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy - mad cow disease.
The move came as Germany's 16 federal states voted in favour of an
immediate, unilateral six-month ban on selective imports of British beef
yesterday.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, would need Brussels' approval
for any lifting of export restrictions on live cattle. However, it is a
particularly sensitive time to start asking for an easing of controls as the
German and French governments are pressing for a clampdown on British beef
shipments.
The Bundesrat, the German upper house of parliament, demanded that the beef
ban be put into effect 'without delay' by Mr Horst Seehofer, health
minister, although European Commission rules would normally delay such a
move between three and 12 months.
The import ban would affect all beef from cattle more than three years old,
or from herds that have not been certified free of BSE for at least four
years.
It is not clear how quickly Mr Seehofer will act on the measure. A health
ministry official said he would wait for a response from Brussels. The
Commission's veterinary committee will discuss its response to calls for an
European Union-wide ban on Monday.
If the Commission fails to take new measures, Mr Seehofer has clearly
reserved the right to act unilaterally, arguing that the protection of
public health must take precedence over EU notification guidelines.
Agriculture ministry officials point out that the number of cases of BSE
reported in the UK in the first six months of the year has dropped by 23 per
cent compared with the same period last year. The number of cattle to have
contracted the disease this year is 17,637 out of a total herd of 4.5m.

FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tales of insider trading deals ahead of MAI's bid for Anglia Television read
like the plot of a bad novel. But the Takeover Panel has again stressed the
seriousness of the issue in its latest annual report. The problem was always
likely to grow because of the ever-increasing complexity of bids -
especially when so many are made across borders. Nowadays it is not unusual
for several hundred people to be involved in preparing deals, inevitably
raising the likelihood of leaks.
The Takeover Panel exhorts companies to limit the number of people involved
in bids to the absolute minimum. But it clearly cannot prescribe how many
advisers should know about a specific deal. The onus must always be on
bidding companies to ensure everyone keeps mum. After all, it is in their
best interests so to do. Enterprise was badly disadvantaged in its bid for
Lasmo by being forced into a premature statement when share prices started
to twitch.
Whether the Panel should force bidding companies into making their
intentions public in this way is contentious. It could be argued that this
protects the speculators most of all. It may also help prevent Aunt Agatha
from trading in a false market. But that argument would carry more weight if
statements were made out of market hours when private investors stand the
same chance of trading the next day as professionals. The additional danger
is that companies fearing takeovers could play dirty and try to force
premature disclosures from bidders. The Takeover Panel should be equally
aware of that danger, too.

FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems to be no end to Metallgesellschaft's problems. Yesterday brought
confirmation of a further DM1bn provision in connection with Castle Energy
Corporation, which will basically absorb the surplus from the sale of its
Buderus engineering subsidiary. The company cannot afford many more nasty
surprises of this nature. In selling Buderus, Metallgesellschaft really was
disposing of the family silver. It will be increasingly hard to find new
assets to sell, but Metallgesellschaft still has a struggle to reduce its
debt.
Conservation of cash is clearly a primary objective. The new management has
cut this year's investment programme in half and imposed a brutal squeeze on
working capital. Even so, its own projections still suggest gross debt close
to DM5bn by the end of the current year. That is a sizeable sum given the
low margins Metallgesellschaft can expect from its trading business at the
best of times.
Creditors might be reasonably happy with management's efforts at debt
service. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner have at least been repaid their
emergency loan. But equity investors betting on longer-term recovery must
wonder how the company is ever to generate enough earnings for expansion and
eventual dividend growth. Since Metallgesellschaft still requires such
radical surgery, it is more baffling than ever that its supervisory board
originally failed to notice how badly things were going wrong.

FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty remains over US economic policy. Yesterday's employment data and
President Clinton's remarks on the importance of not undermining the
economic recovery pointed in opposite directions. The faster-than-expected
employment growth gives the Federal Reserve every excuse to raise short-term
interest rates. But Clinton's comments suggest the White House, at least,
will not be in favour.
While bond prices plummeted in response to the employment data, the dollar
initially held up well. Equities on both sides of the Atlantic advanced. But
after Clinton's remarks, the dollar slid and US share prices retreated.
In the circumstances, the chance that this weekend's G7 summit will mount
any co-ordinated action to prop up the dollar seems minuscule. The most that
can be hoped for is unilateral action on interest rates in the next couple
of weeks by the Fed. But it is hard to see a Fed move on its own doing much
to boost the dollar since a rise in short-term interest rates to 6 per cent
is already being discounted.
If the Fed takes no action, the markets would be even more worried. It is
true, as Clinton said, that there is so far no evidence of inflation. Pay
inflation is still at 2.5 per cent. But the Fed's policy stance this year
has been to anticipate rather than react to inflation. A failure to raise
rates would risk sending the dollar even lower and bond yields higher. With
all that in prospect, it is hard to see equities opening on a positive note
on Monday.

FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons finds its man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive's job at Fisons has looked like a poisoned chalice in
recent years. The sudden departure of the previous incumbent in December did
nothing to dispel that impression. Mr Stuart Wallis, who is giving up the
blue-chip comfort of Bowater, must reason that Fisons' troubles are now
behind it. If good habits learned at Bowater can be transferred, Fisons
stands a better chance of avoiding the kind of management errors which have
dogged its recent progress.
The 3 per cent fall in Bowater's shares yesterday suggests that the
packaging group has lost a valuable asset. Yet the muted reaction of Fisons'
shares points to scepticism about Mr Wallis's ability to add value in
pharmaceuticals. Housekeeping measures such as cost-cutting and selling off
unwanted assets are already in hand. The bigger challenge is to decide
whether Fisons can survive as an independent drugs company and, if not, to
find an alternative solution. While some investors might have preferred an
industry insider, the task may be better approached from a dispassionate
point of view. Mr Bob Bauman, architect of Beecham's merger with SmithKline
Beckman, was also an outsider.
As yesterday's performance shows, though, adding pep to Fisons' shares will
not be easy. The company is already trading at a healthy price-earnings
premium to the stock market average even though the rest of the
pharmaceuticals sector stands at a discount. Lingering hopes that a predator
will step in could be the explanation. If a bid seems less likely as Mr
Wallis gets to grips with the business, the shares will be running to stand
still.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Revived CrossRail project may take 10 years to finish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday revived the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project, using a
complex procedure which means the east-west railway through London could
take at least 10 years to complete.
After the failure earlier this year of a private bill authorising the
scheme, the Department of Transport believed it was left with no choice but
to use the 1992 Transport and Works Act, a new and untried procedure.
This will involve Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, laying an
order before parliament following the request from the promoters of the
project - London Underground, British Rail and Railtrack.
Objections will then be heard at a public inquiry or inquiries along the
route, which is why Whitehall officials fear the project may not be
completed until 2004.
Mr Michael Cassidy, policy director of the Corporation of London, warned
that the government procedure for promoting the project was 'enormously
complex'.
'I don't think the Transport and Works Act was ever intended for such large
projects,' he said.
The corporation is continuing its studies of plans to raise up to Pounds
500m from a levy on business rates coupled with an international bond issue.
Mr MacGregor said: 'It remains government policy that the project should be
financed as a joint venture, with a substantial private sector
contribution.'
The government could have promoted a hybrid bill - so named because it
involves both public and private interests.
But the Department of Transport is already committed to one hybrid bill for
the high-speed rail link from London to the Channel tunnel and felt it was
unlikely to be awarded parliamentary time for a second.
The transport secretary announced his decision in an answer to a
parliamentary question from Mr David Lidington, Tory MP for Aylesbury, who
had been supported by more than 250 MPs calling for a private bill
authorising CrossRail to be sent back to a quasi-judicial committee which
rejected it. But Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker, blocked the motion.
Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, supported Mr Morris.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said it feared it would take at
least another 10 years before CrossRail is completed. 'We have got to find a
speedier mechanism for implementing major national infrastructure projects.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Fight to save Rosyth wins all-party support: Thatcher joins
offensive against defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, LISA WOOD and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, yesterday cautioned against
further cuts in Britain's armed forces as unions joined MPs of all parties
in pledging to fight moves to close the Rosyth naval base in Scotland.
As fears mounted that Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will sound the
base's death-knell next Thursday as part of a package of cuts, unions
representing its 1,800 civilian employees promised a 'national outcry'.
Meanwhile, Lord Younger, the Conservative former defence secretary, was
among a group of prominent figures who published an open letter to Mr John
Major, prime minister, in The Scotsman newspaper pleading for the base to be
kept open.
As Labour said it was still unconvinced of the need to close the base, the
breadth of dismay at the expected move was underlined by Mr Bill Walker,
Tory MP for Tayside North, who warned that the government's credibility was
'on the line'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in whose Dunfermline East
constituency Rosyth lies, called for an urgent meeting with Mr Rifkind and
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary.
Lady Thatcher told an audience of top naval officers that Britain's armed
forces were its greatest asset.
'May they continue to have the leadership, numbers and equipment so that
they can serve with equal distinction in future,' she said. With the
international scene 'increasingly uncertain', it was important to have not
only what was immediately required in defence terms but also the reserves
that could be called into action to meet the unexpected.
Officials from the six unions representing Rosyth's workforce will today
hold a 'council of war' to try to stave off the closure.
Their plan includes a lobby of parliament by workers from the UK's naval
bases and naval support establishments next Tuesday and publication on the
following day of an open letter to Mr Major reminding him of government
promises on both Rosyth and Devonport in Plymouth.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general workers union,
yesterday said Scottish Tory MPs 'should put constituents before career'.
The Rosyth base is already being scaled down following a previous review in
July 1991. It currently employs 1,800 civilian workers and about 4,000 naval
personnel on land and sea, many of whom are accompanied by their families.
The base overlaps but is distinct from the Rosyth naval dockyard whose
future was guaranteed by the government last June until 2005.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Solid gains despite bond
price decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Continued demand for cyclicals helped blue-chips post solid gains yesterday
in spite of a sharp decline in bond prices that was sparked by an
unexpectedly strong June employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.72 at 3,709.14,
near its high for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
also ended higher, up 1.17 at 449.55, while the American Stock Exchange
composite finished 0.80 firmer at 425.45 and the Nasdaq composite 0.94
firmer at 707.47. Trading volume on the NYSE was 235m shares.
The Labor department's announcement that non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000
last month, and that the national unemployment rate held steady at 6 per
cent, surprised the market. Analysts had forecast a rise in payrolls of only
280,000, and an increase in the unemployment rate to 6.2 per cent.
The immediate reaction from investors was to sell shares, primarily because
bonds had dropped sharply on the jobs data, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond up to 7.691 per cent, its highest level
this year. Bonds fell because the Treasury market feared that the strong
jobs figures would persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to
slow economic growth.
Share prices, however, quickly recovered from their early lows, with
investors encouraged by a comment from a Bureau of Labor Statistics official
that the bigger-than-expected increase in payrolls was partly due to the
fact that the reporting period in June lasted for five weeks, instead of the
usual four weeks. By mid-morning, the Dow was up 20 points.
The market could not hold on to its gains later in the session when still
depressed bond prices and a weaker dollar forced a temporary retreat, but
confidence about the outlook for second quarter earnings and continued
strong interest in cyclical stocks ensured that blue-chip shares ended the
day on a positive note. Among individual stocks, Alcoa rose Dollars 3 5/8 to
Dollars 78 7/8 on news of stronger earnings. Other cyclicals also fared
well, with Caterpillar adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 105 3/4 and Ford
rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 30 5/8 . Nike jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
62 1/8 after the shoe-maker reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings that
were below last year's level but still well above analysts' forecasts.
Investors were also cheered by the company's statement that it should be
able to maintain the level of its gross margins from this year through to
the end of 1995.
CBS fell another Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 303 7/8 as speculation continued
that Disney would conclude some sort of business agreement with the
broadcaster and its new merger partner, QVC. Investors had hoped that
Disney, or other big entertainment groups, might make a rival bid for CBS.
Canada
Toronto prices closed higher in a late-session rally in quiet trading. The
TSE-300 index rose 19.03 points, or 0.47 per cent, to close at 4,098.90.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 370 to 325. Volume was 45.82m shares,
down from Thursday's 58.48m and trading value fell to CDollars 567.5m from
CDollars 671. m. On the week, the index gained about 74 points.
The market was flat in dull trading for most of the day, before finding some
life in the final hour or so of trading.
Brazil
Growing optimism among investors over the election chances of presidential
candidate Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso helped Brazilian share prices make
ground.
The Bovespa of the 56 most-traded shares on the Sao Paulo bourse ended the
day up 3.76 per cent at 40,519 after an early morning bout of profit taking.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Afternoon weakness, but
bourses recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses had a nervous afternoon after a surprisingly strong report on
employment toppled Treasuries in the US, but bonds stabilised in Europe
later in the day, and equities seemed to follow suit, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS recovered from an 18-point drop on the US data to close with the
CAC-40 index up 0.03 at 1,920.78, up 2.6 per cent on the week, although
turnover stayed light at an estimated FFr1.7bn.
The financial sector did well again with Cie. Bancaire, the top performer
among CAC 40 constituents, rising FFr15 or 3.3 per cent to FFr495 and the
municipal lender, Credit Local, extending Thursday's gains on accelerated
lending growth with a further advance of FFr10.50, or 2.7 per cent to
FFr397.50.
Eurotunnel eased 40 centimes to FFr22.55. The company said yesterday that it
had been been granted a judicial review of its case challenging the legality
of duty-free trade offered by cross-Channel ferries, its main competitor.
The packaging group, Pechiney International, slipped again with a fall of
FFr2.90 to FFr146 after indications this week of flat first half profits.
MADRID ended about a percentage point above its worst, the market's swing
from an oversold position leaving the general index 1.91 higher at 293.56,
still 1.8 per cent down on the week.
Turnover recovered to Pta34.70bn from Thursday's Pta28.7bn. Repsol extended
its gains with a lift of Pta125, or 3.3 per cent to Pta3,880 while Endesa
changed direction with a recovery of Pta60 to Pta5,450.
FRANKFURT's Dax index closed the session 7.00 higher at 2,050.85, up 0.7 per
cent on the week in turnover of just DM4.7m. Three strong strands of
reasoning moved blue chips during the official session.
Carmakers were strong, with BMW rising DM9 to DM799, Daimler DM11.80 to
DM728.80 and Porsche DM35, or 4.5 per cent to DM818.
Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming in Frankfurt said that US car
registration figures hit the German media yesterday; Porsche showed a big
rise from a low base and its illiquid shares offered a naive response.
Meanwhile, BMW seemed to be financing the Rover acquisition with ease, and
Daimler said that its car sales and production figures were the best-ever in
any single half year, following deep recession in 1993.
Chemicals were weak, reflecting the fashion for selectivity in cyclicals; in
defensives the three big utilities, RWE, Veba and Viag, were all up by
around 2 per cent, suggesting that German investors were still
safety-conscious.
ZURICH continued on its downward path, the SMI index losing 30.2 to 2,560.3,
taking the week's decline to 1.2 per cent.
Roche certificates, which fell 3.2 per cent on Thursday after James Capel
downgraded the issue, came under renewed pressure on selling by London based
investors. The stock gave up SFr80 before finding local buying support at
SFr6,000. Ciba fell SFr13 to SFr777.
CS Holding, which had been under less downward pressure in recent days than
the rest of the sector, fell SFr10 to SFr566.
MILAN remained on hold, still waiting for budget details which are now
promised in a few days' time, and the Comit index gave up 4.40 to 686.92,
little changed on the week.
Pirelli, however, bucked the downward trend, rising L20 to L2,539 after the
managing director was reported as saying that the financial position was
good with consolidated debt below L2,000bn from L2,130bn at the end of last
year.
Ina, on its third trading day, was unchanged at the placing price of L2,400.
AMSTERDAM was mixed with a downward bias and the AEX index dipped 0.38 to
385.84 after a session enlivened only briefly by the US employment data. The
market was little changed on the week.
Fokker stood out, gaining 70 cents to Fl 15.70 as retail investors began
buying on news that the aircraft maker would detail its refinancing plans
soon. Professionals remained sceptical and said they would prefer to wait
for the details.
ISTANBUL suffered a fresh blow with the annulment of a draft law which gave
the cabinet powers in privatisation.
The composite index dropped 4.6 per cent in heavy selling, ending 986.14
lower at 20,423.51 and reducing the week's gains to 5.4 per cent.
State-sector shares dipped to their lower price margins but bargain-hunting
in private issues brought some relief in the second half of the session.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down amid
regional uncertainty
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Technical trading dominated the day's activity, with most investors absent
ahead of the G7 meeting in Naples. The Nikkei index declined on
arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average lost 93.51 to 20,526.51, marginally lower on the week. It
saw a high of 20,691.84 in the morning on buying by individual investors,
but institutional and foreign investors remained inactive and the index
touched a low of 20,440.09 in the last hour of trading.
Volume totalled 342m shares against 283m. Traders said the bulk of the
business was linked to the settlement of July index options contracts.
Investors also remained sidelined ahead of the US employment figures, which
are expected to give some indication of short-term US monetary policy.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.55 to 1,660.88 while the
Nikkei 300 lost 1.37 to 301.48. Losers outnumbered gainers by 640 to 318
with 206 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.21 to
1,347.54.
Terumo, the disposable medical equipment supply manufacturer, which saw its
share price rise earlier in the week on its development of a three
dimensional television, fell Y50 to Y1,120 on profit taking.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y6,000 to Y855,000 on reports that the
company's office was being searched by police in connection with the arrest
of an employee in an alleged bribery case.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 97.53 to 23,112.00 in volume of 30.3m shares.
Roundup
The course of US interest rates, yesterday's US jobs data and the start of
the G7 summit left several markets apprehensive.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index closed 57.90 down on the day, and another 2.3
per cent lower on the week. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 3.37bn to a
preliminary HKDollars 2.48bn. Luoyang Glass H shares made their debut at
HKDollars 3.31 and tumbled to HKDollars 2.92 at the close, against their
public offer price of HKDollars 3.65.
BANGKOK fell after the Thai opposition filed no-confidence motions against
four government ministers and the deputy prime minister, Amnuay Viravan
resigned his posts in the coalition government and his own party. The SET
index fell 15.52 to 1,287.34, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in moderate
turnover of Bt5.07bn.
MANILA took profits and the composite index dropped 45.38 to 2,583.85, 4.1
per cent lower on the week with the telephone stock, PLDT down 3.8 per cent
to its year's low of 1,480 pesos.
WELLINGTON hit a new 1994 low with the NZSE-40 index down 10.33 at 1,955.93,
off 1.4 per cent with brokers fairly phlegmatic about the marking down
process.
TAIPEI put on 1.6 per cent in heavy trade, led by financials, electronics
and some fund shares. The weighted index rose 96.45 to 6,191.79, or 4.4 per
cent higher on the week.
SYDNEY rallied in late trade to finish marginally stronger, helped by a
round of afternoon bargain-hunting. The All Ordinaries index finished 2.7
higher at 1,964.9, off its intraday low of 1,957.0, and unchanged on the
week.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded from early doldrums to close higher in retail-led
buying, sparked by expectations of a technical rebound following
one-and-a-half weeks of sluggish trade and growing expectations of
elections.
The composite index ended 6.41 higher at 987.78, but still 1.6 per cent
lower over the week.
SINGAPORE overcame recent weakness as bargain hunting developed at the lower
levels and the Straits Times Industrials index ended 16.93 higher at
2,162.94, still 2.2 per cent lower on the week.
SEOUL saw a technical rebound following recent retreats and the composite
stock index added 3.25 to 948.96 for a 1.4 per cent rise on the week.
Financials lost momentum after the government decided to delay a plan to
foster financial conglomerates.
JAKARTA was mixed in moderate trading although activity picked up on news
that the government planned to raise its 49 per cent limit on foreign share
ownership. The official index ended 1.90 lower to close at 452.20, for a 1.3
per cent rise on the week.

FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Door is ajar but floor space is a
predicament - Taiwan's investment liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Taiwan announced earlier this year that foreign securities houses could
apply to open a full-service branch or a wholly-owned subsidiary for the
first time in many years, foreign brokers were elated - until they they
discovered that there was a catch.
'They're giving us national treatment, which is great,' says the head of one
foreign brokerage's Taipei office. 'But according to the letter of the law,
it's nearly impossible to find an office space that is both suitable and
which meets government criteria.'
In recent interviews, officials have outlined plans to open up the local
securities industry gradually to foreigners as part of the country's bid to
join the future World Trade Organisation, and to become a regional financial
centre. But the office-space predicament illustrates how liberalisation
measures can hit snags at the level of implementation.
The Taipei municipal government decreed in December 1993 that, for safety
reasons, financial companies must be located in ground-floor or basement
space unless they are in commercially-zoned areas. Quality Taipei office
space is mostly zoned as mixed-residential, and rents for street-level space
in prime business districts are prohibitive. The measure is intended for
local companies with retail operations, but the business of foreign
securities houses is wholesale.
Mr Kuei Hsien-nung, a section chief at Taiwan's Securities and Exchange
Commission, dismisses foreign brokers' concerns. 'They don't need to worry.
It's just a regulation; it can be changed very fast.' A flurry of
consultations among goverment departments are under way, and the matter will
be resolved shortly, he says.
While timetables remain elusive and snags are sure to crop up the
government, nonetheless, is committed to a long-term, step-by-step
liberalisation programme.
In 1983, the authorities gave the green light to overseas-listed funds,
marking the opening of indirect foreign investment in Taiwan shares. In
1990, approved foreign institutions were permitted to invest directly in
local stocks, subject to certain limits.
The next phase, says the vice-minister of finance, Mr Chang Chan-pang, will
be to open the market to foreign individual investors. 'We are now
considering this,' he says. 'But we have to choose the right time: we have
never set a timetable.'
Regulations are steadily being loosened, investment ceilings raised and
restrictions on capital flows and repatriation of profits eased. 'Some
people may ask, why don't we get rid of all restrictions immediately? Of
course, we welcome foreign investment, but we must watch the stability of
our domestic financial markets,' Mr Chang says.
By the end of June, 67 foreign institutional investors had been approved to
invest USDollars 5.6bn in local securities and Dollars 4.7bn had been
placed, Of that, 75 per cent, or Dollars 3.5bn was invested in stocks with
the remainder in bonds or time deposits. Total market capitalisation as of
June 30 was Dollars 199bn.
The Central Bank of China recently raised the overall ceiling on direct
foreign investment in the local bourse to Dollars 7.5bn from Dollars 5.0bn,
and set a limit of Dollars 2.5bn on indirect foreign investment. Late last
year, a cap of Dollars 3bn was set on the amount of funds that can be raised
through overseas issues such as convertible bonds and global depository
receipts. Officials say that these ceilings will be raised if needed.
There is a cap of 10 per cent on aggregate foreign holdings in any
individual stock and a 5 per cent limit for a single foreign shareholder. Mr
Chang predicts that these ownership limits could be lifted to between 15 and
25 per cent, and 10 per cent respectively, in a few months.
However Mr Day Linin, chairman of the SEC, believes that the 5 and 10 per
cent foreign ownership ceilings could be eliminated entirely by the end of
this year, except in strategic industries. Mr Day says that the plan is to
make regulatory treatment of foreign portfolio investment the same as for
equity investment. 'Unlike some countries, our portfolio investment
regulations are stricter than those for equity investment,' he says. Changes
have been agreed but await approval.
The SEC chief concedes that permission for individual foreigners to invest
directly remains a way off. He points out that individual foreigners have
already become sizeable investors in listed companies by having bought
equity in firms before they went public.
There is currently a debate within the government over whether holders of
convertible bonds issued overseas should be permitted to convert them into
listed shares. Mr Day predicts that regulations will be revised to allow
conversion by the end of this year at the latest. Unapproved foreign
investors in such instruments would be allowed to hold the shares after
conversion, but once sold could not buy back into the market.
Mr Day's short-term goal is to raise the ceiling on foreign investment in
local shares to 10 per cent of total market capitalisation, rising later to
25 per cent and eventually eliminating restrictions altogether. The central
bank has agreed in principle, he said, but no timetable has been set.
Foreign investment, including indirect holdings, is about three per cent of
the market.

FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher busy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stores group Kingfisher jumped 12 to 528p as the company's joint broker, the
notoriously secretive Cazenove, turned more positive on the stock.
Cazenove never comments on its moves but sources close to Kingfisher said
the brokerage house had taken the view that the derating of the company by
the City had been overdone. Cazenove is thought to have reasoned that the
owner of chains Woolworths, B&amp;Q, Comet and Superdrug was taking a more
pragmatic attitude to pricing. The move follows a more positive view taken
by BZW last week.
Body Shop fell 2 1/2 to 243p after announcing that Mrs Anita Roddick and Mr
Gordon Roddick had sold 3.5m shares at 240p each reducing their stake to
25.4 per cent. The sale raised Pounds 8.4m which is targeted at charity and
company projects.
Leading pharmaceuticals stocks were supported by some institutional buying
but are likely to open weaker on Monday as a result of the late plunge in
the dollar. Glaxo ended 10 better at 571p, Wellcome, which filed for
approval of a new anti-herpes treatment, added 5 at 606p and Zeneca gained 2
to 737p.
International news and electronic information group Reuters Holdings is also
likely to suffer but its shares received a boost from a Kleinwort Benson buy
recommendation ahead of interim figures at the end of the month. Reuters
gained 3 to 464p
Printing and packing group Bowater slumped 13 to 430 after the group
announced that it had lost its executive director, Mr Stuart Wallis to
Fisons, which gained 2 on the news but closed unchanged at 138.
British Gas attracted keen interest with the shares moving up to 277p before
slipping back late in the session and closing a penny off at 271p after
heavy turnover of 8.1m. Dealers said the initial strength followed reports
that the government had decided to drop legislation from the Queen's speech
planned for the autumn, which would introduce competition in the domestic
gas market in the UK.
Nomura was one broking house seeing the reports as possible good news for
British Gas. 'At a minimum it gives Gas's management more time to prepare
for a competitive market and with a general election looming in 1996-7 it
may be that competition will be postponed until the next century,' said Mr
Steve Turner of Nomura.
Television and leisure company Granada Group added 5 to 507p, after a modest
profits upgrade from Hoare Govett, its broker which is believed to have
increased its current year profits forecast by Pounds 6m to Pounds 250m.
The prospect of Thorn EMI demerging several of its businesses, together with
the hopes of a bullish trading statement at the group's annual meeting next
week, boosted the shares another 13 to 1039p.
Switching in the banks sector was not confined to RBOS and NatWest. There
was heavy trading in TSB where a block of 3m shares was sold into the market
at 195p.
The stock overhang in General Accident, which depressed it from mid-week
onwards, was said to have been partly cleared yesterday with the remainder
expected to be disposed of early on Monday. It closed 8 lower at 558p.
Turnover in Berkeley Group, the housebuilder hit 5.1m shares, with a block
of 2.4m traded at 390p and another of 2.2m at 393p.
Cable &amp; Wireless jumped 6 to 405p on good turnover of 4.6m, helped by buy
recommendations from Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities.
Engineering company TI hardend 4 to 358p, after James Capel reiterated its
buy recommendation. It drew attention to the impressive underlying growth at
the company. Reports that Smiths Industries had lost a lucrative contract
with Boeing left the shares trailing 6 to 435p.
Eurodollar, a vehicle distribution company issued at 220p, ended its first
day of trading at a 2p premium at 222p.

FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switching in banks continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest Bank captured the top two places in the
London market's list of active stocks with some dealers taking the view that
the big seller of RBOS stock on Thursday had quickly pumped some of the
money back into the market through NatWest purchases.
The residue of the RBOS stock acquired by Smith New Court in a bought deal
on Thursday was said to have been placed fairly quickly yesterday morning,
with turnover of 26m in RBOS confirming the deal was completed. Smith was
thought to have paid 408p for the stock.
RBOS shares languished around the 409p mark for much of the morning before
rallying to 414p and eventually settling a net 8 off at 410p. Rumours
circulating yesterday suggested that Morgan Grenfell was the seller of the
RBOS stock.
One buyer then moved in to pick up 5m NatWest at 434p. At the close NatWest
were unchanged at 435p. Turnover in the stock reached a hefty 16m shares,
the heaviest single-day's business since February 23.
Bargain-hunting for hotels group Forte saw the shares recover some ground
from an early retreat, after NatWest Securities placed the stock on the sell
list from its previous hold recommendation. This follows similar advice to
investors from BZW earlier this week.
Having fallen to 217p, cheap buyers helped the shares claw back some of the
earlier losses to finish 2 1/2 down at 221 1/2 p. Turnover was an
above-average 4.4m.
NatWest said: 'The return on capital and prospects for asset price inflation
point to an overvalued property base. Depreciation of a large portion of the
assets must now be on the agenda with ominous implications for the earnings
profile.'
Giving an example, the securities house said: 'An annual two per cent
straight line write-off would mean that 1995's forecast profits become
Pounds 76m rather than the current Pounds 125m.'
However, Forte did the rounds in the city yesterday afternoon saying it had
no plans to alter its depreciation policy. The company also questioned the
figures arrived at in the note.

FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm gilts encourage recovery in
share prices - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An erratic session saw UK shares stand up well against falls in the US bond
market and the dollar following the announcement of the sharp rise in US
payroll numbers last month. London securities houses focused on squaring off
trading positions while awaiting news from the meeting of G7 countries.
Traders warned, however, that the fall in the dollar increased following
comments from President Clinton, and came too only as the London markets
were closing for the day. British government bonds closed very firmly,
brushing off the weakness in US bonds on the view that the G7 meeting is
unlikely to bring dramatic action on the interest rate front. Gains in
long-dated gilts ranged to around half a point, with the short dates steady
after early falls.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day just 2 points off at 2,962.4. After
opening firmer, the blue chip sector held until the the US employment news
drove the Footsie down by 12 points. The market rallied when Wall Street
came in higher, showing a gain of nearly 20 Dow points in UK trading hours.
The broader based FT-SE Mid 250 Index ended barely changed, down 0.1 at
3,454.6.
Over the week, the Footsie has gained 26 points in fairly thin turnover as
investors have become gradually more confident that the G7 meeting which
closes tomorrow, will not bring any aggressive action on global interest
rates. Some analysts expressed concern at the late weakness in the US
currency, warning that this could threaten markets next week. The FT-SE Mid
250 is 38.8 points higher over the week.
Trading volume increased to 585.7m shares yesterday, from 567.2m on
Thursday. Equity trading was swollen by activity in banking stocks as the
proceeds of Thursday's large sale of stock in Royal Bank of Scotland found
their way across the stock market.
Blue chip dollar stocks were narrowly mixed at the London close, with
pharmaceuticals attracting some support but the oil sector looked irregular
in spite of this week's firmness in crude oil prices. There was a rally in
Enterprise Oil shares which have been depressed since the failure of the
group's bid for Lasmo. But the domestic retail stocks made little further
response to the more optimistic view on interest rates which has developed.
On Thursday, retail, or customer business recovered sharply after several
sessions in the doldrums; the retail total of Pounds 1.3bn, compared with
under Pounds 1bn daily earlier in the week, reflected both a return to more
profitable business levels for London brokerage houses and also an
indication that investors have recovered from their concerns that the G7
meeting might set the stage for a hike in US interest rates.
Stock market strategists have drawn confidence from the Footsie's successful
bounce from the 2,930 area and the chart specialists now believe that the
Index could test its next confidence level at around 2,990, and then, if
successful, at 3,017. Most UK securities firms are still predicting a
renewed advance by equities before the end of the year.
In its technical review of the market, Derivatives Securities suggests that
we may be able to say, in retrospect, that; 'It started in Naples,' the
venue for the G7 meeting, where the major countries are expected to discuss
interest rate policies. If they elect to leave rates alone, comments the
firm, then the dollar could be in for renewed volatility.

FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased fears on interest rates following the release of US employment
data brought a retreat to Footsie futures, though the contract closed off
the day's lows.
Trading in a 40 point range, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 hit a
high of 2,976 and a low of 2,937, before recovering to close at 2,959.
Volume at 12,511 showed a slight increase.
There was also an improvement in turnover in the traded options where the
closing total was 33,376 contracts. Tomkins, with 1,028 lots dealt, was the
busiest stock option.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday fell in late trading to its lowest level since April
1993 against the D-Mark after comments from President Clinton unnerved
currency markets, writes Philip Gawith.
After closing at DM1.5741 in London, the dollar slipped to DM1.5580 in US
trading. Against the yen, it was trading at Y98 after closing at Y98.575.
Speaking at the G7 summit in Naples, Mr Clinton caused concern with comments
which were taken to show that he was soft on inflation and unconcerned about
the level of the dollar.
Sterling had an uneventful day, with the sterling index closing at 79.1 from
79.2.
In Europe the currencies of France, Belgium, Italy and Sweden, which had
recently been under pressure, recovered ground against the D-Mark.
There was unconfirmed speculation in the market that European central banks
might have bought the dollar to relieve pressure on their own currencies,
caused by the stronger D-Mark.
Until Mr Clinton's comments, the dollar had traded fairly steadily,
notwithstanding a fall in Treasury prices after the release of the June
non-farm payroll numbers.
Traders reported a fairly lethargic atmosphere at the end of the week which
had promised much action, but delivered little.
The markets ignored the blizzard of comments emerging from Naples about
whether a dollar support package was either necessary, or worthwhile.
The large jump in the payroll number to 379,000, compared to a median
forecast of 242,000, led to some speculation that the Fed might lift
interest rates at Fed time.
One analyst commented: 'Both the foreign exchange and the interest rate
markets are crying out for them to intervene. I don't know what they are
waiting for.'
Interest rates, however, were left unchanged. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of
currency research at JP Morgan in Europe, commented: 'We believe the Fed's
delay does not mark a reluctance to act, but a decision to wait for further
justification from the data for a stronger move in the order of 50 basis
points.'
He said the payroll numbers made a 50 basis point move much more likely. The
Fed will now turn its attention to inflation and retail sales figures next
week.
The tone in the interest rate futures markets was set by the aggressive
selling of PIBOR futures, on fears of higher interest rates to defend the
weak French franc.
The franc fell below its old ERM floor this week, closing yesterday at
FFr3.434 against the D-Mark. The December PIBOR contract closed at 93.85
from 93.93.
The December eurosterling contract traded 29,000 lots to close at 93.57 from
93.63. Mr Richard Phillips of brokers GNI said short sterling had been
weighed down by concerns, similar to France, that higher rates would be
needed to support sterling.
The Bank of England injected Pounds 824m liquidity into UK money markets,
after forecasting a Pounds 800m shortage. Overnight money traded between 2
and 4 3/4 per cent.
In the German money market there was little change to rates, with most
dealings taking place at about 4.9 per cent.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium jumps to fresh
peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a week of concentrating on the consolidation of recent gains most
London Metal Exchange contracts finished near the top of their trading
ranges.
Aluminium was the star performer, the three months position jumping
yesterday to a 39-month high of Dollars 1,541 a tonne. It closed at Dollars
1,539.50, up Dollars 33 on the day and Dollars 29 on the week.
Traders attributed the late strength to bouts of speculative buying, some of
it related to options-market activity. There was also some short-covering by
operators who had gambled on the earlier price decline continuing. With the
metal's fundamentals expected to improve as output cuts following January's
international agreement make further inroads into stocks some dealers told
the Reuter news agency that a test of resistance around the Dollars
1,550-a-tonne mark was likely soon.
Copper was also strong yesterday. The three months position's ended only
Dollars 26 up on the week at Dollars 2,467.50 a tonne but that was a great
improvement on the Dollars 2,390 reached at one stage on Thursday as the
market was hit by selling from speculators and US investment funds. On the
other hand, it was Dollars 25 short of the week's peak, reached on Tuesday.
'Copper should still head higher after bouncing yesterday,' one dealer told
Reuter. 'But it will have to soak up all the overhead selling.'
Another LME market to show renewed buoyancy yesterday was lead. As copper's
rally removed the constraints that had prevented the metal's improving
fundamentals having their full effect on market sentiment the three months
price surged Dollars 25 yesterday to a 22-month peak of Dollars 601 a tonne.
Consolidation was the name of the game for the coffee market for most of
this week. After the recent spectacular surge to 7 1/2 -year highs the
September futures position at the London Commodity Exchange traded in a
relatively narrow Dollars 175 trading range. It ended the week at Dollars
3,077 a tonne, Dollars 121 down overall.
The price had been sent lower on Thursday by news that Brazil planned to
sell 5m bags (60kg each) on its domestic market to calm prices. And early
jitters yesterday about the possibility of another damaging frost in that
country - which lifted the price to Dollars 3,153 at one stage - had calmed
down by the close of trading.
The cocoa market bounced yesterday, with the LCE September quotation ending
at Dollars 1,016 tonne, up Dollars 22 on the day and Dollars 12 on the week.
Prices were initially depressed by the publication of disappointing second
quarter bean grinding figures for Germany and the UK. But with the market
showing what one dealer described as 'a marked reluctance to find sellers',
nervousness about looming supply tightness in the September-March period was
enough to prompt a Dollars 32 rally.
The latest cocoa grind figures have nevertheless further eroded what remains
of the market's bullish sentiment. They might indicate that business in
Europe was not as good as some people had been say it was, confectionery
manufacturers and traders told Reuter.
'They show perhaps that the recession is still deeper than a lot of people
think, and that people are preferring to save up money for holidays rather
than spend it on the finer things in life,' said one manufacturer.
The German grind for the second quarter was 2.5 per cent below the same
three months last year, while the British figure was 6.9 per cent down.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Saatchis stop Dreyfus buying
Adidas shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Saatchi brothers, Maurice and Charles, have obtained a court order
preventing Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a director of the advertising group they
founded, from buying shares in sports-wear producer Adidas.
Mr Louis Dreyfus moved from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi last year to become chief
executive of Adidas but stayed on as a non-executive director of the
advertising group.
Backed by a Pounds 260m (Dollars 395m) consortium that reportedly included
the two Saatchi brothers as well as Credit Lyonnais and Assurances Generales
de France (AGF), the insurance group, Dreyfus himself took a large stake in
the company.
In London's High Court this week the Saatchis and Hatzone, an investment
company half owned by Maurice Saatchi, won an undertaking from Mr
Louis-Dreyfus and Mr Christian Tourres that they would not buy Adidas shares
from seven companies.
The row over the shares is the latest to hit the Saatchi boardroom. Earlier
this year Mr Maurice Saatchi and Mr Charles Scott, both executive directors,
had a embarassing falling out in public over group strategy.
In April Adidas reported 1993 profits of DM9m against a loss of DM149m in
1992.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Steady third-quarter result for
Laidlaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Better third-quarter results in the waste management, recycling and
transportation businesses of Laidlaw were slightly offset by a small decline
in hazardous waste operations. The company blamed this on landfill problems
in South Carolina and pressures on pricing.
Overall, Laidlaw, one of North America's top three waste management groups
and a Canadian Pacific associate, earned USDollars 38.9m, or 14 cents a
share, in the three months ended May 31. This compares to a 1992-93
third-quarter loss of Dollars 33.6m, or 12 cents, after a special Dollars
75m after-tax charge reflecting a write-down in the value of Laidlaw's
interest in ADT. Without the charge, the period showed net profit equal to
13 cents a share.
Third-quarter revenues this time were Dollars 579m, up 6.5 per cent. The
lower Canadian dollar reduced the total by Dollars 11.5m.
For the first nine months of fiscal 1994, overall net profit was USDollars
93.9m, or 34 cents a share, against USDollars 43.4m, or 16 cents in 1983.

Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, is in talks with potential
partners in the insurance industry, with a view to marketing and
distributing non-life products.
The bank said talks were being held with a number of insurance companies,
but declined to confirm reports that Allianz of Germany was among them. Les
Echos, the French financial daily newspaper, reported yesterday that
high-level discussions had been held with Allianz.
Credit Lyonnais said it was seeking a partnership with a company which could
supply non-life products, to be marketed through the bank's retail network.
Initially, the partnership would concentrate on the French market.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hoechst to spin off fibres
activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the big German chemicals company, is to spin off its European
fibres activities into a separate legal entity. The move, which is designed
to take effect on October 1 this year, is Hoechst's reaction to what it
yesterday described as 'unprecedented crisis in the western European fibres,
textiles and clothing industries'.
The Frankfurt-based chemicals group explained yesterday that the transfer of
the fibres business would help the business segment react more flexibly and
swiftly to the poor market conditions in western Europe, where fibres
manufacturers were 'increasingly beset by pressure on prices and cheap
imports from Asia and eastern Europe'.
The aim of the spin-off is to restore the business to profitability after
four years in which there has been a continuous decline in sales coupled
with 'appreciable' losses.
The aim, Hoechst said, was to return to profitability via cost-reduction and
better utilisation of Hoechst's global fibres capacity. It gave no details
on the scale of potential cost-reductions or the nature of capacity
rationalisation, but said it would be entering talks next week with employee
representatives and Hoechst Celanese Corporation, Hoechst's US subsidiary.
Hoechst Celanese and the new entity, to be known as Hoechst Trevira, will
co-operate in certain business areas and target specific markets outside
Europe, Hoechst said. The new entity will, at first, employ about 5,000
people currently working at factories and independent subsidiary companies
in Germany, Portugal, Northern Ireland, Denmark and Austria.
There was no indication of the scale of turnover at the new subsidiary; last
year, Hoechst's worldwide fibres turnover amounted to DM6.84bn (Dollars
4.4bn).
Hoechst first indicated it was considering the spin-off in February this
year, when Bayer, its rival, transferred its fibres activities into Bayer
Faser, a new subsidiary, saying that the move would lead to significant cost
savings.
In April this year Hoechst and Courtaulds of the UK merged their viscose and
acrylic fibre operations to create the second largest European company in
these market segments.
