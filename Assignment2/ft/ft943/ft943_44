FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cariplo suspends L1,650bn share
issue

Cariplo of Italy, which claims to be the world's largest savings bank, last
night suspended an issue of new shares, which could have raised up to
L1,650bn (Dollars 1.02bn), because of poor market conditions.
The decision comes three weeks after Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank,
delayed its L1,500bn rights issue for the same reason.
The offer price was due to be announced today and the sale would have begun
on Monday. The issue would have taken Cariplo on to the stock market for the
first time since its foundation in 1823.
In the last month, the Milan equity market has been hit by doubts about the
new government's handling of the economy, and by the sheer weight of new
shares - worth more than L10,000bn - being offered to investors during July.
Yesterday the Comit index of Milan equities slipped 0.64 per cent, with
banking and insurance stocks among the weaker sectors.
Cariplo undoubtedly took into account the lacklustre opening performance of
shares in Ina, the former state-owned insurer, partly privatised at the end
of June in a L5,000bn sell-off. Ina shares began trading on Wednesday at a
slight premium to the L2,400 offer price, but since then have rarely risen
above that level.
Cariplo said last night it would not have been 'in our interest, nor in the
interests of investors' to have pushed ahead with the issue, but stressed
that the bank did not have an urgent need for new funds.
No new date has been set for the issue, which should be followed before the
end of the year by the sale of a second, slightly smaller stake in the
company in the form of bonds and warrants. The intention was to float up to
22 per cent of the bank, which is wholly owned by a charitable foundation. A
third of the first tranche of shares was aimed at institutional investors
outside Italy.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann chief fires final
salvo at critics
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anxious shareholders yesterday heard Mr Werner Dieter refute what he called
'grotesque' charges that he had lined his own pockets while chief executive
of Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest companies.
Speaking to the annual meeting for the last time before his planned
resignation, Mr Dieter insisted he would not allow himself to become the
victim of a press smear campaign.
He told shareholders he had received an anonymous letter in November warning
him that a campaign would be launched against any attempts to become
chairman of the supervisory board, the non-executive board which oversees
management.
The Dusseldorf state prosecutor began an investigation last week into
allegations in Der Spiegel, he weekly news magazine, that Mr Dieter forced
Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy products at inflated prices from
Hydac, a company largely owned by Mr Dieter's family.
The allegations have attracted prominent press coverage, coming on the heels
of a variety of other scandals this year. In an unusual move, police were
called to be on hand at yesterday's meeting because of Mannesmann management
fears that left-wing extremists would try to interrupt proceedings. As it
happened, their presence was unnecessary.
Mr Dieter, 64, has been chief executive of the group since 1985. He will be
succeeded by Mr Joachim Funk, the finance director. Although Mr Dieter goes
on to become an ordinary member of the supervisory board, he said he would
seek the board chairmanship once external auditors had presented their
report into the allegations.
Turnover for the year was expected to reach DM30bn (Dollars 19.1bn), up from
DM27.96bn in 1993 when the group lost DM513m. Turnover in the first six
months was up 10 per cent to DM14.3bn, exceeding analysts' expectations.
Orders in the same period totalled DM16.8bn, 19 per cent higher than a year
ago.
The group's D2 mobile telephone network, one of two in Germany and the
group's fastest growing unit, now had 700,000 customers, up from 580,000 at
the end of May, the meeting heard.
The links between Rexroth, an engineering company, and Hydac, which makes
magnets and hydraulics accessories, 'were interesting for both companies',
Mr Dieter said.
Mr Dieter had held a 30 per cent stake in Rexroth, but sold this when he
moved to Mannesmann. This, he said, was proof that he had sought to avoid a
conflict of interest.
However, several small shareholders said any suggestion that Mr Dieter might
have benefited from his position as chief executive should rule him out of a
position on the supervisory board.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wates Pounds 31m rights issue meets
lacklustre response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sub-underwriters, led by Mercury Asset Management, have been left with up to
four fifths of the shares in Wates City of London Properties' Pounds 31m
rights issue.
Only 21 per cent of the shares were taken up, according to Cazenove and SG
Warburg Securities, brokers to the issue. MAM had agreed to sub-underwrite
up to 100 per cent of the issue on behalf of discretionary clients.
On this basis MAM's stake in Wates could have risen to about 25 per cent,
although it is believed it was not the sole sub-underwriter.
The outcome was not unexpected given that the 2-for-7 issue was at 73p, only
7p lower than the previous day's closing price.
Yesterday the shares were unchanged at 71p.
It is the company's second rights issue in less than 12 months. Wates raised
Pounds 24m last September when the proceeds were used to cut borrowings.
This time, the company said it intended to use the cash to take advantage of
rising property values by carrying out new developments and allowing it to
retain existing buildings.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: 3i share offer only just oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public offer for 3i, the venture capital group, was only just
oversubscribed - so 98 per cent of applicants will receive all the shares
they sought.
The Pounds 178m offer attracted 75,686 applications - well below the the
385,000 individual registrations for its prospectus.
The offer period coincided with a flurry of flotations hitting the falling
UK equity market.
Baring Brothers, the issue's sponsor, said the public offer of 65.4m shares
at 272p apiece was subscribed 1.1 times.
Applicants for up to 3,000 shares will receive a full allocation.
Those who sought 4,000 to 10,000 will receive 75 per cent, while applicants
for 15,000 and above will receive 50 per cent - up to a maximum of 75,000
shares.
The group's Pounds 522m institutional placement was 1.7 times subscribed, so
there may be some demand when dealing starts on July 18 from institutions
which want to top up their stake.
With a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn and stakes in more than 3,400
businesses, 3i is likely to join the FT-SE 100 Index.
However, analysts believe the shares are unlikely to move to more than a
modest premium - assuming the unsettled equity market does not plunge
further in the meantime.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fisons finds new chief executive -
Priorities to continue rationalisation and fill gap in product pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons' long search for a chief executive ended yesterday.
Six months after ousting Mr Cedric Scroggs, the pharmaceuticals and
scientific equipment group appointed Mr Stuart Wallis, an executive director
at Bowater.
Shares of Bowater, the packaging group, fell 13p to 430p, while Fisons'
shares were static at 138p.
Mr Wallis, who had been responsible for the European packaging and
international health and beauty packaging businesses, had been seen as a
potential successor to Mr David Lyon as Bowater's chief executive.
The appointment follows a series of crises at the former fertilisers group.
These include the resignation of one chief executive, the sacking of another
chief executive and premature departure of a finance director, three profits
warnings, and a collapse in market capitalisation from Pounds 2.23bn to
Pounds 953m.
Mr Wallis, a 48 year old chartered accountant, is scheduled to start at
Fisons on September 1. Prior to his 6 1/2 years at Bowater, he was an
executive director for distribution at Octopus Publishing.
Analysts expressed disappointment that Mr Wallis did not have greater
expertise in the pharmaceuticals industry. However, Mr Patrick Egan, Fisons
chairman, said none of the five short-listed candidates had such experience.
Mr Wallis said he had worked in a number of different sectors and was used
to steep learning curves. He had already had dealings with the
pharmaceuticals industry when at Bowater, he added.
The main priorities were to continue rationalising as quickly and
effectively as possible, and to fill the potential short to medium-term gap
in the product pipeline, he said.
Mr Egan warned the first half results, due in September, would be
'restrained' by acts of God. The hay-fever season in Japan had been
'abysmal', North American laboratory supplies had been interrupted by
weather, and an instrument factory in California had been struck by an
earthquake.
The instruments business would record a small loss during the first six
months and the pharmaceuticals operations' trading results would be down
because they would be compared with a period last year which had been
flattered by unacceptable acquisition accounting and stock loading.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson buys Canadian malls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hammerson, the revamped property company which last year came under new
management, yesterday announced its second large purchase this year.
It is acquiring three Canadian shopping malls in a deal worth CDollars 160m
(Pounds 75m). The developments in south-west Ontario provide net rents of
CDollars 15.5m, providing an initial yield of 9.7 per cent.
The company, which last year raised Pounds 199m in a right issue, acquired a
Pounds 143.3m property portfolio from Postel in March. The deal left the
pension fund with a 12.3 per cent stake in Hammerson.
The latest acquisition will provide the group with 1.2m sq ft of prime
retail space at Westmount shopping centre, London; Stone Road Mall, Guelph
and Tillsonburg Town Centre. The overall vacancy rate of the three centres
is below 3 per cent.
Mr Ronald Spinney, chief executive, said that about 50 per cent of the
purchase cost will be provided from cash resources.
For the balance, Hammerson will take on long term mortgages with a weighted
average life of 10 years and an average interest rate of 9.3 per cent.
Hammerson is seeking to rebalance its portfolio which last year declined in
value to Pounds 1.46bn, after a 14 per cent decline in the company's
properties in continental Europe, North America and Australasia was only
partially offset by a 9.1 per cent increase in UK properties.
Mr Spinney said yesterday: 'This is an excellent acquisition in line with
our strategy of increasing the retail content within our overall portfolio.
In the light of the continuing improvement in the Canadian economy we
believe this is an opportune time to be adding to our retail portfolio.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SB drug same price as Wellcome treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday revealed
that the US price of its new anti-viral treatment Famvir would be the same
as its main competitor, Wellcome's Zovirax, writes Paul Abrahams.
The announcement ended fears that SmithKline Beecham would repeat its UK
strategy by offering Famvir at a discount. Wellcome had responded by cutting
Zovirax's price within hours. In the US, a week's therapy with Famvir,
currently licensed for shingles, will cost Dollars 103.33 (Pounds 67.90),
the same as Zovirax.
Mr Paul Krikler, pharmaceuticals analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'This is a
positive development, but the question remains whether managed care
organisations can start playing one product off against another to obtain
discounts.'
Wellcome separately announced it had filed dossiers for Valtrex, its new
oral shingles treatment, in 19 countries. The group claims Valtrex, whose
generic name is valaciclovir, works more quickly than Zovirax and is just as
safe.
Analysts said the submissions had been due during the second half of the
year, but that it was pleasing they had been so early.
Dr David Barry, Wellcome's director of medical affairs, said: 'In clinical
trials, valaciclovir stopped pain associated with herpes zoster (shingles)
attacks at least 25 per cent faster than acyclovir (Zovirax).'

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: New owner for Gosforth Park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanley Clarke, the millionaire who hauled Uttoxeter racecourse out of
the red, has galloped to the rescue of High Gosforth Park, the quoted
company that owns and runs Newcastle racecourse.
The course is to be acquired for Pounds 3.4m by Northern Racing, formed to
make the acquisition and owned 65 per cent by Stanley Clarke Leisure, a
private vehicle, and 35 per cent by St Modwen Properties, the development
and investment company chaired by Mr Clarke.
Northern is paying Pounds 37 a share and has irrevocable undertakings on
42.3 per cent of the issued share capital. This includes the 7.4 per cent
owned by the board, which is recommending the deal. There is a loan note
alternative.
Last May, Gosforth lost a long-running battle to get the go-ahead to develop
part of its 800-acre site. It had argued that it needed cash from the
proposal to fund development of the course necessary to ensure its survival.
Mr Clarke said that he hoped to apply the same techniques that had proved
successful at Uttoxeter, which had moved from losses of Pounds 36,000 in
1989 to profits of Pounds 400,000 last year.
Gosforth, which has net assets of Pounds 1.42m, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 49,675 last year.
The offer, which represents a premium of 85 per cent to the last trade in
the shares, closes on July 29.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Panel to force bid disclosure earlier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Takeover Panel said it is prepared to force companies planning a bid to
make a public announcement immediately it notices sharp rises in the share
price of the target company.
In its annual report for the period ended March 31 1994, the Panel said: 'In
some cases the requirement to make an announcement of a possible offer may
upset detailed planning and may even lead to abandonment of the offer.'
However, even if forcing disclosure would jeopardise the bid, the Panel is
prepared to do so 'in the interests of fairness to the market'.
Recent instances where the Panel has compelled public announcement of a bid
were Enterprise Oil's offer for Lasmo and De La Rue's offer for Portals.
Concern about cases where pre-offer bid speculation leads to sharp share
price increases remains a Panel priority. Mr William Staple, director
general said 'the golden rule' is that a 10 per cent rise in a target
company's share price would prompt the Panel to force disclosure of a
planned bid, but extenuating circumstances were taken into consideration.
In its annual report, the Panel said that in order to reduce the chances of
pre-bid information leaks, an advisory organisation should not be included
in talks until the latest possible moment and that the number of individuals
involved should be kept to 'an absolute minimum'.
Separately, Mr Staple said that the Panel would review its current rules
regarding cash offers for shares in the midst of an all-paper bid. The move
stems from widespread complaints about Enterprise Oil's purchase of Lasmo
shares during its bid at a price far above that prevailing in the
marketplace.
Several of the Panel's non-executive directors have said they wished to see
the rule reviewed.
In its accounts, the Panel said it was halving the fee it charges the Stock
Exchange to Pounds 1 on equity transactions over Pounds 10,000. The Panel
has already accumulated a surplus of Pounds 4.6m which it deems sufficient
for current operations.

<TEXT>
Break for the Border Group, the restaurant and nightclub operator which came
to the market in May 1993, yesterday accompanied reduced annual profits with
a cash raising exercise.
Turnover from the two London cafes and the Borderline nightclub amounted to
Pounds 4.23m (Pounds 4.1m) during the 12 months to March 31 with improved
margins behind a rise to Pounds 3.24m (Pounds 3.11m)in gross profits from
food and drink sales.
However, increased staffing and costs of seeking expansion opportunities,
left profits before and after tax down from Pounds 477,000 to Pounds
402,000. A maiden dividend of 0.67p is payable from earnings of 4.3p (8.3p)
per share.
Mr Robert Gunlack, chairman, said that further growth would mainly come from
acquisitions and the extension of its brand names away from London and the
group yesterday confirmed the purchase, first announced in May, of the
Dublin-based Marino Group.
Marino comprises a 75 bedroom hotel and four theme bar/restaurants within a
half mile radius in the Irish capital. Initial consideration amounts to
IPounds 2m (Pounds 1.98m) cash on completion with further performance
related payments to a maximum IPounds 5.08m.
The deal will be funded by a placing and open offer of 7.88m new shares at
52p to raise a net Pounds 3.75m. The shares have been conditionally placed
with institutions and other investors by Fiske, with existing shareholders
entitled to participate on a 2-for-5 basis.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Xenova forced to scale down flotation in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Xenova, the Berkshire bio-technology company, has been forced to scale down
its flotation in the US as a result of the weakness of the stock market.
The company said yesterday that it had raised about Dollars 10m (Pounds
6.5m) through the sale of 1.25m American Depositary Share units at Dollars 8
each. The price values Xenova at about Dollars 80m and the units are trading
on the Nasdaq market.
In February, when plans for the flotation were set in motion, the company
had hoped to raise about Dollars 45m.
Xenova now has Pounds 30.7m in cash, enough to last about 18 months. The
company is likely to have to raise more cash, but is likely to seek
corporate partners rather than make further share issues.
Each ADS unit, representing one Xenova share, is accompanied by an ADS
conversion right which will convert on July 14 1995 into a maximum of 0.22
of an ADS based on the performance of the unit price compared with quarterly
target prices.
The company has long planned to float in the US, where investors are more
accustomed to biotechnology companies characterised by years of losses
before a product reaches the market. Xenova specialises in the rapid
screening of large numbers of potential drugs derived from fungi, bacteria
and plants.
The company's advisers in the flotation were Paine Webber, Lehman Brothers,
Cowen and James Capel.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro raises offer for JW Spear by Pounds
2 a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the largest US toy and games group, yesterday raised its bid for JW
Spear, the UK company which owns the rights to the Scrabble board game
outside North America.
The US group, which already owns the North American rights for Scrabble as
well as 26.7 per cent of Spear, increased its offer to Pounds 11 a share,
valuing Spear at Pounds 57.3m. It is also offering a loan note alternative.
The new terms are 100p above an offer from Mattel, the rival US toy company,
and 200p ahead of its original offer, made at the end of May.
Mr Norman Walker, a director of Hasbro UK, said the increased offer
represented 'significant enhanced value for shareholders' and reflected
Spear's past performance and future prospects.
Mr Paul Lipscombe, Spear's finance director, said the board would meet next
week 'to consider all aspects of the situation'. The latest offer closes on
August 5. Mattel, whose offer closes on Monday, said it had noted the new
bid and was considering its options.
Hasbro received no acceptances for its original offer, which was launched
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell
their 24.9 per cent stake unless a higher offer was received in three
working days.
The Spear board sought a white knight and found Mattel, which launched its
bid at five minutes to midnight on the last day.
Hasbro went to the High Court, claiming that Mattel's late offer had not
been properly announced; but the judge released the trustees from any
obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro.
The Spear board, which was not recommending either offer, has since allowed
Hasbro to take a more detailed look at the company and its forecasts.
The trustees have given no further undertakings to Hasbro. Hasbro argues
that its offer gives the trusts and families that own a large part of Spear
an opportunity to escape from the limited liquidity of the shares.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Hasbro's
latest offer represents 20 times Spear's earnings last year.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Selling parts of the Body to gratify their
souls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon and Anita Roddick yesterday sold 3.5m shares in Body Shop
International at 240p in order to help two projects dear to their hearts.
Of the Pounds 8.4m raised, Pounds 2.1m will go to the development of an
inhaler for the alleviation of cold and hay fever symptoms and Pounds 2m
towards a film project on indigenous peoples.
The company said yesterday that, after tax, the remaining money would give
the couple 'a little headroom' for further projects which they are backing.
The sale reduced the number of shares held by Ms Roddick, group managing
director, to 24.01m and by Mr Roddick, chairman, to 24.2m, giving them a
joint stake of 25.4 per cent. The company said the Roddicks had not sold any
shares for a number of years.
The inhaler - to be known as Virotherm - will use a steam-based therapy to
help cold and hay fever sufferers.
Its development is being undertaken by The Healthcare Foundation, which
Anita Roddick helped to set up in 1987 with Michael Grade and Richard
Branson. Its first project was Mates condoms.
Separately, the Roddicks guaranteed the bank funding of Millennium: Tribal
Wisdom and the Modern World, a television series shown in the UK last year
and in North America in 1992. Marketing of the film and the book continues,
but any future revenues will revert to Body Shop International.
The company stressed yesterday that the Roddicks would receive no financial
benefit from either project and did not expect to recover their
contributions.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AromaScan valued at Pounds 35m in main
market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AromaScan, the developers of an 'electronic nose' - a new technology to
detect odours - yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation
valuing the group at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m.
The float is expected to raise Pounds 12m, of which Pounds 4m will be set
aside for working capital and Pounds 8m used to build a manufacturing plant
and develop technology which, according to the company, has applications for
industries ranging from food and drink to cosmetics.
Mr Allan Syms, managing director, said it was a big breakthrough. 'We have
developed the first machine capable of producing the digital fingerprint of
a smell,' he stated.
Unlike rival technologies, AromaScan's electronic nose relies on a large
library of polymers to identify smells and produce digital print-outs. It
can, for example, spot the difference between genuine and fake Chanel
perfume or detect contamination in recycled bottles.
That technology was pioneered and developed at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and has been used by the US Food
and Drug Administration and companies such as Whitbread and Unilever.
Mr Syms estimated the potential worldwide market at Pounds 215m, although he
warned that development costs were likely to lead to losses of Pounds 1.91m
next year and Pounds 863,000 in 1996.
The pathfinder prospectus, however, showed the group making profits of
Pounds 4.02m in 1997 on projected turnover of Pounds 18.4m.
Under the terms of the flotation - handled through a placing by NM
Rothschild with Peel Hunt acting as broker - existing shareholders have
agreed to retain their stakes for at least two years.
They include AromaScan management, which currently holds 30 per cent; Umist
with 10 per cent and 70 private investors holding the balance.
Mr Fred Worth, finance and operations director, said funds raised by the
placing would also be used to repay a Pounds 500,000 loan to Umist, while
Legal and General - one of the original backers - would receive Pounds
300,000 from existing cash balances.
Impact day is July 26 and dealings are expected to begin on August 3.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Daily Mail and General Trust and European Media Associates together now hold
29.99 per cent of Chiltern Radio, the north of England and home counties
broadcaster, as a result of EMA's purchase in the market of 97,176 shares.
The board of Chiltern - which is the subject of an offer from
Luxembourg-based CLT, one of Europe's largest private broadcasters - said it
continued to believe that the terms of the CLT offer were fair and
reasonable.
However, the directors stressed that DMGT has stated it had no intention of
accepting the CLT offer and press reports had indicated that Capital Radio -
which owns 20 per cent of Chiltern - held the same view.
It should also be noted, they said, that GWR Group - in which Capital and
DMGT each had a 17 per cent interest - had acquired a 2.25 per cent holding
in Chiltern.
As a result, directors said they thought it unlikely that the CLT offer
would be capable of being declared unconditional at its first closing date
yesterday.
CLT later said it had decided to extend its offer until 3pm on July 22.

SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent television production company, yesterday
reported a 14 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 809,000 to
Pounds 926,000 in the year to end-March.
The outcome was achieved on turnover 19 per cent ahead from Pounds 19.8m to
Pounds 23.8m and was boosted by an increase in receivable interest to Pounds
441,000 (Pounds 163,000). Earnings per share emerged at 0.38p (0.42p).
Mr Allan McKeown, chief executive, said the results reflected a year of
continuing growth in the company's core business of television production -
albeit at reduced margins - and investment in its programme library had
increased by Pounds 650,000 to Pounds 1.17m at the year end.
The company now faced a period when its cash resources would be called on
both to finance its continuing programme production schedule as well as its
expansion into other areas.
For this reason, Mr McKeown said, the board was not recommending payment of
a dividend this year.

announced pre-tax losses narrowed to Pounds 3.77m for the year to April 3,
compared with last time's Pounds 36.5m which was struck after restructuring

Directors said that substantial progress had been made in the implementation

Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said trading was at a reasonable level in the
current year. However the general recovery was continuing to be patchy and
the construction industry, in which B&amp;T was heavily involved, was still
particularly weak.
Turnover fell from Pounds 119m to Pounds 94m, including discontinued

The Pounds 1.85m cash element of the price will be met by a placing and open

p, which will raise Pounds 3m net. Qualifying holders may apply on terms of
80 new ordinary for every Pounds 17 nominal of loan stock held.
In 1993 Davis made pre-tax profits of Pounds 217,000 on Pounds 52m turnover.
At the year end, it had net assets of Pounds 2.02m.
The deal will increase Caverdale's motor retailing turnover by almost 55 per

FT  09 JUL 94 / Bitter sweets and soft smacks: Summiteers must use
inducements and threats to solve the Bosnian conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Bosnian army was battling defectors to a pro-Serb Moslem unit in the
northwest of the state yesterday, the future of the territory was on the
agenda for discussion in the balmy air of Naples. President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia, along with the western leaders at the G7 summit, will be shouldering
a grave responsibility. It is possible that history will hold them guilty of
fumbling a final chance to prevent conflict in the Balkans from escalating
out of all control.
Five of the eight countries - the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany -
are co-designers of a detailed plan for an effective partition of Bosnia.
All subscribe to the idea that the warring parties should be pressed
strongly, by threats and inducements, to accept the proposals to them in
Geneva this week. The other participants in the summit - Canada, Italy and
Japan - will scarcely demur.
Yet the fact remains that the international consensus over what to do if the
warring Serbs and Moslems reject the plan is only wafer thin; and it may
prove too thin to convince the Bosnian parties. They have two weeks to
consider their response.
Even the plan's creators would agree that it is not a perfect arrangement.
Perhaps the best that can be said is that it is less imperfect, and less
doomed to failure, than any other proposal put forward so far.
While preserving Bosnia's notional existence, the plan would allocate 51 per
cent of its territory to the new Moslem-Croat federation, and the remainder
to the Bosnian Serbs, who now control about 70 per cent.
For Bosnia's mainly Moslem leadership, the worse thing about this is that it
leaves in Serb hands a string of towns in central Bosnia, such as Prijedor,
where Moslem communities have been destroyed by ethnic cleansing.
For the Serbs, the plan's biggest drawback is that the corridor which now
links Serb-controlled land in Bosnia with the Serbian republic to the east
would be narrowed to a width of a few miles. The Serb side would have to
surrender the main towns of the region on either side of the corridor, such
as Brcko, making it easier for its enemies to sever the connection with the
ethnic motherland.
Even if Serb political leaders agree to this concession, it is hard to
imagine Serb officers pulling out of towns they have conquered and cleansed.
The US has stated loudly, and Russia much more reluctantly, that if Bosnia's
Moslem leaders accept the map and the Serbs reject it, the more co-operative
party will probably be rewarded with a lifting of the international arms
embargo.
If the Serbs accept the proposal, they can expect a lifting of economic
sanctions. Both sides have been told that co-operation will earn them
reconstruction aid - while continued recalcitrance will lead to tougher
enforcement of punitive measures.
Bosnia's President Alija Izbetgovic has already moved to seize the moral
high ground by saying that his side will accept the plan, but he does not
have any illusions that it will be implemented. 'I emphasise that we will be
saying yes, since the Serbs will be rejecting it,' he has said.
If the eight leaders conferring in Naples were dictators, with no fear of
domestic opinion, they would probably stand a better chance of forcing their
ideas down the throats of all the combatants. But, ironically, the fact that
their countries are democracies makes it harder for them to apply a 'carrot
and stick' approach in a sustained and convincing way.
In the US legislature, there is massive pressure for an unconditional
renunciation of the arms embargo against the Bosnian government, regardless
of its attitude to the peace plan. In a recent Senate vote, supporters of a
unilateral lifting of the embargo fell one vote short of victory.
Meanwhile, in Russia, there is strong support for an unconditional lifting
of sanctions against Serbia - which are widely breached and have failed to
prevent economic revival.
Many Russians feel that their country's initial adherence to punitive
measures against their traditional Serb allies was at best a temporary
expedient, reflecting a period of weakness in Russian diplomacy.
If the US Congress forces the administration into unconditional support for
the Bosnian government, then Russia's support for its Serb protege will
become more open too, and the Bosnian war could become an old-fashioned
US-Russian conflict by proxy. The UN's humanitarian effort, which depends on
a minimum of consent from all sides, would become untenable. The UK and
France have stressed that they would pull out their troops, which form the
backbone of the peacekeeping force, if there was a full-scale conflict.
Already, several nightmare scenarios look plausible. If Bosnian government
forces manage to wrest from the Serbs the strategic corridor which links
northern Bosnia with the Serbian republic, that would have the side-effect
of severing communications between Belgrade and the Serb-controlled region
of Croatia.
At that point, the Croatian government could be tempted to seize back the
one-third of its territory which is under Serb control. A full-scale
Serb-Croat war could ensue.
Equally real is the prospect of the conflict spreading south to involve the
Albanian communities of adjacent territories: Kosovo, where an Albanian
majority lives uneasily under Serb rule; the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia; and Albania itself. Relations between the Slav majority and
Albanian minority in Macedonia have worsened in recent weeks, with Albanian
deputies abandoning their seats in parliament and refusing to accept as fair
a census designed to show the true ethnic balance.
Any conflict involving the Albanians would run the risk of drawing in
Greece, which has been at odds with Tirana over the treatment of its ethnic
Greek minority.
Finally, escalating conflict in Bosnia and points north and south could
fatally poison relations between Greece and Turkey, nominal Nato allies
whose bilateral relations are already under severe strain.
All this makes a depressing prospect for the leaders as they sit down to
spaghetti and seafood on the Mediterranean. Due to the fragility of the
consensus they have reached over Bosnia, they may not linger on the subject
 -though it is expected to feature in the bilateral meetings between Mr
Yeltsin and his US and British counterparts. If the increasingly vivid
possibility of a Balkan war comes true, however, then all the discussion of
other topics - from interest rates to the dollar - could go down in history
as a frivolous waste of time.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Northern cool in the Neapolitan heat: The first 50 days of
G7 host, Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like any fellow Milanese businessman, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian
prime minister, must have regarded the prospect of hosting the G7 summit in
Naples with unease.
The cheerful anarchy and decadence of the city is anathema to the
hardworking northerners.
The clash of cultures was evident from Mr Berlusconi's pre-summit press
conference in the 17th-century Palazzo Reale, where the main meetings are
being staged this weekend. Immaculately groomed and with a perfect tan, in
almost any other setting Mr Berlusconi would have looked impressively cast
as the New Age prime minister, representing a country that prides itself on
its public appearance. But in the baroque splendour of the Bourbon monarchs'
private theatre his modern image looked out of place.
The humidity has been trying for hosts and guests alike. It made Mr
Berlusconi look uncomfortable when he was forced to dab at the sweat on his
forehead with a handkerchief. Left to his own devices, Mr Berlusconi would
probably have opted to organise the summit elsewhere. However, he inherited
the decision made by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the previous prime minister.
Mr Ciampi chose Naples out of central government guilt for decades of
neglect towards the former capital of the kingdom of the two Sicilies.
Though hosting a party he did not organise, Mr Berlusconi clearly intends to
make the most of the opportunity to launch himself on to the world stage.
His media background should stand him in good stead. Those who know him
attest to his charm as a host, which should ensure his guests at the meeting
of the seven leading industrial nations - plus Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president - feel relatively at ease.
Yet if Mr Berlusconi can reap easy publicity from the occasion, it will not
hide the widening gap between the image and reality of the new regime in
Italy. The Naples gathering occurs when his right-wing coalition is showing
signs of wear and tear - after only 50 days since the parliamentary vote of
confidence which in effect launched the Berlusconi administration.
On Thursday a cabinet meeting - expected to approve the outlines of
macroeconomic policy and agree on a bill to settle the sensitive issue of
providing a form of amnesty for the hundreds involved in corruption scandals
 -was too divided to decide anything. The three-man team of economic
ministers failed to win any advance commitment from Mr Berlusconi on the
introduction of austerity measures in the 1995 budget to hold the deficit
below 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Rumours of resignations flew at
high velocity, and Mr Berlusconi decided to cool tempers by going to the
summit early instead of attending the cabinet session.
But even in Naples he was caught by talk of resignations. He was obliged to
take the embarrassing step of interrupting a press conference, at which he
had just extolled the achievements of his government, to deny market rumours
that his economic team was resigning. The markets seemed to be worried by
the absence of an agreed economic policy statement and by disputes within
government over the harshness of the measures to be imposed on Italians, to
whom Mr Berlusconi had promised lower taxes and more jobs.
But the rumour mill was fuelled by genuine threats to resign from Mr Alfredo
Biondi, justice minister, and Mr Giuliano Urbani, civil service minister. Mr
Biondi was angered by the cool reception from within the government
coalition for his proposals to find a political solution to the corruption
investigations. Mr Urbani, one of Mr Berlusconi's ideologues, was incensed
by the way his colleagues in Forza Italia had drawn up a proposal to reform
the electoral law without consulting him. The proposal envisaged every seat
in parliament being covered by the first-past-the-post system in the next
election, instead of the current 75 per cent. Mr Urbani favoured a
second-round run-off, and believed the reforms were being unnecessarily
hurried.
These tensions serve to highlight three unsettling aspects of the new
administration: its inexperience; Mr Berlusconi's apparent reluctance to
take decisions; and the heterogeneous nature of the coalition.
Of the three, inexperience is arguably the least important, although it may
initially lead to some mistakes. All but two of the 25 ministers have had no
ministerial experience, and the junior ministers are novices. To this has to
be added a bureaucracy that for four decades has depended on a patronage
system, orchestrated by all-powerful ruling parties that have now
disappeared off the map.
These start-up problems have been aggravated by the aggressive manner in
which Mr Berlusconi and his allies have sought to demonstrate they hold the
levers of power and do not need to cut deals with the opposition in the
centre and on the left. Previously everyone was kept content with some bite
of the state's pie.
This posture explains the high-profile battle to gain control of the RAI
state broadcasting organisation, the enforced departure of Mr Romano Prodi
from running IRI, the state holding company, and efforts to unseat Mr Franco
Bernabe at ENI, the state oil concern. It also accounts for the government's
insistence on its right to appoint a successor to Mr Lamberto Dimi, who
moved from being director general at the Bank of Italy to become treasury
minister.
These battles are being fought with little regard for the diplomatic
fall-out. More often than not, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has found
himself using his limited authority to ensure that there are some checks on
the power of the government. This in turn has weakened his tenure as
president - he has always been vulnerable, as a former Christian Democrat
interior minister elected by the previous discredited parliament.
These power struggles have taken priority over policy formulation. Since Mr
Berlusconi took power in mid-May, only a few minor policies, such as tax
breaks for creating jobs, have been introduced. Partly, this is because the
government was unprepared to govern. But it is also due to Mr Berlusconi's
own style of decision making. He ran his Fininvest business empire by
relying on a small group of friends to toss around ideas, and then orders
were executed by a compliant staff.
He is still surrounded by the same group of Fininvest associates; but he now
has to sell policies to a cabinet composed of the populist Northern League
and the neo-fascist MSI/ National Alliance and his own Forza Italia, which
all have different agendas. Once issues are past the cabinet hurdle, they
then have to go to parliament, where the government lacks a clear majority
in the senate.
The decision-making process is thus naturally slow. But Mr Berlusconi has
not helped himself. By failing to clarify his economic policy, he has
squandered the goodwill of the markets. In the past three weeks, the markets
have become dismayed by his apparent refusal to confront the central issue
of Italy's public finances, focusing instead on stimulating jobs and
consolidating a timid domestic recovery. The stock market has weakened and
the lira has reached a psychological floor of L1,000 to the D-Mark.
Financial analysts say that unless he reacts soon, the lira could face a
battering and the Bank of Italy may be forced to raise interest rates. That
might prove a self-inflicted wound which could upset Mr Berlusconi's
honeymoon with Italian voters.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Cash tills with bicycle bells: Stewart Dalby asks if le Tour
de UK has been a commercial hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Merseyside Development Corporation sponsored the Tall Ships regatta and
an accompanying opera in 1992 to the tune of Pounds 700,000, it hoped to
turn the region's image from one of urban decay, unemployment and militant
politics into a middle-class modern version of the Victorian sea-faring soap
opera, the Onedin Line.
But all it got was a damning parliamentary report about the waste of
taxpayers' money that helped pay for rows of wooden trading schooners in the
Mersey docks that few people turned up to see.
This week south-east England caught the sponsorship bug, hoping the world's
biggest cycling event, the Tour de France, would bring tourists to an area
increasingly reliant on their spending for economic survival. The tour is
the world's most lucrative bicycle ride, with Pounds 1.2m in prize money.
On Thursday, the 189 competitors raced through Portsmouth during the
113-mile stint around the Hampshire countryside. About 250,000 people packed
into the town centre, matching a similar number in Brighton and slightly
less in Dover on an earlier leg of the race.
Together, the three towns, with the county councils of Kent, East Sussex and
Hampshire, have spent between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m, of which Pounds
270,000 went to the race's organiser, the Societe du Tour de France. The
rest went on signposting, policing, publicity, car parking and road
closures.
But will the councils meet the same fate as Merseyside and be accused of
squandering public money, or will the costs be justified by the return?
The question is not immediately answerable because the overall effect of the
race cannot be measured simply by the revenue the councils raise, or even
the number of ice creams, hot dogs or T-shirts bought by visitors watching
the race. The real benefits will derive from the three-day cash injection
into hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions. Mr Graham Tubb,
economic development officer of East Sussex County Council said: 'Not
everyone watching the race spends a lot of money. But, say 250,000 visiting
Brighton spend Pounds 10 each, that is Pounds 2.5m just on the day.'
For Brighton, the extra income will come on top of the Pounds 130m it
estimates tourism brings in every year. Across the UK, tourism is a
multi-billion pound industry; overseas visitors alone spent Pounds 9.1bn
last year.
Many local officials believe that the best way to build up tourism is by
sponsoring prestigious, eye-catching projects - which are often loss
leaders. In the 1970s Brighton built a Pounds 13m conference centre which is
thought never to have made a profit, even though the town regularly attracts
more than 200,000 delegates a year. But they spend about Pounds 60m a year
in the town, helping hotels and restaurants to flourish. Mr Peter Bramich,
general manager of the Metropole, the largest hotel in Brighton with 328
rooms at about Pounds 150 a night, said: 'About 80 per cent business is from
conferences.'
Similarly, the value of events such as the Tour de France, has to be
calculated in broad terms. Brighton, which was the finishing town for the
first UK stage of the race, probably did not do as well as it might on the
day because there was a rail strike. The barman in the Concord public house
opposite the pier and just 200yd from the finishing line, was disappointed:
'Where are all the visitors then? We are not doing any extra business at
all.'
His experience seems isolated. The early signs are that the impact of the
race on the local economy will prove beneficial. Mr Paul Delenaught, general
manager of the Dudley Hotel in nearby Hove said: 'I have 60 rooms and we are
absolutely full to the rafters. Normally we would be 75 per cent full at
this time of year.'
Outside Brighton there was a tremendous response to the race. In Ditchling,
Mr Rod Clarke, who runs a tea shop and bakery said: 'We have had four to
five times the usual number of customers and it's only 10am.' The village
saw a price war between the garden centre and a farmer who were trying to
undercut the official rate of Pounds 3 for a day's parking.
In Portsmouth it was a similar story. Ms Debbie Greenwood of the district
council said: 'We estimate that 1m watched the race in Hampshire. This is
more than double the number we expected.'
More important than the number of visitors is the amount of cash they poured
into the local economy. On a conservative estimate of about 1m watching the
race and, taking the rule-of-thumb of tourism officials and assuming each
visitor spent about Pounds 10, then total the benefit to the local economy
is Pounds 10m.
Ms Deborah Grubb, head of arts and leisure at Brighton district council,
said: 'We have spent Pounds 150,000 and I would guess we will get a multiple
of that back. Our town has been on Channel 4 news every night and we have
had a special programme devoted to us. If you include the newspaper coverage
we would have spent nearly Pounds 150,000 on promotion alone.'
Mr David Knight, the race's project manager for Portsmouth council, suggests
Pounds 10m for the whole region might be an under-estimate. 'I think that
Portsmouth will have made Pounds 10m out of the race.'
That might not be enough to fend off the critics - such as Mr and Mrs
Welbury, a retired couple from Ditchling. 'We are in favour of the race but
there is quite a lot of opposition here locally. When the London to Brighton
race came through, they left an awful lot of litter. Someone has to pay for
that,' said Mrs Welbury.
Mr Knight countered: 'The race director said he will definitely be bringing
the race back to Britain next year. He said there was a logic to the south
coast because of the Channel Tunnel. We in Portsmouth would be interested in
hosting the race again.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Faulty argument in support of weak
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT SOLOMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Wynne Godley and William Milberg, in their 'Three cheers for a weak
dollar' (Personal View, July 6), paint a highly misleading picture of the
American balance of payments situation.
They claim that imports have for years been growing faster than exports.
That is factually wrong. How could it be correct when the US current account
deficit declined from Dollars 150bn in 1986 to Dollars 66bn in 1992?
What Godley and Milberg fail to recognise is that the balance of payments
since 1992 has been affected by the recession in Europe and Japan, while the
US economy has bounded ahead. That is why imports of goods and services have
risen much faster than exports of goods and services recently.
Just as we have a measure of the budget balance that abstracts from the
effects of recession - the structural balance - we need such a measure for
the balance of payments. It would show a much smaller structural current
account deficit than the actual one.
It follows that their case for a weaker dollar is itself a weak one.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JACK E FELT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Skapinker's article, 'Motorists warned over summer smog' (July
4), noted that commuters were asked by the Department of the Environment to
avoid using cars last Monday.
As a commuter, I heard nothing of this until I read your article - then it
was too late.
But are such government requests a viable answer to the problem? I think
not. The solution can only lie in positive actions by the authorities to
reduce the number of vehicles entering urban areas and to limit emissions
from individual vehicles by spot testing at the roadside.
Ill-timed appeals to commuters to abandon their cars only demonstrate the
government's reluctance to face the problem.

<TEXT>
Sir, The most significant implication of the BBC white paper, 'The future of
the BBC', is the recognition that the corporation has a central role to play
in the introduction of digital terrestrial television broadcasting in 1997,
ushering in the multi-media age. The white paper estimates that full digital
use of the spectrum would generate a Pounds 5bn per annum business to 'UK
plc'.
Measures to unlock this value need to be expedited. Clearly this means that
the white paper is inconsistent with the licensing of many further analogue
television services, in particular Channel 5. Proposals for an analogue
version of Channel 5 should be dropped.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Abolition of a floating charge too
radical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J E P GERVASIO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read Sir Michael Grylls's letter (June 28) in
support of the proposal to abolish the floating charge. The argument is that
the floating charge encourages excessive gearing for small and medium sized
enterprises (SMEs), inhibits the borrower and places trade creditors at a
disadvantage; its abolition would lead to a more robust lending environment
in the UK along European lines.
l have a great deal of sympathy with the symptoms identified by Sir Michael
 -excessive reliance on short-term finance and over-geared businesses in the
SME sector. Too often in the recent recession we have seen small companies
fall victim to excessive zeal in enforcing 'on demand' facilities.
However, I am not convinced that the prescribed medicine is the answer. I
believe that the abolition of the floating charge altogether would merely
lead to a drying up of funding for SMEs. What they need is a change in the
mix of funding away from short-term money in favour of medium-term or
long-term debt.
Fundamentally, SMEs need permanent capital for growth - that is, equity. For
companies, say, with less than 100 employees, the market does not serve the
needs of the SME sector at all well. In Yorkshire we are the only player
seriously committed to the provision of equity at this end of the market.
Here, there is a responsibility on all those engaged in this sector -
professional advisers, training and enterprise councils, bank managers, and
even the newly expanding Business Links, to encourage expansion through
external investment in SMEs. The sensitive use of externally sourced
long-term capital funding for the small business could be a significant
contributory factor in strengthening this vital part of the UK's economic
future.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: More means testing is no answer to
rise in poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SALLY WITCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to what was stated in your editorial, 'Work and benefits'
(June 27), it is not welfare benefits which trap their recipients, so much
as those which are means tested. Means-tested benefits are withdrawn as
income rises: it is from means-tested benefit paid to the husband that a
wife's earnings are deducted. These are just some of the reasons why they
are such a poor response to the increasing insecurities of today's
'flexible' labour market.
It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that the advent of the job-seeker's
allowance - which brings with it more means testing - is greeted with
enthusiasm in your editorial. Yet there is no avoiding the truth that means
testing brings with it work disincentives, and not because benefits are paid
at too high a level. Income support has been shown to be inadequate to meet
even a low-cost budget.
Between 1979 and 1991, the number of people in work who are living in
poverty (defined as less than 50 per cent average income after housing
costs) has increased from 4.1 per cent to 11.7 per cent, as a percentage of
all in employment. No longer does being in work mean being out of poverty.
The problem is not that benefits are over generous, but that rates of pay
are far too low.
Contributory and universal benefits, such as child benefit, do not bring
with them the work disincentives of means testing. They can even go some way
to alleviating them - child benefit forming a helpful bridge from
unemployment into work.
Cutting benefits and introducing more means testing will do nothing to halt
the dramatic increase in poverty (particularly child poverty) experienced in
the UK over the last 15 years.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Man in the News: The doctor's distress call - Dr Sandy
Macara
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandy Macara and Mark Santer are not household names. Many people, even
after being told that one is chairman of the British Medical Association
council and the other the bishop of Birmingham, would have difficulty
deciding which was which.
The difficulty will have been increased for casual newspaper readers this
week with Santer (the bishop) attacking the 'distressing defects of the
market model' in the government's health reforms, and Macara (the doctors'
leader) addressing his members on the need to be positive in the face of
despair and heal an unhappy society.
Health ministers await the British Medical Association's annual conference
with mounting feelings of discomfort, because it provides the medical
profession with an annual opportunity to win valuable publicity in its
ongoing battle with the government over the 1991 National Health Service
reforms.
This year, the government suffered damage before the conference even
started. At the eve-of-conference evensong in Birmingham Cathedral on Sunday
the bishop - whose wife Henriette is a clinical psychologist who chairs an
NHS trust - delivered a sermon criticising the reforms.
When the conference convened the next day, delegates adopted a resolution
congratulating him for emphasising the 'moral principles on which the NHS
should be based'. By the time Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, was
on television trying to explain away the bishop's remarks, the BMA was
claiming the moral high ground.
Dr Macara, to whom the style of the pulpit comes as easily as it does to
most bishops, continued the moral tone in his opening address to the
conference. 'I give you a text for today from Milton's Paradise Lost,' he
told delegates:
'What reinforcement we may gain from hope;
If not, what resolution from despair.'
The BMA chairman also found room for more earthy language. Doctors were
being forced to serve a perverse philosophy of winners and losers. A new
breed of NHS manager worked by confrontation, intimidation and even
telephone bugging. Misleading information was peddled to distract patients'
attention from real needs.
This sermon, delivered to a conference audience rather than a cathedral
congregation, was greeted with applause and Macara received a noisy standing
ovation. It was a striking achievement by a man who had never seemed
destined to occupy the position of chairman because he was outside the
association's immediate hierarchy.
When the NHS changes started to come into effect in 1991 Mr Jeremy
Lee-Potter, an urbane surgeon who was then BMA chairman, sought to repair
the association's relationship with the government, estranged by a long and
bitter BMA campaign against the reforms. But many doctors remained opposed
to the changes; to some BMA members, Lee-Potter's hand-shaking with
ministers soon came to look like hand-wringing and abandonment of opposition
to the restructured NHS.
By last year's conference, there were calls for a challenge to Lee-Potter.
Dr Macara, who chaired the annual conference, was sufficiently well-known to
mount it, yet sufficiently distant from Lee-Potter's immediate colleagues in
the BMA leadership circle to do so with decency. He ran for chairman of
council, and won.
Dr Macara, a 62-year-old public health specialist at Bristol University,
acquired his belief in the importance of the universal state health service
from his experience of the effects of poverty when working as a young doctor
in Glasgow.
Some colleagues were concerned that Macara's passion for the old-style NHS,
and the florid, idiosyncratic style in which he sometimes expresses it,
might create hostages to fortune that the government would use against the
BMA. He has certainly attacked the reforms with an intensity that never
became the diffident Lee-Potter; but he has also insisted that the BMA must
argue from a well-researched position, and accepts that the best tactic is
to look for step-by-step changes rather than total revolution.
His strength comes from the fact that most doctors are still deeply unhappy
about aspects of the NHS reforms. Many doctors specialise in trying to ride
the three horses of public, professional and personal interest so closely
together that the naked eye cannot tell them apart. Their patients do not
always appreciate that, as well as being the doctors' professional
association, the BMA is their trade union. It is currently moving into
battle against government plans to introduce performance-related pay for
medical staff, and this week's debate on the subject could have been taking
place at any trade union conference - except that the objections were voiced
in the language of professional and public concern. The tactic often
infuriates ministers.
Macara's criticisms are often echoed whenever doctors discuss the reforms.
The inaugural address of Professor David Morrell, this year's BMA president,
did not contain the ornate allusions of either the Macara or Santer
addresses, but the same messages were there. 'There is, I believe, a very
real risk that some members of our profession will be lured into
market-place medicine. There will be lucrative rewards for those who respond
to the demands of management and redundancy notices for others.'
Is the criticism hitting home? Although Mrs Bottomley's detractors accuse
her of undermining the NHS, she is, like Macara, a passionate admirer of the
health service. If she leaves her post in next week's expected cabinet
reshuffle, she will depart wondering why she was unable to dilute criticism
of the reforms.
Part of the explanation is that, while the BMA's long campaign did not
succeed in dislodging the government from its policy path, it may have
undermined the credibility of the reforms in the eyes of doctors and the
public irreparably. Macara declared at the conference this week that the BMA
was determined to reform the reforms. It might yet.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Japan turns the corner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What should be said to a country generous enough to provide its trading
partners with goods and services worth Dollars 415bn more than it demanded
in return, between 1989 and 1993? A hearty 'thank you' would seem a good
start.
No Japanese politician or official, not even one as inexperienced as the new
socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, expects this from leaders of
the other members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in
Naples this weekend. What he can expect, instead, is a mixture of whining
complaint with grudging approval of his country's efforts to reduce the
amount it invests abroad. President Clinton's support for Japanese plans to
stimulate the economy and increase imports at least falls into the latter
category.
US policymakers seem to have learnt some lessons since the bond markets
started tumbling. A country expected by the OECD to run a current account
deficit of Dollars 141bn this year needs to be careful when insulting the
only significant exporter of capital. The deficit may be only 2.1 per cent
of US gross domestic product, but it is large in the context of global
capital flows.
The realisation of US vulnerability to a Japanese investor strike is
presumably why US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday in Naples
that 'we do want to see a strong dollar'. The concern is not idle.
The 'basic balance' in the Japanese balance of payments, which is the sum of
the current account and net long-term capital flows, was an almost
incredible Dollars 82bn in the first three months of 1994. This has had to
be recycled through short-term private capital flows and official foreign
exchange intervention.
It is hardly surprising that the yen has risen. Neither is it surprising
that Japanese foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply, just as they did
after the Louvre accord in February 1987, by Dollars 34.5bn between March
1993 and April 1994. This is a measure of the efforts of the Japanese to
support the US dollar.
Economic damage
However bitter the US complaints about Japanese trade policy, the
administration has recognised the extent of US-Japanese economic
interdependence. Goldman Sachs argues in a recent paper that even if the
entire US bilateral trade deficit with Japan of Dollars 60bn were to be
eliminated, the net increase in the US wage bill would probably not be more
than Dollars 7bn a year, a mere 0.2 per cent of US personal income. The
damage done to the US economy by a collapsing dollar-yen exchange rate and
soaring domestic interest rates, as Japanese investors retreat hurt, is
certain to exceed that by a considerable margin.
Japanese investors are indeed hurt, since the yen has been revalued by 14
per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year. Such a
revaluation entails a substantial decline in the domestic value of
dollar-denominated assets. Furthermore, the rising yen endangers the
Japanese recovery, by punishing an industrial sector whose output in May was
still 12.8 per cent below its peak of three years earlier.
Sensible policy
The sensible policy is to let the forces of recovery and balance-of-payments
adjustment work their way through the Japanese economy. One such force is
the effects on liquidity of the intervention in foreign exchange markets.
Another is the more positively sloping yield curve. The gap between interest
rates on three-month money and 10-year bonds is now just over 2 percentage
points, double what it was earlier in the year. This will help financial
institutions, weighed down by bad property loans, to recapitalise
themselves, on lines pioneered in the US by the Federal Reserve.
Above all, there are signs of a consumer-led return to economic growth. In
the first quarter of 1994 consumption grew at an annualised rate of 5.8 per
cent, driving an annualised increase of 3.9 per cent in gross domestic
product. The remarkable ability of Japanese companies to sustain employment
during the recession is bound to help sustain consumer confidence, while the
improvement in Japan's terms of trade boosts their purchasing power.
Provided Japan's internationally exposed companies are not punished by
further rises in the yen and it does not implement its planned tax on
domestic consumption soon, the recovery should gather in strength.
Meanwhile, export volume did not rise at all between January 1991 and
January 1994, while import volume rose 9 per cent. Domestic demand-led
recovery should stimulate imports further and bring about a significant
reduction in the trade surplus. Also pressing Japan in that direction is its
surplus on investment income, which reached Dollars 41bn in 1993, almost a
fifth of imports.
The Japanese should continue to support the dollar and push import
liberalisation, in the interests not only of their consumers, but also of
export-oriented manufacturing. As for the US, it needs to cool its rhetoric
and let political and economic forces bring about the changes in Japan that
it seeks.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Something is rotten . . .: FT writers with tales of
corporate embarrassment across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is awry in the soul of corporate Europe. This is the conclusion
that can be drawn from headlines this week with disconcerting implications
for European boardrooms.
Blue-chip groups in several countries have been caught up in allegations of
malpractice, casting a shadow over share prices and corporate images across
the continent.
The reality, however, is not that leading companies in Germany and France -
at the centre of this week's episodes - have been suddenly infected by the
corruption endemic in Italy during the past decade.
Rather, a combination of circumstances - a long and severe recession, a
changing relationship between government and business and a less forgiving
climate in the media and among the judiciary - has conspired to bring
wrongdoing into the open. Mr David Roche of Independent Strategy, the
London-based analysis group, says: 'Europe has been too cosy. Now the cold
winds are blowing. Stones are being turned up and we're finding lots of
maggots underneath.'
The most recent business scandals have occurred in continental Europe. But
the UK, where the recession came earlier, is by no means immune. In contrast
to the Continent, the central figures in large British corporate misdoings
in recent years - the collapse of the Robert Maxwell empire, the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, and Polly Peck International in the early
1990s - have often been 'outsiders', not members of the business
establishment.
Mr Ian Huntingdon, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm,
suggests one reason why scandals directly involving top company figures are
less prevalent in the UK is because management controls are more efficient,
partly because of growing emphasis on non-executive directors.
Mr Dieter Schweer, company news editor at the German economic weekly,
Wirtschaftswoche, points to the importance of the sharp German recession in
1992-93 in casting a spotlight on impropriety: 'The (economic) crisis means
that weaknesses have become obvious. Skeletons which you used to be able to
hide in the balance sheet are now on view.'
Mr Volkert Klaucke, managing partner at the Mees Pierson merchant bank in
Frankfurt, underlines the change of mood in management and in the press.
'What has changed is the way fraud is handled. In the past, it would have
been covered up.' The change reflects, he says, 'the increased
aggressiveness of the press' as well as 'a more open corporate culture' in
Germany, as younger people ascend the corporate ladder.
More rigorous attitudes seem to have been spurred by the uncovering, over
the past three years, of widespread illicit ties between Italian politicians
and business. As Le Soir, the Belgian daily paper, put it in a front-page
editorial on Thursday, the political and business scandals in Belgium
'reflect a new era, in which judges no longer hesitate to question the most
powerful as well as the most humble'. Mr Elie Cohen, a Paris university
professor, says: 'Judges now feel free to investigate companies, while
before they felt it was impossible.'
Mr Rolf Breuer, chairman of the German Stock Exchange and a director of
Deutsche Bank, warns about drawing sweeping conclusions from the reported
spate of misdeeds. 'In Italy, Spain and now in France, management were
involved in corruption, for example bribing civil servants. This is not
comparable with our crop of scandals in Germany.'
However, whatever the reasons for the recent revelations, business is on the
defensive. Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris,
the insurance group, untouched by recent affairs, says: 'You must not put
all of these cases together. They are all separate affairs and, when you
look behind these cases, the issues seem quite small. One cannot infer that
there is something rotten in the state of France.'
Nevertheless, a common economic and political thread joins many of the cases
that have emerged recently. They can be separated into three broad
categories:
Cases where charges against leading business personalities have yet to be
laid, let alone proven, but have still caused embarrassment.
On Monday, Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, France's
third-largest industrial company, was held for more than 12 hours by
magistrates investigating alleged misuse of corporate funds. Mr Suard,
formally placed under investigation, was freed on bail of FFr1m (Pounds
110,000) early on Tuesday. He has denied any wrongdoing, and describes the
investigation as 'a banal non-event'.
Mr Suard's detention followed the imprisonment in Belgium for 12 days during
May of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Schneider
electrical group. He was been freed on bail, but remains under investigation
for alleged fraud concerning two Belgian subsidiaries. He denies the
accusations. Schneider has described his treatment in Belgium as
'outrageous'.
In another controversial case, Mannesmann, the large German engineering
company, on Wednesday decided not to elect Mr Werner Dieter, its outgoing
chief executive, as chairman of its supervisory board. The Dusseldorf state
prosecutor this week started investigating alleged fraud by Mr Dieter, who
is said to have forced a Mannesmann subsidiary to buy hydraulic accessories
at inflated prices from another company largely owned by the Dieter family.
Mr Dieter said yesterday the allegations were 'grotesque'.
Cases of corruption or malpractice that have been under investigation for
some time, but have now reached or are approaching a public denouement. On
Wednesday, Mr Alain Boublil, former chief aide to the late Mr Pierre
Beregevoy, the former French finance minister and prime minister, was
sentenced to two years in jail (one suspended) as a result of his conviction
in an insider trading scandal dating back to 1988.
On Wednesday, Belgian investigators laid fraud charges against the general
manager of SMAP, the country's third-largest insurance company, as well as
his predecessor and a Swiss insurance executive. This stems from
long-running investigations into alleged illegal transactions at SMAP,
including those linked to defence contracts.
On Tuesday, a Milan court began a trial linked to L150bn of bribes allegedly
paid to political parties by the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group. The
32 defendants include Mr Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister, Mr
Umberto Bossi, the founder of the Northern League, Mr Berlusconi's main
coalition partner, and several of Montedison's former top executives. Cases
where top European corporations, although not suspected themselves of acting
improperly, have made serious errors in dealings with clients guilty of
misdeeds. On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced the resignation of four senior
executives following the publication of a critical auditor's report into the
bank's lending to the now-bankrupt Jurgen Schneider property group.
Deutsche Bank has faced unusually widespread criticism over the
near-collapse at the end of last year of the Metallgesellschaft metals
group, in which Deutsche is a big shareholder. After Metallgesellschaft's US
trading subsidiary suffered large losses in oil futures markets, Deutsche
Bank accused Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief executive, of
withholding information from the supervisory board - a charge he refutes.
The Frankfurt banking community has also been hit by a scandal centred on
Balsam, a Bielefeld-based sports flooring manufacturer. Four members of the
Balsam board were arrested last month after its finance director confessed
to a complex fraud involving Procedo, Germany's largest factoring company.
Mr Breuer of Deutsche Bank admits that the three cases throw up a common
question: 'Why didn't we detect them (the problems) earlier?' But he also
points to differences. 'The Metallgesellschaft case was caused by management
not telling the truth early enough (about losses in the oil derivatives
business). Balsam was caused by a crook, and Schneider was a crook too. So
do these three cases tell you a story? I doubt it . . . There are crooks
everywhere.'
However, Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of
Japan in Frankfurt, says the repercussions go deeper. 'The companies came to
grief because someone at the very top did something criminal or
half-criminal.' He worries about German managers' lack of self-criticism.
'It is almost as though people do not dare ask the difficult questions for
fear of bringing down the system.'
Across Europe, investigations into business malpractices are proceeding at
diverging paces. In Spain, long-standing inquiries into financial scandals
involving the ruling Socialist party seem to have picked up momentum. The
judge investigating alleged illegal financing of the Socialist party in the
late 1980s has recently questioned the ex-chairman of Banco Central Hispano,
one of the country's biggest private banks, over a Pounds 1m payment
supposedly routed to the party.
In France, the impression of an accelerating anti-corruption campaign has
been heightened by the investigations into the business affairs of Mr
Bernard Tapie, the Marseilles businessman and MP.
In May, Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former French magistrate, published a
'black book' alleging widespread malpractice in politics and business life.
In France, corruption 'which in the US or the UK would immediately send a
politician into a distant retreat' is tolerated, he claimed, as part of 'our
national folklore'.
One prominent French lawyer links the surge in investigations to the
disappearance of 'the old administrative Jacobin society'. He says French
magistrates have undoubtedly been influenced by Italy's anti-corruption
drive.
In Italy, on the other hand, after the upheavals of the past few years, the
business community has now started to talk about bribery scandals in the
past tense. Magistrates investigating corporate bribery cases are taking a
lower profile, and Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government is examining ways to
clear the backlog of cases, without exonerating the guilty. The proposals,
not yet agreed, could include a form of plea-bargaining linked to the
repayment of bribes.
Mr Sergio Duca, partner with the Italian offshoot of accountants Price
Waterhouse, says Italy's business community could set an example for others.
'Some people are starting to say we (the Italian business community) should
regain a bit of credibility, because we were able to turn round, whereas
other countries haven't yet done it.'
Mr Duca's assessment looks over-optimistic. Yet it underlines that, in the
league table of European business misdeeds, Italy no longer enjoys natural
predominance.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Westminster left with series of puzzles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The week started with Lord Archer looking forward to a long-awaited return
to the Conservative political establishment. It ended with his hopes of
preferment in Mr John Major's ministerial reshuffle apparently in ruins.
Westminster meanwhile was left last night with a series of puzzles.
Conspiracy theorists focused on the decision by the Department of Trade and
Industry to break with precedent and confirm that Lord Archer was indeed the
subject of an investigation into alleged insider dealing. Had it
deliberately ruined his chances?
Others wanted to know why 10 Downing Street had not moved to quell the
mounting speculation in recent weeks that Lord Archer was at last to be
rewarded for his years of dogged performances before the Tory faithful.
Then there was the question of why Lord Archer himself had seemed so
confident that his time had come. Those who have spoken with him in recent
weeks have not been left with the impression of a man fearful of the future.
In retrospect it is clear that Mr Major was unlikely to have been able to
offer a job to the flamboyant novelist and Tory peer - least of all the post
of chairman of the Conservative party which he coveted.
The prime minister has known since February that Lord Archer was one of the
subjects of an inquiry into share dealings in Anglia Television before its
takeover by the media conglomerate MAI. Mr Major could not have given him a
post until the investigation was completed.
The judgment of political friends was that Lord Archer will eventually be
exonerated. No one except a handful of inspectors in the DTI actually knows
whether they are right - and the DTI investigations are incomplete.
Lord Archer has done some less-than-sensible things during his 25 years in
the limelight but he is judged by friends and enemies alike as fundamentally
honest. He has at least Pounds 20m in the bank and as much again promised
for his next batch of novels.
So there was no obvious reason why he should throw away his reputation by
dealing himself or passing on tips on the basis of inside information. Nor
is Lady Archer an obvious candidate for the role of secrets trader from the
Anglia boardroom. Yesterday Lord Archer decided to say nothing to the
journalists staking out his Thameside penthouse apartment. But his demeanour
over previous days had suggested he was convinced the investigation would
not prevent him from being given a job in the government.
Yesterday the DTI appeared unable to explain convincingly why - with the
explicit approval of Mr Michael Heseltine - it had so publicly dashed that
dream. The most likely thought offered by officials was that if the
department had refused to confirm reports already circulating in the City,
the government would have been accused of a cover-up. Mr Major could not
afford another 'sleaze' story.
Equally, it would have been entirely improper for the prime minister's
office to have discussed the investigation - or its implications for the
reshuffle - with Lord Archer.
It is a cliff-hanging ending. The question is whether the result of the DTI
probe will come before or after the re-shuffle.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Insurer reviews 'unfair' reference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, the insurance company, is reviewing a negative reference it
issued for one of its former sales agents after the document led to him
losing his new job.
The review follows a complaint to the company by Mr Matthew Lacey that the
reference was unfair and based on false information.
Mr Lacey was sacked from Scottish Widows, another insurance company, last
December, after the company received the reference in confidence from
Standard Life.
Standard Life decided to reconsider the reference ahead of this week's
ruling by the House of Lords that employers have a duty to take reasonable
care in issuing references.
The judgment clears the way for people to sue their former companies on the
grounds of negligence if they believe incorrect references have damaged
their ability to work.
Standard Life, based in Edinburgh, said yesterday: 'We have contacted Mr
Lacey and are still examining the case.' It said its normal policy was to
give people 'fair and honest' references. It was difficult to say what
relevance the ruling had in this case.
Mr Lacey said: 'My main aim is to clear my name so that if I want to I could
work in the insurance industry again.' He had been distressed to lose his
job at Scottish Widows and was studying the legal implications of the
affair.
Mr Lacey worked for Barton Lyle, a London-based company which sells life
products and pensions on behalf of Standard Life, until last autumn.
He then moved to Scottish Widows where he worked for just two months until
he was sacked after the company received the reference, based on information
from one of Mr Lacey's former clients implying he had behaved unethically.
The former insurance agent is now working for a funeral company in London.
Mr Duncan MacKechnie, assistant general manager at Scottish Widows, said the
company had had little option but to sack Mr Lacey after it received the
reference. This was because of life-industry regulations which were designed
to ensure that sales agents who had behaved unethically in previous jobs
would not be allowed to work in the industry.
The company said yesterday it could not comment further on the implications
for Scottish Widows of the Standard Life review.

FT  09 JUL 94 / DTI under fire for revealing Archer probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory backbenchers were astonished yesterday that the Department of Trade and
Industry had broken long-standing guidelines and revealed that it was
investigating allegations of insider dealing against Lord Archer.
Many wanted an explanation from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, as to why he had decided to reveal that the peer was under
investigation.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, said the timing seemed
'extraordinary' with a cabinet reshuffle near.
Another incensed rightwing Tory MP described the DTI's decision as 'a breach
of natural justice'. He said: 'I think it's outrageous. If Jeffrey Archer's
comments are to be believed, there is simply no case against him.'
But asked whether Mr Heseltine could be subjected to intense questioning
over the issue, he said: 'I can't see there is a mood for that. It will just
be seen as poor old Jeffrey in more trouble rather than a problem for the
DTI.'
Lord Clinton-Davies, a former Labour industry minister, said it was 'an
extraordinary departure from practice' and 'murky' to release Lord Archer's
name when other people under investigation remained anonymous. Mr John
Watts, Tory chairman of the Treasury committee, said: 'I think it would be
right for the DTI to explain how and why it came to name an individual who
it is investigating. That is out of the ordinary.'
Meanwhile, Mr John Major, arriving in Naples for the G7 summit of leading
industrial nations, said he sympathised with his close friend Lord Archer,
but refused to comment on the DTI investigation.
'One always feels for an old friend. But I am not going to comment. There is
an investigation going on,' he said. 'The investigation should proceed. It
would be wrong for me to say anything beyond that.'
Sir Norman Fowler, the departing Tory party chairman, was among those
insisting that Lord Archer should not be criticised before a judgment had
been delivered.
He said: 'The only point that has been confirmed is that an investigation is
taking place. That does not imply guilt.'
Lord Parkinson, the former Tory party chairman, said the timing of the
announcement 'could not have been worse from Jeffrey Archer's point of view'
with the cabinet reshuffle looming. 'He must feel very aggrieved,' he said.
'It would be very difficult to promote him into a job with this hanging over
him.'
Others believed that Lord Archer's hopes of getting a government post had
been modest all along. 'If the DTI's statement was an attempt to scupper
Jeffrey's chances of the Tory chairmanship it was a waste of time,' said a
senior Tory official. 'He really had no chance at all.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Record exports help trade gap fall to Pounds 803m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's visible trade deficit declined sharply to Pounds 803m in April,
from Pounds 1.21bn in March, according to figures released by the Central
Statistical Office yesterday.
However half the reduction was due to an improvement in trade in erratic
items, such as precious stones and aircraft. If oil and erratics are
excluded, April's deficit was Pounds 1.46bn, only slightly down from March's
Pounds 1.53bn.
Exports rose by 2.5 per cent between March and April to reach a new record
of Pounds 11.09bn, while imports fell 1 per cent to Pounds 11.89bn.
Over the three months to April, the deficit was Pounds 2.93bn, compared with
Pounds 3.7bn in the previous three months.
The opening of new fields in the North Sea has boosted oil production in
recent months and helped the UK achieve a Pounds 408m surplus in oil in
April, the highest monthly figure since August 1987. Exports of food,
beverages and tobacco and of fuels reached record levels in April.
The CSO estimates that the trend in both exports and imports is a rise of 1
per cent a month, with the deficit narrowing. The trend in volume terms is
favourable for the UK, with exports rising by 1 1/2 per cent per month, and
imports by 1 per cent.
Analysts gave the figures a cautious welcome. Mr Simon Whitehouse, of James
Capel, said that while it was 'encouraging that the underlying deficit at
least remained stable in April a marked deterioration is in prospect over
the coming months as UK domestic demand growth continues to outpace that in
our major European export markets'.
The UK's trade figures are now compiled using two different methods. Trade
with non-European Union countries is calculated from customs returns, as
before. The figures for trade with non-EU countries in May have already been
published.
Trade with EU countries is gathered under the Intrastat system, based on
value added tax returns, and takes longer to assemble. Hence yesterday's
published figures for whole world trade relate only to April. Doubts have
been raised about the accuracy of the Intrastat system, particularly when it
comes to recording imports.
The deficit with EU countries in April was Pounds 310m, down from a revised
Pounds 527m in March. Exports to the EU in April were at record levels. The
CSO said that growth was particularly strong in the Benelux countries.
Imports from the EU fell in April. However, EU imports in the three months
to April were 4.8 per cent higher than in the previous three months. The CSO
said that about half of the recent growth in EU imports came from Germany.
Revisions to figures in the first three months of the year increased the
deficit with EU countries by Pounds 89m, the CSO said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for a Pounds 30m leisure complex in the eastern suburbs of Belfast
were yesterday granted outline planning permission by the Department of the
Environment, Tim Coone writes.
The project, dubbed locally as 'Ulster Disneyland', will be built on a
100-acre site surrounding the Dungannon Ice Bowl, already a leading leisure
centre, and will be the biggest project of its kind in Northern Ireland.
It will include theme parks, 'white-knuckle' rides, a golf course and
driving range, adventure playground, parkland and water sports.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party and a
member of Castlereagh Borough Council, which will be part-funding the
project, welcomed the planning decision.
Most of the project finance is to come from European Union structural funds
and private-sector developers.

FT  09 JUL 94 / BT nears evenings work deal: Engineers set to change shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical new working-time arrangements which will make British
Telecommunications engineers available to customers in the evenings, early
mornings and Saturdays, are likely to be accepted by union members over the
next few weeks.
The proposals, which have been negotiated for more than a year, would mean
four- or even three-day weeks for engineers who volunteered for the most
anti-social weekend shifts.
Engineers would continue to work a 37 1/2 -hour week but instead of normal
hours being 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, the shift pattern (for which
overtime would not be payable) would become 7.30am to 7.30pm Monday to
Saturday.
Working the new shift times will be voluntary, but both sides seem confident
that there will be enough volunteers attracted.
An official of the NCU communications union said: 'There are drawbacks with
the new system but a lot of people will be thinking about how empty the golf
course is on Tuesday compared with Saturday.'
The union wants a more unequivocal commitment that the changes will be
voluntary and that there will be an across-the-board reduction in hours to
36 a week.
However union officials say that BT has moved some distance in negotiations
over the new system - called the Customer Service Improvement Programme -
and that there is now a much wider range of options for staff.
The negotiations, covering 27,000 engineers, are at a sensitive stage and
neither BT nor the National Communications Union wants to discuss them in
public. BT has, however, agreed to offer an inducement of Pounds 1,000 for
those who opt for weekend work and Pounds 400 for those who do early morning
or evening shifts.
BT had said that those payments are dependent upon endorsement of the
package by the NCU executive. It now seems probable that the NCU will not
back the deal, which is extremely unpopular with some branches, but neither
will it recommend rejecting it.
BT is determined to get the deal, which will mean less inconvenience for
domestic customers. Competition from Mercury and other telephone companies
is becoming more intense and BT may therefore turn a blind eye to the
union's non-committal position.
The NCU is not recognised by Mercury but a delegation from the union
recently presented a formal request for representation. Mercury managers
said that the proposal would be put to the board and the union would be
informed of the response before the end of June. No response has been made
yet.
The NCU has agreed to recommend a 2.9 per cent pay offer for its
100,000-plus members in BT. The Union of Communication Workers has also
agreed to recommend acceptance of the same offer for its 10,000 members.

FT  09 JUL 94 / AT&amp;T to be granted telecoms licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition in the UK telecommunications market is set to intensify
following an announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, that he intends to grant a telecoms licence to AT&amp;T, the largest
US operator.
A draft licence will be issued next week, and is likely to be followed by a
full licence before the autumn, allowing AT&amp;T to provide services throughout
the UK.
The business sector, which last year accounted for more than half of the
telecom industry's Pounds 15bn revenue, will be the main beneficiary. AT&amp;T
said it would offer a service to the 450 large multinationals based in the
UK as soon as its licence permitted.
Mr Merrill Tutton, AT&amp;T's UK president, said: 'Our priority is the
multinationals, but we intend to reach small and medium-sized businesses
before long.'
The licence will allow AT&amp;T to build its own infrastructure, but with the
growth in infrastructure provision since the abolition of the British
Telecommunications/Mercury duopoly in 1991 it is thought unlikely that the
company will seek to construct its own dedicated network.
Mr Tutton said: 'There is a lot of high-quality capacity available, and we
have been in discussion with most of the operators.'
Mr Heseltine's decision follows a year-long consideration of AT&amp;T's
application by the Department of Trade and Industry. It turned largely on
reciprocal terms of access for UK operators seeking entry to the US market,
and follows the decision of US regulatory authorities last month to clear
the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) alliance between BT and MCI, the
second-largest US operator.
To allay concerns about AT&amp;T's equipment procurement policy - the US company
is an integrated equipment supplier and service operator - the draft licence
is believed to require it to show that its procurement is fair and open.
AT&amp;T already has a substantial presence in the UK, including more than 6,000
employees. Its Istel subsidiary supplies data communications and IT
services, with offices across Europe. The appointment to the UK last year of
Mr Tutton, formerly responsible for AT&amp;T's consumer services in the US,
signalled the company's desire to develop the UK market.
However, AT&amp;T has failed to forge an alliance with a leading UK telecoms
operator, which some analysts believe is essential if it is to make a rapid
impact. Talks with Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid about to
launch a long-distance network, broke down earlier this year.
Mercury, the main competitor to BT, drew back last month from joining AT&amp;T's
Worldsource international venture, in spite of the decision of Unisource, a
joint venture of the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national operators, to join.
A survey of more than 1,000 UK corporate telecoms users last November by the
Telecommunications Users Association rated AT&amp;T above BT as a supplier. The
users believed the US company had the 'strongest set of credentials' to
compete in the UK, and was rated above BT on three out of five performance
indicators. Although user perceptions depended to some extent on reputation
alone, the association said a large proportion of respondents had already
dealt with the US operator.

FT  09 JUL 94 / European plug plan 'puts 1,350 jobs at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest maker of electrical plugs and sockets warned this week
that the adoption of European standards could mean a 'dramatic shift' to Far
East production, with the possible loss of 90 per cent of its 1,500 UK
manufacturing jobs.
Mr Malcolm Mullins, technical executive of MK Electric, told a meeting of
the Institution of Electrical Engineers that another option for the company
would be to stop plug production altogether.
Unless the UK applies for an exemption, the system of 13-amp plugs and
sockets is under threat from a proposed 'plug for Europe' with two round
pins.
Documents describing the new system will be sent in September to 18 European
countries and will be voted on standards authorities.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Heavy truck sales surge as construction recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of heavy rigid trucks, used almost exclusively by the construction
industry, leaped by two-thirds in the first half of this year, providing
further evidence of accelerating recovery in a key economic sector.
Such vehicles represent the fastest-growing area of demand, in percentage
terms, for truckmakers.
But recovery in commercial vehicle sales now covers 'all sectors from light
vans through to trucks and artics', according to Mr Roger King, spokesman
for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
He was commenting on SMMT statistics showing that total commercial vehicles
sales in June jumped by 24.1 per cent, to 18,286 from 14,735 in the same
month last year.
They lifted the total for this year's first half by 14.56 per cent to
111,370 compared with 97,217 in the first half of 1993.
The commercial vehicle market has now enjoyed six consecutive months of
growth. Previously it had reported endurance of its steepest recession since
the second world war.
Total sales plunged by 47 per cent between the record in 1989 of 370,000 and
last year's 197,000.
The truck sector was worst affected, registrations of vehicles over 3.5
tonnes falling by 55 per cent between 1989 and 1992, when it hit a 40-year
low of 31,000 units. It was the only commercial vehicle sector to rise last
year, to 36,000 units.
Mr Chris Thorneycroft, marketing support director of truck market leader
Iveco Ford Truck, said yesterday it should rise to about 42,000 in the
current year.
However, the recovery is sucking in more imports. Their share of the market
was 41.4 per cent in June, up from 38.3 a year ago, and 42.6 in the first
half compared with the 1993 period which was 39.7 per cent.
Registrations of light vans (mainly derived from cars) jumped by 45.6 per
cent last month, to 5,581 from 3,832 the previous June. Panel vans rose by
15 per cent to 8,093 from 7,038. Trucks over 3.5 tonnes rose by 22.8 per
cent to 3,602 from 2,933.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Gas regulator may act to widen competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, will use her powers to
introduce wider competition if the government fails to put forward
legislation to deregulate the gas market.
She told the Financial Times she has the power to lower the present 2,500
therm-a-year threshold, below which British Gas is the monopoly supplier to
a customer.
Parliament would still need to approve such a scheme, which would leave
British Gas as the sole holder of a public gas supply licence.
Ms Spottiswoode was speaking as senior gas industry figures stepped up
pressure on ministers to renew their commitment to gas deregulation amid
fears the timetable for introducing competition in gas supply may be
slipping.
Legislation to pave the way for the reform is thought not to have been
included in the list of core bills for the autumn agreed by the cabinet last
week, raising the prospect the measure may not be placed before MPs until
parliament's 1995-96 session. Such a delay would make it difficult for the
passage of the bill to be secured in time to implement proposals to open 5
per cent of the gas supply market in 1996.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, unveiled the plan last
December, saying the gas market should be opened up to full competition by
1998.
Ms Spottiswoode has urged politicians to 'make some statements pretty fast'
to counter the growing impression that government support for deregulation
is fading.
She told the FT she was 'not surprised' there could be problems in including
a gas bill in the next legislative programme because of the complexity of
some other bills.
But she said any delay would need to be accompanied by a strong statement of
support from a broad range of ministers in order to encourage independent
gas marketers to make the necessary investments.
'It is very difficult for industry to live with the current uncertainty
because they need to make early investment decisions,' she said.
These include commitments to develop new North Sea gas fields as well as
investment in the information technology systems which need to be in place
before companies can compete in the domestic market of 18m households.
Ms Spottiswoode warned that any delay in legislation could cause companies
to 'lose heart' and withdraw from discussions to develop the detailed
network code that will be 'profoundly important' to the structure of the
industry.
If the threshold for allowing competition were lowered this would burden the
company with the social obligations.
It would also limit the degree to which the corporation could restructure
its operations, in effect barring it from divesting its trading operation
for the transportation and storage business.
Royal assent for a bill could still in theory be obtained in time to permit
the government's plans to go ahead on schedule even if it was not tabled
until 1995-96. But debating time at the start of the parliamentary year has
become scarce since the Budget was moved to November.
The government could in theory press on with deregulation without primary
legislation. But a bill is required to ensure that consumer safeguards are
maintained.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel action over duty-free on ferries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the company which operates the Channel tunnel, yesterday won
permission from a High Court judge to challenge duty-free sales on
cross-Channel ferries and on aircraft.
Mr Justice Tucker said it was 'a matter of very considerable public interest
and importance'. Eurotunnel hopes for the judicial review to take place
later this year, although a final judgment from the European Court could
take until 1996.
The company wants the courts to declare that the continuation of duty-free
sales on cross-border journeys within the European Union is unlawful under
the Single European Act.
The EU had intended to abolish duty-free sales in January 1993 - but
lobbying by the UK government led to their being extended until 1999. The
duty-free concession does not extend to trains travelling through the
tunnel, placing Eurotunnel at a competitive disadvantage compared with the
ferries, the company says.
Eurotunnel has built duty-free shops at its terminals in Folkestone and
Calais, but these require travellers to make a detour. The ferries are able
to subsidise their fares from their takings from duty-free sales, the
company says.
Mr David Vaughan, QC, for Eurotunnel, told the judge the duty-free trade
represented a loss of Pounds 600m a year in excise duty and value added tax.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Man from Auntie goes on global mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday, with no fanfare, the BBC launched its 24-hour television news
service for Japan. The English-language channel, delivered by satellite with
four hours a day of translation into Japanese, has been created in
partnership with Nissho Iwai, a Japanese trading and publishing company.
Two weeks earlier, just as quietly, the BBC launched an Arabic-language
service aimed at the Middle East. The satellite service is initially
broadcasting for just two hours a day but will build up to a 24-hour service
before the end of the year. The BBC is supplying the service under contract
to Orbit Communications, a Rome-based subsidiary of Marawed, the Saudi
Arabian trading group.
The BBC had been expanding around the world with private-sector partners for
some time before the government formally endorsed an international
commercial role in Wednesday's white paper on the future of the corporation.
The white paper not only underpinned all existing BBC services, but proposed
that the corporation should have a new 10-year royal charter to run from
1997, with the continuation of the licence fee guaranteed until 2001. That
too will almost certainly be a 10-year commitment.
But the government has ambitions for the BBC beyond continuing to serve its
domestic audiences. The white paper says: 'The government believes the BBC
should be able to evolve into an international multi-media enterprise,
building on its present commercial services for audiences in this country
and overseas.'
Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general and chairman of BBC Worldwide, a
new organisation which brings together the corporation's commercial and
international activities, is clear on both the opportunities and their
limits. 'There is no plan to turn ourselves into a Time Warner or any of the
great organisations like that. The aim is to build on assets produced for
the domestic market and find ways of delivering them more effectively,
packaged and presented in a different way,' he said.
The BBC's commercial enterprises - which range from programme sales and
magazines, such as the Radio Times, to videos and books - produced Pounds
66.6m to reinvest in programmes in the year to March - up 12 per cent on the
year.
Over the next 10 years Mr Phillis believes it may be possible to increase
that sum to Pounds 200m - a significant sum but still dwarfed by the licence
fee, which last year raised Pounds 1.6bn.
Apart from regional television news there are no plans to produce programmes
specifically for international markets.
The BBC will be monitored by the government to ensure that its commercial
activities are not subsidised by either the licence fee or by the government
grants that fund the World Service. The first step was reorganising the
structure of the Corporation's activities which, Mr Phillis believes, were
not sufficiently co-ordinated in the past.
Under BBC Worldwide there are three separate directorates: BBC World Service
for radio, television - bringing together both programme sales and
international broadcasting - and publishing.
They will be organised into six regional groups: Europe; the former Soviet
Union and south-west Asia; the Americas; Africa and the Middle East; south
Asia and Asia-Pacific.
The expansion of World Service Television will be funded mainly through
private partnerships such as the new Japanese and Middle East services, with
the BBC providing the programmes and expertise and the private partner
providing the capital. The service lost Pounds 5m last year but is expected
to break even this year.
The next big step will be the launch before the end of this year of two
satellite television services aimed at the European market - a news channel
and an entertainment channel. Pearson, the media group which owns the
Financial Times, is expected to put up a considerable proportion of the
capital required. Investment will be on a project-by-project basis and will
include other private-sector organisations.
The BBC also hopes to launch one or two channels on US cable networks next
year and has had talks with Cox, the Atlanta-based media group.
However, the BBC will face competition in areas such as international news
from CNN, the US cable network, while English-language channels will face
the problem of being minority channels in non-English speaking countries.
The BBC will also be examining new interactive services and the education
and language tuition market.
Mr Phillis said: 'There are all sorts of possibilities which we are just
beginning to explore. The whole basis of our approach is the realistic,
step-by-step taking of opportunities as and when they arise.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Out-of-town shopping centre policy faces test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government resistance to out-of-town shopping centres is to be tested
following a Court of Appeal decision to block a Pounds 200m development next
to the Manchester Ship Canal.
Recent planning guidance issued to local authorities by Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, shows the government has changed its attitude on the
desirability of out-of-town centres since the development at Dumplington was
given the go-ahead last March.
Local authorities opposing the scheme claimed that when planning permission
was granted last year, following a public inquiry in 1988, Mr Michael
Howard, then environment secretary, failed to consider changed
circumstances.
The authorities, led by Manchester City Council, told the court that
development by Peel Holdings would increase traffic pollution and harm
town-centre shops.
The court found that Mr Howard had failed to provide adequate reasons for
granting planning permission. It concluded that his reasoning had been so
unclear on a wide range of issues that he had either acted outside his
powers or to the substantial prejudice of the objecting authorities. Both
were grounds for quashing his decision.
However, it gave leave for an early appeal to the House of Lords, which Peel
said it would take advantage of.
The airing of the issue could prove embarrassing to the Department of the
Environment whose recent planning-guidance notes to local authorities
discourages developments which require people to travel.
Mr John Adams, an associate partner specialising in retail developments at
Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors, said the most likely outcome would be a
further public inquiry if the Lords reject the appeal.
He added that local demand for retail space would increase strongly over the
next 10 years. A further inquiry would delay development by up to another 18
months.
The share price of Peel Holdings yesterday fell 31p to 312p - a decline of 9
per cent. The 300-acre Dumplington site was the subject of a bitter
three-year takeover battle for the Manchester Ship Canal won by Mr John
Whittaker, chairman of Peel Holdings in 1987.
The canal company's separate Stock Exchange quotation was absorbed into
Peel's last year after a blocking minority of shareholders - led by Mr
Nicholas Berry - agreed to be bought out for Pounds 30 a share. Of that,
Pounds 7 was in Pounds 1 negotiable loan coupons, redeemable on
Dumplington's development, or in 1998, whichever came first.
Even if the company is eventually successful, it is unlikely it would be
able to start building in 1997 as planned. This could have implications for
the extension of Manchester's new tram system to Salford Quays, Trafford
Park and eventually to Dumplington, which Peel was going to help pay for.

FT  09 JUL 94 / BBC programming to get extra Pounds 180m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is setting up a programme strategy fund to channel Pounds 180m in
extra finance into programmes over two years.
The money, to come from savings and increased efficiency, is in addition to
an extra Pounds 75m which has already been allocated to the main
programme-making directorates.
The fund is being created to ensure that the additional money goes to areas
and types of programming which need strengthening.
Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said: 'Every single area of programming
will benefit but a lot of it is going to go into expanding the amount of
drama on BBC 1.' The BBC admitted yesterday that the corporation had 'a long
history of under-performance' in popular drama, and cited disappointing
programmes such as Grushko, a detective series set in Russia.
The fund, which will have Pounds 60m to spend in the next financial year and
Pounds 120m in 1996-97, was announced yesterday by Mr Birt as the
corporation published its report and accounts for 1993-94 and made one of
its new, more detailed reports on performance.
In addition to the extra cash, the BBC said savings would also allow an
increase in capital expenditure.
The accounts show that the highest-paid member of the BBC board of
management - almost certainly Mr Birt - received Pounds 266,783 in 1993-94,
including a performance-related bonus payment of Pounds 16,000 and a pension
payment of Pounds 28,062. Last year the highest-paid member - presumably Sir
Michael Checkland, the former director-general  - earned Pounds 180,721.
One of the main sources of savings of more than Pounds 100m a year has come
from 'producer choice' - the system of allowing producers to buy services
outside.
BBC programme-makers have continued to carry out 90 per cent of their
business with BBC Resources but full costing has led to a fall in demand
from some services and there was a net loss of 700 jobs in the resources
department over the year.
Further gains came from cutting evasion of potential licence fee income from
8 per cent to 7.2 per cent and reducing the cost of collection from 5.8 per
cent of licence fee income to 5.3 per cent. A Pounds 30m contingency fund to
cover the first year of 'producer choice' was not needed.
The BBC had total licence fee income in the year to March of Pounds 1.6bn
and an operating surplus of Pounds 122m before restructuring costs of Pounds
53m. Last year there was an operating surplus of Pounds 5m after
restructuring costs of about Pounds 100m. Borrowings were reduced to Pounds
63m.
As part of the review of the BBC's activities Mr Birt recently spent 20 days
visiting all parts of the corporation. He said: 'You come back from a
journey like that and feel pretty cheerful about what is happening in the
BBC.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Scots power group attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power, the privatised utility which supplies southern Scotland, was
yesterday criticised by its consumer watchdog for not passing on more of the
financial benefits of privatisation to its customers.
The Southern Scotland electricity consumers' committee said that the 2 per
cent reduction in Scottish Power's 1994-95 tariffs was little more than it
was obliged to make to conform with the electricity regulator's formula.
The committee said it had urged Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, to tighten the formula to 'ensure that the financial benefits of
privatisation be extended to the consumer in whose interests the industry
has been privatised'.
Professor Thomas Carberry, chairman, claimed that Scottish Power made a 41.5
per cent profit on the turnover of its electricity supply business in
1993-94. It said it expected Scottish Power's shareholders to be the main
beneficiaries, but said it would be 'prudent' if the consumers were also to
benefit.
He regretted that the extension last year of competition in electricity
supply to customers taking more that 100kw a year had led to only 4 per cent
of Scottish Power's former customers switching suppliers.
Most electricity companies, he said, had 'set out to corral their customers
by offering discounts which . . . were modest'. More effort should have been
made to alert them to their freedom to choose their supplier.
Mr Duncan Whyte, Scottish Power's joint chief operating officer, rejected
the committee's criticism. Tariffs had fallen 4.8 per cent in real terms
since privatisation in 1991 and were among the lowest in the UK.
British Coal has received Pounds 3.24m in government subsidies for coal sold
to the power-generation companies over and above its long-term supply
contracts. The subsidy arrangement was put in place after the 1992 coal
crisis.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Rollercoaster computer failure to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US electronics expert is due in Blackpool today to investigate why two
computerised safety features on the world's highest rollercoaster apparently
failed on Thursday, resulting in 26 passengers requiring hospital treat-ment
after two trains collided.
Blackpool Pleasure Beach, the privately held company which owns the
rollercoaster, said it had told Arrow Dynamics, the US company which
designed the ride, that it needed assurances that no further accidents could
occur.
The rollercoaster, which officially opened last week, will remain closed
until assurances have been given.
The company said the accident occurred when two trains collided at the end
of the ride. One train stopped shortly before it reached the end instead of
gliding into the disembarkation point. The rollercoaster's computer system
should have prevented this from happening, the company said.
The computer system should then have stopped the train behind. It did not do
so, however, and the second train ran into the first at 7mph, about 15 feet
above the ground.
The company accepted that as the ride is 235 feet high, with a top speed of
85 mph, the accident could have been far worse.
The collision is a serious embarrassment to Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which
is Britain's biggest free tourist attraction and drew 6.75m visitors last
year. This year Blackpool is celebrating the centenary of its tower.
The rollercoaster, which is so high that it has aircraft warning beacons and
required the approval of the Civil Aviation Authority, was intended to be
the resort's biggest attraction. The English Tourist Board designated 1994
the Year of the Rollercoaster in its honour.
First Leisure, the company which owns Blackpool tower, said it hoped the
accident would not cast a pall over the centenary celebrations. It added,
however, that it did not think it would result in fewer people visiting
Blackpool this summer.
The rollercoaster is called the Pepsi Max Big One and is sponsored by the US
soft drinks company. Pepsi said yesterday: 'We are concerned to learn of the
accident. We are in contact with the directors of Blackpool Pleasure Beach
and are awaiting the results of the investigation.'
Blackpool Pleasure Beach said two passengers on the ride were still in
hospital yesterday. Officials from the Health and Safety Executive had begun
interviewing staff about the incident.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Venezuela nears the economic void
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The day after Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera announced a series of
drastic economic measures last week, a Caracas newspaper, Economia Hoy, ran
a cartoon on its front page depicting the president and his minister of
finance, Mr Julio Sosa, walking confidently along a plank that ended in a
great void after one more step.
'How are we doing?' the president asks.
'We're doing just fine,' replies the minister, who is the government's
economic policy chief.
Although the Caldera administration may not have found the cartoon amusing,
it summed up the feelings of many Venezuelan and foreign businessmen.
The measures announced by Mr Caldera on June 27 included controls on all
foreign exchange transactions and a temporary halt to foreign exchange
trading.
Many importers are frantic and business people, but not the government, are
predicting that there will be shortages of manufactured items and finished
products from overseas.
The administration decreed exchange controls in an effort to halt a rapid
decline in foreign reserves that began early this year. Mr Antonio Casas,
president of the central bank, said monetary reserves at the end of June
were Dollars 8.9bn (Pounds 5.9bn), or down 29.6 per cent from the end of
December 1993 and now equivalent to around 11 months of imports.
The government plans to set the single, official exchange rate at 170
Venezuelan bolivars per dollar next week, down from 200:Dollars 1 on the
last day of open trading. Businesses desperate for dollars during the week
paid as high as 270, according to one press report.
At 200 per dollar, the bolivar has been devalued by 47 per cent since the
beginning of this year, compared with a 25 per cent devaluation for all of
1993.
If that were not bad enough, delays in establishing the new control system
have meant that, as of yesterday, the entire country - with more than 20m
inhabitants and an economy that depends heavily on imports - has been
without any normal foreign exchange activities at banks and exchange houses
for two weeks.
'The economy will be on crutches in a few months unless the government gets
imports moving again quickly,' commented one foreign executive in Caracas.
'Government officials are trying to keep everyone calm, promising that there
will be no shortages. But with this administration's record, it looks like
we'll be in real trouble.'
Economists say the country's recession, already in its second year, will be
worsened this year by import delays. In 1993, Venezuela had merchandise
imports of over Dollars 11bn, compared with exports of Dollars 14.2bn.
Imports during the first four months of this year were already down by 32
per cent over the same period in 1993.
This is serious for an economy that imports nearly half of its food for
humans and farm animals, and whose manufacturing plant relies more on
imported raw materials and intermediate goods than some of its neighbours
do. Inventories of some industrial inputs are already running low, and one
of the country's largest vehicle assemblers has not sold any vehicles to
dealers since exchange controls were announced.
The company, and others that rely on a high percentage of imported
components, simply does not know what exchange rate it can legally apply to
a unit that costs, for example, Dollars 20,000.
Mr Jorge Redmond, president of Conindustria, Venezuela's largest association
of manufacturers, warned that government delays in laying out the exchange
control plan would create serious problems for industry and for the supply
of goods to the public.
'Exchange controls are fine for the government, since it can replenish its
international reserves,' an American banker commented. 'But while the
government is counting its reserves, the private sector and the economy are
suffering.'
The real delay in resuming foreign exchange transactions may last even
longer - perhaps a month. The central bank plans to resume US dollar sales
under the new control system on July 11. Moreover, officials say that it
will take around 10 days (presumably, 10 business days) between the time a
qualified importer applies for dollars and the time he actually receives
them.
This is an optimistic projection for a traditionally sluggish bureaucracy.
To make things worse, one press report yesterday warned that the official
re-initiation of dollar sales might be delayed beyond next Monday.
Foreign exchange trading, suspended on June 28, was supposed to have been
resumed on July 6. This failed to happen, however, because the government
and the central bank had not yet worked out the details of the new foreign
exchange control programme.

Peru has retained its position as Latin America's most dynamic economy in
the first five months of this year, with growth rates that have outstripped
expectations, including those of the government.
The government said the economy grew by an annual rate of 11.8 per cent in
the first five months of the year, compared with growth forecasts of 4 to 5
per cent for 1994 as a whole.
The expansion is in most sectors, but has been marked in fishing, with
catches a third higher than last year - when they were also good following a
downturn in 1991 and 1992. Peru is the world's third largest fishing nation
and the leader in fishmeal exports.
This year, the industry expects to exceed 1993's 1.13m tonnes of fishmeal
exports by some 20 per cent.

FT  09 JUL 94 / OECD guidelines seek to avert double tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading industrialised countries have agreed in principle on draft
guidelines intended to discourage double taxation of multinational
companies' profits and to avert international conflicts between tax
authorities.
The guidelines, published yesterday in a report by the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, lay down principles
for treating companies' transfer pricing methods.
They follow controversy over efforts by some tax authorities to maximise
revenues by, for example, taxing local subsidiaries on their parent
companies' worldwide profits.
The OECD report strongly condemns such 'unitary' taxation methods, one of
whose best known practitioners is the state of California. Last month, the
US Supreme Court upheld California's rules after a legal challenge by
Barclays Bank.
The report says unitary taxation disregards market conditions and is
inflexible, arbitrary and imprecise. It says that it also imposes an
'intolerable' administrative burden on companies.
The guidelines, drawn up in consultation with leading multinational
companies, including IBM, Shell and Unilever, are due to take effect next
June. Unusually, the OECD has invited public comment on them before they are
finalised.
Though they will initially apply only to the central governments of the
OECD's 25 members, it is hoped that they will eventually be adopted by other
countries and by state and local governments.
The guidelines are based on the 'arm's length' principle that related
enterprises within a multinational company be treated for tax purposes as if
they were separate businesses, so as to ensure that only profits earned in a
particular country or state are taxed.
The report recommends that the principle should be implemented by using
transaction-based methods, such as examining comparable prices in
independent companies.
It says authorities should use profit comparisons, to determine whether a
multinational company is paying its fair share of taxes in their
jurisdictions, only as a last resort, when transaction-based methods are not
practicable. The guidelines set limits for the use of profit comparisons.
The final version of the US rules, published this month, give multinational
companies greater freedom in the ways they determine transfer prices and are
broadly consistent with the OECD draft guidelines.

Muddy floodwaters cover the streets of downtown Montezuma, Georgia,
yesterday as the remnants of tropical storm Alberto drenched the state for a
fourth day, leaving damage estimated at over Dollars 100m. At least 19
people were reported to have died in Georgia and another in Alabama. The
city of Albany, 175 miles south of Atlanta along the swollen Flint River,
evacuated some 15,000 people to higher ground as coffins floated in

FT  09 JUL 94 / Jobs figures put Fed under pressure: Improved employment
statistics raise fears of tighter monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The publication yesterday of stronger than expected employment figures put
renewed pressure on the US Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest
rates.
The Labour Department said non-farm payroll employment rose 379,000 in June,
well above Wall Street projections of an increase of about 280,000.
Officials, however, said some of the increase could reflect distortions -
labour markets are particularly fluid in early summer as many temporary
positions are created.
In another sign of economic strength the unemployment rate (which is based
on a survey of households rather than employers) held steady at 6 per cent
last month. After a seemingly erratic decline in the jobless rate from 6.4
per cent in April to 6.0 per cent in May, most analysts had expected a
rebound to about 6.2 per cent.
Bond prices fell sharply in early trading on fears that monetary policy
might need to be tightened again to prevent rapid economic growth eventually
putting upward pressure on inflation.
Earlier this week the Fed concluded a two-day policy meeting without
signalling an increase in rates - despite other signs of economic vitality
and the dollar's continuing weakness on foreign exchange markets. The Fed's
failure to move prompted speculation that it believed economic growth was
decelerating of its own accord, justifying a 'wait and see' attitude on
rates.
Between February and May, the Fed raised short-term rates by 1 1/4
percentage points to 4 1/4 per cent, a level that it described as close to
'neutrality' - meaning that it represented neither an expansionary nor a
contractionary monetary policy. After this week's meeting it appeared that
the Fed wanted to wait and see what effect these earlier rate increases
would have, before tightening again.
That may still be its preferred approach, but the strength of the employment
data is likely to make Fed policymakers uneasy. Payroll employment has risen
by 1.6m since January, considerably faster than last year, when gross
domestic product grew 3 per cent. The jobless rate has fallen sharply from
6.7 per cent to 6.0 per cent - at or below the level at which inflation has
begun to rise in the past.
Even if the June employment increase was erratically high, there were few
signs in yesterday's figures of any deceleration in the pace of job
creation. Preliminary GDP figures for the second quarter, to be published
later this month, are likely to show economic growth at an annual rate of
well above 3 per cent, implying that the economy is still growing faster
than its long-run potential rate of expansion.
Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm,
said the June jobs figures overstated underlying employment growth and would
not prompt an early increase in interest rates. However, the Fed would raise
rates in coming months: a neutral stance might require rates as high as 5
per cent before the end of the year.
Ms Katherine Abraham, head of the labour statistics bureau, described the
payroll increase as 'substantial'. Although most of the gain occurred in
service sectors such as healthcare, restaurants, retail trades and leisure
industries, there was also a 'notable' 34,000 increase in manufacturing
employment.

Peru has retained its position as Latin America's most dynamic economy in
the first five months of this year, with growth rates that have outstripped
expectations, including those of the government.
The government said the economy grew by an annual rate of 11.8 per cent in
the first five months of the year, compared with growth forecasts of 4 to 5
per cent for 1994 as a whole.
The expansion is in most sectors, but has been marked in fishing, with
catches a third higher than last year - when they were also good following a
downturn in 1991 and 1992. Peru is the world's third largest fishing nation
and the leader in fishmeal exports.
This year, the industry expects to exceed 1993's 1.13m tonnes of fishmeal
exports by some 20 per cent. Agricultural output also rose 16 per cent in
the first five months of 1994, compared with a year earlier.
There has also been a sharp recovery in Peru's construction sector. The
government, with help from the Inter-American Development Bank and World
Bank, is pouring money into long-neglected infrastructure, with road repairs
and resurfacing boosting sales of cement and iron and giving jobs to
thousands of unskilled workers.
Peru's mining sector, meanwhile, responsible for almost half of all export
earnings, has benefited from the recent rises in international minerals
prices, especially copper. New gold deposits, now coming on stream, are also
rapidly pushing up the overall value of minerals exports.
The upturn is from a low base, however, following a 25 per cent fall in
Peruvian GDP between 1988 and 1992. Even if this year's growth exceeds last
year's 7 per cent rise, Peruvian per capita output will still barely match
1960 levels.
However, for a government facing general elections in just 10 months, the
strength of the recovery is a welcome bonus. President Alberto Fujimori said
on Wednedsay growth for 1994 would 'exceed by far' the 4.5 per cent
previously agreed with the IMF and would probably top 7 per cent.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Chinese PM cuts rest of German tour: Protests highlight
suppression of Tiananmen Square uprising
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
To the embarrassment of his government hosts, and the bewilderment of the
Bavarians who were waiting to see him, Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime
minister, yesterday abruptly cancelled the remainder of his official visit
to Germany.
For the second day in succession the Chinese leader simply abandoned parts
of his programme, apparently out of anger over planned demonstrations to
protest at his role in suppressing the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989.
Yesterday he refused to attend both final events in his official visit to
Bavaria - an inspection of a typical Bavarian farm, and a boat trip on the
scenic Tegern lake in the foothills of the Alps.
En route to the boat ride, protesters had erected a papier-mache model of
the Statue of Liberty, just as the Tiananmen students did five years ago. Mr
Li declined an offer of an alternative route to the lake-shore.
Instead, he lingered as long as possible in the company of Germany's leading
industrialists, including the managers of Siemens and Deutsche Aerospace,
and finally retired to the security of his Munich hotel suite.
His behaviour has aroused the scorn of wide sections of the German press and
an embarrassed hush from the government, which had hoped to entertain him
for a big trade-promoting trip without too much talk of human rights.
The popular Bild Zeitung, a strong supporter of the German government,
ridiculed the Chinese leader on its front page and in an editorial column,
saying: 'You expect respect, but so do we.'
Commenting on the plight of the mayor of Berlin, who was left to wander on
his own through the Brandenburg gate on Thursday, when Mr Li failed to
appear, the newspaper said: 'Our democratically elected politicians
certainly do not have to let themselves be insulted by you.'
The government insisted last night that the end of Mr Li's visit would still
go ahead as planned: a farewell handshake from the government's head of
protocol at Munich airport, around lunchtime today.
He then flies on to Bucharest.
On Thursday Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said that while Bonn
regretted what had happened, 'we must also say that demonstrations are
allowed in Germany, if they are peaceful. However, the federal government
does not believe that it is the right way to promote human rights.'
Before he cancelled his programme, Mr Li and his delegation had signed
further contracts and letters of intent with Siemens, Daimler-Benz'
subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace, and MAN.
The contracts with Siemens involve joint ventures to build three coal-fired
power stations, raising total Chinese business planned by the group to DM6bn
(Pounds 2.4bn).
At Deutsche Aerospace, the Chinese signed documents to found a joint space
satellite enterprise, and at MAN they finalised a licensing agreement for
the China National Heavy Duty Truck Corporation to build up to 5,000 bus
chassis a year.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Plans to liberalise farm trade face obstacles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's agreement in the Uruguay Round world trade deal to liberalise
farm trade by phasing out all non-tariff measures (NTMs) may prove
impossible to implement fully, according to a study.
The study, by two University of Minnesota economists, says that, if
anything, pressures to impose further NTMs are likely to grow in the next
few years because of faster innovation in food products and national
environmental regulations.
'One cannot escape the conclusion that all that can be achieved is a
reduction in some of the existing measures and a framework for future
negotiations of the others. The implication. . . is that non-tariff measures
are here to stay,' it says.
The study also says the complex way in which NTMs are applied in farm trade
poses serious practical difficulties for the Uruguay Round plan to convert
them into tariffs, which would be eliminated over several years.
The biggest problem is that several commodity groups, such as fruit and
vegetables, carry a large number of NTMs, for each of which equivalent
tariffs are not easy to calculate.
The study finds that Norway, the US, Austria and Canada impose a wider range
of NTMs on trade in agricultural products than any other western
industrialised countries.
It adds that although this does not mean these countries necessarily have
the most protected markets, the greater the diversity of NTMs the more
likely they are to restrict trade.
Canada topped the list of countries with the most agricultural NTMs,
totalling 1,464. That was more than twice the number in Sweden, the
second-ranking country, and compared with only three in Ireland, with the
least NTMs of those countries surveyed.
The study, based on an analysis of an Unctad database, finds that almost
half the farm trade measures imposed by western countries are quantity
restrictions, a third are technical regulations and stand-ards, and a fifth
are tariffs and other financial measures.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Cambodia let down by democracy: Coalition government has had
a turbulent year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cambodia is one of those countries in which provincial restaurants display
polite signs asking customers to leave their grenades and semi-automatic
weapons outside.
Travellers outside the capital, Phnom Penh, risk not only the possibility of
being kidnapped by guerrillas or bandits (two Britons and an Australian
seized three months ago are still missing) but also the probability of being
shaken down by drunken government soldiers demanding money or cigarettes at
gunpoint.
Having endured such treatment and worse from a succession of governments run
by whimsical monarchs, a military dictator, fanatical Maoists and
Vietnamese-backed communists, Cambodians know plenty about violence and
political instability.
Perhaps it was not surprising that most Cambodians greeted with a shrug of
indifference the news of an attempted coup d'etat a week ago and the
subsequent sight of more troops on the streets of Phnom Penh.
But the present government, a coalition of royalists and communists elected
a year ago in a poll organised by the United Nations, was supposed to be
democratic. The lack of popular concern about the government's fate, and the
widespread suspicion that it may have engineered the failed coup for its own
unfathomable political purposes, indicate how badly it has fared since
taking power.
Particularly disastrous for its reputation were the army offensives against
Khmer Rouge guerrilla strongholds in northern and western Cambodia earlier
this year.
On two occasions the guerrillas retreated before the troops, led them into a
trap, and then counter-attacked and routed them. Apart from demoralising the
army, the fighting frightened away French and other foreign tourists who
were beginning to arrive in greater numbers to visit the famous Khmer
temples of Angkor Wat.
The government's economic record is better than its military one, but is
hardly ideal. Mr Sam Rainsy, the finance minister from the royalist party
Funcinpec, has tried to introduce free market policies and has inspired the
confidence of the International Monetary Fund and foreign investors.
But Mr Rainsy's authority was suddenly undermined last month when
responsibility for collecting timber revenues was secretly moved to the
Defence Ministry from the Finance Ministry, apparently after pressure on the
government from the military.
The move, authorised by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Mr Hun Sen, the
coalition's two prime ministers, deprives the Finance Ministry of an
important source of budget income, contravenes the budget law, and will
probably anger the IMF.
Funcinpec, in spite of having won the most seats in the election, has not
had much impact in the provinces, where corrupt communists from the former
regime are still largely in control and former Funcinpec supporters accuse
their own leaders of betrayal. Neither the overmanned civil service nor the
incompetent army has been reformed.
At the national assembly in Phnom Penh, haggling between Funcinpec and the
communist Cambodian People's party has delayed passage of several important
laws, including one on foreign investment.
Corruption and inefficiency are so widespread that even Asian businessmen
who pride themselves on being able to strike deals where no westerner would
dare venture are frustrated by the difficulties of doing business.
Cambodians say a lucrative job as a customs officer can be bought for about
Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,900), the equivalent of 30 years' salary. Stolen
Toyotas and Nissans are parked outside government ministries by the
officials who stole them.
Army generals who are supposed to be fighting the Khmer Rouge often trade
gems and tropical timber with them. 'They shell each other in the morning
and trade and drink whisky in the evening,' says one disgusted Phnom Penh
businessman.
After decades of repression by various governments, the UN operation in
Cambodia and the election campaign encouraged the creation of independent
pressure groups dealing with everything from the environment to human
rights. More than 40 Cambodian newspapers also appeared on the streets.
Now this flowering of popular democracy may be threatened. Yesterday the
government said it had arrested a newspaper editor for 'creating disorder'
by publishing a story about the generals believed to have been involved in
the failed coup attempt a week ago. Two other newspapers critical of the
government were closed previously.
Perhaps the government's biggest mistake, according to diplomats and aid
donors, is its failure to invest in the rural areas where most Cambodians
live as rice farmers.
Government troops have made themselves unpopular by extorting money from
villagers when they bring their rice to market along government-held roads.
Foreign aid workers noticed during an outbreak of fighting in the north-west
in May that while many homeless Cambodians fled to government-held zones,
hundreds of others took refuge in Khmer Rouge areas.
'I can't help thinking that things are sliding back into the situation
between 1968 and 1974 (a year before the Khmer Rouge took power), when the
army was ineffective and corrupt and politics were unstable,' said one
foreign investor.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Japanese LDP leaders offer to quit party posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading members of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) offered to resign
senior party posts yesterday in a move expected to accelerate the
realignment of Japan's fractured political system.
The former prime minister, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, and the former foreign
minister, Mr Michio Watanabe, offered their resignations as senior party
advisers following their decision to defy the party's leadership
instructions to vote for the Social Democratic party's (SDP) leader, Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, as prime minister in last week's vote in the Diet.
Mr Nakasone and Mr Watanabe voted for the former prime minister, Mr Toshiki
Kaifu, who left the LDP and stood unsuccessfully against Mr Murayama.
Last week the LDP secretary-general, Mr Yoshio Mori, called the defectors'
actions a 'breach of trust' and said the party would consider punitive
action.
The former ministers' decision is expected to be followed by a further shift
in political allegiances. In the vote last week which resulted in the
formation of a coalition government of the LDP, the SDP and the smaller
Sakigake party, 32 LDP members and 10 Socialists defied their party
leaderships and failed to vote for Mr Murayama.
Two LDP members immediately resigned from the party. They were joined on
Wednesday by one Socialist and two more LDP rebels who resigned to sit as
independents.
Meanwhile, on Thursday eight parties from the former ruling coalition joined
forces to counter the SDP/LDP alliance.
The group, called the Reform Promotion Council, was formed at the
instigation of another former prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. It aims
to create a 200-seat bloc in the 504-seat lower house of the Diet, and is
hoping to attract more defectors from the LDP and SDP.
The group plans to field joint candidates in the next elections, due to be
held under a new system of single-member constituencies combined with
proportional representation.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Attacks in West Bank trigger army clampdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli army clamped a curfew on Hebron yesterday after violence between
Jewish settlers and the town's 100,000 Palestinians threatened to escalate.
Jewish settlers poured into Hebron on Thursday night, smashed windows and
burnt a car after an Israeli soldier and a teenage Jewish settler were
killed by Arab guerrillas in two incidents in the West Bank.
The Israeli army, which forced Palestinians to stay indoors throughout
yesterday as they conducted house-to-house searches, vowed to hunt the
killers 'to the death'.
The renewal of Arab-Israeli violence in Hebron, site of a mosque massacre in
February, is a reminder of the fragile nature of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process despite recent progress.
The Israeli army blamed the attacks on the Hamas Islamic Resistance
Movement, which opposes the peace agreement. If true, it marks a new wave of
Hamas attacks; offensives were halted to see how the peace process unfolded.
Hamas did not make its usual claim of responsibility, but has stated
repeatedly in recent leaflets that it is not giving up its armed struggle
against Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands.
In the two attacks a 20-year-old Israeli soldier, missing since Wednesday,
was found dead in an abandoned Jerusalem house and a 17-year-old settler was
killed when gunmen attacked a car near Kiryat Arba, the militant Jewish
settlement outside Hebron.
The killings overshadowed a successful summit in Paris between Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, who
shared a United Nations peace prize.
Mr Rabin has recently expressed confidence in the PLO following military
reports that Palestinian attacks on Israelis are substantially down since
the implementation of self-rule in Gaza-Jericho.
The attacks will fuel the campaign of the Israeli right-wing which wants the
peace deal terminated and which is determined to resist the extension of PLO
control across the West Bank. Israel and the PLO will begin to negotiate
this phase of the peace process in Cairo on Monday.
Mr Aharon Domb, a spokesman for the settlers, said yesterday: 'While the
prime minister is busy receiving a peace prize, Jews are being murdered
throughout Israel. The reality is staring him in the face but he refuses to
see it.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: US welcomes tax plans by Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officials yesterday welcomed what they saw as a new commitment by the
Japanese government to stimulate dom-estic demand through an income tax cut
and so open new market opportunities for other countries.
Although Japan has already cut income tax and plans another cut of the same
size next year, it had intended to offset this cut with a consumption tax,
thereby eliminating the effect on domestic demand.
But US officials said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new prime minister,
assured President Bill Clinton at a meeting in Naples that his coalition
would not go ahead with the consumption tax until the Japanese economy had
started to grow again.
The bilateral meeting preceded the formal summit of heads of government from
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, which began in Naples last
night.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, his
Japanese opposite number, had assured him he 'would not detract from the
income tax cut until they were sure that they were well on the way to
recovery'.
Mr Clinton also said that Japan had not made enough progress towards opening
up its markets to foreign goods, and that he looked forward to a quick
resumption of the US-Japan framework trade negotiations. Nevertheless, he
showed much greater understanding than in the past for the political
difficulties faced by the Japanese government in opening up its markets.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he would also be pressing the
Japanese government for trade liberalisation measures at the summit.
Mr Clinton plans to broach to his colleagues an idea for further action to
follow up on the free trade promises they made in the Uruguay Round of
negotiations. Besides urging the other G7 countries to ratify the Uruguay
Round agreement, he said he would ask them to review and analyse remaining
trade barriers and report back to next year's summit in Halifax, Canada.
In a letter to the other G7 leaders, Mr Clinton mentioned financial
services, standards and investment rules as examples of areas that largely
escaped scrutiny in the Uruguay Round.
A senior US official said this initiative, dubbed Open Markets 2000, was
intended to maintain the momentum towards freer trade. Nevertheless,
ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement remained the US's first priority
and Open Markets 2000 was not intended to open a new 'Clinton Round' of
talks.
The idea was welcomed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, who
agreed on the need for 'more incisive measures', particularly in the area of
financial services.

West European new car sales rose by an estimated 11.8 per cent in June
compared with the same month last year, providing fresh evidence that the
region's car market is firmly on course for recovery.
Provisional statistics from the European Automobile Manufacturers'
Association show that the June upturn helped lift sales for the first half
of the year to 6.09m, an increase of 6.6 per cent on the same period of
1993. Of the 16 West European markets, only Greece, Portugal, Austria and
Italy did not record first-half increases.

South Korea yesterday agreed to open its market wider to car imports from
the EU under the same conditions granted last month to the US. The measures
include cutting the tariff on cars to 8 per cent from 10 per cent and
replacing a 15 per cent sales tax on cars costing won70m (Pounds 56,000) or
more with a 2 per cent tax on all models.
Distributors of European cars will also be allowed access to television
advertising and more and larger showrooms. The measures are likely to
benefit the EU more than the US since most European cars sold in Korea are
in the luxury range. The EU exported fewer than 400 cars to Korea last year,
while Korea shipped almost 100,000 cars to the EU.

The world's aircraft-producing countries agreed yesterday to exchange
information on the aid they give their industries, after failing to make
progress on European demands that the US accept tighter international
disciplines on indirect subsidies to civil aircraft.
It is hoped the information can be collated by September, and discussed at
the committee's next meeting scheduled for late October. However, officials
are increasingly pessimistic about prospects for reaching a Gatt agreement
to limit indirect industry aid, such as defence-related support, in the face
of US resistance. In bilateral talks with US negotiators this week, EU
officials also strongly criticised Washington's subsidies for a supersonic
civil aircraft project and its role in winning a large civil aircraft order
from Saudi Arabia this year.

The German government yesterday decided that conscripts in the German armed
forces will have to serve 10 months instead of 12, part of a package of
reforms designed to trim the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 340,000. A total of
DM47.5bn (Pounds 19.6bn) will be earmarked for the 1995 military budget. The
new structure of the Bundeswehr will have 290,000 troops assigned to the
so-called main defence forces and a further 50,000 in crisis reaction forces
where soldiers must serve at least 12 months.
The crisis reaction troops could see action as part of United Nations
operations, a thorny issue which the German constitutional court is expected
to decide next Tuesday, when it will rule whether German troops can be
deployed outside the Nato area.

FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Russia looks to summit for economic
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia expects today's economic communique from the Naples summit to go a
long way towards meeting Moscow's concerns, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy
prime minister, said last night.
He said he expected the communique to speak highly of Russia's reform
programme and to go a considerable way towards accepting the Russian idea of
a new relationship between the G7 economies and ex-communist states. Russia
wanted ex-communist countries, including itself, to have greater access to
international financial organisations and more access for their goods on
world markets.
Today's communique should uphold the principle that Russia should in due
course join the new World Trade Organisation, said Mr Shokhin, who was
speaking after meeting Italian officials.
Referring to tomorrow's talks, in which President Boris Yeltsin will take
part, Mr Shokhin said Russia wanted to participate in global mechanisms for
dealing with such problems as nuclear safety, money laundering and heavily
indebted countries.
But he did not believe the problem of nuclear safety in Ukraine should be
solved by replacing all Russian technology with western technology.
Mr Shokhin said Russia would explore with the G7 ways of encouraging foreign
investment without automatically providing full government guarantees for
projects in Russia.
In contrast with previous encounters with the G7, Russia is not asking its
partners this time for more government-to-government credits. Its balance of
payments improved markedly last year, and officials are confident of a
spontaneous inflow of private capital, much of it Russian-controlled but
currently held abroad, now that the first phase of a privatisation programme
is over.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin wants the G7 to set up a consultative

Graham. His idea is to use the G7 network for crisis management and more
sustained consultation between summits. He sent the proposal to Italy as
host of the Naples summit. The Italians appeared to favour the idea, which
could ensure them more say in world affairs, as Italy is not a permanent
member of the UN Security Council.

FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Japan seeks European pressure on N
Korea

<TEXT>
Japan yesterday signalled that it wants the European members of the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries to become more involved in pressuring
North Korea to abandon suspected plans to make nuclear weapons.
A senior Japanese foreign ministry official said Japan wanted the Europeans
to show as much interest in the North Korean crisis as Japan shows over the
problems of the former Yugoslavia.
His comments came as North Korea and the US began talks in Geneva aimed at
resolving the nuclear dispute. A spokesman for Pyongyang said the initial
meeting was 'productive,' though the talks are expected to last several
weeks.
The Japanese official pointed out that a Japanese national, Mr Yasushi
Akashi, is the UNPROFOR chief of mission in former Yugoslavia. In addition,
Japan has allocated Dollars 210m (Pounds 136m) to UNPROFOR, disbursed about
Dollars 96m in humanitarian assistance to the region and pledged Dollars 13m
for the rehabilitation of Sarajevo.
Outside the United Nations Security Council, the handling of the North
Korean crisis has so far been a matter for the US, Japan and South Korea.
Speaking shortly before the start of this year's summit of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations, the official said Japan wanted European
members of G7 to join in sending a 'solid message' to North Korea. This
would help the talks between the US and North Korea in Geneva and the
proposed summit between North and South Korea on July 25, he said.
This year's summit in Naples is again highlighting the importance that the
Japanese accord the G7. While other member countries have toyed in the past
with the idea of abandoning the yearly summits, Japan yesterday made clear
that it wants to strengthen co-ordination among the G7 countries.
Unlike the European countries which are linked through the European Union
and Japan's six G7 partners, which are members of Nato, Japan has no
comparable foreign policy ties other than the G7. It indicated yesterday
that it would like to build on the current policy co-operation to strengthen
the links between the Atlantic and Pacific communities of nations.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new Japanese prime minister, yesterday reassured
Japan's G7 partners that its foreign policy would not change following the
establishment of a three party socialist-led coalition government.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Spain to defy Brussels over UK ferry row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government yesterday signalled its intention to defy a formal
complaint from the European Commission by refusing to grant a British ferry
line access to its most commercially appealing southern ports.
Officials said yesterday in Madrid that Cenargo, the British ferry company,
would shortly receive permission to start services between Nador in Morocco
and a single Spanish port, most probably Alicante.
But in a case being dubbed the Orly Airport of shipping, this solution will
satisfy neither the Commission, Cenargo nor the British government as
Alicante is furthest away from Nador of the three ports on Spain's
Mediterranean coast.
The closest ports - Almeria and Malaga - remain closed to the British line.
The case has been compared with the much publicised British Airways dispute
with France over access to Orly airport in France.
Spain's partial climbdown, after some two years of obstruction, follows a
complaint from Brussels that Madrid has disobeyed the rules and spirit of
the European Union's single market by denying Cenargo access to Spanish
ports.
The official letter from the commission to the Spanish Foreign Ministry,
sent at the beginning of June, states that the Spanish are directly
contravening EU legislation that allows shipping lines to operate services
between any member state and another non-EU country.
The letter suggests that neither the commission nor its legal services will
accept the Spanish government's solution. The letter implies that Cenargo
ought to have been allowed to chose to operate from any of the three
southern ports.
Cenargo said yesterday that although it would accept the offer of Alicante,
it would continue to push for access to Almeria and Malaga. 'The government
has opened a window but not the door,' Mr Armando Ligerri, Cernargo's chief
executive in Spain said yesterday. The Department of Transport in the UK
said it would support Cenargo.
Spain's authorities should have replied to the Commission complaint last
week but they have now been granted an extension until the end of the month
to rectify formally their ban on Cernago.
Although there is an intermittent ferry service between Alicante and Oran,
in Algeria, there has never been one with Morocco and this eastern Spanish
port which - unlike Malaga and Almeria, which lie further south - lacks an
established Moroccan client base. Mr Ligerri said Cenargo did not have an
office in Alicante although it did have one in Almeria.
By operating out of Alicante, with a sailing time from Nador of some 13
hours, against six hours out of Almeria, Cenargo is in effect barred from
establishing a daily return service to Morocco with a single vessel.
Cernargo had originally hoped to establish an Almeria-Nador link early last
year but its ferry's maiden voyage was aborted by the Spanish navy, which
prevented it docking at Almeria. The UK company, which says it will be
unable to start up out of Alicante until November, is claiming Pta2.1bn
(Pounds 10.4m) from the Madrid authorities in compensation for lost
business.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Bundesrat logjam broken for holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With almost indecent haste, the German Bundesrat - the upper house of
federal parl-iament - broke through a legislative logjam in record time
yesterday, devouring no fewer than 139 items in four-and-a-half hours, to
ensure that everyone could depart for summer holidays on time, writes
Quentin Peel in Bonn.
The worthy representatives of the 16 federal states who sit in the upper
chamber rushed through their approval of a stack of outstanding bills, with
sweeping consequences for many areas of the German economy, and daily life.
They gave the go-ahead to postal reform, enabling privatisation of Deutsche
Telekom, as well as the postal service; they approved laws on bankruptcy and
on making insider trading illegal; they legalised private employment
agencies; and they approved a sweeping law on waste disposal.
They gave the green light to a bill allowing private enterprise to build
public roads and finance them with toll charges. And they approved
legislation to wind up the Treuhand privatisation agency in east Germany.
On the way they blocked a second attempt to reform the conflicting abortion
laws of east and west, postponed plans for the Transrapid
magnetic-levitation train, and held up a property compensation law for east
Germany - all of which must now go back for further negotiation.
And somewhere in the middle they voted by a large majority to stoke up the
simmering row between Britain and Germany over BSE - mad cow disease - by
approving plans for a ban on imports of beef from Britain.
The extraordinary exercise, with the largest-ever agenda presented to the
Bundesrat in a single day, was caused by the coincidence of the end of the
parliamentary cycle - with a general election in October - the imminent
summer holidays, and the fact that the chamber has blocked a record number
of bills recently.
In the event, the members started sitting one hour early, at 8.30 am, and
finished the entire agenda in time for a one o'clock lunch.
The predictable approval of Deutsche Telekom privatisation clears its last
parliamentary hurdle, with a first tranche of shares to be on sale in 1996.
The unpredictable rejection of the Transrapid plan - to build a 400 km per
hour line from Berlin to Hamburg - means it will go back for negotiation
between the government majority in the Bundestag, the lower house, and the
Social Democrat (SPD) majority in the Bundesrat.
It is that SPD majority in the Bundesrat - where states with SPD-led
governments have 37 votes, against just 31 for Mr Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats and their allies - which has allowed the upper house to block so
much legislation, and force compromises from the ruling coalition.
The government has been complaining bitterly that the SPD has blocked its
entire legislative programme, while the SPD insists that negotiation is the
name of the game: both are playing politics with an eye on the October
election.
They still have a chance to get the rest of the laws agreed, however, for
the Bundesrat has two more sittings scheduled in September, one to approve a
handful of constitutional amendments, and the other to take in any other
business.
Only then, they will not be so bothered about having to get away for their
holidays on time.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Ciller urges public debate on Kurds: Turkey's PM is seeking
to regain the political initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's beleaguered prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller sought to regain the
political initiative this week, calling for a public debate on what has long
been an official taboo - use of the Kurdish language in schools and
television.
In a style more reminiscent of the late Turgut Ozal, Mrs Ciller dropped her
bombshell at an engagement in Paris, telling reporters she wanted to see the
constitutional ban on Kurdish broadcasting and education lifted.
The move could serve to win over moderate Kurds, and isolate the rebel
Kurdish Workers' party (PKK). But the suggestion has left the Ankara
establishment floundering.
Mrs Ciller's apparent change of heart is prompted by mounting international
criticism of Turkish policy, and the government's apparently blind pursuit
of a military solution. It will also divert attention from the newspaper
allegations of impropriety Mrs Ciller and her husband face in connection
with property acquisitions in the US.
'In institutions, schools and the state television, the official language is
Turkish. But beyond that, everything should be free,' she said.
Clearly, such a move risks alienating hardliners in her True Path party
(DYP), without whom it may be hard to win a two-thirds majority in
parliament for constitutional reform. It will further strain the uneasy
compromise between civilians and the military which has prevailed since she
came to power last summer.
Western governments have been particularly shocked by recent moves to close
the Kurdish-based Democracy party (DEP), following lifting of the
parliamentary immunity of MPs representing the Kurdish region, five of whom
could face the death penalty for espousing the Kurdish cause.
International censure is also hampering Turkey's efforts to win financial
aid from western governments to see it through its current economic crisis.
'At the moment her ambassadors can't even get through the doors of Europe's
treasuries to present their requests,' says one foreign banker.
Concern has been voiced in the US, where the House of Representatives has
for the first time proposed to link US aid to improvements in Turkey's human
rights.
Furthermore, the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly voted last week
to send a delegation to Turkey to investigate the Kurdish problem.
Ironically, the promotion of Kurdish education was one of the charges cited
in the Constitutional Court's decision to close the DEP on June 30. The
debate could trigger further divisions within Mrs Ciller's conservative-led
coalition.
Only this week, speaking to the military academy, President Suleyman Demirel
echoed hardline sentiment when warning that the west's demand for democratic
reforms would be rejected if they threatened Turkey's territorial integrity.
In sharp contrast, Mr Celal Kurkoglu, a social democrat deputy, called on
the justice ministry to investigate Mr Nusret Demiral, head of the Ankara
state security court, for his actions against the DEP.
It could also imperil Mrs Ciller's close ties with the army, which has until
now been given carte blanche to prosecute increasingly bloody counterattacks
against the Kurdish Workers' party .

FT  09 JUL 94 / Clinton rules out summit accord to support dollar: Murayama
calls for stable exchange rates as US currency falls sharply against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton effectively ruled out the possibility yesterday that
any significant agreement to support the dollar would emerge from this
weekend's summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in
Naples.
Speaking after his first meeting with the new Japanese prime minister, Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, Mr Clinton said it would be a mistake for the G7 nations
to change the direction of their macroeconomic policy in an effort to halt
the fall of the dollar.
'We want the dollar to be properly valued, not undervalued,' Mr Clinton
said. 'But I think on the other hand it would be a mistake for us to change
the fundamental objective that we all ought to have: the one we agreed to at
the G7 last year, which is to pursue global growth.'
Mr Clinton's observations unnerved foreign exchange markets, and the dollar
fell to its lowest level since April 1993 against the D-Mark. Traders
interpreted his comments as showing he was unconcerned about the level of
the dollar.
Meanwhile, the publication of stronger-than-expected US employment figures
put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.
Unemployment held steady at 6.0 per cent in June, against expectations it
would rise to 6.2 per cent.
The Clinton-Murayama meeting was one of a series of bilateral talks among
leaders before the formal G7 summit, which began last night.
Heads of government of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada, with the president of the European Commission, will confer today on
how to reduce the 35m unemployed in the industrialised world and debate
plans to make former Soviet nuclear power stations safer. Tomorrow, they
will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin for discussions on international
issues.
Yesterday's Clinton-Murayama meeting dispelled some of US administration
fears about the policies and stability of the new Japanese socialist-led
coalition, and about Mr Murayama's political leanings.
But a fundamental difference remains between the US and Japan over the
dollar, which, after closing in London at DM1.5741 and Y98.575, fell over a
pfennig to end in New York at DM1.561. Against the yen in New York it closed
at Y98.055.
Commenting on recent foreign exchange market turbulence, Mr Murayama said
countries around the world, 'and especially Japan and the US, should make
policy that is conducive to more stable exchange rates in co-operation with
each other'.

FT  09 JUL 94 / OFT names life insurers giving zero refund after one year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK investors get no money back from more than a dozen life insurers if they
stop Pounds 100-a-month, 10-year savings plans after only one year,
according to unpublished figures collected by the Office of Fair Trading.
Last month, the OFT published a report on the values returned by life
offices to customers surrendering long-term policies early, and published
figures for surrender values where a customer was paying Pounds 50 a month
in premiums.
The latest figures, which cover cases in which a customer could have paid
Pounds 1,200 and yet be entitled to nothing if the policy is cancelled after
one year, underline why early surrender values are increasingly becoming an
issue in the life industry.
The life insurers offering a zero surrender value at the end of the first
year for both types of savings policies considered by the OFT are: London &amp;
Manchester; London Life; MGM; Refuge; Royal Life; Tunbridge Wells; Abbey
Life; Allied Dunbar; Confederation Life; Cornhill Insurance; Irish Life;
Midland Life; Reliance Mutual and Royal Life.
Although the surrender values offered by some of these insurers in
subsequent years compare more favourably with those given by their
competitors, the information available suggests that more people stop paying
their premiums in the first year than in any later year. Estimates put
first-year lapse rates in the 17 per cent-23 per cent range.
Mr Mike Bateman, MGM sales and marketing director, said the company was
considering changes to the surrender value in the first year. Eleven per
cent of the company's savings plans were surrendered in the first year, he
said. Mr Peter Kelly, life marketing director for Allied Dunbar, said the
proportion of this type of savings plan surrendered in the first year was
'significantly less' than 10 per cent.
Mr Nigel Stephens, marketing actuary for Confederation Life, said that while
such policies had previously been sold for the long term, early surrender
rates were now at historically high levels.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Heseltine in row over Archer probe: DTI disclosure meant to
avoid allegations of political cover-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, Britain's trade and industry secretary, was at the
centre of a political controversy yesterday after his department's
revelation that Lord Archer, the Tory peer and best-selling novelist, was
under investigation for alleged insider dealing.
Amid signs that the DTI's unprecedented disclosure had severely damaged Lord
Archer's chances of securing a post in Mr John Major's forthcoming
ministerial reshuffle, it emerged that Mr Heseltine had acted to avoid
charges of a political cover-up.
But there were suggestions at Westminster that the DTI statement on its
investigation had been a deliberate attempt to undermine Lord Archer's
political future. The probe centres on share deals in the run-up to an
agreed bid by MAI, the entertainment and financial group, for Anglia
Television this year. Lord Archer's wife, Mary, is a non-executive director
at Anglia.
Senior Tory and Labour figures expressed astonishment that the DTI had
broken its long-standing rule of never naming any individual who is under
investigation.
It is thought that the investigation centres on one large share purchase
that resulted in a substantial profit when MAI announced its agreed takeover
of Anglia on January 18.
Lord Archer has denied buying shares in Anglia ahead of the bid, and
yesterday the company confirmed that he had not held shares in his own name
or through a nominee account for at least three years.
Passing on inside information can be an offence even if the individual
concerned does not buy shares or even profit from the trade. For someone
knowingly in possession of inside information, it is insider dealing to
encourage someone else to trade the shares, having reasonable cause to
believe the dealing would take place.
Lord Archer has stated that the allegations that have been made are
'completely untrue.' He is going ahead with a planned book signing session
at Harrods today.
DTI sources said last night that Mr Heseltine informed the prime minister
that he would make reference to Lord Archer before issuing the statement on
Thursday night.
Mr Heseltine's decision followed a statement to the press by Anglia that a
DTI investigation into the share deal was under way.
Anglia said yesterday that it did not name Lord Archer in its press
statement on Thursday. However, DTI officials emphasised that there was a
clear indication in Anglia's statement that 'there was a specific
investigation looking into a specific alleged transaction'.
Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the backbench Treasury and Civil Service
committee, called on the DTI to issue 'a full and clear explanation' of its
decision to disclose Lord Archer's identity. 'If they do not, it is
something I would want to pursue in the House of Commons. There needs to be
a full explanation of how and why this has happened.'
Downing Street confirmed yesterday that Mr Major had known about the DTI
investigation at the time of its inception in February. of this year. The
prime minister, in Naples yesterday for the G7 summit of leading industrial
nations, said: 'One always feels for an old friend. But I am not going to
comment.'
He added: 'There is an investigation going on. The investigation should
proceed. It would be wrong for me to say anything beyond that.'
The trade over Anglia shares was investigated by the Stock Exchange which
then passed the evidence on to the Department of Trade and Industry, the
prosecuting authority for insider dealing.
The Stock Exchange surveillance department routinely examines trading in
shares ahead of large price movements, particularly if it involves
directors. Last year the Stock Exchange examined 450 such 'unusual trading
patterns'.
Very few of these are likely to result in prosecutions partly because
insider dealing is a very difficult crime to prove. Legal experts believe
that the circumstances surrounding the Anglia takeover would further hamper
any successful prosecution.
One leading City lawyer said: 'There was widespread speculation in the press
that MAI was going to bid for Anglia so anyone accused of acting on inside
information could use the defence that they were going to buy the shares
anyway.'
'It is very difficult to prove what was in somebody's mind.'

FT  09 JUL 94 / Two-tier system for rand 'likely to go'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South Africa's cumbersome two-tier exchange rate system was 'fundamentally
wrong' and its abolition only a matter of time, Mr Chris Liebenberg, the
country's finance minister-designate, said yesterday.
However, any decision to abolish the two-tier system had to be 'taken
against a background of sound, sustainable government', Mr Liebenberg said,
and would depend on the country's reserves and on international confidence.
He acknowledged that his appointment this week as replacement to Mr Derek
Keys could have been better handled but said he had received a personal
reassurance from President Nelson Mandela that the government had a
commitment to fiscal discipline.
Mr Liebenberg, 60, was appointed on Tuesday, hours after Mr Keys shocked
financial markets with his unexpected announcement that he planned to step
down this year for personal reasons.
In an interview, Mr Liebenberg, formerly head of banking group Nedcor, said
he fully supported the reconstruction and development programme, the
centrepiece of government economic policy.
The programme's success was 'absolutely essential' but this could be
achieved within current spending limits.
'Implied in that (the RDP's success) is very strict fiscal discipline that
brings with it very strict monetary discipline,' he said. Mr Liebenberg, who
said he had no formal political affiliation, accepted that Tuesday's news,
which had been preceded by rumours of Mr Keys' resignation, had done damage
as government bond rates rose half a point, and the currency weakened.
'There is no doubt there is a Keys factor but that a correction in the
market was going to take place was inevitable,' he said. But Mr Liebenberg
acknowledged that 'with hindsight, had everything been perfect, it could
have been better handled.'
On the question of the abolition of exchange controls, Mr Liebenberg said he
was no supporter of the current system. 'I believe that South Africa's
two-tier exchange rate is fundamentally, inherently wrong. It cannot last.
This principle is accepted. It is now a matter of timing.'
Three issues would affect the decision to abolish the financial rand: the
level of reserves, the overhang of speculative financial rands in the
banking system, and international confidence.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Clinton rules out summit pact on support for dollar:
Murayama calls for policies to pursue stable exchange rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton effectively ruled out the possibility yesterday that
any significant agreement to support the dollar would emerge from this
weekend's summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in
Naples.
Speaking after his first meeting with the new Japanese prime minister, Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, Mr Clinton said it would be a mistake for the G7 nations
to change the direction of their macroeconomic policy in an effort to halt
the fall of the dollar.
'We want the dollar to be properly valued, not undervalued,' Mr Clinton
said. 'But I think on the other hand it would be a mistake for us to change
the fundamental objective that we all ought to have: the one we agreed to at
the G7 last year, which is to pursue global growth.'
Mr Clinton's observations unnerved foreign exchange markets, and the dollar
fell to its lowest level since April 1993 against the D-Mark. Traders
interpreted his comments as showing he was unconcerned about the level of
the dollar, and 'soft' on inflation.
Meanwhile, the publication of stronger-than-expected US employment figures
put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.
Unemployment held steady at 6.0 per cent in June, against expectations that
it would rise to 6.2 per cent.
The Clinton-Murayama meeting was one of a series of bilateral talks among
leaders before the formal G7 summit, which began last night with a dinner at
the 11th-century Castel dell'Ovo in Naples.
Heads of government of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada, with the president of the European Commission, will confer today on
how to reduce the 35m unemployed in the industrialised world and debate
plans to make former Soviet nuclear power stations safer.
Tomorrow, they will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia for
discussions on international issues, including Bosnia, North Korea and
Rwanda.
Yesterday's Clinton-Murayama meeting dispelled some of the fears harboured
by the American administration about the policies and stability of the new
Japanese socialist-led coalition, and about Mr Murayama's own political
leanings.
But the good atmosphere generated at the meeting could not disguise the
fundamental difference between the US and Japan over the dollar, which,
after closing in London at DM1.5741 and Y98.575, fell over a pfennig in New
York to trade at DM1.5610. Against the yen it was trading at Y97.88.
Commenting on the recent turbulence in foreign exchange markets, Mr Murayama
said that countries around the world, 'and especially Japan and the US,
should make policy that is conducive to more stable exchange rates in
co-operation with each other'.
He said the two countries had 'a common understanding' on that, and hoped
that 'those responsible for the matter will talk to each other and work at
it properly'. Mr Clinton said the relationship of the yen to the dollar was
'obviously a function of the movement of world currency markets'.
He said: 'If we continue to pursue growth without inflation and to work on
generating new jobs out of that growth, then eventually the macroeconomic
realities will assert themselves, and the currencies will be righted
according to market conditions.' It was 'important not to overreact'.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry drops out of Bridge Oil
race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The hard-fought bid battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based oil and gas
group, appeared to be over last night, after Gantry, one of the two rival
suitors, dropped out of the race.
Gantry - which was the bid vehicle for Enron, the US natural gas company,
and the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the largest
state pension funds - said it would not proceed with an offer. This leaves
the way clear for Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texan oil independent, to go ahead
with its 90-cents-a-share cash bid.
Gantry said P&amp;P's public statement that it would not accept a
95-cents-a-share offer for its 21 per cent holding in Bridge, meant that
Gantry had no hope of reaching its 90 per cent minimum acceptance level.
'Thus, we have decided not to proceed with this transaction,' it said.
Gantry had bought Bridge shares in the market on Thursday at prices up to 95
cents, boosting the target company's share price. However, during
yesterday's trading, Bridge shares eased to 91 cents. Gantry's announcement
came after the market closed.
Santos, the South Australian oil and gas company, is buying a 32.802 per
cent interest in the Anglia gas field in the North Sea from Conoco, the oil
and gas subsidiary of Dupont in the US.
Santos said the deal, which is still subject to regulatory and joint venture
approval, had been under negotiation for some time, and would be backdated
to January 1, 1994. The company declined to disclose its price 'due to
confidentiality provisions'.
The deal will boost Santos' budgeted gas production this calendar year by
5.3 per cent, and add 1.15m barrels of oil equivalent to the group's 1994
production. Proven gas reserves at the purchase date were put at more than
50bn cubic feet.
Santos said its share of gas production from the Anglia field, which started
producing in late-1991, had been sold forward under a 'life of field'
contract to Total Gas Marketing. The other joint venture partners in Anglia
are Ranger Oil and Amerada Hess.
Although this is Santos' first investment in the North Sea, the company said
it would consider further acquisitions there.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: When investors just have to pay -
It's decision time at Kleinwort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Decision time is approaching rapidly for holders of shares in the Kleinwort
European Privatisation investment trust. The second 50p instalment is due on
August 1 but the shares start trading as fully-paid from July 18. So, anyone
selling after this date will have to stump up the extra 50p in any case.
The basic choice for shareholders is between paying the instalment and
keeping the shares in the hope the lost ground will be regained, or cutting
losses and selling up before the extra cash is due.
Both strategies have their price: the former carries the 50p a share cost
while the latter involves waving goodbye to the 36 per cent of your original
investment lost since the trust was launched. Investors initially bought
packages at 250p, including five half-paid shares and one warrant. The same
package is now worth about 159p.
Your choice should depend on your long-term view of the fund's prospects,
but the one option not recommended is complete inaction. That way, you could
forfeit your shares altogether.
An alternative strategy if you cannot afford (or are not willing) to pay the
cash call, but still believe in the fund's investment strategy, would be to
sell the shares but keep the warrants, which were issued 'free' in the
initial offer. They have traded as high as 49p, just after the fund was
launched, but are now down to 25.5p.
Each warrant allows you to subscribe for one share at 100p on January 31 in
any of the years between 1995 and 2006. When the actual share price rises
above 100p, the warrants' intrinsic worth leaps up.
Investors can either exercise the warrants when the time is ripe or sell
them in the open market. By retaining just the warrants, your level of
immediate exposure to the fund is low, but you keep a highly-geared stake in
its capital growth.
The huge quantities of money attracted by the fund's first instalment have
taken some time to place in European markets, but it is now 98.5 per cent
invested. At end-June, the main holdings were in France (24 per cent),
Germany (21), the UK (18) and Scandinavia (15). By sector, the greatest
weighting is in utilities, with 23.3 per cent. Financials account for 20.3
per cent, followed by telecommunications (14.5) and capital goods and basic
industry (10.1 each).
The largest single holding is in KPN, the recently privatised Dutch posts
and telecoms group, with 4.5 per cent, followed by the Danish Teledanmark
and Austria's VA Technology, each with 3.7 per cent.

FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft makes more
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the heavily-indebted German metals, mining and
industrial group, is to provide DM1bn (Dollars 637.8m) to cover losses
arising from its engagement with Castle Energy Corporation, a small North
American oil refining company in which MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's New
York-based trading subsidiary, has a minority stake.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of the Frankfurt-based group, said the
provision would be covered by extraordinary profits realised through
disinvestments, especially the DM1.2bn sale of the Buderus engineering group
completed last month. However, the provision comes on top of the DM2.3bn
losses run up by MG Corp through speculative trading in US oil derivatives,
which drove Metallgesellschaft to the brink of bankruptcy earlier this year.
The group also warned yesterday that losses for the 1994-95 financial year
would probably be around the same level as for the year to September 30
1993, when it lost DM1.9bn.
In the first six months of the year, the group incurred a loss of DM1.54bn
compared with a profit of DM98.3m. Without MG Corp, the loss would have been
DM61.3m, down from a deficit of DM88.6m in first half of 1992-93. Turnover
for the six months to the end of March fell 3 per cent to DM12.26bn.
The new provisions are the result of 76 individual contracts between MG Corp
and Castle, in which MG Corp undertook to supply Castle with crude oil, to
finance Castle's purchase of that oil, and thereafter buy the refined
product at above-market prices until the year 2000. Metallgesellschaft is
trying to renegotiate these contracts, which Mr Neukirchen recently
described as 'incomprehensible'.
The complicated relationship between Castle and MG Corp, which owns 40 per
cent of the refinery, has only been unravelled in the past few months.
Consequently, the scale of the potential losses from this quarter had not
been quantified when bankers agreed to a DM3.4bn rescue package in January.
The Castle problem helps explain why Mr Neukirchen decided to dispose of
Buderus, one of the most profitable of the group's 650-plus subsidiaries,
when earlier this year he said it would not be sold.
It would probably take five years for Metallgesellschaft to recover fully,
Mr Neukirchen said this week. He was speaking on his achievements in the
first seven months as the group's chairman, and mapping out future strategy.
he says the group will concentrate on four core areas: plant construction,
trading, financial services and chemicals. This will mean that group
turnover will, in the medium term, settle down to DM14bn a year - compared
with DM26bn last year - and employees will number around 20,000, compared
with 58,000 at the end of March last year. Metallgesellschaft will scale
back its traditional metals activities and sell off its mining interests,
concentrated in the 50.1 per cent-owned Toronto-based Metall Mining.
The reduction in the group's size goes hand in hand with the sale of
subsidiaries and rationalisation measures. Group debt is set to fall from
DM9.4bn at the end of last year to DM5bn by the end of the 1994-95 financial
year.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Global investment flows bypass poorer developing nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance ministers in the poorer developing countries, who have recently been
lamenting the diversion of foreign investment from their regions to more
developed countries, have had their fears confirmed by a study on global
investment flows.
Although foreign direct investment destined for developing countries
continued to rise rapidly between 1985 and 1992 at an annual rate of 23 per
cent, the smaller and least developed received very little.
The study, by the International Finance Corporation, found that the increase
reached 37 per cent in 1991 and 33 per cent in 1992. From a level of Dollars
8.4bn in 1985, net foreign direct investment in developing counties had
expanded to Dollars 36.3bn in 1992. East Asia and Latin America were the
main recipients of foreign direct investment, taking about 80 per cent.
'While investment to Latin America and East Asia continues to dominate
flows, as has been true throughout the 1980s. . . sub-Saharan investment has
been declining in relative terms, a characteristic shared by Europe, the
Middle East and North Africa since 1989,' the report says. 'On the other
hand, there has been a rapid rise in foreign direct investment destined for
east European countries following the disintegration of communism.'
The poorer among the developing countries are at the bottom of the list
because of a combination of infrastructural and policy deficiencies.
Although foreign and domestic investors are influenced by much the same
factors, foreign investors differ in that they look at market size, actual
or potential, as one criterion, the report says. They also tend to be
sensitive to specific policy issues such as those related to foreign
exchange availability and operational freedom.
Consequently, private investment tends to be more attractive in regions
where strong growth has occurred and seems likely to continue, or where
there are promising prospects. These regions include many of the East Asian
countries, Chile, Argentina and Mexico. 'There is evidence as well that
private investment is a function of relative stability in country economic
policies and, to some extent, in political stability more generally,' it
says.
'Moreover, recent research has confirmed that income inequality, by
increasing the likelihood of instability, also tends to reduce private
investment activity. Compared with any other region, private investment in
sub-Saharan Africa remained low relative to average gross domestic product.
The study found a correlation between the deregulation of developing country
economies, particularly the privatisation of state-owned economic
enterprises, and the pattern of foreign investment flows. These policy
changes have also encouraged increased domestic private investment.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Li Peng fails to face protesters in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   BONN, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's Premier Li Peng failed to appear at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin
yesterday, where some 200 human rights protesters gathered with banners
branding him a 'mass murderer' and the 'butcher of Tiananmen'.
On the fourth day of his tour of Germany, Mr Li became the first visiting
dignitary to a reunited Berlin to miss a stroll through the gate, symbol of
the city's former cold war division. A surprised Berlin mayor, Mr Eberhard
Diepgen, was left waiting for the Chinese party, which flew on to Weimar.
There, Mr Li interrupted a speech by the curator of the ciy's museum, who
referred to the writer Goethe's work on human rights. 'I know Goethe's
work,' Mr Li said angrily. 'I want to see how Goethe worked and lived.'
During three days in Bonn, the Chinese delegation signed contracts and
letters of intent worth Dollars 3.5bn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Klaus
Kinkel, his foreign minister, raised the question of human rights in talks
with the Chinese leader, but the issue did not head the agenda.
Mr Norbert Blum, employment minister, took a hard line: 'There is no
business deal big enough to make us forget the slaughter on Tiananmen
Square' in 1989, he said in a newspaper interview. Mr Li cancelled an
official lunch in Weimar and left three hours early for Munich, the last
stop on his six-day tour.
Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister and vice-premier, again denouncing
the democratic reform bill passed by Hong Kong's legislature, ordered an
advisory body yesterday to study ways to put a new parliament in the colony
after it returns to China in 1997, Reuter adds from Beijing.
Mr Qian said the narrow passage of the reform bill on June 30, three years
to the day before Beijing takes back Hong Kong from London, proved the plans
did not have great support.
Conservatives in Hong Kong's legislature narrowly failed to water down
radically the proposals put forward by Governor Chris Patten that have
enraged China. Mr Patten's legislation finally went through by an eight-vote
margin.
'This plan was passed by a slender majority, proving that 'the Patten plan
is accepted by the majority of the people' is nothing but a lie,' Mr Qian
told a meeting of the Preliminary Working Committee, an advisory group
helping China plan Hong Kong's transition.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Vietnam blocks Coca-Cola plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Vietnamese government is reported to have blocked plans by Coca-Cola to
invest in a bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City, where its arch-rival Pepsi
has a local bottling venture already in operation.
The Business Times, a Singapore newspaper, said the State Committee for
Co-operation and Investment told Coca-Cola that it could not start
production, only weeks before the factory was ready to roll.
The state committee argued that south Vietnam was already supplied with
ample soft drink factories and that new facilities must be added 'in harmony
with the demand of the market'.
Even before US President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo with Vietnam
in February Coca-Cola and Pepsi were jockeying to try to establish
themselves as the pre-eminent brand in this country of 70.6m people. Pepsi
won the first skirmish by opening a local bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City
in the south - where three-quarters of the demand for cola is. Pepsi and its
partners - Singaporean investors and Vietnamese local government
organisations - laid out Dollars 10m as an initial investment. Coca-Cola, in
a blaze of publicity, imported 3.6m bottles a month from Singapore and, last
month, opened a Dollars 20m bottling operation in a Hanoi suburb.
This is expected to go into production in the first half of 1995 and
eventually produce 200m bottles of cola a year. A company spokesman in
Singapore said that Coca-Cola would protest against the decision to put its
Ho Chi Minh plant on ice and was optimistic that this appeal would
eventually succeed. In the meantime it would try subcontracting the bottling
of Coke in Ho Chi Minh to Chuong Duong.
Pepsi has appeared to be following a strategy of working with the Ho Chi
Minh authorities to obtain speedy practical returns on the ground, whereas
Coke seems to have put more emphasis on solidifying contacts with the
central authorities in Hanoi.
Coke's Hanoi factory is a joint venture between Coca-Cola Indochina of
Singapore and the state-run Vietnam National Import Export Corp (Vinamilex).
Before this setback Coke said it planned to invest more than Dollars 45m in
Vietnam in the next five years in an effort to catch up and overtake its
rival - much of the money going to revamp an old Ho Chi Minh factory.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Clinton offers Poles funds to adapt to Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton could not give Poland a firm date for membership of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation when he visited Warsaw yesterday, but
he offered what the US administration believes to be the next best thing:
money to help the Polish armed forces convert their equipment and
communications systems so they can work with Nato troops.
In a speech to the Polish parliament, Mr Clinton promised to ask the US
Congress for Dollars 100m next year to help the 21 countries which have
signed up for Nato's Partnership for Peace - a sort of associate membership
 -adapt to Nato norms, with a quarter of the money earmarked for Poland.
'We believe that when Nato does expand - and it will - a democratic Poland
will be a member,' Mr Clinton said.
US officials said the money was very different from the Dollars 10m Mr
Clinton had pledged the day before in Riga to the Baltic Battalion, a
peacekeeping force set up jointly by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The promise of cash drew a rare burst of applause from an otherwise
unenthusiastic Polish parliament, gathered in an extraordinary session to
hear Mr Clinton speak.
But the parliament, no longer controlled by President Lech Walesa's
Solidarity party, clapped only when Mr Clinton ventured a Polish phrase. US
presidents once drew emotional crowds in Poland, but five years after former
President George Bush visited Warsaw, the thrill is gone.
In the past, the US embassy used to pass word of a visiting American
president's itinerary through the grapevine, so that the people of Warsaw
would know where they could go if they wanted to see him, while not a word
would appear in the government-controlled newspapers.
Today, the papers publish the complete route, so people will know where not
to go if they want to avoid the traffic jams caused by the presidential
motorcade.
The crowds that gathered to see Mr Clinton for ceremonies at the tomb of the
unknown soldier, and at the memorial to the 1943 uprising in the Warsaw
ghetto, were respectable but much smaller than those that greeted Mr Bush.
Mr Clinton promised that he would 'not let the Iron Curtain be replaced with
a veil of indifference', and reassured his audience that Russia would not be
allowed a veto over Poland's eventual membership of Nato.

FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBOS bought deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big market action in Royal Bank of Scotland shares led to intense
speculation that Smith New Court, one of the London market's most aggressive
marketmakers, had taken on a block of 20m RBOS shares, equal to 2.5 per cent
of RBOS's issued capital, via a bought deal and sought to place them in the
market.
No details of the trade were forthcoming, but the Seaq ticker revealed that
upwards of 15m shares had been placed in the market at 412p and that there
was a strong possibility that the remaining stock was left with the
securities house.
Talk that the stock had come from Schroders, the merchant bank, were
dismissed by the market, but there were strong suggestions that Scottish
Equitable, the investment institution, might be the seller. RBOS shares lost
8 at 418p.
Other banks eased as institutions reduced holdings in order to pick up what
was seen by some fund managers as cheap stock. Lloyds dipped 2 to 538p.
General Accident was again actively traded, the stock sliding 5 to 566p amid
strong market rumours that one of the City's biggest agency brokers had
tried in vain to place a block of 5m shares in the insurance group, around
1.1 per cent of the issued capital, at 570p a share. There were also
suggestions that the stock would be offered in the market this morning at
560p a share.
Other composites were unsettled by talk that one big UK integrated house had
published a bearish note on the sector. Royal slipped 6 to 246p.
Merchant banks gave another strong performance, still boosted by the recent
BZW buy note. Schroders, after announcing that it was acquiring the rest of
Schroder Wertheim, the US investment bank, rose 14 to 1165p. Kleinwort
Benson put on 15 at 457p, while SG Warburg added 9 at 706p.
Profit-taking saw Wellcome shares dip 7 to 601p.
Smith &amp; Nephew consolidated recent outperformance on perception that the
company has managed to avoid the margin pressures faced by more high profile
rivals. The shares edged ahead to 141 1/2 p.
A buy note from Robert Fleming Securities continued to drive BT shares,
which rose 10 more to 393p on heavy turnover of 10m. The partly-paids added
8 1/2 to 273p, on 5.9m.
Media conglomerate Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, bounced 12 to 582p
after sustained weakness. BZW said the shares were worth 620p in the short
term and dealers said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were also
recommending the stock.
Advertising agency Gold Greenlees Trott put on 5 at 182p after full year
profits came in lower than the previous year's but above forecasts. Analysts
were also heartened by new UK accounts won by the company.
GKN advanced 12 to 581p after James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation
following news of a joint venture with Fiat. The broker also favours T &amp; N,
a penny ahead at 236p. Lucas Industries rose 8 to 182p after a favourable
presentation at Credit Lyonnais Laing.
British Airways and airports group BAA powered ahead after a Smith New Court
recommendation and favourable passenger traffic figures. Shares in the
former put on 9 at 412p on volume of 7.6m, while the latter gained 15 at
918p on 1.6m.
Volume in industrial group BTR rose to 5.3m and it closed 5 ahead at 372p
after news that the European Commission had reduced its 1992 fine on
subsidiary Dunlop Slazenger.

FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mirror benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market whispers that the Sun might be preparing a retreat from the current
newspaper price war battle gave a big lift to Mirror Group Newspapers
shares.
Some traders said they understood that Mr Rupert Murdoch's flagship tabloid
was preparing to raise its cover price by 2p to 22p. News International, the
Sun's UK parent, flatly denied the talk but refused to comment on the length
of time it intended to maintain its current stance.
However, media analysts said the move would make sense as the Sun had
achieved its goal of boosting circulation back above 4m and every penny off
the cover price is a significant blow to profits. Hoare Govett estimates
that, assuming maintained circulation, each penny reduction knocks Pounds
13.1m off full-year profits, which came in last year at Pounds 139m for the
whole group.
Mirror Group was also helped by news that Mercury Asset Management had
raised its stake in the company to 19.01 per cent and that forecasts for
national advertising expenditure had risen sharply. The stock ended 7 better
at 138p on significant turnover of 5m. News International slipped a penny to
228p.

FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Demerger hints lift Thorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leisure to electronics group Thorn EMI was one of the FT-SE 100's best
performers as the market picked up hints of a bullish trading statement at
Thorn's annual meeting next week. News of further disposals from the group's
defence activities is also expected.
The market was also said to be increasingly optimistic about the chances of
demerger for the company's two core businesses, music and rental. That move
would almost certainly see Thorn shares accelerate as the market focused on
the intrinsic value of its premium music production and publishing
operations.
There have been strong rumours that the Thorn board is poised to discuss a
potential demerger which, the market believes, could be completed before
mid-1995.
Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency broker, was a large buyer of Thorn EMI
stock yes-terday. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson puts a break-up value on
Thorn EMI of between 1340p to 1420p and described the shares as a 'strong
buy'.
At the close of business, Thorn EMI shares were 28 higher at 1,026p.
Turnover was a hefty 2.1m.

FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close firmly but volume still
subdued - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market closed very firmly yesterday in spite of the general
uncertainty ahead of the meeting of the G7 countries which opens this
morning in Naples. Although encouraged by both the US Federal Open Market
Committee and the Bundesbank making no move on their respective key interest
rates, markets were worried that the G7 meeting might not bring sufficiently
decisive action on the dollar.
The FT-SE 100 Index gained 17.7 on the day to close at 2,964.4. Shares
opened easier but quickly rose to the day's peak of 2,968 on the Footsie
after bond markets jumped on reports that a leading German banker had
suggested that the Bundesbank might cut rates. The market cooled off when
the German central bank said, following its regular policy meeting, that it
was not moving its key rates.
While some traders warned that the Federal Reserve could still act on the
payroll and unemployment numbers due today, most believed that markets will
now be on hold until next week, when a statement from the G7 meeting is
likely.
The underlying concern in the stock market is that, should the US dollar
come under renewed pressure, the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise
interest rates sharply and unilaterally. This would be likely to react
sharply on thre UK market where fears of higher rates before the end of the
year continue to hover in the background.
Early trading was enlivened by the sale of a 2.5 per cent stake in Royal
Bank of Scotland as, in a deal worth around Pounds 80m, one fund unloaded
its shares. This transaction helped boost the day's Seaq volume total to
567.2m from the 506.2m the previous session. But retail business on
Wednesday was worth only Pounds 989.7m, confirming the fallin equity
business ahead of the G7 talks. Retail business has this week dropped below
the Pounds 1bn daily figure which had been established as an average total.
Non Footsie business made up 53 per cent of yesterday's total, well below
the usual proportion. At 3,454.7, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 16.5
points.
Hopes that interest rates will continue to fall slowly in Germany benefited
shares in those building and construction shares with activities in
continental Europe. UK retail stocks also showed optimism towards interest
rate prospects, moving higher in fairly moderate turnover.
The international blue chips edged higher, brushing off the continued
weakness in the US dollar in which their profits are earned.
Equity strategists remained fairly optimistic towards market prospects for
the third quarter but agreed that, with the bond market still clearly
dominating sentiment, there can be little real progress until the G7 meeting
has been completed and some solution found to the weakness of the US dollar.
BZW, which has cut its year-end target for the FT-SE 100 Share Index to
3,400 from its previous 3,600 target, warns against being 'too dependent on
the gilt-edged market.'
The investment bank stands by its forecast of dividend growth of 10 per cent
in the stock market this year, with similar growth likely in 1995.
Kleinwort Benson Securities, which aims for a Footsie at 3,500 at the end of
the year, and believes that yield strength will be a significant driving
force behind the London market. Inflation and interest rate gloom, it
comments, 'appears overstated.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Light bargain hunting and increased stability in bond and currency markets
brought an advance to stock index futures, although volume remained modest,
writes Joel Kibazo.
After an initial setback in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 which
saw it fall to 2,934 in the first half-hour of trading, the contract moved
steadily ahead for most of the day.
A successful French bond auction boosted both European bond and gilt
markets, encouraging buying of the September contract. Its advance helped to
pull the underlying cash market higher.
The decision by the Bundesbank to make no change to its key interest rates
had no impact on trading, although uncertainty surrounding the dollar
continued.
The firm opening on Wall Street brought further buying and September climbed
to a day's high of 2,982. It closed at 2,970, up 23 from its previous finish
and at a 5-point premium to cash. Volume, at 11,746, showed a slight
improvement.
Turnover in the traded options returned to a low level, totalling only
26,588 lots. The day's activity in the index options brought business of
8,446 in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,217 in the Euro FT-SE. GEC was the
busiest stock option, having 1,431 contracts transacted.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher as interest rate
worries recede

Wall Street
US share prices edged higher across the board yesterday as fears that the
Federal Reserve would raise interest rates after the release of today's June
employment report diminished, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.92 up at 3,688.42, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.25 at 448.38. The American SE composite put
on 1.10 at 424.65 and the Nasdaq composite added 5.53 at 706.53. NYSE volume
was moderate at 259.7m shares.
The market's attention remained squarely focused on monetary policy
throughout the day. After the meeting of the Fed's open market committee
ended on Wednesday with no apparent change in policy, traders and investors
began to worry about today's employment figures for June.
Some analysts believed that the Fed had held off from lifting interest rates
on Wednesday only because it wanted to see how the June jobs data would come
out. The same analysts warned that if the figures showed stronger than
expected growth in the labour market, then the Fed would probably put up
rates to slow the economy down.
By yesterday, however, interest rate fears had receded. Analysts predicted
that the jobs data would show a rise of about 280,000 in non-farm payrolls
in June, and believed that the increase would have to be substantially
larger than that for the Fed to be persuaded to raise rates. An early
advance in bond prices helped equities to gain ground during the morning
session, and stocks held on to their rises later in the day when bonds
retreated.
Among individual stocks, the cyclicals which led the market higher on
Wednesday were mixed. International Paper added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 68
7/8 and General Electric firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 , but
Caterpillar eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 104 3/8 and Alcoa fell Dollars 1
5/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 .
Wal-Mart firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 , lifted by news of a 9.3 per
cent rise in same-store sales during June. Another retailer, Best Buy,
dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8 on disappointing sales.
CBS declined Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 308 1/2 as speculation mounted that
entertainment giant Walt Disney is seeking some sort of alliance with CBS
and its new merger partner QVC. If the story is true, it would scupper the
hopes of investors who were looking to Disney as a possible rival bidder for
CBS.
On the Nasdaq market, Snapple Beverage receded Dollars 1 1/16 to Dollars 19
1/4 after brokerage house Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from a buy to
a hold. Future Now tumbled Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 7 3/4 after the company
announced that it would take a second-quarter charge of between Dollars 30m
and Dollars 45m to cover a restructuring.
Canada
Toronto ended higher after a rally sparked by easing interest rate fears and
bargain hunting, and traders said the market mood is on an upswing.
The TSE 300 index strengthened 36.5 to 4,079.9 and turnover was 58.9m shares
valued at CDollars 679m. This marked a resurgence in volume which has been
subdued this week as players hugged the sidelines.
Rises led declines by 358 to 301. Of the 14 sub-group indices, 11 ploughed
ahead. Transportation jumped 148.66, or 3.52 per cent, to 4,368.0.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil ahead as Cardoso gains in
opinion poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo closed 4.04 per cent higher in local currency terms in strong
volume after a poll showed that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former
economy minister, had narrowed the lead of Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva,
the left-wing frontrunner, in the presidential election race.
The Bovespa index was ahead 1,515 at 39,050, after an early peak of 39,214.
Volume reached RDollars 260.8m (Dollars 286.6m).
Some brokers said that they had seen foreign clients selling in the market,
but they added that most foreigners seemed to be staying away.
Most blue chips closed higher, with Telebras preferred showing an advance of
2.51 per cent at RDollars 40.9, Petrobras preferred up 3.6 per cent at
RDollars 115.0 and Eletrobras preferred 6.02 per cent stronger at RDollars
229.0.
Mexico
Equities finished higher, helped by Telefonos de Mexico's advance on Wall
Street and the absence of an interest rate increase from the US Federal
Reserve.
The IPC index closed 24.40, or 1.06 per cent, firmer at 2,334.39. At the end
of 1993 the IPC stood at 2,602.63.

Johannesburg drew support from firming world markets, but a low level of

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei fails to find
direction but Sydney falls 1.5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
Tokyo would have been happier with a day's holiday, said dealers, as first
section turnover fell from 367.5m shares to an estimated 270m, and the
Nikkei index ended marginally easier, agencies report.
Uncertainty over currency direction and investor reluctance to move actively
ahead of the Group of Seven (G7) summit and settlement of July options kept
trade muted.
The three-day G7 summit in Naples, and July options settlement (SQ) both
start today. A Sanyo Securities trader said active trade was discouraged by
SQ and the fact that people know no fresh factors will emerge from the
summit.
'I wouldn't say that sentiment is bad,' he added. 'People have been going
for individual issues, especially stock linked to Aids and consumer
spending.'
For example, Kissei Pharmaceutical ended Y170 higher at Y4,420, and Japan
Energy Y13 better at Y487 on brisk turnover of 9.51m shares.
The Nikkei 225 average finished 9.01 down at 20,620.02, after a day's high
of 20.724.24 and low of 20,594.12. Mr Michio Sugita, general manager at
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, said the market was slightly depressed by a
flurry of selling by a foreign securities house just before the close, but
dealers added that it picked up again as index-linked buying kicked in.
The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 2.22 off at 1,668.43 and
the Nikkei 300 eased 0.58 to 302.85, while falls led advances by 539 to 381,
with 246 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 5.37 at
1,356.82.
Advancing sectors were led by rolling stock, airlines, pharmaceuticals,
trucking, autos, credit/lease and food. The railways and buses sector posted
the largest loss, followed by ceramics, brokerages, miscellaneous
manufacturing, warehouses, retail and shipbuilding.
Hanwa fell Y21 to Y587 on talk that its main creditor or creditors may stop
helping in the restructuring of the financially troubled company.
Terumo, a market star in the previous two days, retreated Y50 to Y1,170 on
brisk profit-taking following a strong gain on its involvement in the
development of a three-dimensional television screen.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets were mixed, as they remained wary about the outlook for
US interest rates.
SYDNEY fell sharply in afternoon trade, disheartened by a sell-off on the
futures market and weaker blue chips. The All Ordinaries index tumbled 29.0,
or 1.5 per cent, to 1,962.2.
Western Mining, which on Wednesday announced an alumina merger with Alcoa,
dipped 29 cents, or 4.1 per cent, to a two-month low of ADollars 6.73.
Among blue chip stocks, BHP lost 32 cents at ADollars 17.68, CRA fell 36
cents to ADollars 17.70 and News Corp, which on Wednesday said it had
purchased a 1.7 per cent stake in rival newspaper group John Fairfax
Holdings, dropped 14 cents to ADollars 8.16. Fairfax closed 10 cents, or 3.7
per cent, firmer at ADollars 2.80.
HONG KONG saw early losses reversed as a dip below 8,300 in the Hang Seng
index triggered bargain hunting. The index ended a net 35.94 up at 8,490.86
in turnover that rose to a provisional HKDollars 3.2bn from Wednesday's
HKDollars 1.9bn.
The early decline was attributed to news that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
had reported a 34 per cent drop in mortgage lending in June.
HSBC finished steady at HKDollars 83, but among property issues, Cheung Kong
slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 31.30, Henderson Land 20 cents to HKDollars
33.90 and Hongkong Land 25 cents to HKDollars 18.55. Sun Hung Kai Properties
put on 50 cents at HKDollars 42.70.
WELLINGTON edged lower, the NZSE-40 Capital index shedding 17.88 to
1,966.25, just off the year's low of 1,961.30 set on May 27. Turnover picked
up, however, to a healthy NZDollars 46.3m as investors continued to switch
to larger stocks exposed to recovering commodity prices and the world
economy, and away from second liners.
Fay Richwhite, the merchant bank, fell 10 cents to 60 cents after saying on
Wednesday that it would just break even for the year.
MANILA firmed slightly at the close on some late bargain hunting in PLDT and
Manila Electric. The composite index added 1.43 at 2,629.23.
The newly listed SM Prime Holdings cornered the bulk of trading but ended
unchanged at 5.50 pesos. PLDT stayed at its year's low of 1,540 pesos, but
Meralco 'B' shares, open to all investors, climbed 2.3 per cent to 332.50
pesos.
SEOUL was pulled down by sales of shares heavily weighted on the index, but
elsewhere there were selective gains in small and medium-capitalised shares.
The composite index lost 7.77 at 945.71.
Investment trust companies were seen to be active sellers ahead of an August
10 deadline for repaying Won2,100bn in soft loans to the central bank.
TAIPEI saw early gains eroded and closed slightly lower, but brokers
expected that strong demand for electronics and petrochemicals would
continue to support the market in the near term.
The weighted index fell 19.84 to 6,095.34 in turnover that remained active
at TDollars 75bn, but below Wednesday's TDollars 86.52bn.
SINGAPORE was broadly lower on a lack of institutional interest and the
Straits Times Industrial index receded 20.76 to 2,146.01. Much of the
decline was attributed to Fraser &amp; Neave, down 70 cents at SDollars 15.70 on
news that its Coca-Cola venture in Ho Chi Mihn has been put on hold.
KUALA LUMPUR finished softer in moderate trade, pressured by blue-chip
selling. The composite index dipped 13.99 to 981.37.
Among blue chips, Tenaga was marked 50 cents lower to MDollars 13.30 after a
brokerage report suggested that the power giant would be adversely affected
by competition from independent producers after the launch of a Malaysian
power grid code.
BANGKOK rebounded from the day's lows on a flurry of last-minute buying. The
SET index closed 5.41 higher at 1,302.86.
Jasmine International, which made its debut on the market, closed at Bt320
compared with its initial public offering price of Bt345.
BOMBAY ended lower after a midsession recovery was not sustained. The BSE
30-share index retreated 49.72 to 4,048.61, with local investors unwilling
to commit fresh funds.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Banks recover on intraday
rises in Dollars and bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of action on the interest rate front, with the Bundesbank and
the Bank of France leaving key interest rates unchanged and no decision yet
in the US, was accompanied by an intraday recovery in the dollar and in bond
markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, neither recovery was sustained in the late afternoon and
accompanying equity gains, particularly in German and French banking stocks,
remain to be tested today.
FRANKFURT saw a rise of 25 basis points in mid-afternoon in the September
bund future and the Dax index, up 8.15 to 2,043.85 on the session, increased
to an Ibis-indicated 2,049.10 at the end of the day.
In banks, Deutsche rose DM8 to DM708 and Dresdner by DM5.50 to DM378.
Dealers said that the sector had looked very oversold by the end of June and
that Deutsche, in particular, seemed finally to have dealt with the
repercussions of the Schneider property affair.
Turnover stayed thin, unchanged at DM4.6bn. On that basis, dealers were
inclined to question a couple of gains in the engineering and metals sector,
where Klockner-Werke advanced DM8.80, or 6.1 per cent, to DM153.90 and
Metallgesellschaft put on DM5.70 at DM203.50.
K-W, upgraded in the spring by Flemings and Bank Julius Bar on its move from
steel into the engineering sector, was apparently the subject of a skirmish
between an obstinate seller, and a buyer who wanted to test the market.
Metallgesellschaft, said the dealers, was moving slowly compared with the
acceleration which took it, temporarily, to a year's high of DM286 in May.
PARIS saw a strong banking performance, particularly from Credit Local, up
FFr24, or 6.6 per cent, to FFr387, and Credit Lyonnais, FFr31, or 6.8 per
cent, better at FFr489, as the CAC-40 index rose 31.76, or 1.7 per cent, to
1,920.75.
BNP, CCF and Paribas were all around 2 per cent better. Mr Keith Baird of
Kleinwort Benson looked for a recovery in the sector at the beginning of
this month, saying that French banks are heavily geared to falling bad debts
as the economy begins to grow again, while efficiency is improving.
Credit Local, he said, was regarded as a low risk business as a municipal
lending agency, and in that context the 22 per cent rise in lending reported
for the first half of the current year looked 'quite impressive'. Credit
Lyonnais, he added, said on Wednesday that it would cut 10 per cent from its
domestic staff numbers over the next three years.
Turnover stayed low at FFr2.8bn. Valeo lifted the automotive components
sector with a 9.4 per cent rise in first-half sales, and its own shares by
FFr10, or 3.9 per cent, to FFr270. Michelin tagged along, up FFr9.20, or 4.1
per cent, at FFr235.20.
ZURICH was edgy after James Capel in London downgraded Roche to a hold,
taking it off the buy list for the first time in five years. The SMI index
dipped 8.4 to 2,590.5.
Roche certificates fell SFr200, or 3.2 per cent, to SFr6,080 after Mr Andrew
Tivenan at Capel said the downgrade was the result of the company's
valuation relative to the Swiss market and other pharmaceuticals worldwide,
its exposure to the weak dollar and an expected decline in financial
earnings due to weak markets.
Banks and insurers edged higher on the view that they would be less affected
than industrials in the short term by a weak dollar. UBS and SBC each rose
SFr4 to SFr1,175 and SFr401 respectively. Nestle dipped SFr2 to SFr1,111.
In his latest monthly review, Mr Simon Marshall-Lockyer at Kleinwort Benson
commented that the out-of-favour financials and Nestle seemed to have
reached a valuation floor following massive underperformance in recent
months. He expected the stocks to outperform short term and recommended
buying Nestle and SBC, both of which were at the bottom of their trading and
valuation ranges.
MILAN was disappointed by the lack of further details on budget proposals
and the Comit index slipped 4.27 to 691.32 in thin trade.
Plans for preliminary details of the budget to be announced after a cabinet
meeting were scrapped when Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was
absent as he prepared for the G7 summit in Naples.
Telecoms provided a bright spot after reports that the cellular business of
Sip, the national telephone operator, could be split off and receive
financial autonomy. Sip ended L105 higher at L4,150, while Stet, the holding
company, added L85 at L5,105.
Ina, the newly privatised insurer, gave up L30 on its second day of trading
to return to the placing price of L2,400. Volume fell sharply from 37.4m to
10.7m shares.
MADRID tried to stage a technical rally, lifted by the initial recovery in
global bond markets, but it proved more sensitive than most to their
subsequent decline and the uneven opening of equities on Wall Street.
Turnover stayed low at Pta26.7bn as the general index closed only 0.22
higher on the day at 291.65.
In utilities, the downgrading of Endesa continued, with the shares losing
Pta110, or 2 per cent, at Pta5,390; however, this was balanced by a gain of
Pta100, or 2.7 per cent, in the oil company Repsol to Pta3,755.
AMSTERDAM edged higher in thin trade ahead of the G7 meeting, and the AEX
index rose 0.86 to 386.22.
KLM gave back some of its recent gains, losing 70 cents to Fl 52.10 after
its June traffic figures failed to match some expectations.
Pakhoed rebounded after recent weakness, picking up Fl 1.10 to Fl 47.90.
STOCKHOLM saw rebounds in the debt market and in the Swedish crown, and the
Affarsvarlden General index rose 15.0 to 1,349.70, with banks and insurance
stocks up some 3.5 per cent, and construction and real estate shares almost
2.5 per cent better.
HELSINKI, an early closing market, reflected the better part of the day's
sentiment in bonds, and the Hex index rose 37.8, or 2.2 per cent, to 1,743.3
with banks up 2.4 per cent and Nokia FM14 better at FM468.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Markets Report: No Buba rate move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision yesterday by the Bundesbank council to leave official German
interest rates unchanged removed another prop from beneath the US dollar,
writes Philip Gawith.
Dollar bulls had hoped that lower German rates would lend support to the US
currency, which nevertheless closed firmer in London at Y99.015 from Y98.125
and DM1.5745 from DM1.5685. In New York it ended at Y98.60 and DM1.5715.
The Bundesbank left the discount rate at 4.5 per cent and the Lombard
emergency financing rate at 6 per cent.
The market is increasingly convinced that no dollar support package will be
forthcoming, though some observers are becoming concerned that the pat
consensus is playing into the hands of the central banks.
The flip side of dollar weakness continues to be a strong D-Mark and weak
sterling. The pound fell further to DM2.4246 from DM2.4303. In Italy,
meanwhile, lira weakness persisted, the Italian currency finishing at L997.1
against the D-Mark from L995.5, amid rumours of ministers resigning.
The South African financial rand recovered some ground after the shock
resignation of Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, earlier this week. It closed
at R4.765 per dollar from R4.84.
Traders said activity in the market was fairly quiet ahead of today's US
labour market data, and the G7 summit that starts in Naples.
The main development was the persistence of the string of G7 officials
downplaying the current dollar weakness. Joining the list of those
apparently unconcerned by the dollar, or at least not expecting it to be
discussed in Naples, were Japanese and British officials, as well as Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister.
Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, commented:
'People are slowly pricing in the realisation that nothing much is coming
out of this G7 meeting. The dollar is a long way down the agenda at Naples.'
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior international economist at UBS in London, said
this consensus 'increased the scope for the authorities to do something'.
But he said he was not convinced that the market was yet short enough (of
dollars) for intervention alone to achieve anything, or that the G7 would
provide other policy signals, such as concerted rate changes, that would
complement intervention.
'If we come in on Monday to an innocuous communique, the market will
interpret that as a signal to sell the dollar again,' said Mr Cunningham.
Some observers believe, however, that the central banks have played their
hand well this week, and thus limited the downside for the US currency.
Expectations have now been so downplayed that no action on Monday will
hardly be cause for surprise or disappointment.
On the other hand, if the G7 did come up with a policy of co-ordinated rate
moves and intervention this weekend, 'the market would be totally
shell-shocked', in the words of an economist at a leading European bank. He
said he was 'very suspicious' of the long string of officials downplaying
dollar weakness and had advised clients to cover their short dollar
positions.
Another factor becoming an issue is the strength of the D-Mark. Although the
Bundesbank's reluctance to participate in the last round of intervention to
support the dollar is a poorly kept secret, the weakness of the lira,
Swedish krona and French franc is probably starting to cause concern.
So while it may be true that DM1.57 to the dollar is probably not, in
itself, a level that need concern the authorities, the ramifications of this
may be more serious. One analyst went so far as to say that the market was
'not far from a mini-ERM crisis'.
Italian financial markets were buffeted by rumours about tensions in the
government, and market disappointment that the cabinet made no announcement
about measures to curb the budget deficit, running above 10 per cent of GDP,
with the stock of debt equivalent to 120 per cent of GDP.
Rumours of ministerial resignations were emphatically denied by Mr
Berlusconi, who is hosting the G7 summit. A cabinet official also said that
deficit projections would be available next week, after the G7 meeting.
The Swedish krona regained some ground against the D-Mark to end at
SKr4.979, from SKr5.004 on Wednesday, but Belgium, also seen as a high debt
country, saw its currency slip further to BFr20.70 from BFr20.67 per D-Mark.
In the money markets, German call money eased to about 4.84/4.95 per cent
from about 5 per cent, ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting. Money
conditions were fairly easy and some traders thought there might be a cut in
official rates.
In the UK the Bank of England supplied Pounds 724m liquidity to the money
markets after forecasting a Pounds 700m shortage. Overnight money traded
between 1 1/2 and 5 1/4 per cent.
Volumes in the futures markets were better than in recent days, with the

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Auctions are in recess in Australia until the end of this month and raw wool
costs in the meantime are measured by what merchants assess in relation to
business and the market prospect. No weakness is apparent at present. On the
contrary, with stockpile sales again at encouraging levels last week, and
the Garnaut disposal quotas effectively taken up for July and August
already, the outlook appears at least firm. There was also good demand in
Europe not only for stockpile wool, but for stockpiled tops which were
combed some time ago on behalf of the Australian Wool Corporation then in
charge. This adds to the impression that combs at present are busy on
present orders and there is little or no slack to be taken up to meet
short-term buying interest. Prices are without wool auction guidance but
must be described as firm.

<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures tumbled in the afternoon on news
that Brazil was ready to sell 5m bags (60kg each) on the internal market to
calm prices. The September position ended Dollars 50 down at Dollars 3,095 a
tonne after earlier plunging Dollars 100.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices were supported by commission
house buying, and though they closed sharply lower on the day the overall
uptrend remained intact, dealers said. ALUMINIUM initially buckled when
copper came under pressure, but rallied after finding support below Dollars
1,500 a tonne.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru gets oil privatisation
drive into gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation of the core assets of Petroperu, Peru's state oil and gas
company, has finally got off the ground with the release this week of a
preliminary information memorandum.
The strategy, devised by Merrill Lynch after technical studies by Arthur D.
Little and other industry experts, is to split the company into 11 business
units. For most of these a 60 per cent stake will be offered to private
sector operators, with the state retaining 40 per cent. Auctions, by sealed
bids, will start in October.
Some analysts still question the decision to dismember the integrated
company for sell-off. Its assets are very mixed, with the upstream
operations more attractive than the elderly refineries.
Two major oilfields, known as Blocks 8 and X, have proven reserves of 100m
and 45m barrels respectively. Current output from the former, located in the
northern jungle's Maranon basin, is 33,000 barrels a day. Block X, in the
northern coastal basin of Talara, produces some 15,000 b/d.
For sale separately are four refineries: La Pampilla, the largest, which
serves Lima and the coast; medium-sized Talara on the north coast; the small
refinery and terminal at Iquitos on the Amazon River; and Conchan, just
south of the capital, which is the sole asphalt producer for the Lima
market. Conchan twice failed to find a buyer when offered at auction in late
1992.
Most important of the remaining five business units is the Japanese-built
pipeline, the only means of transporting crude from the northern jungle
fields to the Talara terminal. It now operates at about 40 per cent of its
200,000 b/d capacity and will be offered as a renewable concession for 10
years at a time.
Other Petroperu assets up for sale are a gas gathering system, with storage
facilities and pipeline; marine terminals and airport fuel plants; the
liquefied petroleum gas storage facility in Lima's port of Callao; a
lubricants blending plant; and electric power generating facilities in the
Talara region.
In line with the government's objective of creating competition in the local
market, bidders will be subject to certain restrictions: the future operator
of La Pampilla, for example, will be barred from purchasing Talara, Conchan
or the Callao terminal.
Petroperu was created in 1969 when General Velasco's left-wing military
regime nationalised the assets of International Petroleum Corporation (a
subsidiary of Exxon), Chevron and Belco. The company was charged with all
Peru's oil-related activities, from exploration through refining to sales
and distribution.
In the early years, the state made big investments and some major finds. The
200,000 b/d northern pipeline was built with Japanese financing and the
refineries at Talara and La Pampilla were expanded.
Decline set in, however, when the international oil price slumped in the
early 1980s. The state proved a poor manager, swelling Petroperu's payroll
with political appointees and pursuing incoherent pricing policies that left
the company badly decapitalised. Foreign investment flows dwindled, then
disappeared altogether in the mid-1980s.
Peru's crude oil production slumped from 1982's peak of 195,000 b/d to
115,000 b/d in 1991. From being an oil exporter, the country became a net
importer. Exploration came to a virtual standstill and reserves shrank to
360m barrels at the end of 1993.
New oil legislation passed in August 1993 was designed to attract foreign
investors back and, to a certain extent, is doing so. Perupetro, a small
state agency, now promotes, negotiates and administers contracts for
exploration and production, while Petroperu must compete on equal terms with
the private sector.
Since 1993, 11 contracts have been negotiated by private oil companies -
including Petrotech and Maple Gas of the US and China's Sapet, a subsidiary
of China National Petroleum. Perupetro has a similar number of further
contracts in the pipeline with, among others, Arco of the US, Elf Aquitaine
of France and Spain's Repsol. Occidental Petroleum, Peru's old-established
and biggest producer, has also embarked on new exploration and development
ventures.
Modest investments by private operators - and by a now financially-viable
Petroperu - are starting to have an impact on output. This year's First
quarter production, at 130,000 b/d, was 5 per cent higher than 1993's. But
the oil trade deficit for the quarter still cost the country almost Dollars
18m.
Perupetro's new president Mr Alberto Bruce is upbeat about prospects.
'Investors are flocking in,' he says, attributing fresh interest to
increased confidence in Peruvian economic management, the attractive legal
framework and the decline of terrorism. 'At this rate, we'll have to buy
bits of Brazil and Argentina to satisfy all of them.'
But Peruvian production costs are high and, so far, the promising geology
has failed to throw up any major strikes comparable with Colombia and
Ecuador's. By far Peru's biggest prospect so far is the huge Camisea gas
fields, discovered in 1986 by Royal Dutch Shell. The company is currently
updating feasibility studies and could sign a development contract, perhaps
worth Dollars 2bn, late next year.
Peru's immediate future looks to be in the hands of the smaller
international and national operator. Nut that is not necessarily a
disadvantage, according to Mr Roger Alderson, chief executive of Great
Western Resources, a medium-sized company prepared to invest Dollars 80m in
Peru over the next five years.
'As in Colombia, we smaller firms come in, take the risks and attract the
big fish once we start showing results,' he says. 'Peru continues to be the
great unexplored.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining share 'indigestion'
approaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mining companies have raised at least USDollars 5.584bn from the issue of
shares and convertibles so far this year, topping the Dollars 4.84bn they
collected in the whole of 1993.
Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at the Ord Minnett financial services group, who
collated the statistics, says last year's total 'looked a pretty impressive
number' but 1994's will put it in the shade.
There is at least another Dollars 2bn of equity potentially to be offered to
investors during the rest of this year, he says, and warns: 'one can't help
feeling that the gourmet grazing on mining equities is rapidly approaching
indigestion'.
He points out that shares in some of the big new issues in the first half of
1994 - Ashanti Gold Fields (which raised Dollars 320m); Santa Fe Gold
(Dollars 252m) and Falconbridge (Dollars 1bn) are all trading below their
issue prices.
According to Mr Hatch, North American mining companies so far this year have
raised Dollars 2.441bn; Australian companies have raised USDollars 1.731bn;
European companies Dollars 631m; African companies Dollars 511m; and Dollars
270m was raised by mining companies based elsewhere in the world.
He points out, moreover, that he has tracked only substantial issues and
there were certainly more, particularly in North America, that were not
included.
Included in the total raised so far by Australian mining companies is the
USDollars 525m being asked for by Western Mining to help pay for its deal
with Alcoa of the US, announced this week.
Other capital-raising operations expected this year include Royal
Dutch/Shell's sale of some Australian mining assets for about USDollars
300m; the USDollars 450m flotation in Australia of a company with an
interest in the proposed Lihir Island gold mine in Papua New Guinea; a share
sale by Alcan Australia to net about USDollars 230m; and a rights issue by
Comalco.
Elsewhere in the world, a sale of shares in Outokumpu of Finland is to raise
Dollars 276m; Metallgesellschaft is expected to sell its controlling
interest in Metall Mining of Canada, which might raise USDollars 300m; while
in the UK the London-listed Bakyrchik Gold will be seeking about Dollars
120m for expansion before the year-end.
In North America nearly every substantial mining company has made a 'shelf'
registration - an indication to the authorities that it might soon issue new
shares. Zeigler Coal, the fourth-largest US coal company, recently announced
it will raise about Dollars 160m.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diouf makes a vigorous start to
FAO reform - John Madeley talks to the new director-general of the United
Nations' food and agriculture agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Diouf of Senegal, the first African to lead the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organisation, is planning the most radical shake up of
the agency since it was formed in 1945.
The FAO is both the largest UN agency and largest international organisation
dealing with food and agricultural issues. Six months after taking over as
its director-general, Mr Diouf called for urgent action to tackle the
serious food problems in Africa and for FAO to be re-invigorated, 'making it
more effective in a renewed war on hunger and malnutrition'.
With a two-year budget of Dollars 673m, the agency has come in for criticism
for its bureaucracy and for basing professional staff mostly at its Rome
headquarters. But after years of little change, staff are heading out of
Rome, meetings are being cut and some Dollars 40m of the budget has been
re-allocated to field-orientated programmes for 'food security and
preventive measures against pests and diseases', says the new
director-general.
He wants more of the FAO's money to be used to help increase the
availability of food in areas where it is short, with the emphasis on
sustainable production.
A 'war on hunger' needs to waged, Mr Diouf stresses, especially in 78
low-income, food-deficit countries, 45 of them African. 'Governments of
developing countries will have to adopt efficient policies and programmes to
foster agricultural production. They need to re-allocate the means to invest
in agriculture and rural development,' he says.
But production is only part of the problem, Mr Diouf points out, calling for
'a frontal attack on poverty to be be launched to allow the rural poor to
have the income needed to buy food'.
He has urged international financing institutions to redirect their funds in
favour of the agricultural and rural sector in the form of investment for
basic infrastructure. As part of the FAO shake up, a special programme to
support food security in food-deficit countries has been launched, with a
new department of sustainable development being set up, together and a
technical co-operation department to 'enable FAO to be more responsive to
the needs of its members', says Mr Diouf.
A new division has been set up to deal with with the advancement of women
'who,' the director-general points out, 'produce well over 50 per cent of
the developing world's food'. In addition a new Agriculture and Economic
Development Analysis Division has been established to improve the agency's
analysis of macro- and micro-economic issues.
Nearly 200 of FAO's 1,500 Rome-based experts are being relocated to Third
World national offices, which are also being reinforced with local expertise
 -'a new approach to the problem', claims Mr Diouf.
He warns that a food crisis is emerging in eastern Africa, with 34m people
threatened by famine, and that 'the situation is worsening dramatically in
some parts of the sub-continent. 'We should act in such a way as to avoid
the regular occurrence of famine, due to drought in particular, and make
sure that we deal with the problem of water management,' he says. 'In
Africa, we have to ensure that the 5,100bn cubic metres of water from rivers
that go to the sea every year are controlled and used for the benefit of the
agricultural producer. Without water control, there is no production'.
FAO intends to launch projects, Mr Diouf says, that will show that even
where there is drought 'we are able to have adequate protection'.
'We will prepare bankable projects for the infrastructure needed, and hope
that through this process, and also by convincing governments of water
management, adequate resources will be invested'.
With global population projected to rise by 50 per cent in next 30 years, Mr
Diouf points out that land availability per person is already declining 'and
will decline further. There is less land for more people, and a tendency for
farmers to move to marginal lands. Some areas will be used more intensively.
If there is no technological breakthrough that allows the population to
produce more yet preserve the value of the land, there is no solution'.
He believes that alongside policies to ensure that population growth rates
are lowered through the improvement of the economic conditions, 'we in
agriculture have the responsibility to ensure that there are technologies
which are more efficient, yet respect the environment. That is the only
way'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Property: From domes to towers - John Barham reports on the
changing face of Buenos Aires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, the sight of a busy building site in Buenos Aires provoked
in passers-by a look of mild curiosity. Their response was understandable:
there had been little construction activity in the city over the previous
decade. Today, building sites are blossoming throughout the city. In fact,
since 1991 the city centre, particularly its cramped business district, has
become one big building site.
Years of runaway inflation and economic decline had depressed construction
to less than 100,000 square metres a year by the late 1980s. Today total new
constructions have increased to 2m sq m a year.
This leap in building activity is the consequence of the free-market reforms
unveiled by President Carlos Menem in 1989. The market liberalisation
ushered in a construction boom, low inflation (from a peak of 200 per cent a
month to 0.1 per cent a month today), privatisation and economic growth of 6
per cent a year.
Mr Eduardo Elsztain, president of IRSA, Argentina's only quoted property
developer, said: 'Economic stability led to a rise in property values, and
encouraged many Argentines to bring back their 'flight capital' from abroad
to invest in property at home.'
Initially, much of this renewed domestic investor demand was used to mop up
the property surplus from the previous upswing, which petered out in 1980.
But such has been the pace of demand since the early 1990s that there is
already a shortage of prime office accommodation.
Mr Alberto Cardello of surveyors Inverlad, the local associate of UK
property company Richard Ellis, estimates that construction of offices,
apartments and shops has risen 20-fold since the low point in 1989. Seven
office blocks are currently going up within a stone's throw of each other on
one of the last vacant plots of land in the city's business district. When
completed, the new buildings will increase Argentina's 2.5m sq m stock of
office space by one-fifth.
As the market has become more liquid, more property deals are being
concluded, including many with international companies attracted to the city
as operators of privatised utilities. But rising values are also forcing
some companies to think twice about Buenos Aires: a year ago, IBM failed to
sell and lease back its Buenos Aires headquarters after it refused to pay
the high rent demanded by the prospective purchasers.
While rents for new high-rise offices in Buenos Aires remain high,
developers in the city say rents for old offices in the crowded financial
district are falling. In addition, industry observers warn that too much
uncontrolled development could soon lead to a surplus. Critics point, for
instance, to the plans unveiled by the property arm of the Argentine food
giant, Bunge y Born, as an example of constructions which may ultimately lie
empty.
Mr Juan Goni, general manager of the property division, said the company has
a Dollars 100m portfolio of empty land which it is trading to generate cash
to reinvest in property. One project under way is a Dollars 65m, 26-floor
office block in the city's business district, jointly funded by Bunge, the
Aoki Corp of Japan and a local construction group. 'We think that those who
had the courage and went ahead first (with developments) will be successful.
I am not sure about those who came later,' said Mr Goni.
In any event, despite concerns in the office sector, developers remain
bullish, largely because of optimism about the residential and retail
property sectors.
The availability of relatively cheap 15 per cent mortgages - until three
years ago mortgages were unavailable - are drawing the middle class into the
property market for the first time in a generation. For years home ownership
has been the preserve of those able to pay in cash.
To make housing more widely available, President Menem last week unveiled a
four-year programme to build 166,000 homes. The properties, costing between
Dollars 40,000 and Dollars 50,000, would be financed by private financial
institutions. The government is assisting with further dismantling of
planning regulations.
Investor interest has also honed in on shopping centres: French-owned
Carrefour, Argentina's leading retailer, recently bought a Dollars 20m plot
in Buenos Aires on which to build its eighth hypermarket in Argentina.
Wal-Mart of the US is to pay Bunge Dollars 20m for a 100,000 sq m former
factory site where it will erect a hyper-market, its first in Argentina.
IRSA has begun work on a project to convert Buenos Aires' central market
into a shopping and housing complex. The company paid Dollars 54.6m for the
site in a run-down district of the city.
The past fours years of frenetic activity has inevitably provoked criticism
from people who say the dash for high-rise structures is doing untold damage
to the city's distinctive Parisian architectural character. The outcome has
been a rapid disfigurement of Buenos Aires' skyline of cupolas and domes;
today, the skyline is dominated by glass and steel towers. There are some
notable exceptions. Argentine-born architect Cesar Pelli - who designed the
Canary Wharf tower in London's docklands - has created a widely-admired
29,000 sq m office block, inspired by the smooth, curved lines of a ship's
hull.
Opponents of government housing and inner-city policies have singled out for
criticism the run-down Retiro railway station, which the authorities hope to
turn into a vast shopping/conference/exhibition complex. Mr Antonio Cartana,
the city's ombudsman, said: 'Retiro is not a renovation project, but the
clearest and most direct manifestation of the causes of urban and social
collapse - profit-seeking interventions by those connected to the
government.'
Developers also point to an over-stretched transport and utility
infrastructure and the absence of clear planning regulations as impediments
to potential developments.
Buenos Aires' legislative council, for instance, often grants planning
permission that runs counter to its own zoning regulations, which are
designed to restrict property constructions in certain areas. As a result,
says Mr Roberto Salem, the city's urban planning and environment secretary,
'you get a 50-storey building on a site that is meant for 10 storeys. These
exceptions are the result of influence, politics and lobbying. It's sad to
recognise it, but it is true.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: French auction leads Europe to firmer
ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds ended a choppy session on a firmer tone, supported
by a successful auction of long-dated French government bonds and
short-covering in the futures markets. However, investors continued to keep
a low profile, put off by this week's high concentration of potentially
market-moving events: Tuesday and Wednesday's meeting of the Federal
Reserve's open market committee, yesterday's Bundesbank council meeting,
today's US jobs data for June and the weekend summit of the Group of Seven
industrial nations in Naples.
After outperforming the rest of Europe on Wednesday, the German bond market
was overtaken by most of its neighbours yesterday and ended little changed.
The September bund future on Liffe rose 0.05 point to 92.00.
The bund market's allure as a safe haven in times of turmoil had prompted
heavy switching into bunds out of other markets earlier this week, causing
yield spreads over Germany to widen dramatically.
However, that was partially reversed yesterday, with some spreads narrowing
back sharply.
The main beneficiary of the this trend was France, where a well-received
auction of 10-year and 30-year bonds gave the market a lift. The French
10-year yield spread over bunds narrowed to 52 basis points, from 63 on
Wednesday.
The Treasury sold a total of FFr19.337bn in bonds, at the lower end of the
government's FFr19bn to FFr21bn pre-announced range.
The bulk of paper was allocated in the 6.75 per cent bonds due 2004, which
saw a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.4 times. The cover on the 6 per cent bond due
2025 was even higher at 3.3 times.
Most of the paper was said to have been taken by primary dealers, with
investors largely abstaining.
UK gilts ended another trendless day firmer, supported by the French
market's strength and early institutional buying.
However, traders said cash volume remained thin as many investors remained
sidelined, awaiting today's US data and the G7 summit.
The September long gilt future on Liffe rose  25/32 to 100 19/32 .
Danish bonds rallied sharply after the central bank cut its two-week
repurchase rate by 10 basis points. The 10-year benchmark bond rose nearly a
point, causing the yield spread over Germany to narrow to around 130 basis
points, from 142 at Wednesday's close.
US Treasury prices across the maturity range barely moved yesterday amid
trading subdued by the unwillingness of participants to commit funds to the
market ahead of today's important jobs figures.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond, which had inched
higher during the morning, was down  1/16 at 84 1/4 , yielding 7.594 per
cent. There was a similar lack of movement at the short end, where the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to carry a yield of 6.084 per
cent.
After this week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market
committee ended without any sign of a move in interest rates, the attention
of investors and traders switched to the June employment report, which is
due this morning.
Most analysts believed the FOMC chose not to change monetary policy because
it wanted to see what the June jobs numbers would say about economic
conditions.
Analysts said yesterday that if the data revealed a further strengthening in
the economy, then the Fed might choose to raise rates again to slow the pace
of economic activity. If the figures come in at or below the consensus
forecast of a 284,000 rise in non-farm payrolls, then the Fed would be more
likely to leave monetary policy unchanged.
Either way, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates persuaded many
participants yesterday that they were better off staying out of the market
until after the June employment report.
The only action during the morning was some modest demand from international
accounts and the occasional short-covering which, along with rumours of
outright buying of Treasuries by the Fed, lifted longer-dated prices
slightly by mid-day.
Later, bonds retreated as what few buyers there were in the market dried up,
and participants squared their positions ahead of the employment release. A
small drop in the dollar contributed to the afternoon decline in prices.
The French economics minister, Mr Edmond Alphandery, told a conference that
a plan to make it easier for private investors to buy French government
bonds would not affect the government's borrowing requirement, AP-DJ
reports.

The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said the exposure of leading Swedish
participants to debt derivatives led to relatively limited credit risks,
Reuter reports from Stockholm.
The bank said in its first derivatives report: 'Interest rate derivatives
have the largest market share, measured by amounts. The exposures stemming
from derivatives lead to relatively limited credit risks for the major
Swedish market participants.'
The Riksbank said it was considering collecting statistical information on a
regular basis. It said the derivatives market was characterised by trading
primarily through leading Swedish banks and derivatives exchanges.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Dealers prepare for flurry of issues
next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers are bracing themselves for a potential slew of issues next week,
including global fixed-rate offerings for Finland and Freddie Mac, and
Dollars 4bn equivalent of floating-rate notes for Italy, split between yen,
dollars and D-Marks.
Freddie Mac's Dollars 1.5bn five-year global issue, for which an investor
roadshow is being held in London today, is due to be priced early next week.
The yield spread is expected to be 15-18 basis points over the five-year US
Treasury yield.
Finland's 10-year deal, arranged by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, is
also likely to be launched early next week at a spread of about 50 basis
points over the comparable US Treasury yield.
In addition, at least two other sovereign borrowers were looking at the
market, dealers said.
'You can still get global deals away, even though it's a difficult market,'
said one trader.
However, he added that market sentiment remained fragile, and strong
employment data on Friday or disappointment with the Group of Seven summit
of industrial nations in Naples at the weekend could spark further weakness.
Several more offerings emerged yesterday in the yen sector, where activity
has been lifted by strong demand for yen assets in Japan.
Japanese investors are cash-rich, having liquidated dollar assets due to the
weakness of the US currency.
Deutsche Bank launched a Y50bn issue of five-year notes, with a spread of 40
basis points over the comparable Japanese government bond yield.
However, dealers said that Japanese investors were focusing on the 4 1/8 per
cent coupon, rather than the spread.
Because of the strong appeal of the Deutsche name, there was also some
placement in Europe, lead manager Merrill Lynch said.
Two other deals, aimed largely at the Japanese market, were launched for
Mitsubishi Corporation and NTT Data, via IBJ.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Pension funds lift overseas
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European pension funds intend to reduce their reliance on domestic markets
and increase investment overseas, according to a report on the industry.
Global Research, a division of Euromoney Publications, surveyed 181 of the
largest pension funds in Europe between April and June.
With the exception of the UK, where fund managers expect to reduce the
proportion of their US investments over the year, funds are increasing their
investments in all areas of the world. The survey found that managers were
diversifying their portfolios away from fixed-income instruments towards
equities.
Phillips and Drew Fund Management was the most preferred external fund
manager for UK pension funds, followed by Mercury Asset Management, Schroder
Asset Management, Henderson Pension Fund Management and Gartmore Investment
Management.
Non-UK pension funds preferred BBL, Kredietbank, AIB and Bank of Ireland.
The survey reported a difference in management styles between UK and other
European pension funds, with 36 per cent of UK managers using indexing as
part of their domestic strategy, compared with about 17 per cent of non-UK
European funds.
However, there is an increasing trend towards indexing across Europe, with
the trend most prominent in the UK. Almost 27 per cent of domestic
portfolios are indexed, compared with 19 per cent two years ago.
Non-UK pension funds intended to follow UK pension funds and increase their
use of external, specialist fund managers, largely for efficiency reasons
and a more individual approach. Across Europe, about 62 per cent of funds
employ external investment managers.
Market presence was given as the most important reason for using an external
manager, with efficiency and expertise also important factors.
More than half of respondents saw an increasing role for trustees. About
one-third of custodial services are still performed by fund managers, with
global custodians proving almost as popular.
Derivative instruments were used by more than half of those managers
surveyed, but UK pension funds were slightly more reluctant than non-UK
funds to use derivatives. Risk was cited as the main reason for not using
derivatives.

Vietnam plans to tap international capital markets for the first time to
raise up to Dollars 3bn by the end of the century, a senior finance ministry
official said, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
Vietnam is seeking to raise a total of Dollars 50bn by the end of the
century to upgrade infrastructure, hoping to double gross domestic product
and achieve an annual growth rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent.
At least half would be raised domestically and half would come from overseas
sources such as direct investment, foreign aid and by tapping capital
markets, said Ms Le Thi Bang Tam, director of the ministry of finance's
state Treasury department. The Treasury has been charged with planning the
issue and marketing government bonds abroad.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry builds holding in Bridge
Oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based energy group, threatened to
reach stalemate last night. Gantry Acquisition, one of the two rival
US-based bidders, raised its stake in Bridge to almost 10 per cent, buying
shares at prices ranging up to 95 cents.
Gantry said it wished to proceed with a full takeover offer at 95 cents a
share - which would value Bridge at ADollars 399m (USDollars 285m) - but
required further information before it would do so. In particular, it wanted
to know if its Texan rival, Parker &amp; Parsley, would accept a higher Gantry
offer in respect of its own 21 per cent stake in Bridge.
Until yesterday, Gantry had been offering 85 cents a share for Bridge, while
P&amp;P was offering 90 cents a share.
P&amp;P described Gantry's 'alleged wish to make a 95 cents a share
highly-conditional offer' as 'a mirage'.
It said it would not accept such an offer in respect of its own Bridge
shares.
Gantry insisted it had no intention of accepting P&amp;P's 90 cents offer, and
accused P&amp;P of using delaying tactics.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Outokumpu FM1.4bn issue goes
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday went ahead with a
FM1.4bn (Dollars 270m) share issue, following Nokia, the tele-communications
company which this week completed a FM2.5bn issue, the biggest international
offering by a Finnish company.
Outokumpu fixed the price for the offered units of one A share and one
warrant at FM82.50.
The company is issuing 13.5m units, while the Finnish state, until now the
majority shareholder, is selling 4.5m. Subscribers have the right to trade
six warrants for one A share at a price of FM92 before June 28 1996.
The pricing compared with a closing price for Outokumpu A shares of FM83 on
Wednes-day.
Outokumpu said a further 3.3m units had been granted to the underwriters as
an over-allotment option. If these are taken up, the issue will raise a
total of FM1.3bn for Outokumpu and FM480m for the state.
Strong demand from both overseas and Finnish investors will have come as a
relief to Outokumpu, as there had been some nervousness that the weakness of
worldwide stock markets and a heavy flow of issues from Finland in recent
months would dampen enthusiasm.
The proceeds are to be used to strengthen Outokumpu's balance sheet and to
reduce debt.
If the over-allotment option is fully taken up, the state's holding in
Outokumpu, which strengthened profits strongly in the first four months,
will fall from 50.1 per cent to 38.2 per cent, the latest in a series of
similar moves to reduce state ownership in Finnish industry.
The Outokumpu issue followed a successful issue by Nokia, the star of the
Finnish stock exchange which last week became the first Finnish company to
be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Nokia's original offer of 5m shares was eventually raised to 6m, raising a
total of FM2.5bn to help fund its fast-growing mobile telephones business.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fox units to be reorganised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fox, the US film and television subsidiary of News Corp is to be split into
two separate divisions reporting directly to Mr Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's
chairman and chief executive, under a reorganisation announced yesterday.
The reshuffle will see the departure from the company of Ms Lucie Salhany,
who chairs of Fox Broadcasting and was the first woman to head a US
broadcast network. She took the position 18 months ago.
News Corp said Ms Lucie Salhany had resigned because she felt the
reorganisation was an appropriate time for her to pursue other interests.
But she had been under pressure because of weak programme ratings, and
recently suffered the embarrassing cancellation of The Chevy Chase Show, a
short-lived late-night chat show that she had backed.
Under the previous structure, Fox had four principal subsidiaries: Twentieth
Century Fox, Twentieth Television, Fox Television Stations and Fox
Broadcasting. After the reorganisation, Twentieth Century Fox and Twentieth
Television will be in one division, while Fox Television Stations and Fox
Broadcasting will be in the other.
Twentieth Century Fox makes films and Twentieth Television makes television
programmes, so their combination in a single division will bring together
Fox's production activities. The division comprising Fox Television Stations
and Fox Broadcasting, to be called Fox Television, will bring together the
television programming activities .
News Corp said Fox had been growing aggressively over the past few years and
the time had come to review the company's structure.
Mr Peter Chernin, chairman of Twentieth Century Fox, will continue in his
present role and add responsibility for Twentieth Television. The Fox
Television division will be headed by Mr Chase Carey.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic cleared to compete
with cable TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bell Atlantic, the Baby Bell telephone company, has become the first US
telecommunications group to win regulatory approval to provide an
interactive television service over its wires in competition with local
cable television monopolies.
The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates both industries,
approved an application by Bell Atlantic to provide the so-called 'video
dialtone' service to 38,000 households in a New Jersey township.
The move is a significant precedent, since many other telephone companies
have similar applications pending before the FCC, which now seem likely to
be approved.
Mr Reed Hundt, the FCC chairman, said: 'The telephone companies are knocking
on the cable door and we want to let them in.'
However, while the FCC action allows Bell Atlantic to transmit television
programming, telephone companies are still forbidden in general from owning
the content of those programmes or packaging them.
Bell Atlantic has therefore teamed up with an independent programmer called
FutureVision of America, which will provide the television service in New
Jersey. It plans to undercut significantly the prices charged by local cable
companies.
Bell Atlantic said that in addition to traditional video entertainment
products, such as movies-on-demand, its New Jersey service would potentially
allow hundreds of information providers to use the network as a platform for
their products and services.
These providers could include schools, newspapers and hospitals.
However, the National Cable Television Association said that it intended to
fight the FCC's decision in court.
It complained that the FCC had not yet issued comprehensive rules preventing
telephone companies from subsidising construction of their networks on the
backs of telephone rate payers.
Congress is currently considering a bill which would allow telephone
companies to compete freely in the cable television industry as programme
providers, which they are forbidden from doing under 1984 cable legislation.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Central European Fund 42.4%
invested in shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first three months of operation the Central European Growth Fund, a
Dollars 200m investment trust set up in March by CS First Boston and
Cazenove to invest in central European stocks and bonds, has become 42.4 per
cent invested in the shares of central European companies and 16.8 per cent
in bonds. The remainder is in US money market instruments. Net asset value
at June 30 was Dollars 186.9m or Dollars 93.43 per share.
The fund's greatest exposure is to Hungarian equities, which account for
18.7 per cent of funds invested, followed by 12.3 per cent in the Czech
market, 9.3 per cent in Poland and 1.9 per cent in Slovak equities. In the
fixed income department the fund holds 16.8 per cent of its portfolio in
bonds issued by central European entities and 16 per cent by western
issuers.
The fund is one of a growing number of European and US-based trusts
attracted by last year's sharp rise in central European share prices. Share
prices have since fallen substantially on all the central European bourses
following the rise in US interest rates.
But with privatisation proceeding apace and private sector growth running at
an estimated annual rate of 25 per cent in the three main central European
states - the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland - the prospects for medium
and long term capital appreciation continue to attract investors.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eni's net profits this year may
exceed L1,000bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eni, Italy's state-owned energy and chemicals holding company, could
increase net profit this year to more than L1,000bn (Dollars 641m) if the
recovery of the first five months is maintained.
Sources at Eni yesterday confirmed reports that Mr Franco Bernabe, the
group's chief executive, would present managers with an upbeat forecast for
this year, when they meet later this month.
Last month Eni reported a return to profit of L419bn in 1993, from a loss of
L815bn in the previous year.
Eni is underlining the improvement in its prospects as its oil and gas
interests - Agip and Snam - are likely to be sold off by the state within
the next 12 months.
The improvement in the 1994 results will be built on the recovery at the
loss-making Enichem chemicals subsidiary, which announced last month that it
expected this year to halve 1993's L2,668bn loss.
The forecast also provides a timely riposte to reported criticism by Italy's
vice-premier, Mr Giuseppe Tatarella of the neo-fascist National Alliance. On
Wednesday, Mr Tatarella called for the resignation of Mr Bernabe and
attacked the level of mediocrity at Eni.
Eni managers hit back at the declarations, and warned the government against
trying to interfere with the final stages of Eni's restructuring.
'We are convinced that the future of a group of this importance ought to be
built on co-operation with the government and on the basis of programmes
shared with the management,' the managers said in a statement.
'But we are also absolutely certain that better results can be obtained by
leaving each (to carry out) his own responsibilities, and evaluating
managers . . . on the basis of results obtained according to objectives
established by the shareholder, whoever it might be,' they added.

Japan's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of International Trade and Industry
permitted Nippon Shinpan's asset-backed securities on condition that they be
sold to overseas investors, the company said.
The company said it was taking this step in order to vary its means of

Nippon Shinpan added that it also planned to securitise parts of its

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry lifts Bridge Oil stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based energy group, threatened to
reach stalemate last night. Gantry Acquisition, one of the two rival
US-based bidders, raised its stake in the target company to just under 10
per cent by buying shares at prices ranging up to 95 cents.
Gantry said it wished to proceed with a full takeover offer at 95 cents a
share, but required further information before it would do so.
In particular, it wanted to know whether its Texan rival, Parker &amp; Parsley,
would accept a higher Gantry offer in respect of its own 21 per cent stake
in Bridge.
It asked for elaboration on reported comments from P&amp;P, about 'having
different plans for different levels of acceptance'.
Until yesterday, Gantry had been offering 85 cents a share for Bridge, while
P&amp;P was offering 90 cents a share. An offer of 95 cents a share would value
Bridge at about ADollars 399m (USDollars 285m).
P&amp;P described Gantry's 'alleged wish to make a 95 cent a share
highly-conditional offer' as 'a mirage'.
It said it would not accept such an offer in respect of its own Bridge
shares, and dismissed its rival's initiative as an effort to confuse Bridge
shareholders.
However, Gantry insisted it had no intention of accepting P&amp;P's 90 cents a
share offer, and accused P&amp;P of using delaying tactics to prevent
shareholders from obtaining a higher offer.
Gantry is the bid vehicle being used by an investment partnership owned
jointly by the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Enron, the
US natural gas company.
Unlike P&amp;P, which has said it is interested in developing Bridge's US and
Australian assets, Gantry has said it is primarily interest in the US
properties.
Bridge shares closed 2 cents higher at ADollars 0.92 yesterday.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Philippine acquisition by MUI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malayan United Industries, (MUI), a Malaysian-based conglomerate with
holdings in hotels, trading, property and newspaper concerns, is continuing
its regional buying spree by purchasing a 'significant stake' in Shangri-La
Properties (SLPI), a loss-making Philippine property company.
The acquisition, worth at least MDollars 30.4m (USDollars 11.7m), marks the
fourth overseas venture by MUI since selling its Malaysian banking and
financial concerns to the Malaysian-based Hong Leong group last January for
MDollars 1.1bn.
SLPI owns 8.7 hectares of prime business land in Manila, including the
Shangri-La hotel and shopping mall. MUI has agreed to purchase at least 55
per cent of SLPI's proposed Peso 1.12bn (Dollars 41m) rights issue, as well
as any remaining shares not taken up by investors, leaving MUI with a stake
of between 21.67 and 39.41 per cent.
Proceeds from the rights issue will be used to retire debt, paving the way
for further office building and condominium development. MUI said the SLPI
purchase would provide it with a vehicle for the group's expansion plans in
the Philippines.
MUI is controlled by Tan Sri Khoo Kay Peng, a reclusive Malaysian-Chinese
businessman and close business associate of Mr Robert Kuok, another
Malaysian Chinese regarded as one of south-east Asia's richest businessmen
and who controls about one-quarter of SLPI.
Since last December Mr Khoo has made substantial investments in two
Kuok-controlled companies - the South China Morning Post (Holdings), the
Hong Kong publisher, and Kerry Financial Services, a Hong Kong finance
company. The other major shareholder of SLPI is Philippine tycoon Mr Alfredo
Ramos, who controls 39.1 per cent.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Murdoch's stake in Fairfax said
to be over 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
John Fairfax, the Australian publishing group, said yesterday that it
believed that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, the Australian arm of News
Corporation, had increased its stake and now held more than 2 per cent of
Fairfax's shares.
On Monday, News revealed that it bought a 1.7 per cent shareholding in
Fairfax, which publishes three of Australia's leading daily newspapers, in
mid-June. It made the disclosure after Fairfax had formally requested
details of share trading around that date.
Yesterday, Fairfax said that it had since received confirmation that
additional purchases made 'in the last week or two' had gone into five
nominee accounts connected to News. These further shares lifted News' stake
in Fairfax - which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and
Australian Financial Review newspapers - to 2.05 per cent.
In addition, Fairfax said that it knew of a further block of shares bought
at the end of June into an account which had previously been identified with
News.
However, Fairfax said it had not yet received any official confirmation that
News was interested in this latest parcel of stock. If these shares do prove
to be connected to News, Mr Murdoch's group would have a 2.3 per cent
interest in Fairfax.
The disclosures sent Fairfax shares 10 cents higher yesterday, to ADollars
2.80, in a generally falling market, as speculation over Mr Murdoch's
motives and talk of a bid play starting at Fairfax continued to circulate.
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media magnate who is currently embroiled in
newspaper price war with Mr Murdoch in the UK, owns almost 25 per cent of
Fairfax, while Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, has almost 15
per cent. Australian Pay Television, the consortium of media interests which
was formed to pursue opportunities in the pay-TV field, announced yesterday
that Network Ten, one of the country's commercial TV networks, had withdrawn
from the grouping.
It said that in the short to medium term Ten would still participate in the
pay-TV industry by making programming available to the consortium.
The consortium includes Mr Kerry Packer's leading Nine Network, Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News group, and Seven Network, another commercial network, as well
as Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications body.
The consortium, better known as PMT after its three most powerful members,
is thought to have faced internal strains recently, as its members have
developed differing interests in the evolving pay-TV sector in Australia.
However, it said yesterday that 'plans to established the best and most
attractive pay television service . . . will not be affected by Ten's
withdrawal as a shareholder'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Labatt's sizzle leaves Molson a
little flat : The balance of power between Canada's two brewers is shifting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two groups which dominate Canada's beer market regularly poll
institutional investors and financial analysts to find out their views on
the companies' performance.
The collective wisdom for several years was that Molson Breweries was
powering ahead, leaving John Labatt drifting rather aimlessly.
However, the balance of opinion has shifted in recent months. Molson's
earnings have been dragged down by the troubled US division of Diversey, its
cleaning-services subsidiary.
Labatt, on the other hand, has gained favour with a flurry of initiatives
which began about two years ago. These range from greater financial
disclosure and aggressive cost-cutting, to a rising share of the domestic
beer market and a sharper focus on brewing and broadcasting, which have
emerged as its two core businesses.
Ms Irene Nattel, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Canada, echoes the views
of several analysts with her impression that Labatt has more sizzle than
Molson.
The difference was apparent in Labatt's announcement on Wednesday that it
was joining Femsa, Mexico's biggest beverage group, in a North American beer
alliance. Labatt unveiled its plans just 90 minutes before Molson's annual
meeting. In contrast to Labatt's upbeat message, Mr Mickey Cohen, Molson's
chief executive, told shareholders he could not quarrel with their 'somewhat
hesitant' view about Molson's prospects.
Labatt will pay USDollars 510m for a 22 per cent stake of Femsa's brewing
subsidiary, with an option to buy a further 8 per cent over the next three
years. The partnership will include the creation of a jointly-owned company
to distribute premium, high-margin beers in the US.
Labatt has extensive interests outside Canada, where beer consumption is
gradually falling. It has bought almost 600 pubs in the UK and owns Birra
Moretti, which has a 9 per cent share of the Italian beer market. Latrobe, a
US subsidiary, brews Rolling Rock, whose sales volumes climbed by an
impressive 15 per cent in 1992 and 9 per cent last year.
The Canadian company is signing up foreign markets for its pioneering and
popular Labatt Ice beer, which is passed over ice crystals as part of the
brewing process. Labatt Ice's most recent markets include Japan and Denmark,
and it is being launched in the UK by Carlsberg, the Danish brewer.
However, the Femsa deal will take time to digest. Labatt has also halted UK
pub acquisitions while it assesses the fast-changing UK beer market. But it
has not stopped searching for international alliances and acquisitions.
'What we're trying to do is to find opportunities outside Canada which give
us an opportunity to leverage our know-how in the industry and our marketing
know-how.' says Mr George Taylor, Labatt chief executive.
Some analysts link Labatt's new vigour partly to its emergence early last
year as a widely-held company following the disposal of a controlling block
held by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family.
'Before, it was basically run by Brascan (a holding company of the Toronto
Bronfman family), presumably for Brascan,' says Mr Michael Palmer, analyst
at Equity Research in Toronto. 'Now, these guys are flexing their muscles.'
Mr Taylor retorts that 'we had established what we wanted to do before the
Brascan disposition'. In the year before the divestiture, Labatt sold a
diverse group of food-processing businesses, and laid the groundwork for
spinning off its US and Canadian dairy division.
The latest move, announced last month, is a plan to offer the public a large
slice of its sports and entertainment businesses. These include a 90 per
cent stake in the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team (which has won the World
Series championship for the past two years in a row, but is faring miserably
this season), and BCL Entertainment, a leading live-event promoter whose
clients include the rock groups the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd.
The Canadian broadcast interests, which Labatt has identified as an area of
high potential growth, consist mainly of cable TV channels, including one
which is all-sports.
However, the company's future will be determined largely by the performance
of the beer division, which accounted for 77 per cent of Labatt's CDollars
2.3bn (USDollars 1.6bn) sales in the year to April 30. Beer contributed
almost 90 per cent of pre-tax profits of CDollars 292m.
The Femsa alliance gives Labatt access to the fast-growing Mexican beer
market, where per capita consumption is much lower than North America, but
is growing by 5 per cent to 7 per cent a year.
Mr Taylor predicts that Femsa Cerveza will be highly profitable, with
operating income rising at double-digit annual rates. He sees the alliance
as a springboard for expansion into other parts of Latin America.
The deal is not without its challenges, however. Femsa Cerveza's market
share has slipped in recent years to about 48 per cent. Its main rival,
Grupo Modelo, has the backing of Anheuser Busch, the largest US brewer.
Ironically, Labatt distributes AB's Budweiser beers in Canada.
Mr Taylor sees the looming battle as a David and Goliath encounter. 'We're
going to be more fleet of foot, and do the types of things that we've
demonstrated we can do in Canada and Italy,' he says.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Pinault set to buy Credit
Lyonnais' stake in Fnac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, is set to sell a controlling
stake in Fnac, France's leading books and music retailer which has a stock
market capitalisation of about FFr3bn (Dollars 557m).
The buyer is expected to be Mr Francois Pinault, who controls
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the distribution and retailing group. Credit
Lyonnais confirmed that Artemis, the holding company, through which the
Pinault family controls Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, is involved in
negotiations. An announcement should be made shortly, it said.
The sale of Fnac represents part of the recovery strategy at Credit
Lyonnais, which suffered net losses of FFr6.9bn last year.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, has said he is seeking to dispose of about
FFr20bn worth of assets over the next two years in an attempt to consolidate
the bank's activities and raise capital. The sale of the 64.6 per cent stake
in Fnac, which is held through its Altus Finance subsidiary, could raise up
to FFr1.9bn, according to industry analysts.
Credit Lyonnais's decision to sell control of Fnac is also the latest step
in the turbulent history of the books and music chain, which was founded in
1954 and has grown into one of France's largest retail groups with annual
sales of just under FFr9bn and about 50 stores.
Last year, GMF, the troubled insurance group, sold control of Fnac to a
consortium comprising subsidiaries of Credit Lyonnais and Compagnie Generale
des Eaux, the communications, utilities and construction group. At the time,
Mr Pinault and several of Europe's largest retail groups - including
Kingfisher of the UK, Bertelsmann of Germany, and Havas of France -
expressed an interest in acquiring Fnac.
The disposal planned by Credit Lyonnais is complicated by pre-emption rights
held by Generale des Eaux, which holds 34 per cent of the shares in Fnac
through its subsidiary, Compagnie Immobiliere du Phenix.
Generale des Eaux has one month to decide whether to seek to acquire Fnac
itself, keep its shares or sell to the successful bidder. The sale of Fnac
may also be referred to the French privatisation commission.
Mr Pinault, who has long sought to acquire Fnac, has this year been engaged
in controversy surrounding an offer to buy out minority shareholders in La
Redoute, the group mail order subsidiary. Some minority shareholders
rejected the terms of the offer, which was finally approved in May.
The attraction of Fnac has increased following its return to profits growth
in the first half of 1993-94. In the six months ended February, it recorded
net profits of FFr60.6m, compared with FFr50.5m a year ago.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Royal Oak Mines bids Dollars
1.4bn for Lac Minerals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Oak Mines, the upstart Vancouver-based gold producer formed in 1991
from five penny stocks, has made a USDollars 1.4bn hostile bid for Lac
Minerals, one of North America's longest-established mining groups.
The combined company would produce more than 1.3m ounces of gold this year,
making it the biggest miner of gold in Canada.
Royal Oak, which has gained a reputation for hard-nosed management, is
expected to rely on the generous terms of its offer and Lac's recent
lacklustre performance to win over Lac shareholders. Lac said it would
evaluate the bid in its shareholders' best interests.
A Royal Oak spokesman said that one of its financial advisers told Lac's
senior management of the bid shortly before the offer was announced
yesterday morning. The meeting was described as 'brief'.
Royal Oak, which has built up a 2.5 per cent stake in Lac, has offered
CDollars 3.75 in cash and 1.75 of its shares for each outstanding Lac share.
Alternatively, Lac shareholders can opt for 2.416 Royal Oak shares for each
Lac share.
Based on Wednesday's closing share prices, the offer represents a 20 per
cent premium over Lac's market price.
The offer is conditional, among other things, on the gold price, which is
currently around Dollars 383 an ounce, remaining above Dollars 360.
Lac produced 1.1m ounces of gold last year as well as copper and zinc from
mines in Canada, the US and Chile.
By contrast, Royal Oak's output was 276,000 ounces of gold from four mines
in Canada. But Royal Oak posted a CDollars 15.1m profit, compared with Lac's
USDollars 63.5m loss.
Royal Oak's chief executive Ms Peggy Witte is one of the few women to head a
large mining company. She has gained a reputation as a tireless manager and
a ferocious cost-cutter.
Ms Witte said yesterday that Royal Oak had identified savings that could
reduce Lac's annual operating costs by more than Dollars 40m in 1995 and
almost Dollars 50m in 1996.
'Our offer allows Lac shareholders to participate in the significant growth
and increased efficiency we plan for the combined companies,' Ms Witte said.
The Dollars 400m cash portion of the offer will be financed by three US and
Canadian banks. Royal Oak has also obtained binding commitments for Dollars
700m in long-term credit facilities to retire the tender facility, provide
working capital and, if necessary, to pay down Lac's debt.

Remy Cointreau, the French wines and spirits group, yesterday announced a
24.5 per cent increase in net profits, to FFr252m (Dollars 46.8m), for the
year ended March.
It also forecast a further improvement this year as European economies
recover and as the US sees further expansion.
The company, which owns the Remy Martin cognac brand and Krug and Piper
Heidseck champagnes, said the rise in profits was achieved on sales of
FFr6.38bn, an increase of 9 per cent over 1992. Sales have continued to
expand this year, growing by about 10 per cent in the three months to the
end of June.
The group said last year's results were achieved in spite of weak demand in
some of its principal markets. In particular, continental Europe and Japan
suffered from the effects of recession.
In spite of these constraints, sales of Remy Martin cognac grew by 13 per
cent in value terms, to FFr2.82bn, consolidating its position as the world's
biggest-selling quality cognac with about one-third of the international
market.
Sales generated by liqueurs, wines and spirits rose 5 per cent to FFr1.74bn,
while the champagne division rose just 2 per cent to FFr668bn. The small
increase in champagne sales was blamed on the continued strength of
competition in the market, and on pricing pressures.
The company's sales under licence rose 13 per cent, with Highland
Distilleries whisky brands up 57 per cent. There was a strong rise in sales
of The Macallan whisky brand in the US.
Remy Cointreau said it took a financial charge of FFr595m last year -
compared with one of FFr577m in 1992-93 - mainly reflecting payment to Grand
Metropolitan of the UK for the buy-back of 20 per cent of Remy shares.
It said it would pay a dividend of FFr4.60 per share, an increase of 4 per
cent.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: UAP chief confirms UK plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, France's
largest insurance group, yesterday confirmed his interest in acquiring a UK
non-life insurance operation. He said he hoped to reach a decision by the
end of the year.
'We are looking, but we are only interested in buying a good company which
doesn't need restructuring,' said Mr Friedmann. He said the investment would
not be on the scale of UAP's previous European acquisitions, and ruled out a
hostile bid for a UK company.
Over the past 10 years, UAP has undergone substantial expansion in Europe,
bringing Royal Belge, Sun Life of the UK and Colonia of Germany under its
control. The UK non-life sector is now 'the only hole in our network',
according to Mr Friedmann.
He expressed concern about the possible impact of depressed French and
international share and bond markets on this year's earnings. However, he
stuck to his forecast of a significant increase in net profits, compared
with the FFr1.42bn (Dollars 263.9m) posted in 1993.
The UAP chairman said the group was well-placed to benefit from the
introduction of the single European insurance market: it is already offering
two new products - Pan Euro Life and Pan Euro Risk - across Europe.
In the French market, Mr Friedmann said the introduction of a system of
private pension funds would create an important, if competitive, new market.

United Saudi Commercial Bank, the Riyadh-based commercial bank controlled by
Prince al-Waleed Bin Talal, who recently came to the financial rescue of
Euro Disney, has reported a 21.5 per cent rise in first-half income for
1994, to SR157.7m (Dollars 42m).
The bank's unaudited figures show an 11.5 per cent rise in assets over the
period, to SR10.6bn at June 30 1994. Loans and advances rose 17 per cent,
with the bank's total securities portfolio up by 33 per cent on the same
period last year. Placements with other banks, meanwhile, fell by 24 per
cent to SR2.08bn.
Revenues from ancillary businesses rose a nominal SR1.5m. Non-interest
operating costs rose almost 10 per cent. USCB ascribed this to the launch of
products such as MasterCard cards.

FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Quiet investors find their voice
 -Ciga's fund shareholders are flexing their muscle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will take a while for Italian fund managers to achieve the same worldwide
recognition as Italian soccer players or opera singers, but certain bright
sparks in the fast-growing sector are at least trying.
At Wednesday's meeting of shareholders in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels
group, a group of fund managers indicated for the first time how they might
begin to take back some of the power accumulated by what one observer
described as 'Italy's coterie of delinquent entrepreneurs'.
If it was a revolution, then it was a quiet one. Ciga's dominant shareholder
 -Sheraton International, the hotels subsidiary of ITT of the US - started
by demonstrating that with its 17.4 per cent stake, it was likely to take
effective control of the Italian group. A board meeting next Tuesday is
expected to endorse a reshuffle of directors, bringing ITT representatives
on to the board.
So far, so Italian. In most UK or US companies, 'control' would only change
hands if a stake of more than 50 per cent was accumulated. In Italy, it is
possible to gain control at much lower levels.
At the Ciga meeting, however, a number of fund managers, together holding
some 15 per cent of the shares, indicated their disapproval of Ciga's old
directors, under whose aegis the group slipped heavily into debt when it was
controlled by the Aga Khan's Fimpar holding company. The same funds gave
their backing to Sheraton, but abstained from a final vote on the 1993
balance sheet, showing they intended to keep a close eye on future
management of the group.
Mr Gherardo Spinola, of Akros, a financial services group which holds 4.3
per cent of Ciga, said after the meeting the fund managers would act as
guarantees of transparency - a concept much abused by Italy's public
companies - and in the interests of fund-holders.
'It isn't our objective to manage these companies, but we will be extremely
diligent,' added Mr Vittorio Cazzulani of Fondigest, the fund management arm
of the Milan savings bank, Cariplo, owner of a 3.8 per cent stake.
In the past, Italian funds have maintained a very low profile. This is
partly because most are owned by larger groups, some of which may have had
an interest in preventing their fund managers interfering with the parent
company's direct investment or credit interests.
However, the funds' potential influence has been increasing, as ordinary
investors have begun to put their savings into equities. In 1993, for
example, equities managed by Fondigest funds increased to L6,536bn (Dollars
4.2bn) from L1,953bn; the Fiat-controlled Prime mutual funds, also Ciga
shareholders, increased assets under management by 36 per cent to L6,929bn,
while the value of the seven Akros funds rose from L1,874bn to L3,297bn.
Ciga is still an exceptional case. The environment is, however, gradually
changing. Privatisation provides one opening. Most objective analysts agree
that the real problem is the lack of development in the Italian pension and
mutual fund industry, representing ordinary investors.
The funds are not absent - some 80 per cent of the shares made available to
Italian institutions in last week's L5,000bn privatisation of Ina, the
state-owned insurer, went to pension funds, investment funds and insurance
companies - but they have not yet thrown their weight around.
In that sense, the Ciga assembly could represent a first tentative flexing
of Italian fund managers' muscle.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mail order helps Farepak to Pounds 6m -
Number of agents up 10% and marketing investment at Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 36 per cent rise in turnover at its core mail order business helped
Farepak, which supplies about 1m Christmas hampers a year, to report a 22
per cent rise in profits.
For the year to end April, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.98m to Pounds
6.08m on sales of Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 70.5m).
The outcome was struck after extraordinary charges of Pounds 211,000 for the
amortisation of interest on the deferred consideration for the Littlewoods
hamper business acquired in April last year, and Pounds 136,000 of costs for
joining the Official List.
Profits at the mail order division rose from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.93m on
sales up from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 44.6m. The increased turnover included
a contribution of Pounds 5.4m from the Littlewoods acquisition.
The average number of agents, which rose by 27 per cent to 70,000 in
1993-94, was 10 per cent up this year. The group had invested Pounds 1.1m in
marketing and was looking for good growth in the current year.
The food processing division reported profits of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds
122,000) on turnover of Pounds 37m (Pounds 34.3m). Of the sales, Pounds
15.8m was made at no profit to associates, including Home Farm, the joint
venture with Fine Art Developments, which contributed Pounds 1.57m to
profits.
A further Pounds 10m of sales were accounted for by Tranfood, the cooked
meat supplier, which had cut losses but was still some Pounds 100,000 in the
red.
Customers start paying for Christmas hampers months in advance, providing a
strong cash flow. However, a fall in average interest rates from 9.3 per
cent to 5.6 per cent cut net interest receivable from Pounds 828,000 to
Pounds 567,000.
Earnings per share rose from 14.42p to 17.58p. A final dividend of 4.75p is
proposed, taking the total for the year to 6.6p (5.75p).

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant demand helps Reg Vardy jump 92%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant demand for new and used cars helped Reg Vardy, the multi-franchise
motor retail group, to increase pre-tax profits by 92 per cent from Pounds
4.38m to Pounds 8.4m in the year to April 30.
The company said yesterday resurgent sales of both volume and specialist
vehicles had pushed turnover up from Pounds 205.2m to Pounds 298.2m.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said: 'Customers have been a bit more frisky.
After three years in the doldrums, buyers are returning because prices and
interest rates are low.'
Those factors prompted a 58 per cent increase in total new vehicle sales to
11,268, while sales of used cars rose 27 per cent to 22,966.
Forecasting a steady recovery in the motor retail trade, Mr Vardy pointed to
increased gross profits of Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 5.95m) on new vehicles sales
and Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 7.76m) on used cars.
The figures were enhanced by improved profits in the after-sales division
and contributions from seven dealers acquired during the year at a cost of
Pounds 9.54m.
Acquisitions injected Pounds 1.1m to operating profits ahead from Pounds
5.03m to Pounds 8.27m.
The group also made an exceptional Pounds 1.07m profit on the sale of
surplus land and Mr Vardy hinted at further disposals this year.
Increased profits from both vehicle and property sales would, he predicted,
enable the group to expand from its network of 28 dealerships to 40 within
two years.
'We've promised to outperform our rivals in this sector, and that's what
we've set out to do.'
Earnings per share advanced to 12.9p (7.1p) and a final dividend of 3.2p
makes a total of 4.6p (4.2p).

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: P&amp;P adds QA to its training operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;P is consolidating its move away from computer distribution with the
acquisition of QA Training, one of the UK's leading computer training
companies, for up to Pounds 18m. The purchase will be funded partly by a
1-for-4 rights issue at 60p to raise Pounds 8.6m.
P&amp;P also released its interim figures, which showed continued recovery
following its exit from volume computer distribution last year.
Pre-tax profits rose 35 per cent from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.7m in the six
months to end-May on turnover from continuing operations up 27 per cent from
Pounds 93.8m to Pounds 119m.
Earnings per share increased from 2.1p to 3p and the interim dividend is
raised from 0.8p to 0.95p.
Mr David Southworth, group managing director, said the company was seeing
good growth across the board, which would be enhanced by the acquisition of
QA. 'It will expand P&amp;P's skill base and corporate client base, and provides
us with enhanced opportunities for the future.'
QA is the UK market leader, with an estimated 20 per cent share, in the
provision of technical training in desktop computing. It trains staff within
companies who develop and support computer systems. It made an operating
profit of Pounds 1.78m last year on turnover of Pounds 9.37m.
Mr Southworth said it would complement P&amp;P's existing training operation,
which has turnover of about Pounds 3m a year.
The vendors of QA - comprising its top management, its employees, and IBM,
which has a 10 per cent stake - will receive an initial Pounds 15m in cash,
shares and loan notes. There will be an additional payment of up to Pounds
3m, equal to six times the amount by which QA's profits exceed Pounds 2m in
the year to April 1995.
Phoenix Securities advised P&amp;P on the deal and the rights issue has been
fully underwritten by Panmure Gordon.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ICI makes Malaysian disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI is to sell its non-paint businesses in Malaysia to local managers for
about Pounds 30m.
The restructuring is part of ICI's strategy of concentrating on its core
businesses and involves two parallel deals.
ICI has a 50.1 per cent stake in the Chemical Company of Malaysia which has
interests in industrial chemicals, fertilisers, agrochemicals and 50.1 per
cent of ICI Paints Malaysia.
ICI is selling its CCM stake to a management group for MDollars 206m (Pounds
51m). At the same time, it is paying MDollars 90m for 25.1 per cent of
ICIPM, to add to a 34.9 per cent stake it owns directly.
Both ICIPM and ICI's Malaysian operation are profitable, although ICI would
not provide figures.
The net effect is for ICI to have disposed of its non-paint businesses and
increased its stake in the local paints operation from 50.1 per cent to 60
per cent.
ICI's other Malaysian business, Tioxide, whose products are largely used in
paints, is unaffected by the deal.
Mr Iain Macfarlane, chairman of ICI's Malaysian operations, said the
restructuring would allow his company and CCM to concentrate on their main
business areas. 'Both groups will be able to grow their operations in a more
sharply focused way.'
ICI said it hoped that CCM would continue to sell ICI products.
No decision had been taken on whether the roughly Pounds 30m cash generated
would be repatriated or reinvested locally.
The transactions are subject to approval by Malaysian regulatory
authorities.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: British Bloodstock moves out of the red
with Pounds 124,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of losses, British Bloodstock Agency returned to the black
in the 12 months to March 31 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 124,000.
Shares in the USM-traded company, however, fell 13p to 92p yesterday, as the
result fell short of some market estimates of between Pounds 250,000 and
Pounds 300,000.
Mr Christo Philipson, chairman, pointed out that the result, which compared
with a Pounds 38,000 loss previously, continued the steady improvement in
trading results which began in the second half of 1991.
He attributed the recovery to a substantial reduction in fixed costs and the
first increase in turnover since 1990 - up 4 per cent at Pounds 5.22m.
Despite the return to profits, no dividend is recommended. Mr Philipson
explained that he believed reserves should be strengthened following the
lossmaking years and that the improvement in fortunes must be sustained
before payments could be recommenced.
Earnings per share were 2.7p (1.4p losses).
The chairman said greater industry confidence reflected the beneficial
change in VAT legislation in the spring 1993 Budget and an increase in prize
money.
He expected the market to benefit from further increases in prize money,
funded by the evening opening of betting shops and Sunday racing, and also
in breeders' prizes, which are set to top the Pounds 1m mark in 1995.
Mr Peter Bickmore, managing director, has decided to step down in order to
concentrate on running BBA Insurance Services and expanding the group's
insurance interests. He will however, remain an executive director.

on US

<TEXT>
Learmonth &amp; Burchett Man-agement Systems, the USM-quoted computer services
company, is switching its focus to the US. It is selling its UK general
consulting division and increasing its US shareholdings, writes Nigel Clark.
The moves were announced at the same time as reporting losses of Pounds
746,000 for the year to April 30, against profits of Pounds 1.61m. Turnover
was Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 23.6m) including Pounds 3.81m (Pounds 4.26m) from
discontinued activities.
The shares lost 40p to close at 85p.
The consulting division is being sold to Parity, which yesterday confirmed
its change of name from Comac, for Pounds 1.35m cash plus Pounds 400,000
under a software licence agreement.
The division reported trading profits of Pounds 438,000 on turnover of
Pounds 3.8m in the year to end-April. Net assets at July 6 were valued at
Pounds 27,000.
Learmonth is raising a net Pounds 2.3m through a 1-for-5 rights issue of
3.63m shares at 70p. Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, and Mr Roger Learmonth,
chief executive officer, with others, are not taking up their rights in
favour of Bessemer Venture Partners III, which is acting on behalf of a US
consortium.
Bessemer is also underwriting the issue. Following the rights the consortium
will hold between 7.9 and 16.7 per cent of the enlarged capital. It may
subsequently increase its holding to 29.9 per cent.
Over the last three years the focus of Learmonth has been switching to
software sales particularly in the US.
The new operational centre will be in Houston, although because of the UK
quote Mr Burchett will be based in the UK. Mr Learmonth will travel between
the UK and US and Mr John Bantleman, chief executive of the US company,
becomes group chief operating officer. In due course the company may
consider moving to a US stock market quote.
Problems in the UK and continental Europe were blamed for the fall into
losses in 1993-94. Corrective action was taken towards the end of the year
which will have an effect in the present year.
Losses per share were 3.3p (earnings 7p) and the dividend is passed (0.75p).

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Malaysian cinema joint venture for Wilton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wilton Group, the cinema and television concern, has formed a joint venture
with Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese entrepreneur, to build and operate
a chain of multi-screen cinemas in Malaysia.
Wilton and United Artists Theatre Circuit, which last year formed a joint
venture to develop cinemas in south-east Asia, have joined forces with
Cathay Cinemas to exploit the Malaysian market.
Cathay, a subsidiary of Mr Kuok's Perlis Plantations vehicle, operates 38
cinemas in Malaysia and Singapore. It will have a 50 per cent stake while
Wilton and United Artists will each have 25 per cent.
It is thought that Wilton and United Artists are talking to Mr Kuok's group
about cinema joint ventures in other south-east Asian countries, including
mainland China.
Mr Michael Buckley, chairman of Wilton, said that the goal was to develop
between 10 and 12 multiplex cinemas in Malaysia at a cost of between Dollars
7m (Pounds 4.6m) and Dollars 12m each.
He stressed that the cinemas would be very cash generative once opened.
The main shareholders in Wilton, which is shortly to change its name to
Pacific Media, are Mr Buckley and Mr Clive Ng, the Malaysian entrepreneur.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jurys' Pounds 6m Bristol acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jurys Hotel Group yesterday announced its third acquisition in the UK with
the Pounds 6m purchase of the 245-bedroom Unicorn, in Bristol.
The Ireland-based hotel operator also announced a 60 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to end-April, from IPounds 2.32m to IPounds
3.72m (Pounds 3.67m).
The Bristol deal follows the purchase of the Jurys Pond Hotel in Glasgow and
the Jurys Kensington Hotel. The latter deal was funded mainly by an IPounds
7.59m rights issue at the end of 1993. The balance of the Pounds 9.8m
consideration came from borrowings.
The latest move will be financed through debt.
Sales in the 12 months increased by 28 per cent to IPounds 33.6m (IPounds
26.3m). Operating profit rose to IPounds 5.13m (IPounds 3.97m). Earnings
were 11.1p (7.2p).
A final dividend of 3.25p is proposed, making a total of 5.15p (5p).

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prestwick seeks Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prestwick Holdings, the Scottish printed circuit board maker, is to raise
Pounds 4.5m through a 4-for-5 rights issue of 20.1m shares at 24p each. It
is also selling Electroconnect, its electronic design subsidiary, to its
management for Pounds 1.65m.
Prestwick lost Pounds 3.9m in the year to July 31 1993 and a further Pounds
1.95m in the first six months of the current year.
In January Mr Archie Coulson of Postern, the corporate rescue specialist,
took over as executive chairman.
He said yesterday Prestwick was now trading profitably. It would incur a
pre-tax loss of not more than Pounds 1.23m in the current year. Operating
profit for continuing operations would be not less than Pounds 765,000,
compared with a loss of Pounds 96,000 in the first half.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Burtonwood shows 11% advance to top Pounds
3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burtonwood, the Cheshire-based real ale brewer, reported an 11 per cent
improvement in pre-tax profits, from a restated Pounds 2.77m to Pounds
3.07m, for the 12 months to March 31.
The increase, struck after losses of Pounds 353,000 (Pounds 399,000) on
asset disposals, was achieved despite minimal growth in turnover; sales
totalled Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 50.3m), including Pounds 3m (Pounds 3.8m) from
the small off-licence chain, now sold.
Mr John Dutton-Forshaw, chairman, said retail profits from managed houses
'improved significantly' while 'selective expansion' in the tenanted estate
also contributed to the performance.
Beer volumes in the tied estate - now comprising 462 houses owned or leased
against 424 at end-March 1993 - increased by 5 per cent. The ongoing
withdrawal from low margin free trade business, however, resulted in a 3 per
cent fall in overall volumes.
A revaluation of group properties undertaken during the second half showed a
small increase on previous book values. When the review was announced at the
interim stage the company said that a slight overall decline was likely.
Earnings emerged at 9.9p (8.5p), or 11.6p (10.4p) excluding the disposals. A
final of 4.3p makes a total of 5p (4.68p).

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Gibbon Lyons Group, the USM-quoted maker of printing inks
and related products, showed a 72 per cent advance from Pounds 990,050 to
Pounds 1.7m in the year to end-March. Turnover rose by 11 per cent from
Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 25.7m.
Last year's profit, however, was depressed by the writing off of the group's
Dutch subsidiary. Stripping out exceptional charges the profits increase is
reduced to 13.4 per cent - from Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 1.84m.
Earnings per share emerged at 10.9p (4.7p) and a recommended final dividend
of 3.3p makes a total for the year of 5.5p (5p).
To better reflect current operations it is proposed that the company's name
be changed to The Gibbon Group.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Greene King static at Pounds 20.4m -
Government asked to cut beer duty to combat cheap imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greene King, the regional brewer, yesterday blamed the lingering recession
in East Anglia for a flat performance during the 12 months to May 1 with
underlying pre-tax profits rising just 1 per cent to Pounds 20.4m.
The Suffolk-based company said it had endured one of the longest and deepest
recessions in memory, and beer volumes in its home market had fallen 7 per
cent.
However, Mr Simon Redman, chairman, said the brewer had managed to restrict
its own sales decline to 0.6 per cent and contributions from newly-acquired
pubs in other areas helped group turnover increase 5 per cent to Pounds
146.1m (Pounds 139m).
He claimed this was a creditable result in a fragile market where many
breweries were suffering from cheap European beer imports.
Calling on the government to help the UK industry by reducing beer duty
rates from 30p a pint to less than 10p, he warned: 'Failure to act merely
exports jobs and passes tax revenue to our European neighbours.'
Difficult trading conditions and the impact of continental imports meant
prospects remained patchy, he added, even though pre-tax profits rose 18 per
cent on an FRS 3 basis.
The figures were distorted by exceptional costs of Pounds 2.8m arising from
the abortive 1993 bid for Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer.
Trading profits were held at Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 26.8m) as the group
struggled with its brewing and wholesaling business, where profits fell
sharply from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 6.9m.
The shortfall was offset by slightly improved profits in the tenanted trade
 -which overcame intense price competition and discounting to report profits
of Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 14.8m) - and a 24 per cent upturn in profits in the
retail trade to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.5m).
The acquisition of 44 pubs from Bass helped the managed pubs division
improve margins with drink sales growing 12 per cent and food sales
increasing 49 per cent.
The Pounds 17.5m Bass acquisition took capital spending to Pounds 37.6m,
while gearing rose from 34 per cent to 39 per cent.
Adjusted earnings per share came out at 35.9p (35.6p) and a final dividend
of 9.05p is proposed, making 12.9p (12.3p) for the year.
COMMENT
Although the results were slightly below expectations, Greene King should
emerge from its local difficulties in a stronger position. It has shifted
its bias away from tenanted pubs, where price cutting has been fiercest, to
develop its managed estate while also building a reputation outside East
Anglia. That effort will be boosted shortly by the opening of its Camberley
depot to serve southern England and restoring its in-house canning
operations. These developments are expected to lift profits this year to
Pounds 22.5m, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 12 - below the
market sector's average.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Subdued response to 3i public offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public offer for 3i, the venture capital group, has been fully
subscribed. But the response to the Pounds 178m share offer was subdued by
comparison with the 385,000 individual registrations for its prospectus.
Baring Brothers, the issue's sponsor, said details of acceptance levels
would be released today. But early indications suggest that it was only
marginally over-subscribed.
The timing of the offer coincided with a further slump in the equity market
and a deluge of flotations. The company said yesterday it was 'delighted'
with the take-up.
Sir George Russell, chairman, said: 'To raise over Pounds 700m, including
over Pounds 178m from the public, in these market conditions is a very major
achievement.'
Brokers were unwilling to forecast share price performance.
However, the consensus was that with the Pounds 522m institutional placement
1.7 times subscribed, the shares should edge above the issue price in early
trading, but would offer little for the stags.
The company, which is Europe's largest investor in unlisted companies, with
stakes in more than 3,400 businesses, is not a natural target for retail
investment support.
However, it offers an unusual exposure to the unlisted smaller companies
sector.
With a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn, it is likely to be propelled
into the FT-SE 100 Index, which will require many institutions to buy it.
Share allocations will be announced tomorrow. Dealings will start on July
18.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lincoln House buys Medallion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lincoln House, the USM-quoted home furnish-ings group, yesterday announced
the purchase of Medallion Upholstery, largely funded by a placing and open
offer to raise Pounds 7.4m net.
Lincoln is paying up to Pounds 8.2m for Medallion, 50 per cent of whose
turnover is represented by exports to continental Europe.
Mr Anthony Robinson, Medallion's chairman and 50 per cent shareholder, will
receive Pounds 1m in Lincoln shares at the placing price of 36p as part of
the consideration for his stake. On completion, he will join Lincoln's
board.
In view of the size of the deal, Lincoln intends to apply for a full
listing. Yesterday, the shares were suspended at 37p, but dealings are
expected to resume on August 3.
Under the placing and offer, Lincoln is to issue 12.14m placing shares and
10.09m offer shares on a 2-for-5 basis at 36p. As a result, the share
capital will almost double.
Lincoln also said it intended to consolidate every 150 ordinary shares of
10p into one new Pounds 15 share; each new share would be subdivided into 75
new ordinary shares of 20p each.
It is also proposed to change the company's name to Wyefield Group.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Some Everton holders get the blues over
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Everton, the English football club, were on offer in Liverpool
yesterday at Pounds 2,750 each - well short of the Pounds 4,000a share
rights issue which the club will launch at a special general meeting on July
26.
'Anyone who takes up their rights at Pounds 4,000 when they can buy on the
open market at Pounds 2,750 will be absolutely bonkers,' said Mr Philip
Oakell, a stockbroker with Tilney &amp; Co in Liverpool, who owns two shares
himself.
'I shall definitely not be taking up my rights,' he added.
'You can count me out too,' said Mr Mike Dyble, co-founder of the BDH
advertising agency in Manchester, who has three.
'You get almost nothing for being a shareholder anyway,' said Mr Tony Tighe,
a Manchester public relations consultant, who paid Pounds 300 each for his
two shares in 1986. 'I spent Pounds 208 on my season ticket yesterday - a 5
per cent discount - but this club is so mean to its shareholders you don't
even get a cup of tea at the AGM.'
Mr Brian McGain, Liverpool managing partner of Moore Stephens, the
accountancy firm, is one of the more substantial small shareholders, with 17
shares.
'I disagree with the way it is being done,' he said sadly. 'If the club
wanted to raise money it could have pitched the rights issue at below market
price and pleased a lot of us. But this way will just squeeze out the little
guys and dilute their holdings.'
Mr Dyble, who was part of consortium organised by Mr Bill Kenwright, the
theatrical impresario, which hoped in vain to take over the club, agreed.
'It has had to be done this way so Peter Johnson can put nearly Pounds 10m
into Everton and ensure the money goes to the club, not to shareholders,' he
said.
Mr Johnson is chairman of Park Food Group and the man who rebuilt Tranmere
Rovers - Merseyside's third football club after Liverpool and Everton - both
financially and on the field of play. He has one Everton share and will
definitely be taking up his right to one more.
He also hopes to buy the other 2,499 new shares in the issue, which he is
personally underwriting to buy his way into the Everton chairmanship so he
can play boardroom football on a bigger stage. He left for a long weekend in
the south of France yesterday to make himself unavailable.
There are 2,500 existing Everton shares, although Professor Tom Cannon,
former director of Manchester Business School, true-blue Evertonian, and
another member of Mr Kenwright's failed bid team, thinks 200 are 'dead' -
untraceable after their owners died and failed to carry on a longstanding
Scouse tradition of turning them into heirlooms.
He believes a few people will take up their rights to try to spite Mr
Johnson by ensuring he does not get more than 50 per cent of the club. 'Some
people will never forgive him for being a self-confessed Liverpool
supporter. They will see it rather like making a pact with the devil,' Prof
Cannon said.
Control of what will actually happen is in the hands of the Moores family,
the death of whose patriarch - Sir John Moores, founder of Littlewoods and
the football pools - precipitated the struggle for control of Everton last
year.
They own more than half the existing shares and have basically agreed to let
Mr Johnson take control, although it is thought they are likely to
manipulate their own take-up of rights to ensure they keep a 25.01 per cent
block-ing minority at any future AGM.
Mr Johnson plans to build bridges: Mr Kenwright will become deputy chairman
and one of his allies, Mr Arthur Abercromby, will join the board. So will Mr
John Suenson-Taylor, son of Sir John's daughter, Lady Grantchester, herself
the Moores family's main negotiator with Mr Johnson and Mr Kenwright.
What will happen to the share price after the rights issue fails and Mr
Johnson sweeps in? 'It will hold,' says Mr Oakell, who is Tilney's expert on
the football indus-try.
'This offer values Everton at about Pounds 20m, which is half the market
capitalisation of, say, Arsenal, another unquoted club of similar pedigree.
If Johnson can pick Everton up the way he did Tranmere Rovers, the value
should eventually double. The shares could become very valuable indeed,' Mr
Oakell added.
Provided, of course, Everton eventually floats on the Stock Exchange - the
Moores family's likely blocking minority will be the deciders of that.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Higher costs cut Gold Greenlees to Pounds
3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m for the year to April 30, against Pounds 4.3m
 -a fall of 29 per cent.
The results were in line with a profits warning issued by the group in
March, the second time in five months that GGT found itself acting to dampen
City expectations which had originally been forecasting profits of about
Pounds 6m.
Turnover increased by 8 per cent from Pounds 275.4m to Pounds 298.2m, but
administrative costs increased by 17 per cent, or 11 per cent at constant
exchange rates. Operating profits were down 29 per cent to Pounds 4.1m
(Pounds 5.84m).
Earnings per share were down 44 per cent from 15.63p to 8.77p. A proposed
final dividend of 2p makes a total for the year of 5.3p, compared with 8.3p.
Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said that much of the increase in revenue
had come from new business, rather than higher levels of income from
existing clients. This had led to the need for additional resources to
service the business before the receipt of the resulting income.
'The disappointing financial performance does not adequately reflect the
progress made during the year,' he said, adding that he was 'encouraged by
the outlook for the current year'.
The group announced that Mr Michael Gold, co-founder and joint chairman with
Mr Greenlees, would be leaving at the end of July, having moved with his
family to France.
Ms Jan Hall, until recently chairman and chief executive of Coley Porter
Bell, the design consultancy, will join the board in the newly-created role
of chief executive, GGT Europe. Mr Peter Quinnen has been appointed a
non-executive director.
The shares rose 5p yesterday to close at 182p.

FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Smith New Court holds back the tide for
brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court, the UK securities house, announced yesterday it would
accommodate private client stockbrokers 'for a transitory period' following
the move to 10-day rolling settlement on July 18.
The move is likely to prompt other UK marketmakers, who are keen to retain
their share of the private client stockbroking order flow, to match the
offer.
Smith New Court said that from July 18 it would offer a facility for these
stockbrokers to request special settlement at the point of execution if
Trade Date plus 10 is not suitable. They will not be charged additional
interest for a longer settlement period.
Settlement is the process by which shares are delivered to a buyer in
exchange for delivery of payment.
From July 18, UK securities bargains will settle 10 business days after they
are struck, a departure from the current position in which trades settle as
a block within two- or three-week settlement periods.
While institutional investors are expected to make the switch to 10-day
rolling settlement with ease, some private client stockbrokers fear it will
create difficulties for retail investors.
Some fear they will not be able to remit cash to their stockbroker in time
to pay for shares within 10 business days, nor may they be able to deliver
share certificates on time.

Allied-Lyons, the drinks and retailing group, said yesterday that further
disposals of its food manufacturing businesses were being actively explored.
The group, which in March paid Pounds 739m for control of Pedro Domecq
Group, the Spanish drinks producer, wants to focus on its drinks and
retailing businesses.
The food manufacturing division, which last year had sales of about Pounds
1bn, makes Tetley teabags and also includes a European bakery business and
an ingredients supplier in North America.
Yesterday's annual meeting received shareholders' approval for a name change
to Allied Domecq.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Schroders builds up Wall Street presence: Chairman sees
further US investment as merchant bank pays Dollars 92m for Wertheim control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders yesterday announced a deal giving it one of the largest presences
on Wall Street of a UK merchant bank. The Dollars 92m (Pounds 60.5m)
purchase for the half of US-based investment bank Wertheim Schroders it does
not already control would allow Schroders to make further investment in a US
arm, according to Mr George Mallinckrodt, Schroders chairman.
Schroders already has a presence in the US through its asset management arm,
which was the largest non-US manager of international investments as of
March 31, 1994, according to the trade publication Pensions and Investments.
Of the Pounds 6.5bn in net new cash it attracted last year, nearly Pounds
4bn was from accounts outside the UK, with much coming from the US. The
increasing interest among US investors for non-US securities was a key
factor in Wertheim's decision to sell full control of the firm to Schroders,
Mr Mallinckrodt said. 'Two or three years ago, this was not really a factor.
That's what persuaded them to sell now,' he explained. 'In the future we can
target ourselves to introduce more foreign securities into the US.'
To this end, Mr Mallinckrodt said, Schroders hoped to expand Wertheim's
securities distribution capabilities in the US, as well as its corporate
base.
The acquisition of total control of Wertheim allows Schroders to draw the
firm into areas its management might have been reluctant to participate in,
such as expansion of its derivatives activities.
Mr Mallinckrodt said that Schroders might seek to raise Wertheim's capital
base to Dollars 250m from Dollars 177m in the next five years or so.
Schroders has owned 42.5 per cent of Wertheim's equity since 1986, a stake
which carries 50 per cent of the voting rights. Yesterday's deal will pay
Dollars 68m for the shares held by Wertheim's management and a further
Dollars 24m for the 15 per cent non-voting interest held by institutional
shareholders.
The acquisition price, which includes the assumption of some Dollars 65m in
Wertheim debt securities, values the company at about Dollars 310m. Wertheim
had net tangible assets of Dollars 179m at May 31, 1994, and for the year
ended December 31, 1993, pre-tax profits after exceptional items of Dollars
35m.
Wertheim last year paid roughly Dollars 20m to cover compensation and legal
fees to Ames, the US department store chain, over advice Ames received when
it made the Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the discount store division of Zayre
in 1988.
According to Securities Data in New York, Wertheim ranks 15th among
worldwide M&amp;A advisers so far this year, having worked on completed
transactions valued at Dollars 5.56bn. In 1993 the firm ranked 10th,
advising on Dollars 16.8bn in deals. However, in league tables showing
number of M&amp;A deals worked on, Wertheim stands higher - 12th in the
year-to-date, and 4th in 1993 - an indication that its corporate clients are
smaller in size than those advised by Wall Street's biggest banks such as
Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.
Mr James Harmon, Wertheim's chief executive, said it was wrong to label the
firm as serving the medium-sized corporate market, as it had particular
strengths in sectors such as chemicals.
The buy-out of Wertheim comes a time when other UK firms have been actively
developing US operations, with mixed success. Lazard has long had a presence
in US investment banking through its relationship with Lazard Freres, while
SG Warburg and NatWest Securities have begun to establish themselves in
various corners of the domestic securities markets. In contrast, Barclays de
Zoete Wedd has been unsuccessful in its attempt to build a US stock
brokerage business, while the 1991 partial merger between Baring Brothers
and Dillon Read has yet to pay significant dividends.
Mr Philip Gibbs, merchant banking analyst at BZW, said the deal offered
benefits for Schroders, even though, at 1.7 times net worth, it had paid a
premium over the going rate for US merchant banks. 'The fact that they have
worked together as partners for eight years augers well.'
If there is a disadvantage, it may be that the senior management of Wertheim
no longer has the incentive of sharing the profits as owners.
Wall Street's top earners receive compensation packages in the millions of
dollars, whereas London pay rates are much lower. Mr Harmon said talk of
tension over pay levels was off-target. 'We are well aware of this matter.
Clearly, you have to pay competitively, and we will continue to pay
competitively.' A Schroders banker in London said: 'The reality is that New
York pays more, and you have to pay local market rates.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Backers ofEurotunnelrights let off lightly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Underwriters to Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rights issue received final
confirmation yesterday that they got off lightly despite the dire stock
market conditions and city cynicism that hampered the share price in the
offer period.
The company announced that 93.4 per cent of the primarily French-owned
bearer rights shares were taken up by investors, leaving the underwriters
with around Pounds 42m out of the Pounds 640m new bearer shares.
Only two thirds of the UK portion was taken up, but the excess, or rump, was
successfully placed out to institutions, relieving the underwriters of their
obligations. Investors took up 86.9 per cent of the combined total.
The higher take-up of the French portion reflected the different
underwriting system, whereby investors can only benefit from the rights by
either selling or converting them.
The 1990 issue had received more than 98 per cent of acceptances, and some
brokers suggested the result was slightly disappointing.
However, the underwriting syndicate, led by Banque Indosuez and Swiss Bank
Corporation, is definitely off the hook.
The share price closed 25c higher at FFr24 (Pounds 2.84) in Paris,
comfortably above the FFr22.5 rights price, and underwriters should be able
to secure buyers for the excess.
In addition, underwriters have received more than Pounds 18m in commissions,
excluding the substantial advisory and administration fees, so they have
been well rewarded for their efforts.
With the financing finally over, attention is returning to Eurotunnel's
attempts to get all its freight and passenger services up and running.
Eurotunnel, which is claiming up to Pounds 1bn in compensation from the
railways for their failure to provide adequate rail links to the tunnel,
said it may seek compensation for any additional loss of revenues which
occurs.
The company still hopes to obtain its operating licence for an invitation
only car shuttle service by the end of July.
A paying service should commence in October, when investors will finally be
able to start evaluating the revenue projections put forward by the company,
and get a sense of the real worth of its shares.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Daimler considers Anglo-US policy on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz is considering changing its dividend policy to come into line
with what the group's finance director described as 'Anglo-American'
practice.
Speaking as Daimler an-nounced the successful completion of its DM3bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) rights issue, Mr Gerhard Liener said that in the long-term
Daimler was considering making sure that its dividend was more closely
related to the group's earnings.
German companies are reluctant to vary dividends in line with earnings,
although Daimler did cut its dividend last year, from DM13 to DM8,
reflecting the group's fall into a loss of DM1.8bn under US accounting
standards.
Mr Liener described the rights issue, the first from a German company to
incorporate a 'global offering' to international investors, as a great
success, although he conceded that Daimler had not managed to increase the
percentage of shares owned by US investors to 10 per cent as planned.
Demand from US shareholders was very high, Mr Liener said and 53 per cent of
all new shares not taken up by existing shareholders were placed in North
America, raising approximately DM200m.
This took the US shareholding to more than 8 per cent, from about 6.5 to 7
per cent before the issue.
The rights issue followed Daimler's move last year to become the first
German company to obtain a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock
Exchange.
The move had proved fully justified, Mr Liener said. Daimler remains the
only German company to have a full listing in the US and therefore direct
access to the world's largest capital market.
The rights issue was launched in late June just ahead of a severe downturn
in the German stock market.
The shares were offered at DM640, a 20 per cent discount to the then share
price. Had the issue been priced more tightly, it might have been forced to
follow Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, and cancel, Mr Liener said.
He said that Daimler's turnover was likely to exceed DM100bn this year,
representing a slowdown in turnover growth from the 19 per cent advance in
the first quarter of 1994. The surge in sales reflected the popularity of
the new Mercedes.

Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, yesterday
announced a boardroom clean-out which seals his takeover at the troubled
Frankfurt-based metals and trading group seven months after it almost
collapsed.
Mr Neukirchen, who was drafted in last December to re-launch the group, said
the management board would be scaled down to five people from seven.
A new holding company, which would oversee the group's divisions, meant a
seven-man management board was now superfluous, the company said.
Mr Ulrich Wohr, the chief executive of the car parts supplier VDO Adolf
Schindling, will join the board as finance director on August 1, while Mr
Hans-Ulrich Plaul, the chief executive of Buderus, until recently a
Metallgesellschaft engineering subsidiary, will step down. Mr Neukirchen
will take over the personnel division on top of existing duties.
Metallgesellschaft almost collapsed earlier this year when it lost DM2.3bn
(Pounds 920m) through trading in oil futures.
The boardroom changeover comes days after a new chief executive assumed the
reins at MG Corp, the US subsidiary which is still tied up in loss-making
oil contracts with Castle Energy, a refinery 40 per cent owned by MG Corp.
The New York-based company, which Mr Neukirchen recently described as a
'machine for losing money', has been trimmed since the beginning of the year
and will now focus on delivering oil, petrol and other products to US
customers. Mr Karl von der Heyden, the outgoing chief executive, said the
company's debt would be halved by the end of September but it remains
unclear how it will extract itself from the Castle contracts.
In an effort to reduce debts which in March totalled DM9.2bn the group last
month announced it would sell its prestigious headquarters in the centre of
Frankfurt which it said could raise DM750m. However, the group will not
receive all the proceeds as the site is jointly owned by Dresdner Bank.
A week earlier Metallgesellschaft had raised DM1.2bn through the sale of
Buderus, its high-profile engineering unit.
Mr Heinrich Gotz, 63, left the supervisory board two years ago but was
recalled last December to oversee the personnel division and become Mr
Neukirchen's deputy during the group's overhaul.
Mr Gotz and Mr Jens-Peter Schaefer, who headed Lurgi, the energy-based
subsidiary, will step down.

FT  08 JUL 94 / BT boosted by Japanese link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the largest Japanese
telecommunications operator, has agreed to distribute international services
for British Telecommunications and MCI, the second-largest US long-distance
carrier.
BT hailed the deal as an advance for Concert, its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m)
joint venture with MCI launched last month, which is geared to providing
multinationals with a one-stop service - global telecom networks from a
single supplier.
However, regulatory barriers will restrict the range of services Concert can
offer in Japan, and the arrangement with Nippon Information and
Communication, a small joint venture between NTT and IBM Japan, is far short
of the tie-up with NTT which many analysts were seeking to give BT
credibility in Asia-Pacific.
'It is not the deal with NTT that people were looking for, although it
appears moderately encouraging for BT,' said Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms
analyst at Robert Fleming.
The arrangement is non-exclusive, and involves no equity exchange or joint
investment. NTT indicated that it did not preclude agreements with BT's
rivals. 'We are not aligning ourselves with BT against AT&amp;T or the French
and Germans,' said one NTT executive.
Concert also announced what it claimed was the first one-stop international
corporate telephone service for multinationals, giving it an edge over the
other two international telecoms alliances formed in the last year - led by
AT&amp;T and by Deutsche Telekom, the German state operator.
Mr Alfred Mockett, BT's international director, said the deal reinforced
BT's head start on its international competitors, claiming that Concert was
six months ahead of its two rival alliances in terms of technology and 12
months ahead in terms of marketing and regulatory approvals.
The Japanese deal marks Concert's first notable entry into the Asia-Pacific
market, which is critical to its ability to sell itself as a one-stop
provider to multinationals. About 20 per cent of the 2,000 multinationals
being targetted by Concert have facilities in Japan.
AT&amp;T's Worldsource venture, launched at the same time as Concert, has
partnerships with KDD, Japan's international operator, Singapore Telecom and
Telstra, the Australian national operator.
The third of the alliances - between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and
Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator - has no formal links
with Asian operators.
Concert said its one-stop international 'voice' service would be available
immediately in Australia and the larger EU states, and in the US and Canada
later this year. It will be followed this year by a Concert calling card.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Paris intelligence chief replaced after bugging Socialist
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Pasqua, France's interior minister, yesterday replaced both the
head of Paris's political intelligence service and his subordinate who
eavesdropped on a confidential meeting of the opposition Socialist party on
June 19 when Mr Michel Rocard was ousted as party leader.
In what has inevitably been dubbed 'Pasquagate', after the famous 1972 case
of political bugging in the US, Mr Pasqua first brushed aside furious
Socialist charges of 'espionage' by telling the National Assembly on
Wednesday that the eavesdropping was 'an isolated, individual initiative' by
a member of the Renseignements Generaux (RG).
But after the parliamentary leader of his own Gaullist RPR party also called
the affair 'a serious threat to democracy', Mr Pasqua announced he was
moving the two RG policemen to other duties, before waiting for the
conclusion of an internal inquiry.
MPs' sensitivity was already heightened by the revelation in this week's
issue of the satirical newspaper, Le Canard Enchaine, which also broke the
Pasquagate story, that one of their number, Mr Bernard Tapie, the maverick
businessman, had his tele-phone line bugged on a judge's order.
From this telephone-tapping the judge learned that Mr Tapie was planning a
trip to Rwanda to avoid prosecution and had him hauled out of bed and
charged last week.
As a result, the National Assembly passed a bill early yesterday ordering
judges to advise the speakers of the parliament's two chambers before
tapping MPs' telephones.
Ironically, Pasquagate was leaked by members of the RG who disapproved of
their colleague's action in installing himself in an empty translation booth
and telephoning through news of Mr Rocard's problems to police headquarters.
The mission of the RG (literally, General Information) is to act as the
'eyes and ears' of a French state, traditionally keen to control a society
that often seems to take it by surprise.
The activities of this plain-clothes force of some 3,800 range from serious
intelligence work in anti-terrorism, to gathering information on leaders of
political parties, companies, unions and the professions, and to
fore-casting election results.
In the last week of any French election campaign, publication of regular
opinion polls is forbidden. But everyone gossips about what the RG - which
continues its inquiries right up to election day - is predicting.
'The government needs to know what is happening in the country,' an Interior
Ministry spokesman said yesterday, 'and often we need information that is
more precise than appears in the press.' The press is, however, one of the
12 areas on which Paris's 1,200 RG officers target their attention. The RG
seeks, for instance, to find out what sensitive stories journalists might be
working on, and there is always an RG employee waiting at print works to
scoop up a first edition to ensure the prime minister, or minister, gets his
copy on time.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Health reforms under fire in report from ombudsman: NHS
attitude to complaints provokes Commons exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on the government over reform of the National Health Service
intensified yesterday with a report from the health ombudsman condemning the
handling of patients' complaints.
Mr William Reid, health service commissioner, described some cases he had
investigated as an 'abrogation of responsibility and neglect of management'.
His report criticises staff who are resentful of complainants and ignorant
of procedures and use of 'words rather than actions' in delivering a quality
service.
The report, which followed repeated attacks on the NHS reforms at this
week's British Medical Association conference, provoked immediate Commons
exchanges. Ms Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, accused Mr John Major
of presiding over a record level of complaints in the NHS.
The prime minister promised that ministers would take the report seriously.
Mr Reid's report reinforced speculation at Westminster that Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, will be moved in the forthcoming cabinet
reshuffle.
It is particularly embarrassing for the government because it suggests the
NHS reforms have contributed to the problem. It says many complaints arose
from poor communication, 'aggravated by splitting health care into many more
separate organisations'.
Serious problems in handling complaints persist in spite of government
efforts to give a higher priority to relations with patients.
Mr Reid says that far too often he found cases which showed a disregard for
the needs and care of fellow humans.
Staff were often ignorant of health department advice on how to admit
patients, give them adequate care and discharge them. Although there was a
legal requirement for members of health authorities and hospital boards to
receive quarterly reports on complaints, this was often ignored at local
level. 'A quality service is about devoting personal attention to individual
patients. Policies and procedures are useless if that essential human
element is missing,' says the ombudsman.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, called on the government to
produce an action plan to tackle the 'growing complaints crisis'.
'We are told that the health service is employing the best of modern
management practices, yet repeatedly it emerges that patients are continuing
to lose out,' he said.
The report shows that there was a 12.8 per cent increase in complaints to
the ombudsman between 1992-93 and 1993-94.
Ministers will, however, draw comfort from Mr Reid's comment that complaint
levels remain 'remarkably low' in relation to the volume of NHS activity.

FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Fnac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais is grappling with some gargantuan challenges. But the bank
still has time for the lesser things in life as its recent attempts to
reclaim Mr Bernard Tapie's antique furniture show. The mooted sale of its 65
per cent holding in the books and records retailer, Fnac, could provide a
more conventional means of raising some much-needed cash in a hurry. But the
likely FFr2bn proceeds will not make much of a dent in its debt.
Fnac has had a chequered history of ownership which has hindered its
progress. It has also suffered in recession from fierce competition from
Virgin and the hypermarket chains. Fnac's trading history has been
undistinguished; its net margin remains less than 2 per cent. But that owes
much to the costs of its uneven opening programme. The retailer certainly
has its attractions as a seller of intellectual software in the dawning
multi-media age. The application of committed management should enable Fnac
to push volumes higher in a recovering economy and widen margins, too.
Fnac could easily be embraced by the rapidly-expanding
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute retailing empire. But it is not necessarily a done
deal given that Generale des Eaux has pre-emption rights. Bertlesmann and
Kingfisher have been rumoured to be interested and may be tempted to offer
more. At a third of sales, the implied FFr3bn valuation for the whole of
Fnac does not seem excessive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The advertising recovery has come earlier and stronger than even the
optimists expected. The Advertising Association now expects spending to grow
by 13 per cent this year and 10 per cent next. The question for investors is
how best to lock into the upswing. Advertising agencies are the obvious
places to look because almost all their income is linked to spending by
their clients. Yesterday's results and cut dividend from Gold Greenlees
Trott are a reminder that the spoils will not be spread evenly.
There are similar arguments for selectivity among media owners. National
newspaper companies seem intent on reinvesting higher advertising revenue in
lower cover prices, although it is doubtful whether they will make a decent
return on this investment. Regional newspapers could be caught in the
crossfire: it will be difficult to raise the cover prices of leading
regional titles while national alternatives are cheaper. The better
opportunities may lie in radio - which has been gaining market share - and
magazine publishers.
Even though radio shares have raced ahead over the last year, not all the
good news may yet be in the price. Recent takeovers - including Reuters
buying the new London radio company even before it started broadcasting -
shows the appetite of industry insiders. Despite the impressive swing out of
recession this year, advertising spend may not grow much faster than the
wider economy in the 1990s. If that happens, the best investment
opportunities will lie in sectors which are taking a larger slice of the
cake.

FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders has dropped so many hints of its intention to buy the rest of
Wertheim that the actual deal scarcely comes as a surprise. The price it is
paying looks reasonable, too, especially after last year's exceptional
charge of Dollars 19m for the Ames department lawsuit is factored out of
Wertheim's 1994 earnings. But there is a nagging question of what is to be
gained by moving to full control when Schroders has already co-operated
closely with Wertheim for eight years.
Schroders would argue that the acquisition will make group strategic
planning more coherent. There will be one organisation instead of two
parallel ones. Full ownership of Wertheim will enhance its ability to
distribute foreign issues in the US. It will create interesting prospects
for corporate finance, for example advising US corporations on acquisitions
in the far east. As a result Schroders may eventually succeed in moving
Wertheim up several notches in the ranks of US investment banks.
Sceptics might see these as nebulous advantages for a total price, including
assumption of debt, of over Dollars 150m. The suspicion is that Schroders
has simply found the first convenient home for its surplus capital. But in
that case it has at least bought something familiar, and Schroders'
strategic track record suggests a more substantial motive. As it expands,
Wertheim will need extra capital which Schroders is now in a position to
provide. If it can move Wertheim into the major league, Schroders will have
made a productive investment.

FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: BT's Asian connection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's shares are back in favour. The 4 per cent rise over the past two days,
building on a modest rally since May, has gone some way to reverse the
terrible performance over the previous half year. The company has regained
its position as the UK's most highly capitalised group.
Yesterday's accord with Nippon Information and Communication has little to
do with the rally. This is not the big Asian deal Sir Iain Vallance, BT's
chairman, has been working for years to pull off. NI&amp;C is a small relatively
unknown company and, anyway, the marketing accord is non-exclusive. The deal
may, of course, foreshadow a closer relationship with Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, NI&amp;C's half-owner. A far-reaching alliance with the Japanese
giant would help fulfil BT's international dreams. But such a deal has yet
to be clinched. Even if it is, investors will be sceptical about BT's
international strategy so long as it depends heavily on paying 'control'
premiums for non-controlling stakes in foreign operators.
Still, the bounce in the share price looks right. BT had been oversold. Back
in May, its yield was 50 per cent higher than the market's. That was only
justified on the assumption that BT faced tough competition and no growth.
Competition it certainly faces. But the UK telecoms market has potential to
grow. BT's attempts to persuade people to use their phones more produced its
first fruit in the quarter to end-March. Not surprisingly, the yield premium
has shrunk to 30 per cent. A further modest reduction could be justified on
the hope that there is more growth to come. But a substantial rerating would
have to wait for hard evidence.

in the poverty trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For John, a supervisor with a small company making wooden kitchen and
bathroom furniture in Gateshead, the Pounds 28 a week he receives in Family
Credit is a lifeline in the struggle to make ends meet.
'It's very tight,' he says. 'I'm not talking of the last Pounds 10 or Pounds
15, I'm talking down to the last penny. We do without all sorts, luxuries,
food, going out. Holidays? No chance.'
His weekly wage of Pounds 150 gross for a 39-hour week has to support him,
his wife and two children aged 5 and 2. He has no opportunity for overtime
earnings.
On the industrial estate where he works, there are lots of lads, single men,
on Pounds 120 a week, says John. He knows of 16 and 17-year-olds on only
Pounds 50 a week.
Now 25, John left school at 16 with CSEs but no O Levels. He went on Youth
Training Schemes and Employment Training before landing his cherished job,
initially at Pounds 135 a week.
He and the workmate he supervises are proud of their work as wood
machinists. They have told the boss of other job offers they have had, and
he has promised to raise John's wage soon to Pounds 180, to make sure he
stays.
'I enjoy my work here; I've got a good reputation for the work I do,' says
John. 'It's being out of the house, working, and knowing things will get
better.'
But he admits: 'When I get down, I occasionally work out how much I would
get on the dole. There's not much difference.'
Last Christmas, his wife had a temporary job in a supermarket. 'She was
getting more than me.'
She is now training as a creche worker. 'She'll be on Pounds 4.75 a hour -
that's more than I'm getting.' He says his wife and her fellow trainees, who
expect to be employed at a creche near their homes, have been told they will
not be allowed to work more than 15 hours a week, to keep below the national
insurance threshold.
John expects his promised wage rise will wipe out his entitlement to Family
Credit, making the family almost no better off. In this he is probably wrong
 -although many people on Family Credit believe pay rises reduce benefit
pound for pound. The withdrawal rate depends on a number of factors, but
never reaches 100 per cent. While he remains a low-wage earner, his family's
income can rise markedly only if his wife can get out to work too, he says.
Her earnings as a creche worker would more than outweigh the loss of Family
Credit.
The weekly rent on their house is Pounds 29. He says things have been better
financially since he and his wife got on top of the heavy hire purchase
outgoings for the television, video and the car.
The latter is no luxury: the C-reg Vauxhall Cavalier is the vital connection
between his Sunderland home and his Gateshead workplace. Keeping it going is
a big commitment, made no easier by vandalism on the estate where he lives.
Regularly replacing smashed car windows is an additional drain on resources.
'The car's out on the road. It's always getting broken into. I pay the
damage - there's no point claiming.'
Some on the estate are not bothered about the lack of work, he says. They
make up their income from crime: 'They can go out and pinch six videos and
get more than I earn in a week. But one day they'll get their come-uppance.'
Informing the police is not the streetwise thing to do. 'If you report them,
they don't think twice of putting your windows out; they don't care who's in
the house.'
John says he and his wife keep to themselves. His full name has not been
used in this article at his request, out of concern for his family's safety.
He hopes in future years to fix up a job for his son at the same factory.
'It's who you know, not what you know,' he says. 'It's all through the
grapevine.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Bretton Woods and the G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just a photo opportunity: that is how one knowledgeable observer has already
dismissed the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, due
to start in Naples tonight. It could well prove to be an accurate forecast.
Fortunately, President Clinton comes armed with a number of ideas, some of
which, notably the call for an official review of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, deserve support.
It is, in any case, wrong to overdo the cynicism. At the least, G7 summits
help leaders know one another better. Summits can also push global
decision-making forward. The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations might never have been finished if successive summits had not
reminded more recalcitrant leaders of its importance. Now they can remind
one another of the need to ratify the outcome. But summits are not the right
place for day-to-day economic management. On exchange rates, the question
leaders should ask themselves is not whether the ailing dollar needs
support, but whether the system needs modification.
Not all the topics on the agenda are likely to prove equally productive. But
now is the right time for the G7 to pay attention to the Bretton Woods
institutions. This is appropriate, not just because of the 50th anniversary
of the initial conference, but also because the world has changed so much in
recent years.
Global co-operation
Communism has collapsed, largely because of the success of postwar economic
reconstruction. Russia's presence at the summit bears witness to this
change. With the passing of the strategic threat it posed, the international
economic system is both the heart of global co-operation and a potentially
potent source of conflict. Also important is the rapid economic growth of
populous east Asia, which may soon deprive the present G7 of the capacity to
determine the shape of the international economic system. In addition, the
agreement to create the World Trade Organisation, reached since the last
summit, means that now is the appropriate time to return to the topics of
international macroeconomic co-operation and development assistance.
The Bretton Woods commission, under the leadership of Mr Paul Volcker, has
helped define the issues. It calls for the major industrial governments,
first, to strengthen macroeconomic policies and convergence and, second, to
establish a more formal system of co-ordination, including target bands for
exchange rates. Managing this would become the IMF's central role, leaving
development assistance to a reformed World Bank Group. The latter should
have a greater orientation towards the private sector, largely through an
expanded role for the International Finance Corporation.
Fiscal deficits
These ideas deserve consideration, above all in the G7, which alone can
ensure any conclusions are put into effect. But they are not all equally
persuasive. Those on the World Bank and the relationship between it and the
IMF seem cogent. Also convincing is the call for better fiscal policy, the
greatest need being smaller fiscal deficits over the cycle.
The most controversial question is whether, now that inflation has converged
at low levels, greater exchange rate stability can also be achieved. It is
easy to accept that floating rates have not behaved as well as people once
hoped. It is more difficult to agree that this has been one of the main
reasons for the slowdown in growth since the 1960s. Nor, particularly after
the ERM's melt-down last summer, is it obvious that there exists a workable
alternative. The tighter any exchange rate bands, the more demanding the
system, in terms not just of knowledge about where limits should be set, but
also of the willingness of the members to subordinate domestic goals to
international obligations.
Nevertheless, it makes sense for the G7 to confront the question of reform.
To do so, it should set up high-level taskforces, to make recommendations on
how to achieve the goals of the Bretton Woods conference, 50 years on.
Attempting this task is both timely and important. It would also pay
suitable homage to those wise leaders of 50 years ago, whose achievement can
be seen in the fact that the G7's second, third and fifth largest economies
were then enemy powers.

Red faces all round. The publisher of Capital Account, the magazine of the
London Society of Chartered Accountants, has gone into receivership. Its
unpaid bills include money owed to the society itself. Worse still, one of
Capital Account's directors is David Haigh, author of a book called
Marketing Your Practice, published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales.
It describes him as having extensive experience in marketing and
communications - but not presumably in adding up.

As Jacques Delors' regime in Brussels draws to a close, loyalists of the
European Commission president are scrambling for their survival parachutes.
The aim of the game is to jump before you are pushed overboard when Delors'
successor arrives.
Insiders report that Francois Lamoureux, the philosopher-type who was a key
player in the Maastricht treaty negotiations, has quietly moved to a senior
management job at DG3, the Commission's industry directorate. Jean-Michel
Baer, who headed the Commission's Paris office, has taken charge of the
audio-visual section of DG10, the information and culture directorate.
Jean-Francois Pons, formerly working on monetary affairs, has been promoted
to deputy director-
general of DG4, the competition directorate.
Delors has not been as active as some of his predecessors in fixing up top
jobs for his acolytes. Bruno Dethomas, his spokesman, remains uncertain
about where his next move will be, but insists he is not going back to his
old journalism job at Le Monde. Brave words.

Hard luck, Tony. Blair is going to have to wait until the autumn before he
gets his first go at outshining Britain's prime minister at the Commons
dispatch box.
The government has decided that MPs will start their modest 12-week summer
holidays at lunchtime on July 21 - just hours after Blair's expected
coronation as Labour leader. Normal service at the dispatch box won't be
resumed until October 18. That gives John Major plenty of time to master his
Blair-bashing technique.
However, the parliamentary timetablers have not been able to delay one
long-overdue showdown. Next Thursday sees health secretary Virginia
Bottomley being grilled by an all-party group on parenting. Peter Bottomley
will lead the questioning.
If anyone knows just how far he can go with Virginia, it should be her
husband.

Should any readers happen to insure their boats with Eagle Star, don't be

Earlier this week a crew from the giant insurer was competing in the T &amp; N
Industry Sailing challenge. Eagle Star is hot stuff on the water, and until
early Tuesday looked likely to win again. However, with just 10 miles to go,
it bumped into a crew from Mars (confectioners not planet), and emerged with
a sizeable hole in the yacht's port quarter.
It's not clear how it will affect Eagle Star's No Claims Bonus.

The girls of St Trinians could not have thought up a better plot. The fate
of Felixstowe College, a boarding school in Suffolk, has been thrown into
the unlikely hands of Andrew Buxton, chairman of Barclays Bank, and Saddam
Hussein, the president of Iraq. The mind boggles at the possibilities.
It all started when Felixstowe announced a couple of weeks ago that it would
close at the end of this term because it had run up sizeable debts. However,
this week's sale of the former dartboard in Canford School's tuckshop - a
Pounds 7m Assyrian frieze - has offered a possible lifeline for Felixstowe,
a fellow member of the loosely grouped Allied Schools - chairman Andrew
Buxton. It seems the schools have a policy of guaranteeing each other's
debts.
There is therefore a possibility - albeit remote - that part of Canford's
windfall could be used to bail out the distressed gentlewomen of Felixstowe.
Buxton was in a huddle with Allied Schools' governors at Barclays' head
office in London yesterday.
However, any rescue plan might still have to be passed by Saddam, whose
spokesman has described the action of selling the frieze as 'obnoxious'.
Iraq said it would use all legal means to recover the carving, and the
country's Revolutionary Command Council has also sentenced 'smugglers of
antiquities' to death, just to raise the stakes a little.
But for the parents and teachers of Felixstowe College, if not the gels, it
is already a matter of life and death.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Search for a way to stay afloat: John Willman explains why
social security reforms could cut unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full employment is back at the top of the policy agenda. At a conference on
Tuesday organised by the UK Trades Union Congress, Mr David Hunt, the
Conservative employment secretary, as well as business and union leaders,
committed themselves to cutting jobless queues to the minimum.
Mr Hunt was candid enough to point out that there remains disagreement over
how full employment is to be achieved. There is a gulf between those who see
low inflation and deregulation as the way forward and those who want
reflationary policies.
But there is a growing consensus that, if full employment is to be realised,
reforms to the social security system are needed. 'A welfare state created
50 years ago needs modernising if it is to encourage the labour market
flexibility that is widely seen as essential to competitiveness in the
global economy,' says Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies.
The need for social security reform arises from the changing nature of work.
As last month's jobs study from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development pointed out, many of the new jobs emerging in the advanced
economies are low-productivity, low-wage jobs. The gap between the better
paid and the worst paid is widening in most countries, according to a recent
IFS study. In the UK, hourly wages of the lowest-paid men have fallen in
real terms since 1976, while in the US below median wages have been falling
for the past 20 years.
In many countries, welfare systems discourage the unemployed from accepting
new jobs which offer wages close to - or even below - the level of benefits
paid to the unemployed. The OECD study recommended that social security
systems should pay benefits to people who take up low-paid jobs to ensure
that they are better off in work than on the dole.
The UK is the only large European country to have attempted to go down that
path with Family Credit, a benefit for low-paid workers with children. More
than 500,000 families receive this means-tested benefit, getting an average
of Pounds 42 a week tax free, to top up their income.
To get Family Credit, the breadwinner must work for 16 hours or more a week
and be responsible for at least one child. The amount of benefit depends on
the number and age of children and the family income - based on earnings net
of tax, national insurance and pension contributions.
If family income is Pounds 71.70 a week (or less), the family receives the
full amount of benefit. For a family with two children under 10, this would
be Pounds 66.70. Such a family would also receive Pounds 18.45 a week in
child benefit, so Family Credit creates an effective floor for their income
of Pounds 156.85 (Pounds 71.70 + Pounds 66.70 + Pounds 18.45). So long as
they claim their benefits and stay in work, they are unlikely to sink below
this level.
According to a recent survey by Policy Studies Institute, the independent
think-tank, Family Credit leaves couples on average about Pounds 18 a week
better off in work than if they gave up their jobs and took unemployment
benefits. Single parents are about Pounds 30 a week better off.
'The majority of families with experience both of unemployment and working
on Family Credit said they preferred being in work on Family Credit to a
life on the dole,' says Mr Alan Marsh of the PSI.
There have been difficulties in persuading many of the people who ought to
be getting Family Credit to make a claim. However, a prolonged publicity
campaign has raised take-up to about two-thirds of those eligible. Of those
that don't claim, many would have been entitled to only small amounts and
may have chosen not to claim.
Ministers certainly regard Family Credit as having encouraged people to take
low-paid jobs. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is considering extending
it to cover childless couples and single people. That would add another
Pounds 1bn a year to the Pounds 1.2bn already spent.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
has proposed a more fundamental overhaul of benefits both for those in work
and the unemployed, to cater for the demand for greater flexibility in
labour markets. Most UK benefits were designed for a world of full-time,
regular work in which a male breadwinner brings home the family income.
Increasingly, employers are looking for less rigid work patterns and want
workers prepared to work on a part-time, casual or seasonal basis.
Even with Family Credit, the benefits system still discourages unemployed
people - and their partners - from accepting such flexible work. 'With
benefits, we enter a kind of crystal maze of traps, tapers, withdrawals and
disregards,' says Mr Davies. 'It is a maze from which many unemployed people
find it hard to escape.'
Unemployed people, who are entitled to Income Support, for example, can earn
only small amounts each week ('disregards') without losing benefit. Any
part-time income over Pounds 5 a week (Pounds 15 a week for long-term
unemployed) reduces the amount of benefit pound for pound. At such low
levels, accepting part-time or casual jobs could leave them worse off after
travel and other work expenses.
Their partners' income is similarly treated, providing an equally strong
disincentive for them to seek work. A recent study found that only 12 per
cent of wives of unemployed men were working more than eight hours a week,
although more than half wanted to work. The result is to create 'work-poor'
households reliant on benefits.
The wife (it is almost always the wife) in a couple on Family Credit has a
similar problem if she accepts low-paid work. Her wage will reduce - perhaps
extinguish altogether - the husband's Family Credit, leaving them little or
no better off. If the work is insecure, she may decide to stick with the
assurance of a weekly benefit cheque.
In a world where wages for the unskilled are falling, creating 'work-rich'
households with both partners in work is the key to reducing dependency.
Rules which make it harder for wives to take whatever work is on offer leave
families trapped on a single low income and reliant on the state.
One option would be to increase the disregards, which have remained at
current levels for years. A disregard of Pounds 30 might allow someone to
work a day a week without losing any benefit.
A second option would be to allow unemployed people to accumulate their
disregards across several weeks, so that they could take an occasional
temporary job without coming off benefit altogether.
A third option would be to reduce the rate at which benefit is cut when
income is higher than the disregards. If the withdrawal rate was reduced
below 100 per cent, there would be an incentive to accept casual work.
More radically, separate disregards could be introduced for husband and
wife. This would provide an incentive for wives to accept part-time and
low-paid jobs. If it encouraged both partners into jobs, it would help
narrow the gap between work-rich and work-poor households.
A further deterrent to entering insecure forms of work is the difficulty
recipients face in moving between benefits for the unemployed and in-work
benefits.
'Life inside the benefits maze, while not exactly a life of Riley, can seem
more predictable and in some ways secure than the uncertain job market,'
says the CBI's Mr Davies. Taking a job means leaving Income Support and
claiming Family Credit and - for tenants - Housing Benefit. Despite
streamlining the system for claiming Family Credit, it can still take
several weeks to receive payments. Housing Benefit can take much longer.
Although benefits payments are backdated, the delay leaves a nasty gap in
the finances of people who normally have little or no savings to live off.
This sudden loss of income comes at a time when returning to work may
involve one-off expenses, to buy tools, work clothing or transport. Some
sort of return-to-work payment - perhaps set against future Family Credit
payments - would bridge the gap. Alternatively, unused disregards might be
rolled up to continue paying Income Support.
Creating a one-stop benefits shop for the unemployed would also be a step
forward. The aim would be to provide a seamless flow of benefit income for
those returning to work and for those moving back from jobs that peter out.
'People don't only look at the level of income they will get by re-entering
work,' says Ms Eithne McLaughlin, of Queen's University, Belfast. 'They give
weight to the sources of income, including their reliability.'
The good news for policymakers is that the majority of unemployed people -
including the long-term unemployed - are seeking work and would prefer paid
work to unemployment. The trick is to give them the confidence to make the
leap from the security of the dole in an increasingly insecure labour
market, confident that they will not be digging themselves into debt.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Leading Article: The G8 and a plan for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, the world leaders assembled in Naples do not need to do
anything about Bosnia. Their foreign ministers have already worked out a
peace plan and the ball is now in the court of the warring parties, which
have been given until July 19 to decide their response.
Yet Bosnia certainly will be on the summit agenda, if only because the
Italian hosts have placed it there. As a close neighbour of the former
Yugoslavia, with an obvious interest in the outcome of the war there, Italy
is understandably irritated at its exclusion from the 'contact group', in
which the EU is represented by Britain, France and Germany. Beyond that, the
inclusion of Russia for the first time in the political part of a G7 summit
offers a timely opportunity for the leaders of Europe, America and Russia to
emphasise, and to cement, their new-found unity on the conflict.
It is indeed this unity of sponsorship which constitutes the main novelty in
the plan, and the only element which gives it any better chance of success
than its predecessors. Otherwise the content is broadly familiar, and has
not changed significantly since last November, when France and Germany
produced their 'action plan' and persuaded the EU to back it. Indeed, the
basic principle of a de facto partition within a de jure union was agreed as
long ago as last summer. The EU merely adjusted the percentages somewhat in
favour of the Moslems, while offering Serbia the carrot of lifting
sanctions. In March this year the US negotiated an agreement between Moslems
and Croats, so that since then the main focus has been on the share of
territory allotted to the Serbs, namely 49 per cent, as opposed to the
roughly 70 per cent that they hold at present.
Arms embargo
To the carrot is now added a stick, in the shape of a warning that if the
Serbs reject the plan, the UN security council will lift the arms embargo,
enabling the Moslems and Croats to pursue the war more effectively. At the
same time the Moslems and Croats are warned that, if they reject the plan,
sanctions on Serbia will be lifted. In either case, the UN protection force
(Unprofor) would almost certainly be withdrawn. But if both sides accept the
plan it would be strengthened, notably with a large US contingent.
The question now, therefore, is whether the unity of the contact group is
strong and credible enough for both sides to take it seriously. Unhappily,
there is still much room for doubt on that point. The Moslems know that the
US is far from enthusiastic about deploying troops to support a plan which,
with good reason, it regards as morally tainted: a plan that would partially
ratify Serb 'ethnic cleansing' by leaving in Serb hands several towns which
had Moslem majorities before the war. The US has consistently advertised its
preference for lifting the arms embargo; and last week in the Senate a
resolution which would have forced the administration to pursue this option
unilaterally failed by only one vote.
Desperately familiar
Similarly the Russians, and indeed the British and French, have so often
voiced opposition to lifting the embargo that the Serbs will not easily be
convinced that they are willing to agree to it, even if the peace plan
fails. Both sides will see the next phase not as one in which they have to
accept the plan and implement it in good faith, making the best of a bad
job, but rather as one in which each manoeuvres to avoid implementing it
while letting the other take the blame. Indeed, President Izetbegovic has
admitted this with disarming frankness: 'We will be saying yes, since the
Serbs will be rejecting it.'
All this is desperately familiar from the time of the Vance-Owen plan, and
the danger is that the contact group will be unable to agree either on which
side is responsible for the plan's failure, or on how much extra time to
give them to come round. It is therefore vital that the leaders of the
countries concerned take advantage of being together in Naples to make clear
their personal commitment, not only to the plan as such but to specific
criteria by which the co-operation of the parties will be judged, and
specific courses of action to be taken if they do not co-operate.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warning: do not mishear what is to follow. It may sound like another replay
of that many-times discredited theme, 'Major rises; Tories resurgent.' It is
not. On present form the Conservatives are headed for defeat at the general
election of 1996 or 1997. Those of us who have twice or thrice made the
mistake of writing up the prime minister or his party should have learnt the
lesson by now. Mr John Major is still the least popular holder of his office
in postwar memory. He is a weak leader of an unstable coalition of
fundamentally opposed factions of the right and centre. He is, and may be
doomed to remain, an object of national derision.
Got it? Fine. Then let it be acknowledged that the prime minister, in free
fall until a few months ago, seems to have reached firmish ground. This is
not saying much. There was hardly a great deal of downwards direction in
which to go. He is, however, a beneficiary of the first manifestation of
progress, namely an absence of further deterioration. The government seems
to have cured itself of the habit, so distressing to its practitioners, of
knocking its head against a wall. One of its scathing internal critics, a
senior minister who a few months ago expressed near-despair at the prime
minister's floundering, and moaned aloud at his deficiencies as a leader, is
saying that Mr Major is showing signs of 'grip'. Just a little, but it
appears to be there.
Grip is a magic word in Conservative circles. It means taking charge, making
things happen, planning a strategy and sticking with it. Without it you are
condemned to withdrawing everything you say, to a series of policy
somersaults, to the sneers of the populace and a persistent hail of bad
luck. Grip is what Lady Thatcher had until 1988. She lost it and within a
couple of years she was out. Mr Major, if he ever had it, mislaid it in
September 1992. As chancellor, he had the then prime minister enrol Britain
in the exchange rate mechanism. On Black Wednesday sterling was ejected from
the ERM. Mr Major's strategy was blown to pieces. Bye bye grip.
It would be depressing to recount the history of the government's subsequent
misfortunes. Just let us say that rarely has such humiliation been inflicted
on so deserving a collection of individuals, giving such perverse pleasure
to so many. This week the catcalls appear to be dying down. Fewer rotten
tomatoes are being flung. It is no longer chic to barrack Mr Major and his
government with quite the enthusiasm of the early spring. This change in the
political mood needs some explanation, beyond the familiar list of reasons
why each of the possible successors to the prime minister would be
unsuitable or unlikely to challenge him.
The principal factor is the apparent general acceptance of a multi-speed
Europe, a notion elaborated by Mr Douglas Hurd. Moderate Euro-sceptics
appear to have acquiesced in his wheeze. Using the Hurd formulation,
sometimes called variable geometry, as a basis for anti-European rhetoric
will not trigger a serious revolt by pro-Europeans so long as the foreign
secretary himself, plus the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the trade and
industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, remain paid-up signatories. The
Hurd concordat allows Mr Clarke to say that he favours monetary union, while
Mr Michael Portillo asserts that he does not. Thus fortified, the cabinet
(or nearly all of it) followed Mr Major into the streets to campaign in the
elections to the European Parliament. The Conservatives lost badly, but not
so horribly as forecast. The prime minister took his bows in the garden of
No 10 Downing Street.
It was an easy act to follow. Mr Major's loud rejection of the Franco-German
candidate for presidency of the European Commission enhanced the impression
that he was taking control, and won Lady Thatcher's ap-proval. At last
night's meeting of backbenchers he exuded an air of confidence. Some say
that he has passed through unendurably bad times and emerged the stronger
for it. I'll believe this when he has kept it up for a year. He might. He
may not have been born with grip, but grip is being thrust upon him.
His next trick will be to reshuffle his cabinet. It was dotty to announce in
the rose garden that all his ministers' jobs would be in danger for a few
weeks, but that period is now drawing to a close. The long advance notice
created an expectation that the changes will be substantial. They had better
be, although it is hard to see in what way. If Mr Hurd postpones his
retirement for another year, the great offices - foreign secretary, home
secretary and chancellor - may well remain untouched, while Mr Heseltine
will be difficult to dislodge from industry. If only lesser individuals are
to be moved, Mr Major will have to demonstrate grip by shifting as many of
them as possible.
I have no idea what he will do. Some say that Mr David Hunt remains
front-runner to replace Sir Norman Fowler as party chairman. That would
release the Department of Employment, a cabinet newcomer's post that could
suit Mr Stephen Dorrell. Mr Major needs to promote more Tory women. My
favourite for education secretary is Mrs Gillian Shephard, who has a good
track record in local education. She would be well placed to win both
teachers' and parents' support for the national curriculum, testing and
league tables, and unlikely to press for further opting-out. Her chair at
agriculture could go to Mr Michael Portillo, who might enjoy debating the
Common Agricultural Policy with his continental cousins. Baroness Blatch
could take on the Department of Heritage in the Lords. Mrs Emma Nicholson
could become minister for the disabled, and the Angelas Knight and Browning
might profitably be moved up the lower slopes.
Assuming that his reshuffle is successful, the prime minister may arrange
for a summer of planned sequential departmental announcements of good news.
The party conference in October will be Euro-sceptic and right-leaning, even
if Mr Hunt is maestro. The Queen's speech is likely to contain few if any
surprises. 'Consolidation' is the current demand. The November Budget will
doubtless be hailed as 'steady as she goes'. If fate allows all this to
proceed according to plan, Mr Major's precipitate descent into the abyss
will truly have come to an end. But do note the health warning above.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: A way round the vagaries of
regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Some shareholders of privatised companies whose profits are subject to
the vagaries of the regulators ('Power companies await the crunch', July
2/3) may wonder whether their interests and those of consumers are really so
inevitably opposed, as is generally assumed.
Could not a formula be found which would allow the benefits of
modernisation, rationalisation and investment to be shared equitably between
the parties, without stifling the companies' incentives to economise on the
one hand or enabling them to rip off the consumers on the other?
The answer is that it could if the regulator would only tear himself away
from the two well-known methods of regulation, known as 'rate of return
regulation' and 'price capping', both of which have failed so lamentably in
the past. The formula needed is for profits to be limited, not by rate of
return nor by prices per se, but by reference to the benefit the company
brings to its customers by way of price reductions from year to year. Such a
formula was published two years ago in the July 1992 Political Quarterly.
This would enable the company to retain large profits as long as it passes
on a proportion of its economies to its customers; profits would be
inexorably reduced if the company tried to swell them at the expense of
customers. The whole process is automatic, so the regulator need not
intervene to keep the company on its toes.
And the company need not look over its shoulder all the time to try to guess
how severe the regulator will be after the next review.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Devaluation merely debilitates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUG HENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While it was cheering to read an honest diagnosis of the US economy -
rare in these days of celebration of the American way of life - it is
disappointing that Wynne Godley and William Milberg (Personal View, July 6)
concluded that a cheaper dollar is 'just what is needed'. Yes, the US
suffers from a chronic trade deficit and is again sinking deeper into
cross-border hock. And for the first time since before the first world war,
the US is no longer a net earner on foreign investments. (I point this out
not to celebrate the virtues of overseas assets, only to note a profound
shift in international relations.) But will depreciating the currency solve
the problem?
Devaluation is the economic equivalent of steroids: it can bulk you up for a
little while, but it is debilitating over the long term. As Keynes famously
noted, admittedly before he was really a Keynesian, debauching a currency
'engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction,
and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose'.
It impoverishes a country on a world scale, and diverts attention from
serious underlying problems like chronically low investment levels,
political drift, and social decay. Among the countries with chronically
depreciating currencies are the UK and Argentina; with appreciating ones,
Japan and Germany. Which club would you rather belong to?
The answer is not some Volcker II, a dramatic tightening by the Federal
Reserve; while that might boost the dollar for a while, it would depress
real investment and further worsen the trade picture, which is the last
thing the US needs. Instead of reviving one of the less fortunate aspects of
the Keynesian legacy, devaluation, we might revive some of the more
intriguing aspects, namely the repression of finance and the 'somewhat
comprehensive socialisation of investment'.
Of course, these are deeply unfashionable things to say, but who wants to be
a slave of fashion?

non-executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is understandable that questions should be raised over the quality
of non-executive directors, with 84 per cent of institutional investors
surveyed taking the view that non-executive directors are less effective
than expected ('City slams 'low calibre' non-executive directors', July 4).
What is more difficult to understand is why these institutional investors
make such little use of their considerable voting strength as shareholders
to remove lightweight non-executive directors and replace them with
individuals of sufficient calibre.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Privatisation, not efficiency, the
real government objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The leaked details of the government's forthcoming civil service white
paper ('Cabinet plan to reform Whitehall pay bargaining', July 5) are
noteworthy not for the references to delegated pay bargaining so much as the
predicted move from market testing to straight privatisation.
It is claimed that there will be 'a reduced emphasis' on market testing and
'increasing encouragement for privatisation'; apparently because market
testing is costly and private sector bidders are 'reluctant to bid because
most contracts are won by departments' own teams'.
The government's own statistics make interesting reading. Of the first
Pounds 1.1bn-worth of work market tested, the private sector was awarded
Pounds 855m-worth. Of this, Pounds 768m was directly contracted out, with no
in-house bid permitted. Where an in-house bid was allowed, six out of seven
of the market tests were won by the in-house team. So much for the
exhilarating effects of exposing civil servants to the chill winds of
competition with the private sector.
In the foreword to the 1991 white paper, Competing for Quality, the then
chancellor, Norman Lamont, said: 'Services may be bought either from the
private sector or within the public sector; we have no dogmatic preference
for either one over the other . . . we believe that public sector managers
and staff will welcome the opportunity to compare the services they provide
in fair and open competition with the best of the private sector.'
An examination of the more recent Citizen's Charter second report revealed
government claims for annual savings of Pounds 100m to be virtually
meaningless, the figures having been calculated on anticipated savings over
a 10-year period. Even then a note warned that 'the calculation of any net
savings figure should be treated with caution and regarded as illustrative
only'.
So, on two counts the government stands exposed as having as its real
objective not efficient public services but rather privatised services -
regardless of the quality. Public servants and public service users are
entitled to better than this.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Bretton Woods (50 years): Rules needed for new age - John
Williamson continues the Bretton Woods series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Bretton Woods conferees concluded their deliberations of 50 years
ago, they thought they had created a new international monetary system to
replace the monetary anarchy of the 1930s, and a new bank that would replace
the international capital market which had been killed off by the defaults
induced by the Great Depression. The Bretton Woods monetary system died in
the early 1970s. The international capital market confounded the conferees'
expectations. It revived to a point where it at least matches its golden age
before the first world war. The contribution of the World Bank to
international lending is now marginal.
The remaining legacy of the Bretton Woods conference is the two large
bureaucracies known as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Since
the original remit of both institutions has vanished, and bureaucracies are
inherently unlovable, it is not too surprising that there are suggestions to
abolish them.
But the '50 years is enough' campaign is orchestrated by those who are not
necessarily dedicated to the objectives that both organisations are now
pursuing: helping poor countries catch up with rich ones and assisting
former centrally planned economies to make the transition to a market
economy. Both have, in fact, exhibited a substantial measure of flexibility
in adapting their operations to evolving circumstances. The task of
development, or of making the transition from communism to the market
economy, would be even harder without the technical expertise and financial
support the Bretton Woods institutions provide.
Since the 1970s, however, both the fund and the bank have been providing
increasingly similar support to the same group of countries. Given the
overlap, thoughts of merging them inevitably arose. They are less easy to
dismiss than calls to abolish them.
The only convincing answer to those subversive thoughts would be a return by
the IMF to the monetary vocation for which it was created. Its current role
of fostering macroeconomic discipline in non-industrial countries would then
revert to being a by-product of its central task of overseeing the
international monetary system, rather than the be-all and end-all of its
existence.
There are reasons for believing such a return could improve world economic
performance. The heyday of the Bretton Woods system, from the end of the
postwar recovery in the late 1950s until the late 1960s, was the best decade
the world economy has experienced. It was a golden age in terms of the speed
and wide distribution of growth, with low inflation and payments imbalances
that caused concern but, because of that, did not build up large debt
overhangs threatening prosperity.
This impressive performance was aided by the opportunities of catch-up
growth in Europe and Japan, the scope for exploiting the first, easy stage
of import substitution in developing countries, the inheritance of low
inflation, and the absence of big economic shocks. Nevertheless, the Bretton
Woods system, with its dedication to balance-of-payments discipline and
equilibrium exchange rates, alongside full employment, helped.
While the years since 1971 have not yielded disasters comparable with the
1930s, the cup is no more than half full. A massive overvaluation of
sterling in the early 1980s destroyed far too much of British manufacturing.
In the mid-1980s, there was an equally large overvaluation of the dollar,
the reaction to which threatened the international trading system.
Happy-go-lucky attitudes toward payments imbalances led directly to the
international debt crisis, which cost much of the developing world a decade
of progress. The attempt to freeze European exchange rates prematurely led
to a far deeper recession than would otherwise have occurred. These ills
were not unavoidable; they were not avoided because there were no rules of
the game as appropriate to their era as the Bretton Woods rules were to the
1960s.
Bretton Woods rules cannot be resurrected, primarily because capital
mobility has made it very difficult to manage exchange rates with narrow
bands and occasional jumps in central rates. But that is no reason for
failing to design rules that would be equally appropriate to our age.
Such rules should provide for a system of 'target zones' for exchange rates,
with central rates set for consistency with satisfactory medium-run
macroeconomic outcomes and regularly revised to prevent their becoming
outdated. Concerted intervention, backed up, when necessary, by changes in
interest rates, could prevent rates leaving the zones even under the current
situation of high capital mobility, provided intervention did not occur
until it was virtually certain that the market had overshot.
Ideally, there would also be international pressure for responsible fiscal
policies, meaning far smaller budget deficits over the cycle, combined with
active anti-cyclical stabilisation. It is difficult to envisage this
happening soon. But politicians are searching for institutional mechanisms
that will tie their hands with respect to fiscal policy. Why not offer them
a way of committing themselves to economically sensible rules, instead of to
balanced budgets or the arbitrary Maastricht limits?
In a recent speech at the Institute for International Economics, the
managing director of the IMF stated that he yearned for more currency
stability. He also declared that, in many ways, circumstances were now
propitious for movement in that direction. The obstacles, he implied, lay in
the continuing resistance of many of the member countries.
It would have been an ideal 50th birthday present for the IMF if the most
powerful and most resistant of those members, the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries, had invited the managing director to their Naples
summit this weekend specifically to explore ways of rebuilding an
international monetary system worthy of the name, in whose management the
IMF would once again have a central role.
The memory of Bretton Woods would be even better honoured if the summit
asked what else needed to be done to update the international economic
system. So far as the World Bank is concerned, there is nothing that could
not be remedied by having a president who had spent a lifetime in economic
development.
The Bretton Woods twins are about to be joined by their long-lost sibling, a
World Trade Organisation, to ensure countries take account of the global
interest in liberal trade. But the agenda has broadened since then. There is
also a need to create a Global Environmental Organisation, to ensure that
similar account is taken of environmental spillovers.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Spread of nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MEGAN RYAN and Mr NICHOLAS LENSSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox raises some excellent points in her critique of the
International Atomic Energy Agency ('Soft bark and a weak bite', July 4).
However, even if her call for the watchdog to 'be more alert than in the
past' were heeded, it would do little to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.
Given the conflicting nature of the IAEA's charter, in which it is
specifically called upon to promote peaceful uses of nuclear power, regulate
nuclear safety and control proliferation of nuclear weapons, it is doubtful
that increased vigilance will do the trick. It is impossible to promote
civilian nuclear technology without increasing the risk of nuclear weapons
proliferation.
As the 1946 Acheson-Lilenthal report to President Truman stated: 'The
development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and the development of
atomic energy for bombs are in much of their course interchangeable and
interdependent.' This connection continues today, as illustrated by Bronwen
Maddox's example that new technology makes it increasingly easy to convert
uranium and plutonium from commercial grade to weapons grade.
The IAEA's current position is analogous to the fox guarding the hen house.
To resolve the dilemma, the IAEA will need to abandon its role of promoting
nuclear technologies - which would require amending its charter. It is not
simply a question of waking up the fox, as Maddox suggests.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: The Schoolmistress - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are English and live in England, you have at least two notions of
your native land: the real present-day England in which you live, and the
old ideal England, the green and pleasant land of tradition. And you relish
those occasions when these two Englands seem to merge into one - maybe
watching cricket on the village green, maybe picnicking at Glyndebourne. But
the experience is only valuable if the present-day England does not vanish
beneath the illusion of the old one. Today's cricket must be good; and
Glyndebourne takes its audiences seriously enough to challenge them with
tough-minded productions.
Not so Chichester. The audiences at the Chichester Festival Theatre look
predominantly English, middle-class and middle-aged, and yet they lap up
productions that present them with cheap reproductions of Ye Olde Englande -
the kind of England that should only fool the kind of tourist who is 'doing'
England in a week. I cannot remember when I saw anything worse than its new
production of Pinero's 1886 comedy The Schoolmistress - a featherweight
little late-Victorian farce about secrecy, class and marriage, dragged down
by execrably heavy Comedy Effects from the entire cast - but its first-night
audience gurgled and chortled. This is theatre as the most futile kind of
escapism, offering an England of perpetually puerile behaviour and crummy
caricatures.
Still, even these viewers would surely prefer to see more three-dimensional
acting; and this Pinero play would be surely more delectable if its cast
took it seriously for a moment. This is one of those late-19th century
farces in which marriages are kept secret and secrets are kept within
marriages. The schoolmistress, Miss Dyott, has recently married a penniless
aristo, the Hon. Vere Queckett - in secret. She supports him, but she keeps
secret from him her amateur career as a comic opera singer. He keeps his
chums secret from her. Meanwhile one of her pupils, Dinah Rankling, has
married Mr Reginald Paulover in secret. It is particularly important that
Dinah's parents, Rear Admiral and Mrs Rankling, do not discover the latter
marriage. Peggy Hesselridge, pupil of Miss Dyott's college and in training
to be a governess, emerges as a key manipulator of events - and in so doing
falls in love too. And so forth.
All of which could, I suppose, be delicious - a perfect summer sorbet - but
Matthew Francis's staging treats Pinero's characters like mere marionettes,
and treats young love and repressive old age as if they were both very
silly. Most bizarre of all, it asks us to believe that Patricia Routledge
(Miss Dyott) has married Guy Henry (the Hon. Vere Q). Now, Routledge has
been middle-aged as long as I can recall, and she has grown stouter with the
years, whereas Henry is a wide-eyed young beanpole who does not entirely
convince as an emblem of maritally fulfilled heterosexuality. If Pinero had
wanted a hippo to marry a giraffe, he would have made that central to his
comedy. But since we are not asked to be amused by this marriage of
opposites, we can only find it grotesque.
But everything about the way The Schoolmistress is played says 'Don't
believe this'. The schoolgirls are supposed to be of marriageable age, but
behave like pre-teenage ninnies. A squeaky naval cadet (his shrill, unbroken
voice, concocted from the merest hint in the text, is laboured by the
production to idiotic extremes) bumps into a sofa, has his voice break
(falling more than two octaves), and is soon spooning with one of the
ninnies. The trainee governess (Victoria Hasted) is adenoidal and speaks
with vowels few Victorian employers would permit into the schoolroom.
Routledge and others go in for the most jerky double-takes, jolting changes
of voice, and other strenuous devices. Dulcie Gray and Michael Denison, as
the parental Ranklings, turn every Pinero touch of delicate characterisation
into ponderous turgidity. At least Guy Henry seem to find himself funny, and
sometimes makes his own panic-stricken antics funny to us too. But it is
time that Chichester realised, or remembered, that Pinero's comedies require
playing as subtle as do Wilde's. Time, too, that it stopped treating its
audiences like tourists for whom plays must be reduced to the level of sit.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: Cash and Costello - Popular music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The big man in black with the voice of a Fisherman's Friend says: 'Hello,
I'm Johnny Cash', It is a joke, of course. The Godfather of country music
has been on stage for around half an hour already at the Shepherds Bush
Empire, and no one this side of senility is going to mistake him for for
Garth Brooks, Dwight Yoakam or any of the new generation of stetson
super-stars.
After 40 years in the game, a Cash concert is inevitably a series of myths
and rituals. The biggest one of all is that the hero is a touchstone of
survival, a man who popped a million pills, drained ten million bottles,
played around with women and the law, only to stumble on God at the last
chance saloon and win through.
We like the legend, even if we know that Cash's criminal act was no more
dastardly than plucking a few off-limits flowers, and that he has spent
almost 30 years safely married into Country Music's Royal Family, the
Carters. And it helps us to enjoy more a reflective musical commentary on
his fantasy life in songs about shootings, prison, moving on, and bumming
through.
The fact is that Cash's brooding bulk and hickory tinged voice make the
songs ring true. They might be the short, superficial, 1950s Family
Favourites but in his hands they become life. He starts with 'Folsom Prison
Blues' and you are there in a cell listening to the freight train whistle
past. 'Sunday morning coming down' is the saddest commentary on a no-hoper's
weekend drinking spree.
And just when the child-like superficiality of 'Ghostriders in the Sky' and
'Walk the Line' start to cloy Cash changes tack, going genuinely
confessional with a solo set of fresh material, of heart-baring songs
written by that other successful outsider, Leonard Cohen, and the supremely
oddball Loudon Wainright III.
With the new album plugged June Carter Cash, as buxom and leggy as any
Southern matron, casually let drop two knock out family facts. Not only is
Mrs Cash's mother a direct descendant of a British Prime Minister (OK, it
was the totally forgotten Lord Addington) but that she is currently
appearing on the new 20 cent US stamp.
June's strident Carter voice does not always gel with Johnny's resounding
bass on duets like 'It Ain't Me Babe' but they are a touching sight, and
make the concert as uplifting and redemptive as the revivalist gathering
underway across the road. The Seventh Day Adventists had one advantage: they
were not subjected to the most embarrassing song ever performed by a great
artist, 'A boy named Sue'. Only Cash could sing it and survive.
Another more newly minted pop icon with an album to plug was in town this
week: Elvis Costello. He held a mini residency at the Royal Albert Hall, a
suitably establishment venue for the man who raised the intellectual profile
of punk.
Little has changed in the decade since he last took on London: the
flirtation with country music, and the US, seems well over. He was even
reunited with his original band, the Attractions, a trio of barnstorming
thumpers. Costello's new songs may be crypto-punk in style but they run into
the difficulty faced by all established stars: an exhaustion of ideas.
Happily protected from emotional turmoil, Costello lacks the map to return
to the political and social abuses he attacked in his early songs. 'London's
Brilliant Parade' is hardly going to start the revolution.
The fluency of his playing, guitar still pointed resolutely earthwards,
voice as challengingly bitter as ever, is subverted by the incessant speed
and noise. The lyrics are swallowed, which is a pity on songs like
'Shipbuilding', Costello's slant on the Falklands War. A strangely
positioned sound system did not help the audience seated at the sides. But
if the overall effect was like cowering before a hurricane of unstructured
indignation, there was also the pleasure of an invigorating shock.
And Costello relents near the end. 'Alison' is an enjoyably lucid relief,
with its chilling, put down, lyrics, and 'Accidents will happen' still
tumbles over itself towards genius. But Costello, nudging 40, was too much
the frantic scatter gun, desperate to prove a point. The arena had been
cleared of seats for the Proms but the audience was slow to pogo: a
blistering indictment of his performance. This was somehow the great
occasion that failed to happen.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: A motley cast for 'Aida' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a motley crew for Verdi's Aida on Wednesday, motlier than I can
remember seeing at the Royal Opera - and that was just the audience, who ran
from American neglige (greying T-shirts, busted chinos) to bold chic
imported from deeply foreign countries. It was a nice touch for the RO to
have imported another motley new cast, unable to communicate with one
another nor even, apparently, with the conductor Edward Downes. I have to
report that by the end, most of the audience were vociferously delighted.
'New cast' is too simple, because the singers successively contracted for
this Aida - Elijah Moshinsky's new production - have been dropping like
flies. Somebody at the RO has had to spend desperate hours on international
phone-lines. Wednesday's Radames, the Icelander Kristjan Johannsson (new to
London), was flown in on the afternoon of the performance: it was no wonder
that he and his Aida seemed never to have been properly introduced.
Of the ex-Soviet singers - not including the Amonasro of Gregory Yurisich,
who is Australian - Nina Rautio's Aida sang in even less intelligible
Italian than Paata Burchuladze's High Priest. Burchuladze, however, lent
imposing power and presence to his faceless role; Miss Rautio, musically
quite effective, kept herself glumly to herself, and her acting to raising
one or both arms heavenward at high notes. It was amusing to watch Dolora
Zajick's Amneris (a daunting Midwestern hostess), Yurisich's wild Amonasro
and Johannsson's stiff, upstanding Radames trying in turn to get some
dramatic response from her, all in vain.
The Zajick mezzo has too sharp an edge for the crucial Act 2 scene with Aida
 -which I have not seen more crudely played: where was Moshinsky?  - but
came into its own with the Act 4 showdown. Johannsson's Italian-schooled
tenor has bright metal and force (he must be a stirring Manrico in
Trovatore), but not much grace. 'Celeste Aida' was brittle, and he kept
rushing his fences - again and again Downes made considerate room for him to
breathe in, but he refused to take it.
Otherwise, Downes himself sounded un-tender with the score, though of course
efficient: grand, noisy ensembles, but no magic in the quieter music. As
usual Moshinsky has built a clean, thrifty production, designed to last; I
thought that recycling Michael Yeargan's Nile act set, with its tall array
of Anubis-heads, for the Act 4 trial looked too much like parsimony. And why
Aida and her father should belong to a genetically deviant tribe of
Ethiopians (none of them was remotely black) remained a mystery: could this
be a perverse example of pc?
In repertory with a variety of singers until July 22

With the completion of the Rhine-Danube canal it is finally possible for
sizeable boats to cross the continent from the North Sea to the Black Sea,
and Peter Day has made the trip, as he recounts in Barging Across Europe
(6.30 Radio 4). Christopher Chataway continued smoking throughout his career
as a world-class athlete, a situation inconceivable in today's sporting
world where medicine, science, technology, diet and training techniques
become more and more significant. BBC1's new series, The Contenders, looks
at every aspect of sports preparation from psychology to tactics (7.00).
That is followed by another new series: International Young Driver Of The
Year, in which 27 young people from different parts of Europe compete for
the title. In addition to driving cars they compete in go-karts and, today,
in road sweepers, attempting to pick up golf balls as a test of vehicle
control (7.30 BBC1). In advance of the 100th season of promenade concerts,
beginning next Friday, Radio 3 broadcasts The Man Who Made The Proms
(10.30), a tribute to Sir Henry Wood.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: Why the Bolshoi pulled out of Britain - Inflating
classical ballet for commercial gain was the real cause of failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolshoi scandale] A Russian dancer will recount a 'big scandal' - a skirt
lost as Giselle makes her spectral appearance in Act 2 - with peals of merry
laughter. But there is no joking about the scandal of this summer's
cancelled Bolshoi Ballet tour.
Moscow's finest were due to perform at indoor arenas in Birmingham and
Manchester, and after a season in Dublin, were to make a series of open-air
appearances to tens of thronging thousands at Leeds Castle, Highclere, and
Castle Howard. The Manchester and Birmingham seasons were postponed, and
after a financially disappointing visit to Dublin and the cancellation of
two of the stately dates, the last - Leeds Castle - was this week abandoned.
Derek Block, impresario of the enterprise, is quoted as saying: 'I believe
I've been caught up in something which is much bigger than me: the worst
recession I've ever seen'. I think the failure of the tour is indicative of
something bigger than the events themselves, bigger than the losses incurred
(stated as Pounds 1.25m), and bigger than the public's reluctance to fork
out Pounds 55 for open-air performances by what has always been thought the
ultimate bankable dance troupe.
Block master-minded the five week season in the New Year, 1993, which
brought 150 Bolshoi dancers to the Albert Hall and exposed them (rather as
one might an unwanted tot on a Greek hill-side) on a thrust stage.
Programmes comprised 'Suites' - ie large and often illogical chunks of the
standard Moscow repertory - which impressed by the numbers of dancers
involved and by their roaring enthusiasm. An audience - not the usual
Russian Ballet aficionados - poured in, as they might to hear a rock-star or
a popular evangelist, paying considerable sums to see a well-marketed show.
Hence the 'suites' as a sampling of classical tit-bits. Hence our critical
sniping, which pointed out that ballet is an art that is conditioned by the
proscenium arch, and without that formal frame is sadly diminished in
effect.
The argument for such gigantism in the lyric theatre is commercial. Lots of
space, lots of bodies and a few big names can do marvels for an impresario's
and a company's bank-balance. In warmer European climes than ours there can
be trudging hordes of supers in an open-air Aida (a friend appeared in such
a staging in Italy, just behind the camels, whose defecations he neatly
caught upon the serving platter he was holding), or an acreage of white
tulle and swan-feathers, and given reliable weather and proximity, the
public may be expected to flock.
Such mass art demands modest pricing, ease of access, even a tradition of
comparable entertainments. The Bolshoi has, in South America, played to vast
crowds, and in the Palace of Congresses in Moscow it can appear before 6000
people. It is not in any way subtle as ballet, nor credible save on the bald
terms of slam-bam performance and reverberant box-office tills.
Like other Russian artistic enterprises, the Bolshoi has a present and
urgent need for hard currency. It is also faced with the problem of
relocation while its home theatre is re-furbished. Last year's Albert Hall
season meant, for the Bolshoi, work and funds, though in every other way it
implied a continuation of the hack-labour and artistic stagnation which has
dogged its every gloriously-trained step in recent years.
The blatancies of such seasons - never mind the quality, feel the size of
the cast - are deleterious to the lyric arts. (The Bolshoi, whose style is
physically larger than that of any other troupe, runs the danger of
elephantiasis.) The performances are also oddly dependant upon public
caprice, momentary switches of taste. Three tenors may bawl their lungs out
to millions, and Pavarotti hold a sodden horde captive with gems from his
repertory, but recent cancellations of other bloated opera recitals suggest
that the fad has passed. Ballet under the terms proposed by the Bolshoi and
Mr Block this summer - ten thousand spectators every night, in the open air
 -was ballet seen through the wrong end of a telescope. And the enterprise
demonstrated a greater faith in the English climate than most of us would
credit. (Last week, in my corner of Sussex, we had an evening
temperature-drop of 20 degrees and a rain-storm. Ideal for Penguin Lake.)
At the heart of this fiasco is the matter of how ballet may be shown to a
large audience. Maurice Bejart, for valid aesthetic reasons, made spectacles
for the expanses of the Boboli Gardens; the Grand'Place in Brussels; the
Grand Palais in Paris. These succeeded on boldest terms, because Bejart
conceived them thus. Inflating traditional ballet for a new public, be it in
the Albert Hall or the English country-side, implies distortion, evaporation
of effect. It is a thoroughly bad thing, because an audience is given art
diluted, deformed. And, if the prices for this tour are evidence, it is
expected to pay through the nose for it. The great ballet companies are now
prohibitively expensive to tour and present: value for consumers' money
demands that if they are to be seen, it must be at their very best.
Was it recession that caused the failure of this tour, or public reluctance
to face the tedium of travel, the unpredictabilities of climate and location
and even of programming? Ballet is an art of the theatre, and even the
strongest troupes are only truly themselves in the great houses where they
have always flourished. The impresario's trick, and the company's task, is
still to make ballet available on these rigorous terms.

Jan Hall, until recently the chairman and chief executive of design company
Coley Porter Bell, is about to join the quoted advertising and marketing
services group Gold Greenlees Trott in the newly-created post of Europe
supremo.
The move, announced yesterday at the same time as the group's disappointing
year-end figures, is part of attempts to strengthen a pan-European network,
set up last year through a link-up with the privately-owned agency GGK.
Hall's title will be chief executive, GGT Europe.
Coley Porter Bell, where Hall had been for 10 years, was bought by Martin
Sorrell's WPP group in 1989. Her last triumph, shortly before her departure,
was landing a wholesale review of British Gas's corporate identity. She was
also recently appointed a non-executive director of travel group Owners
Abroad.
GGT also announced yesterday that Michael Gold, co-founder with Mike
Greenlees, would be leaving at the end of July, having moved with his family
to France. The group is also hoping to restore its reputation in the City by
appointing Peter Quinnen, a former chairman of James Capel, as a
non-executive director. Quinnen has known the group since its flotation.

FT  08 JUL 94 / People: Leeds BS fills one of its gaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, has proved that it
can still make senior appointments, even though its chief executive's seat
remains empty. John King has been named as chairman-elect of the society, to
succeed Malcolm Barr who will retire in January. 'The fact that we have
decided on the chairman does help in the appointment of a chief executive
officer,' King says.
The arrival of a chief executive will clearly affect the extent to which
King (above right) has to be involved in the society. He sees the job as
taking up two to three days a week of his time, fitting in with his other
roles as chairman of Analysys, a telecommunications consultancy, and a
director of Olivetti UK.
King, 61, has been a director of Leeds since April 1991, and was a main
board director of BT until 1988.
The challenge for societies over the next year or so, he says, will be to
develop within a greatly changing environment after a period when the market
in traditional society activities has been quite dull.
Meanwhile, Bradford &amp; Bingley, the UK's seventh largest society, is aiming
to meet those changes by appointing John Wriglesworth (near left), 37,
societies analyst with UBS for the past seven years, to a new post as
general manager in charge of strategy and communications.
The first change for Wriglesworth, who will join the society in October,
will be to open a B&amp;B account. His lack of one at present is, he says, no
reflection on the society but simply a matter of the location of its London
branches. This problem will presumably be eased when he spends a proportion
of his time in Yorkshire.

FT  08 JUL 94 / People: Stud owner joins Bloodstock Agency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kirsten Rausing, a member of one of Europe's wealthiest families, has been
appointed a non-executive director of The British Bloodstock Agency, which
buys and sells racehorses on behalf of wealthy clients.
Rausing, who is the granddaughter of Ruben Rausing, founder of Sweden's
TetraPak packaging business, is the largest individual shareholder in the
BBA - which claims to be the world's largest and longest-established
bloodstock agency. She bought a near 10 per cent stake in February 1991.
The company, which employs 40 staff and bought and sold around 200 horses
last year, is starting to recover after several years of losses. Its wealthy
clientele has been hard hit by the collapse in bloodstock prices, the
recession and the problems of the Lloyd's insurance market.
Estimates of the wealth of the Rausing family range from Dollars 9bn (Forbes
magazine) to Pounds 5.2bn (Sunday Times). Several members of the family now
live in Britain. Rausing, who is vice-chairman of the Thoroughbred Breeders'
Association, owns the Lanwades and St Simon Studs near Newmarket and the
Staffordstown Stud in County Meath, Ireland, all of which are operated on a
commercial basis.
Meanwhile, the BBA is still looking for a new chief executive with a strong
financial background. Peter Bickmore, who has been running the group's
insurance business as well as being managing director of the group, is
stepping down in order to concentrate fully on running the group's insurance
business. John Harvey-Barnes, the finance director, is 65 next year and is
expected gradually to hand over some of his financial responsibilities to
the new chief executive.

The UK government should undertake a wide-ranging study of the relationship

Acost's report is the latest in a series by influential bodies calling for
government action to stimulate research and development by more favourable
tax treatment for R&amp;D. The Commons Committee on Science and Technology made
a similar recommendation earlier this year.

Irritating background noise can now be eliminated with the arrival of the
Noisebuster from Noise Cancellation Technologies, writes Richard Rosen.
The system consists of a set of light-weight headphones and a small noise
analyser/sound source production unit.
Microphones in the earcups of the headphones listen to external sounds.
These are fed to the noise analyser. An anti-noisewave is generated by the
controller as an electronic signal which is fed back to the speakers in the
headphones. When the anti-noise reaches the incoming offensive noise each
cancels the other out.
The system is claimed to reduce noise by 50 to 90 per cent within the 20Hz
to 120Hz frequency bandwidths. The Noisebuster is available for Dollars 149
(Pounds 98).

A computer and keyboard package, designed to help disabled employees use
standard computer systems, has been introduced by KCS and HM Systems, two UK
companies.
The keyboard consists of a touch-sensitive flat pad which can be overlaid by
a number of standard or customised keysets. The overlays can be programmed
so that one keystroke can perform a series of functions.
The keyboard is designed to make inputting information easier for people
suffering from motor disabilities and it is also suitable for people with
visual disabilities, because the keyset overlays can be designed using
different colours and key sizes.
The system, which is compatible with standard software, does not need
hardware or software modifications. The computer and keyboard package costs
Pounds 1,500.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New lease of life for
smartcards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The life span of banking smartcards is to be extended with the introduction
of a smartcard chip which uses re-programmable memory cells.
Smartcards are increasingly used as credit and debit cards in order to cut
down fraud. But currently banks are forced to re-issue the cards regularly
to frequent users, because they cease to function once their memory capacity
has been exhausted.
The new card, which has been been devised by Schlumberger and Texas
Instruments, is based on re-programmable EEPROM memory cells. These allows
the chip to store about 160 transactions in a sequential file. Once the card
reaches this capacity, it automatically creates more capacity by deleting
the oldest record.
Schlumberger, which will put the card into commercial production later this
year, believes the longer life of the card will substantially cut down
banks' issuing costs. It will also offer issuers the chance to get more
information about their customers' purchasing patterns, because the chip's
transaction memory will be accessible.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology: Changes in store at the grocery - Hugh Carnegy
looks at how two Swedish groups have streamlined their supply and
distribution services, in a series on electronic retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When ICA Retailers, Sweden's largest retail group, was considering upgrading
the technology backing supply and distribution in one of its three
geographic divisions four years ago, it found itself confronting some
glaring inefficiencies.
The three divisions operated with a large degree of autonomy, had their own
supply and distribution systems and often had differing marketing
strategies. Meanwhile, the environment within which ICA was operating was
changing fast.
A spate of deregulation during the 1980s had sharply increased competitive
pressures and was set to continue as Sweden applied to join the European
Union. A looming recession threatened to hone competition even more keenly.
The advent of commercial television networks meant that an organisation such
as ICA could, for the first time, run effective nationwide marketing
campaigns.
So ICA, a co-operative group with turnover last year of SKr60bn (Pounds 5bn)
and a 35 per cent share of Sweden's retail grocery market, decided in 1990
to scrap its three-pronged structure and combine its operations throughout
the country, underpinned by an integrated information technology system.
Three years and SKr500m later, ICA makes the bold claim to have one of the
world's most advanced systems for the grocery wholesale industry and
in-store back-office operations.
At much the same time, ICA's biggest competitor, the Swedish Co-operative
Union (KF), was also preparing for change. The sprawling conglomerate has
since 1992 embarked on a strategy of shedding its myriad industrial
interests to concentrate on the retail sector.
In the process, KF last year signed what was then described as Europe's
biggest IT services contract when it brought in Electronic Data Systems
(EDS), the General Motors subsidiary, to handle its IT needs. A key part of
the deal, to be worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 666m) over 10 years, is the
upgrading of KF's retail supply and distribution services.
While KF continues to wrestle with its vast restructuring project, ICA has
already largely transformed itself. With the help of Andersen Consulting, it
set up two divisions, ICA Partihandel to operate the wholesale side and ICA
Detaljhandel to operate the retail services end. The two are tightly bound
together by a communications network which integrates and links ICA's 2,700
individual stores with the group's distribution, sales and marketing
operations.
This consists of a so-called backbone network based on the national
telecommunications network provided by Telia, the Swedish state telecom
company, and an X25 communications network.
The backbone system ties together the computer and telephone systems of
ICA's nationwide organisation, while the X25 network, with 138 nodes, or
intersections, allows all the individual stores to connect to the backbone.
From the storeowner standing in the aisle of his supermarket punching in his
day-to-day product needs into a hand-held device, orders can be channelled
back automatically through the ICA systems, combined and rationalised with
other orders flowing in from elsewhere, then directed to the appropriate
distribution point and, ultimately, to the supplier. In the other direction,
goods are tracked out to the stores, on to the shelves and through the
check-out. Sales information and centralised marketing campaigns are also
fed out through the system.
'The idea is to get supplies to the retailer as quickly and as cheaply as
possible,' says Ake Westerlund, ICA's data project leader. The target of
cutting ICA's logistics costs by 50 per cent by 1995 appears to be well in
sight. The efficiencies the system allows in correlating and managing orders
has led to a radical shake-up of ICA's distribution network. Half of the
group's 22 regional distribution centres have been shut and the number of
central warehouses has shrunk to two from three.
By enhancing its knowledge of its own demands, ICA has been able to move
away from a system of individual suppliers transporting their goods to
several ICA distribution centres to a so-called cross-docking operation.
This involves suppliers delivering to one ICA centre where goods are
reloaded on to ICA transports. ICA now has two cross-docking centres, in the
southern cities of Gothenburg and Helsingborg, and it is planning a third in
the Stockholm area. Although this appears to add an extra link in the
distribution chain, the cut it allows in the number of local distribution
centres and the lower prices it enables ICA to force out of suppliers more
than pays for the cross-docking facilities. Transport costs are squeezed as
delivery trucks are used at maximum capacity and inventories are kept much
lower than previously.
'In the past, suppliers delivered weekly to each distribution centre.
Therefore, the distribution centres had to keep about one week's worth of
supplies. Now, deliveries are made daily and inventories have been reduced
by 50 per cent. We are getting larger volumes through fewer centres,' says
Richard Hill of Andersen Consulting.
KF, with an 18 per cent share of Sweden's total retail market, is following
a similar path from a different starting point. It always served as the
supply and distribution organisation for the many co-operative retail chains
within its empire, but is now seeking to modernise and further integrate its
systems. Five store chains - the Konsum supermarkets, Obs] hypermarkets, B&amp;W
hypermarkets, Fakta discount chain and Obs] Interior stores - are served by
one supply and distribution organisation.
KF has also used Andersen Consulting to advise it on how best to organise
such a complex operation. It, too, has reduced its distribution centres,
from 13 to 11, and has opened a cross-docking centre in the southern city of
Malmo.
Urban Strand, KF's IT manager, says the organisation was quick to introduce
point-of-sale links to back-office operations, for example through the use
of check-out scanners. But he says a new generation is now required to
integrate further the point-of-sales systems back through the chain to the
suppliers. This is what EDS is working on.
'What EDS has done is take over the monitoring and enhancement of the
system. We have all the information - we need the applications to put it
together to make distribution more efficient,' says Strand. Ultimately, at
the store level, it seems, systems could be developed to the point where
orders were automatically triggered from point-of-sale monitoring of the
flow of goods out of the stores. The store manager might have little more to
do than monitor the system.
Hill says ICA already has a system which is 'completely on-line', from the
central network out to its 'Budica' in-store network. The latter allows not
just the control of the flow of goods in and out of the shop, but also
carries information on marketing campaigns, produces weekly analyses of a
store's operations and sales trends, pricing models, E-mail links to the
rest of the ICA network and staff training programmes.
The complete ICA network is 'functionally richer than any other we have ever
been involved with throughout the world', says Hill.
But customers at least may be comforted to know that neither ICA nor KF
envisage the elimination of the human factor. Both say store managers will
always want and need to talk to their supply points about the availability
of certain products and make subjective decisions on ordering - particularly
for fresh goods. And, says KF's Strand, there is no technological substitute
for the manager on the supermarket floor gauging the tastes of customers.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Management: . . . and politicians too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers in Britain's public services say they are under pressure from their
political masters.
Almost half those contacted for a research study to be published next week
believe their ability to resist political interference in operational
decisions has declined over the last three years. Only 10 per cent felt that
ability had increased.
This is despite the apparent relaxation of authority and transfer of power
from central government which has accompanied the radical restructuring of
Britain's public sector in recent years.
The survey, carried out by the Institute of Management and the Centre for
Public Services Management at London's South Bank University, is expected to
show that a majority of those public-sector managers polled are nevertheless
willing to accept and implement change. Many principles, such as a new
responsiveness to customer needs, are being established and the pressure for
efficiency is producing benefits. But it is also causing problems for those
managing the new policies.
The survey will propose that public-sector managers receive more management
development support and specifically more training for dealing with
politicians and project management and working in teams. It will show that
while there has been increased use of quality management techniques, staff
appraisal and team working managers in the public sector have not on the
whole been empowered to change the more direct means of control - the hiring
and firing of staff.
The report will also suggest there is a need for new, revised and
strengthened codes of ethics for public-sector managers. The public sector
needs clear guidelines on corporate governance to define clearly the rights
and responsibilities of all parties involved in managing institutions in the
public interest.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Management: Trouble with the children . . . - The CSA has
faced severe administrative problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive of the UK's Child Support Agency,
apologised this week for the anguish her organisation has caused to divided
families over the last year.
But despite promising wide-ranging changes to the CSA's operations -
including more staff and greater government funding - many MPs wonder
whether the most unpopular executive agency in Whitehall faces management
problems that will only be solved by a root-and-branch reform later this
year.
Presenting the agency's first annual report this week, Hepplewhite admitted
that the CSA - which was set up to force absent fathers to pay maintenance
to their former families - had recently caused more anguish than any other
government department.
The agency - which operates under the Department of Social Security - has
been accused of making inaccurate assessments of how much absent fathers
should pay; of being unnecessarily heavy-handed in its dealings with
applicants; and of being unable to answer telephone calls and letters from
parents and MPs.
Hepplewhite also admitted the agency had not provided basic financial
information to parliament about its overall operations. In the report, the
CSA did not give a final figure for how much has been paid in maintenance
over the last year. Nor did it give a firm figure for the benefit savings
that higher maintenance payments had created for the Treasury.
The CSA's problems were exacerbated by the speed with which the organisation
was set up in the wake of the Child Support Act. Hepplewhite admitted that
the organisation had started operating in April 1993, without all the
management information that was desirable at the time. 'We had a short
lead-in time to get the organisation running,' she said.
She has pledged to introduce changes. Seven-hundred staff are to be taken on
to help process applications. Andersen Consulting, the management
consultants, will advise on changes. And a new computer will help to collate
the financial and accounting information that parliament needs.
But will these changes put the organisation on a more stable footing? One of
the biggest problems for the CSA is that piecemeal changes tend to slow down
the organisation in the short term.
Earlier this year, the government introduced a number of specific policy
changes to the CSA's operations, including a change in the formula by which
maintenance payments are made.
However, as the CSA said in its report: 'Implementing these changes obliged
us to reconsider the assessments we had made in our first 10 months, and
staff had to be diverted away from processing new applications.'
Any alteration to the rules can also discourage absent fathers from making
their required maintenance payments because they believe the law is subject
to regular change.
Moreover, some MPs argue that there is a conflict in the CSA's twin goals of
enforcing maintenance payments on absent fathers and creating benefit
savings for the Treasury.
According to Hepplewhite, the CSA operated at a slower pace in its first
three months to ensure its systems were operating effectively. But, it was
discovered that the organisation was failing to meet targets for benefit
savings that had been set by the government.
More effort was put into processing the volume of applications. But, as a
result, there was less emphasis on ensuring that each CSA worker processed a
single application for maintenance from beginning to end, thereby reducing
the quality of customer service.
This conflict of goals may be at the heart of the organisation's problems.
As one MP put it: 'Mrs Hepplewhite may hope that her changes will improve
the CSA. But what is really needed is a change in the tasks it has been set
by the government.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Management: Start slow, end fast - Jean Louis Barsoux offers
advice on working in multicultural teams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN LOUIS BARSOUX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When 3M recently restructured its European operations employing 21,000
people, it limited relocation to fewer than 40 managers. Yet about 1,000 of
its managers have been given permanent and/or project responsibilities
across national borders.
Increasingly, companies are asking employees to participate in multiple work
groups - project teams, task forces, steering committees, commissions and
boards - which transcend national boundaries.
The idea, confirmed by research, is that cultural diversity promotes
creativity, overcomes group-think and leads to better decision making.
'Establishing a situation that is unfamiliar and slightly uncomfortable
forces people to look at things differently', says Irene Rodgers of the
Paris-based consultancy ICM.
The gains from diversity, however, are not automatic. In order to fulfill
their creative potential, multicultural teams have to overcome barriers that
uniform teams resolve quickly, often instinctively. They have to confront
differences in attitudes, values, behaviour, experience, background, and
expectations, as well as language. The team's biggest problem though is the
lack of trust. Multicultural team members often find it difficult to
overcome long-held prejudices and stereotypes about people who speak and
behave strangely and have different ideas from themselves.
From the very inception of the team, members will have different views about
how to build up the level of trust - and about how much time should be
devoted to relationship building prior to 'getting down to business'.
North American managers, for instance, tend to have an instrumental view of
relationships. Teams can be put together mechanistically and expected to
function effectively, or fixed if they fail to do so. The directness of the
team-building approach reflects the directness of American culture.
Members from more relationship-oriented cultures such as southern Europe,
the Middle East or Latin America may feel rushed or distrustful of
colleagues if the getting-to-know-each-other phase is curtailed.
What is more, artificial efforts to speed up that team-building process may
backfire. Consider the example of a French medical equipment maker, taken
over by General Electric in 1988. GE decided to boost the morale of its new
French employees by organising a training seminar for French and other
European managers.
In their hotel rooms, the company left colourful T-shirts emblazoned with
the GE slogan 'Go for One'. A note urged the managers to wear the T-shirts
'to show that you are members of the team'. The French managers wore them,
grudgingly, to the seminar, but as one of them recalled: 'It was like Hitler
was back, forcing us to wear uniforms. It was humiliating.'
The build-up of trust may prove especially problematic if it is a project
team which only meets periodically. Not only will opportunities to develop
trust be restricted, the need for trust will be higher since individuals
rely on one another to advance work outside the formal meetings.
Trust is universally important but it is built up and sustained in different
ways. For instance, in Germany, trust is heavily biased towards a person's
dependability. Delivering on promises, honesty and punctuality all increase
trust. If a task is not going to be completed by a promised date, the
deadline must be renegotiated in advance to let people make arrangements. In
other cultures, where time is more elastic, and words and statements taken
less literally, not meeting a deadline is not critical and will not
necessarily lead to a loss of trust.
A further problem is that cultural misunderstandings often happen in
situations where trust may already be low. Disagreement and suspicion may
therefore be magnified out of proportion. The misunderstanding serves as
additional proof of lack of trustworthiness. There is no benefit of the
doubt.
As Rodgers saw it: 'People get hung up on a word and it flies up into a huge
event, and becomes a focus for all sorts of displaced anger and frustration
 -a bit like domestic quarrels caused by leaving the lid off the
toothpaste.'
In America and Europe, trust is usually enhanced by looking people in the
eye. This is considered a sign of respect and sincerity. But in East Asia,
for instance, eye contact indicates anger or aggression.
That makes it easy to misinterpret cultural problems for personality
differences. A manager may consider a colleague to be awkward or sabotaging
group efforts when that person is merely responding to cultural upbringing
and beliefs.
Digging into cultural differences is a high-risk activity for the team since
all sorts of value-laden differences and prejudices can come to the surface.
Multicultural teams, therefore, have to find ways of describing and
surfacing differences in a depersonalised way. For instance, one
multicultural team of MBA students was exposed to the idea that cultures may
have a polychronic (flexible) versus a monochronic (rigid) view of time.
An Italian student who turned up late to a session was teased about being
polychronic. This served to mark his 'violation' of team norms without
attacking him personally. His colleagues gave him the 'benefit of the doubt'
by ascribing his lateness to cultural programming rather than to the
individual's own behaviour.
Humour can also provide a means of putting the cultural differences 'on the
table'. The level of shared humour within a group, therefore, serves as a
kind of barometer of team integration. 'If a team has reached a high level
of emotional security and members can laugh, joke, question and play devil's
advocate with each other while completing the task, then it has done well,'
observes Sue Canney Davison of the London Business School.
Every culture has its own particular insights and blind spots. So it is a
question of using these differences, not just living with them. In
neglecting to work through these differences at the beginning, multicultural
teams are storing up problems for later.
All this may sound rather time-consuming but, as Canney Davison comments:
'You have to start slowly and end faster; by starting too fast, you run the
risk of not ending at all.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Regulator regrets impact of job on husband's firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An architectural firm run by the husband of Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas
industry regulator, has decided to decline a Pounds 1m contract with British
Gas because of a potential conflict of interest.
Ms Spottiswoode yesterday expressed frustration that her public role could
have such a severe financial impact on people outside her family. She said
ORMS - the firm run by Mr Oliver Richards, her husband - might now have to
make some employees redundant. 'We did absolutely nothing improper or
illegal,' Mr Richards said yesterday. 'It's a problem of public perception
and what the press would do with it.'
ORMS was invited last May by British Gas to bid for the modernisation of an
office complex near Newcastle upon Tyne. It was the third time the firm had
dealt with British Gas's property division, which said it was unaware until
last Thursday that Mr Richards was Ms Spottiswoode's husband.
The first British Gas contract with ORMS was awarded early last year -
before Ms Spottiswoode was appointed director-general of Ofgas. It was a
small contract for a feasibility study in Swindon. The second, another small
contract for work in Poole, was awarded last November, days after Ms
Spottiswoode joined Ofgas.
She said she had immediately informed the Department of Trade and Industry,
which did not object to ORMS dealing with British Gas as long as her husband
was not directly involved and the amounts were not significant.
Last May, however, British Gas asked the company to bid for what turned out
to be a much larger contract. Ms Spottiswoode said the DTI again advised
that there was no legal objection. But it suggested she exercise her own
judgment, even though she had no direct influence on ORMS.
Mr Richards said he and his two other partners looked at ways to ensure that
he did not benefit from the contract, including the possibility of giving
his share of the profits to charity. But accountants advised them that there
was no practical way of doing so, and they decided to withdraw.
Mr Philip Kirby, the British Gas executive who dealt with ORMS, said the
firm was 'a good architectural practice which won the work fairly'. But he
said he wished it had told him of Mr Richards' connection to Ofgas.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Ex-minister 'gave confused evidence': Credibility of former
Matrix chief queried after allegations at Scott inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The businessman at the centre of the Matrix Churchill case yesterday told
the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that Lord Trefgarne, the former trade and
defence minister, had given 'inaccurate' and 'confused' evidence relating to
the export of machine tools to Iraq.
But the credibility as a witness of Mr Paul Henderson, the former managing
director of Matrix Churchill, was itself challenged by Ms Presiley Baxendale
QC, Lord Justice Scott's counsel.
Mr Henderson was giving evidence in response to statements to the inquiry by
Lord Trefgarne in March. The former minister said then that Mr Henderson had
deceived him about the purpose of machine tools exported to Iraq by Matrix
Churchill in the 1980s.
Yesterday Mr Henderson insisted that he had never personally assured the
minister that the machine tools in a number of pending contracts with Iraq
were for civilian use. Mr Henderson said discussions at a meeting in
September 1989 had been conducted only at a general level.
Mr Henderson was repeatedly questioned about other accounts of the meeting
which appeared to support Lord Trefgarne's evidence.
In a series of sharp exchanges, Ms Baxendale told Mr Henderson she could not
understand how he could describe as 'wrong' and 'confused' an account of a
meeting about which several witnesses concurred.
Mr Henderson later agreed that an account of the meeting in his recently
published autobiography The Unlikely Spy was inaccurate. In it, he writes
that he told Lord Trefgarne that the machine tools had commercial as well as
military uses. Mr Henderson also stated in the book that he knew that the
intelligence services had informed all relevant ministers about the military
use of the tools.
After giving evidence yesterday, Mr Henderson said he was glad to have been
given the opportunity to answer Lord Trefgarne's allegations.
But within Whitehall, yesterday's hearing was seen as potentially mitigating
the case against ministers and officials. Some feel that the full Matrix
Churchill story was not sufficiently aired because the trial of Mr Henderson
and other company directors collapsed before they had been cross-examined by
the prosecution.
After yesterday's two-hour public hearing, Lord Justice Scott heard evidence
in private from Mr Henderson about his contacts with the intelligence
services.
The intelligence service MI6 is thought to have given evidence alleging that
it was not fully briefed by Mr Henderson about the extent to which his
company was engaged in the export of military sensitive machine tools to
Iraq.
The judge has also received written evidence from Mr Mark Gutteridge,
another former Matrix Churchill employee, which contradicts some of Mr
Henderson's evidence.
Yesterday's hearing is expected to be the last before Lord Justice Scott
prepares his report for publication at the end of the year.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Litigation activity forecast to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers are forecasting changes in litigation business over the next five
years. They expect litigation in the property, construction, banking and
fraud sectors to grow most quickly, while cases in insolvency and personal
injury are expected to increase less quickly, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The forecasts come from a national survey of litigation specialists by KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. KPMG has built a forensic accountancy
section of 70 expert witnesses and investigators on the back of what it says
is a litigation boom.
Nearly 80 per cent of 105 lawyers in the survey predicted overall growth in
litigation of 25 per cent by 1999. This compares with the 80 per cent growth
that KPMG says the market experienced in the last five years.
The survey says one reason the market is growing is the greater awareness of
litigation opportunities, partly because of marketing by lawyers. It adds
that the increasing complexity of commerce is also a factor.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Whitehall agency praised on rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property Holdings, the Whitehall agency responsible for providing
civil-service accommodation, was yesterday praised for saving Pounds 500m in
rents between 1988 and 1992.
The report by the National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, comes
just two months after the government announced plans to reduce the agency's
powers.
Instead of managing the government's general purpose office accommodation,
Property Holdings will advise the departments, agencies and quangos which
occupy a total of 7.5m sq m of office space.
The watchdog's study was more critical of government departments which had
reduced Property Holdings' bargaining powers with private-sector landlords
by ill-defined or changing departmental requirements; by setting timetables
which were too tight, or by making competitive negotiations difficult by
signalling their intentions to prospective landlords.
Property Holdings, on behalf of the Department of the Environment, manages
7.5m sq m of office space. In future the 3,267 offices in the estate are to
be handed over to the bodies that occupy them. Property Holdings will
continue to provide advice and support to departments.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Molyneaux pessimistic on Dublin links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday urged the
government to think again about proposals for cross-border co-operation in
Ireland in the light of Dublin's handling of a dispute over horseracing.
Mr Molyneaux used a parliamentary early-day motion to highlight the Irish
government's failure to act 'in a fair and honourable manner' over
nominations to the Irish Racing Authority.
He called on the UK government to 'reconsider proposals for co-operation
between the two administrations in Ireland' in the light of the way Dublin
had acted.
The move pointed up how carefully London and Dublin are having to tread in
their efforts to secure a durable political settlement in the province.
It emerged earlier this week that the UK government has virtually given up
hope of agreeing with Dublin the framework for a comprehensive settlement in
time for the next Anglo-Irish summit later this month.
Downing Street said yesterday that a number of important and complex issues
had still to be settled.
The main differences involve the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to
Ulster and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance
cross-border co-operation.
London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's
territorial claim is not resolved.
Yesterday's motion said Dublin had 'contemptuously ignored' the Northern
Ireland racing industry's nomination of a representative to the
'incongruously named' Irish Racing Authority. This replaced the Turf Club of
Ireland, which had 'hitherto administered racing on all courses in Ireland
including Downpatrick and Down Royal, in Northern Ireland, to the
satisfaction of those concerned'.
The motion called on the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland to
'intervene and ensure fair play'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Records set at sale of furniture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of a suite of furniture designed by Chippendale in the 1770s for
Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire sold for Pounds 759,500 at Christie's
yesterday.
New auction records were set for a pair of giltwood torcheres, or
candlestands - which made Pounds 177,500 - and for two pairs of chairs,
which sold for Pounds 166,500 and Pounds 161,000 respectively. A pair of
sofas realised Pounds 254,000. Prices were roughly double their estimates.
In the same auction of English furniture, a set of12 mahogany dining chairs,
after a design by Thomas Sheraton, sold for a record Pounds 463,500. In 1984
Christie's sold them for Pounds 75,600. The auction totalled more than
Pounds 3.2m, and was almost 90 per cent sold by value, confirming furniture
as one of the strongest sectors of the antique market.
A collection of ancient and Islamic glass, assembled over the past three
decades by Mr Hans Benzian, a Swedish businessman, sold for Pounds 1.37m at
Sotheby's - above the high estimate. An amber-coloured kohl tube, for eye
make-up, made in Iran in about 400 BC, made the top price of Pounds 102,700.
The highlight of a disappointing auction of European sculpture and works of
art at Sotheby's was a bronze drinking vessel, shaped like a lion, which
made Pounds 199,500.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Reservists set to serve abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is to clear the way for reservists to serve
alongside regular forces overseas as part of its restructuring of the armed
forces.
It emerged at Westminster yesterday that ministers are planning to make more
flexible use of reserve troops in frontline operations.
The news was warmly greeted by backbench Tory MPs. However, optimism over
the move was tempered by fears that next week's cuts will include the
closure of the naval dockyard at Rosyth in Scotland.
The cabinet will take a final decision on the package next Thursday.
However, some Tory backbenchers were surprised that this ratification would
be made just hours before the package is due to be revealed to the Commons.
There was uncertainty over whether the MoD had persuaded the Treasury that
it should keep the savings above the Pounds 750m which it is required to
make in its 1994-95 budget.
But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is understood to be confident
that he will be able to announce spending cuts well in excess of those
required by the Treasury without further reducing the armed forces' fighting
strength.
It was also understood that the Treasury could still be trying to persuade
the MoD that it must provide redundancy payments for the 25,000 servicemen
and women who are due to lose their jobs in the review.
Defence officials are anxious to get a Treasury assurance that it will not
seek more cuts in the forthcoming Public Expenditure Survey.
The move to allow part-time volunteers will require legislation. It aims to
bolster front-line capability at a time when Tory backbenchers are concerned
about the impact of a fall in defence expenditure.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Banham offers one rule for Essex and another for Dorset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southend and Basildon are to become free-standing local authorities, but the
rest of Essex will retain a two-tier system under proposals from the Local
Government Commission for England inadvertently sent to homes in the area
yesterday.
The leak, a week early, confirmed the commission's intention to leave the
two-tier status quo intact in most of England outside the main cities, in
spite of government requests that it recommend unitary authorities in all
but 'exceptional' circumstances.
Under the plans Thurrock would merge with Basildon New Town to form a
unitary authority while Southend would be given independence on its existing
boundaries. The county and 11 district councils would continue to provide
local government services in the rest of the county.
As an alternative, the commission suggests that the county council be
abolished and split into six unitaries. But this would involve merging
Colchester and Tendring districts, which have announced that they cannot
work together.
Under this option, the other unitary councils would be Braintree and
Uttlesford; Harlow, Epping Forest, Brentwood and Billericay; Thurrock and
Basildon New Town; Chelmsford and Maldon; and Southend-on-Sea, Castle Point
and Rochford.
Essex County Council welcomed the commission's preferred option, while the
Association of District Councils was unwilling to comment.
The Essex leak overshadowed the commission's formal announcement of plans
for Dorset, which would see Poole split from Bournemouth/Christchurch, with
both becoming unitary all-purpose authorities.
The rest of Dorset - including the present district councils of North
Dorset, East Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset and Weymouth and Portland - would
be merged into a unitary authority. The county council would cease to exist.
This contrasts with the plans for Essex, and for neighbouring Hampshire,
where the commission recommended retaining the two-tier system outside the
bigger towns.
The plan to split Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch angered the business
community, which had argued strongly for one new authority to cover the
conurbation.
The managing director of one of Bournemouth's largest employers said:
'Christchurch, Bournemouth and Poole look like one conurbation from the air
and they feel like one when you drive through them. Services I need come
from those three areas and they need co-ordination.'
Start-up costs of the plan would be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 22m,
according to the commission, generating annual savings of between Pounds 4m
and Pounds 7m. The commission is offering an alternative which would create
four unitary authorities for Dorset by splitting rural Dorset into two
councils.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Pergau dam row forces spending protocol change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has made an important concession in the wake of the Pergau
dam scandal by ruling that an independent accountancy watchdog must be
informed of any disagreement between a cabinet minister and permanent
secretary over expenditure plans.
The ruling, which was revealed in an official document prepared by Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, follows a disagreement
between officials at the Foreign Office in 1991 over whether Britain should
contribute to the Pergau project.
Mr Dorrell's decision will mean that any minister officially overruling a
top civil servant on expenditure matters will have to inform Sir John Bourn,
the comptroller and auditor-general.
This will in effect mean that such a disagreement could quickly be debated
by MPs on the Commons' public accounts committee, which first asked the
government to examine procedures in such cases.
The change to procedure, which came to light in recently published Treasury
minutes, follows a disagreement at the Foreign Office in February 1991 over
whether money from Britain's aid budget should be sent Malaysia.
Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration, told Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that he would
not authorise spending on Pergau.
Mr Hurd issued a ministerial direction, overruling Sir Timothy's advice and
in effect forcing him to sign the cheques for the deal.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Hopes for end to Malaysian ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was growing optimism last night that the Malaysian ban on government
contracts with British companies would soon end.
Mr Mohamad Mahathir, the Malaysian prime minister, said in Paris yesterday
that the ban would continue for the foreseeable future, but only
selectively.
'Trade goes on as usual, but we will not give any more government contracts
to British firms,' he said at the start of a three-day visit to France.
The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed the growing optimism,
although it made no comment about Dr Matathir's statement. Mr Richard
Needham, trade minister, told the British Overseas Trade Board earlier this
week that British business in Malaysia was 'returning to normal'.
However, a growing number of Malaysian officials and businessmen are talking
to British companies behind the scenes on the expectation that the ban will
be lifted soon. This is in spite of a strong minority of nationalist opinion
in Kuala Lumpur against resuming any links with the UK.
'There is no longer the same degree of nervousness as there was before,'
said one UK banker.
In spite of the ban on government contracts, two British companies have
announced Malaysian deals this week. Wilton Group yesterday unveiled a joint
venture to build and operate a chain of multi-screen cinemas in Malaysia. On
Wednesday, Trinity Holdings announced a deal to supply and build buses.
The Malaysian cabinet is known to have agreed two weeks ago that the ban on
government contracts with British companies could be lifted, but that the
precise timing would be left to the prime minister.
Given the unpredictability of Malaysian government decisions in the past,
some trade sources urged caution. British officials appear to be marking
time, drawing back from making any provocative statements that might
endanger the prospect of a rapprochement.
The continuing vulnerability of some British companies because of the
partial ban was underlined last month when a planned joint venture between
Rolls-Royce and Malaysia's EPE Power Corporation was suspended.
The ban on Malaysia government contracts with British companies was
announced in February because of Mr Mahathir's anger over UK press reports
alleging corruption in the granting of some contracts.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Revived Major targets spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night sought to capitalise on the recent upturn in his
fortunes within the Tory party with the promise of a renewed squeeze on
public spending to pave the way for income tax cuts.
In a confident end-of-term address to Tory MPs, the prime minister pledged
to put 'clear water' between the Conservatives and Labour before the general
election due by mid 1997.
Confirming the rightwards tilt in his political strategy, Mr Major said the
government would begin preparations for its election manifesto as early as
this autumn. Policy committees would be established to reconnect the party's
priorities with the preoccupations of its grass-roots supporters.
His comments, ahead of a planned cabinet reshuffle within the next two
weeks, attracted strong applause from a packed audience of backbench MPs.
In spite of a sideswipe against the extreme Thatcherites who have suggested
that the party needs a period of opposition to restore its ideological
fervour, the general view on the Tory right was that Mr Major had heeded
warnings not to fight Labour for the political centre ground.
Erstwhile enemies on the Euro-sceptic right said the prime minister had
further diminished the prospect of an autumn leadership challenge.
Anticipating the election of Mr Tony Blair as Labour leader, Mr Major said
his aim would be to give clearer definition and distinction to the Tory
message. That meant a 'compact' legislative programme for the next session
of parliament in the autumn focusing on a number of key priorities.
Mr Major described Mr Blair as 'one of those politicians who likes climbing
up the ladder of opportunity but kicking it down for others'.
He gave no timetable for the implementation of tax cuts but MPs at the
meeting said he left the deliberate impression that some reduction would be
possible before the next election. The prime minister indicated that those
lower down the income scale would be the first beneficiaries of a reduction
in the tax burden.
Foreshadowing another cabinet battle over priorities in this autumn's
spending negotiations, Mr Major said that the Pounds 15bn which the
government had cut last November from spending plans over the next three
years was not enough. The cash targets set in the November Budget would be
further reduced.
Mr Major also said he would continue to press the case for a flexible rather
than centralised European Union.
He dismissed as 'futile' arguments over whether Britain should be in
Europe's fast or slow lanes insisting that 'people cannot be taken too far
or too fast in a direction they are instinctively loathe to go'. Instead
Britain would insist Europe took the 'right track'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Ports sold off short, say MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was criticised by an all-party committee of MPs yesterday for
allowing the resale of a leading UK port to deprive a large part of its
workforce of the full value of their shareholding.
The port of Medway was acquired by its management and workforce in 1992 for
Pounds 29.7m and sold 18 months later to Mersey Docks for Pounds 103m.
The trust ports of Tees and Hartlepool, Clyde, Forth, Medway and the Port of
London were sold for Pounds 380m of which Pounds 169m went in the form of a
levy to the government.
In the period up to the second sale the Medway workforce was reduced from
688 to 260 in spite of an earlier promise from its management that it would
maintain the terms and conditions of the employees at the existing level.
More than 250 of the employees who lost their jobs were required to sell
back shares worth Pounds 35 for only Pounds 2.50. 'We are surprised that the
resale value of the shares was not covered in the sale agreement,' the
committee said.
It urged the government consider ways of inserting binding undertakings into
agreements reached for any future sales to ensure that bidders stood by
promises made to workers.
It also called for the government to consider introducing a clawback on
increases in the value of shares where the increase resulted from the
buyer's failure to meet undertakings given at the sale time.
The reduction in the size of the Medway workforce and the forced sale of
employees' shares made a significant difference to profitability.
The committee was also critical of the government for failing to obtain the
best price for the five ports. It said that it was 'particularly concerned'
at the price difference between the first and second sales of Medway. The
port fetched little more than three quarters of the lower benchmark
valuation when it was first sold to its workers but more than three times as
much 18 months later. This second sale led to the management and their
backers making a far greater profit than the Pounds 13m received by the
taxpayer on the initial privatisation.
The committee said it was concerned that in two of the five sales the price
reached was below the lower benchmark valuation which had been made. The
upper benchmark was achieved in only one of the sales.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Foreign Office taps reserves for peacekeeping bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Foreign Office is set to contribute Pounds 200m more than it budgeted
for to United Nations peacekeeping operations this year, forcing it to draw
on the government's Pounds 3.5bn contingency reserve.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office minister, said in a Commons written
answer that the Foreign Office diplomatic-wing cash limit on 'other external
relations' for 1994-95 would be almost doubled from Pounds 211.4m to Pounds
415.5m.
This was mainly to take account of contributions to UN peacekeeping
operations.
More than half the increase is attributable to the UN protection force in
the former Yugoslavia. But contributions to UN operations as far afield as
Haiti, Rwanda and Nagorno-Karabakh are also taken into account.
The increase will spark concern among Tory right-wingers anxious to see
public spending reduced in order to make room for early tax cuts.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said
yesterday that he did not see why British taxpayers should foot the bill.
'We are involved in peacekeeping on behalf of the UN because our armed
forces are arguably the most efficient in the world,' he said. 'Other
wealthy countries with no troops in the region - for example Germany and
Japan - should pay.'
Mr Townend has long argued that the government should make deep cuts in
Britain's foreign aid budget as part of a drive to rein in spend-ing.
Foreign Office spending on peacekeeping has risen rapidly in recent years,
multiplying seven-fold from Pounds 32m to Pounds 225m between 1990-91 and
1993-94.
The Foreign Office used this year's departmental report to comment on the
'significant increase' in international peacekeeping activities which has
been undertaken by the UN and other international bodies. It noted that such
operations 'cannot be planned for in advance'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Justice bill survives Lords challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government secured a majority of 52 in the House of Lords last night to
defeat another challenge to the introduction of new court procedures
affecting the right to silence.
Ministerial fears of a further defeat on the criminal justice and public
order bill receded with the introduction of a new safeguard for defendants
who refuse to answer when questioned by the police or in court.
Peers approved without a division a government amendment stipulating that a
defendant must be cautioned that the jury would be asked to draw inferences
from his decision to exercise his right to silence.
But the amendment failed to meet objections raised by Lord Ackner, a former
appeal Lord, who recalled that two royal commissions had rejected outright
similar proposals to those made in the bill.
He said the change introduced by the government failed 'quite hopelessly' to
safeguard the innocence of an accused person.
Lord Ackner moved an amendment providing for an accused person to have his
lawyer present before being interrogated, and for the tape recording of any
statements made. The amendment was supported by Viscount Runciman.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, described Lord Ackner's amendment as
'too restrictive'. It was defeated by 143 votes to 91.

The government failed to obtain the best price for five ports sold to the
private sector in 1992, a cross-party committee of MPs found yesterday.
The sale agreements also failed to take sufficient account of the interests
of employees who were encouraged to buy shares in their companies, according
to a report by the Commons public accounts committee.
The trust ports of Tees and Hartlepool, Clyde, Forth, Medway and the Port of
London were sold for Pounds 380m of which Pounds 169m went in the form of a
levy to the government.
The committee said it was concerned that in two of the five sales the price
reached was below the lower benchmark valuation which had been made. The
upper benchmark was achieved in only one of the sales.
It was 'particularly concerned' that Medway was sold for Pounds 29.7m,
little more than three quarters of the lower benchmark, and then resold 18
months later for Pounds 103m to Mersey Docks. This second sale led to the
management and their backers making a far greater profit than the taxpayer
on privatisation.
There were also delays in collecting the government's share of these
disposals which cost the taxpayer Pounds 4.5m, the committee found. This
delay arose partly because of disputes with two of the ports about whether
certain expenses were deductible.
The committee urged the government to consider ways of inserting binding
undertakings into agreements reached for any future sales to ensure that
bidders stood by promises made to the workforce.
The Port of Medway reduced its workforce from 688 to 260 in spite of an
earlier statement from its management that it would maintain the terms and
conditions of the employees at the existing level.
Employees who lost their jobs were required to sell back shares worth Pounds
35 for only Pounds 2.50. 'We are surprised that the re-sale value of the
shares was not covered in the sale agreement,' the committee said.
It called for the government to consider introducing a clawback on increases
in the value of shares where the increase resulted from the buyer's failure
to meet undertakings given at the time of the sale.
The reduction in the Medway workforce and the forced sale of employees'
shares made a significant difference to profitability.

FT  08 JUL 94 / BBC may launch 24-hour widescreen news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is seriously considering setting up a 24-hour television news
service using wide-screen digital technology.
The corporation is currently trying to raise finance for the project. Talks
will continue for the rest of the year with the government to see how
digital services could be introduced and paid for. If approved, the
technology would also be used to transmit BBC1 and BBC2. It would give
viewers enhanced coverage of everything from sport to drama - with a
high-quality picture rather like the shape of a cinema screen.
Existing sets would show a narrow picture with a dark band above and below,
but the picture would cover the screen on later models.
An indication of how seriously the BBC is taking the introduction of digital
services is that Mr Michael Starks has been put in charge of the project. Mr
Starks was responsible for implementing the controversial 'producer choice'
initiative - which gave producers freedom to buy services in the outside
market. The change has been credited with making big savings at the BBC.
Mr John Birt, director-general, confirmed yesterday that the BBC was
seriously interested in launching wide-screen services using digital
technology. He declined to elaborate, however, on what additional services
were being considered for widescreen in addition to BBC1 and BBC2.
Introduction of widescreen services would be very costly because of the need
to re-equip studios and transmitters.
One avenue of finance was cut off on Wednesday with the publication of the
government's white paper on the BBC. That said the licence fee could not be
increased to pay for digital services. This leaves the possibility of
raising money through transmitter privatisation or ventures with private
operators.
Mr Birt stressed that he did not regard the white paper as a vindication of
his personal policies and reforms. He said it was a group effort. 'It's what
all of us at the BBC worked hard on over a long period of time,' he said.
'We developed a consensus, not just in government, but outside.'
Mr Birt also cleared up one uncertainty in the white paper - a paragraph
that gave both the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority
the right to licence services owned or partly owned by the BBC. This is
largely a technicality - and does not mean that the BBC will be applying for
commercial television or radio licences.
The ITC is forbidden by law from licensing BBC satellite services in the UK,
so this has to be done by the heritage department.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Brand manufacturers warned on complacency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever, last night warned manufacturers of
branded products against the dangers of complacency and failure to innovate,
while calling for partnership, rather than confrontation, with the retailing
chains.
Sir Michael said successful manufacturers could 'sit back and rest on their
past investment - sometimes for years'. But he added: 'I know, we've done
it. But at some point a day of reckoning will come'.
Brands can establish a formidable reputation, said Sir Michael, but he
warned that 'very few are truly inimitable over time'.
The warning, delivered at a lecture to the Advertising Association, of which
Sir Michael is president, comes as 30 of the leading brand manufacturers,
including Unilever, have joined together to press for legislation to curb
supermarkets' 'look-alike' brands.
It was no longer adequate for brand manufacturers to rely on their
reputation for consistency of quality, he said. 'Stores like Sainsbury,
Tesco and Safeway have established their own reputations as guarantors of
freshness and quality - and far more than that. They have established
powerful brand identities of their own.'
'Brands only prosper - and only deserve to prosper - when they represent
value to the consumer.' The only way a brand could continue to provide value
was through continuous research and development and 'getting the result to
market faster'.
Sir Michael appealed to retailers for a new partnership: 'We go along to
them with a simple question: 'How can we work together to maximise sales and
margins across a whole product category?''
Brand owners must at all times focus on the 'value for money' equation,
concluded Sir Michael: 'Is the balance between price and quality the right
one?'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Forces volunteers to serve abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is to clear the way for part-time volunteers to
serve alongside regular forces overseas as part of its current restructuring
of the British armed forces.
With less than a week to go before the publication of a major package of
defence cuts, it emerged at Westminster yesterday that ministers are
planning to make more flexible use of reservists in frontline operations.
Fears grew last night that the cuts would include the closure of the naval
dockyard at Rosyth in Scotland. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor -
whose Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth - said any closure
'after promise after promise' would be a betrayal of the workforce.
Following a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on defence, it was revealed
that the cabinet would take a final decision on the package next Thursday.
However, some Tory backbenchers were surprised that this ratification would
be made just hours before the package is due to be revealed to the Commons.
'They are leaving it extremely tight,' said one MP.
There was lingering uncertainty over whether the MoD had managed to persuade
the Treasury that it should be allowed to keep all of the savings over the
Pounds 750m which it is required to make in its 1994-95 budget.
But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is understood to be confident
that he will be able to announce spending cuts well in excess of those
required by the Treasury without further reducing the armed forces' fighting
strength.
This should help him to deflect criticism from the main opposition parties
that the effect of the cuts have not been thought through strategically and
are Treasury-led.
It was also understood that the Treasury could still be trying to persuade
the MoD that it must provide redundancy payments for the 25,000 servicemen
and women who are due to lose their jobs in the review.
At the same time, defence officials are anxious to get a Treasury assurance
that it will not raise the possibility of more cuts in the forthcoming
Public Expenditure Survey.
The move to allow part-time volunteers will require legislation. It aims to
bolster front-line capability at a time when Tory backbenchers are concerned
about the impact of a severe fall in defence expenditure.
Under the Reserve Forces Act, it is all but impossible for the government to
send reservists overseas in peacetime.

FT  08 JUL 94 / IoD reports slight fall in directors' confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors are slightly less optimistic about their companies' prospects and
about the economy than they were in the spring, a survey from the Institute
of Directors has found.
Only 44 per cent of 300 directors surveyed last month were more optimistic
about the economy than they were six months ago, compared with 51 per cent
in April. Political uncertainty and government mismanagement were the
factors cited by those who were more pessimistic.
Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, said it believed there
was no case for either a cut or an increase in interest rates. He added:
'Business confidence, which is essential to sustain economic recovery, could
be restored by a firm commitment by the chancellor to return public finances
to order by means of a significant reduction in government spending.'
The proportion of directors more optimistic about their companies' prospects
fell slightly to 61 per cent, from 63 per cent in April. However 47 per cent
expect to take on more employees in the next six months, compared with 44
per cent in April. Seventy per cent said the volume of business had
increased, the same as in April, and 62 per cent said that profits had
risen, against 59 per cent in April. Overall, 79 per cent said their
companies were performing well or very well, the same as in April.
Economic recovery in the west Midlands has reached a plateau and confidence
about immediate prospects for corporate profitability has faltered, a survey
of business performance has found, Paul Cheeseright writes.
But the proportion of companies recruiting more staff has increased and, for
the services sector, there have been increasing difficulties in finding
skilled manual labour.
The west Midlands regional group of Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey
shows that the rise in domestic orders in the first quarter of the year was
not repeated in the second.
Last month 42 per cent of manufacturing companies reported home orders
higher than three months before, compared with 46 per cent in March. The
proportion reporting higher export orders rose to 36 per cent from 34 per
cent.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Bingham urges civil case changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, yesterday called for judges to be
given greater control over the management of cases to cut costs and delays
which dog the English civil-justice system, Robert Rice writes.
Lord Woolf, the law lord who is conducting a review of the civil-justice
system, has suggested the creation of 'procedural judges' to control the
conduct of cases up to trial.
But Sir Thomas, England's most senior civil-court judge, said pre-trial
control should be by the trial judge. It was important for the same judge to
be in charge throughout.
Giving the 1994 Justice Lecture in London, Sir Thomas said passing
responsibility for case management to the courts would result in a need for
more judges. The cost of this should be offset by time savings if trials
became shorter and simpler. It would also result in a diminution in the role
of the final trial, which would become something closer to the low-key
affair common in Europe. If that could be achieved the savings in costs
would be enormous, he said.
The suggestion of making judges responsible for case management came under
attack yesterday in the Law Society's Gazette. Mr Rowland Williams, a
solicitor, said that with 30,000 new seriously disputed cases filed in the
Queen's Bench each year, effective court monitoring of cases was 'light
years beyond the state's resources'.
Mr Williams also noted that if the cost of litigation could be reduced in
this way to levels acceptable to the public, the state could never hope to
handle the explosion in litigation which would follow.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Building societies' cheers give way to caution: How the
government's proposals for change have been received by the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The initial burst of cheering from building societies has died down. After
Wednesday's announcement of the government's decision to give them more
powers and to maintain their relative protection from takeovers, societies
are now considering altering the ways they do business.
Three specific changes are planned to give societies greater flexibility: an
increase from 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the ceiling on the amount of
their funds that they can raise on the wholesale money markets; an ability
to own all of a general insurance subsidiary dealing in housing-related
insurance; and a broadening of the types of business loans they can
undertake. All could be in place before the end of the year.
Alongside these changes, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary,
emphasised the need for more effective accountability of societies' boards
to their members. The most significant change is to require a board to
inform members at a general meeting of any non-confidential takeover offers
from organisations other than societies.
With the increase in the wholesale funding limit already widely expected,
the greatest immediate enthusiasm among societies was directed at the
proposal on general insurance - there is now a limit of 15 per cent in the
stake a society can hold in a general insurer.
Halifax and Woolwich, the largest and third-largest societies respectively,
expressed some interest in setting up general insurance subsidiaries. Others
such as National &amp; Provincial, the eighth-largest, saw a benefit in terms of
structuring existing relationships with insurers.
While in some cases this might simply mean being able to drive a harder
bargain, so as to make savings to pass to the customer, it might also mean
partnerships with general insurers.
These could reflect the arrangements some larger societies made with life
insurance companies whereby each had an equity stake in a venture.
Mr Brian Davies, the new chief executive at Nationwide, the second-largest
society, noted the risks in moving into general insurance, but agreed it was
a logical step in developing societies' functions. 'It will take time,' he
said, 'but in due course I would want to be responsible for the product the
customer sees.'
In spite of general enthusiasm for this proposal, it was not seen everywhere
as immediately relevant. At Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, the
priority was seen as consolidating the life insurance subsidiary it has just
launched.
The prospect of carrying out unsecured lending to businesses has been
greeted with much more caution.
However Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich, and Mr Alistair
Lyons, finance director of N&amp;P, both said that it would be an advantage in
developing relationships with customers who were involved in small
businesses or were self-employed.
Mr Kirkham said: 'I don't think societies will be wanting to take on big,
national companies but we want to be effective in the personal sector where
we operate.'
Such a reaction was probably the closest to what Mr Nelson seemed to want to
hear, in terms of increasing competitive pressure on the banks in the
small-business sector.
Mr Dick Spelman, marketing general manager at Halifax, said his society's
prime concern in this area was the restriction that the previous bar on this
type of lending had put on the society as it looked at acquisitions,
particularly in continental Europe.
Many societies appeared to be more conscious of the risks than the
opportunities. Several privately agreed with the view of Mr John Fry, group
services director of Abbey National, the banking group which used to be a
society.
'Societies are welcome to do small-business loans,' he said. 'We don't have
the expertise and I doubt very many building societies have either.'
Even at Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest society which already has
experience of small-business accounts through its ownership of Girobank,
reaction was guarded.
Mr Peter White, chief executive, emphasised the importance of having the
expertise to carry out business lending successfully. The Building Societies
Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, would 'take a tough prudential
line with societies intending to move into this sector'.
Societies and their competitors are now looking forward to the further
possibility of changes. Mr Fry believes that the principle that greater
accountability should go with any new powers has been usefully established.
On the other hand, at least one society chief executive is so relaxed about
accountability that he doubts the government will even bother to legislate
on the specific change it has already announced. There is still much to play
for.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shorter leading index, designed to reflect trends in the UK economy five
months ahead, fell in May, according to the Central Statistical Office,
Philip Coggan writes.
The shorter cyclical indicator dropped for the fourth successive month. The
CSO said May's decline was caused by share price falls and consumer
borrowing.
However, the longer leading index, which aims to pick up trends in the
economy 13 months ahead, rose in May. An increase in housebuilding starts
and a rise in the corporate sector's financial surplus contributed to the
change.
The coincident index rose in April and has been climbing since 1992's second
quarter.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Hurd tames plans for civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has warned ministerial colleagues that
reform of the civil service must be accompanied by respect for its core
values.
As officials yesterday disclosed that he had prevented radical moves to
privatise services in the forthcoming Cabinet Office white paper, Mr Hurd
said ministers should accept the valuable service they receive from civil
servants.
He told the FDA top civil servants union this week: 'The Conservative
government should not regard the civil service either as some hidden enemy,
or as a body of partisan supporters.'
He said loyalty could only work in both directions. Just as the civil
service would have to accept reform of its working practices, so ministers
would have to accept that the civil service remained an essential element of
Britain's constitution.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, the FDA general secretary, yesterday said: 'Senior
civil servants were so relieved to hear a minister praising the civil
service instead of attacking it.'
The white paper is expected to propose an end to centralised pay bargaining
in Whitehall but to reject some of the more radical moves to privatise
services supported by Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister.
Mr Hurd made it clear that he wanted to reaffirm the civil service's values
of integrity, impartiality and selection and promotion on merit.

The Commons Treasury committee is to investigate the increase in imports of
beer, wine and tobacco from the Continent, which is costing the government
millions of pounds a year in lost revenue.
Mr John Watts, committee chairman, said he was also concerned about the loss
of trade to British distillers, brewers and tobacco manufacturers.
'There is evidence to suggest that much of the increase in imports from the
Continent is illegal,' he said. The committee plans to publish a report of
its findings in the au-tumn.
The committee's decision to launch its review came as British companies
yesterday called on the government to reduce excise duties.
Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, the brewing group, said: 'Cheap
imports of beer from the Continent are damaging the industry at a
substantial cost to the Treasury.'
Recent estimates suggest that the Exchequer is losing between Pounds 400m
and Pounds 500m a year in revenue because of the increase in illegal
imports.
Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman of Allied-Lyons, said rates of excise duty,
which are substantially higher than those in Europe, were encouraging
cross-border shopping. 'This trade undermines a key British industry and its
contribution to the economy,' he added.
Mr Watts said the committee would invite submissions from industry and well
as from Customs &amp; Excise. 'This is a very serious matter which is causing
concern to both industry and government,' he said.
The committee will also study proposals made by the brewers to the Treasury
in a Budget submission, which called for a halving of excise duty on beer as
a first step towards lowering beer duty to the European average of eight
pence a pint by 1997.
Mr Redman said that he was hoping for a substantial cut in beer duty in the
Budget, and that any reduction would be passed on fully to consumers.
He said there was 'irrefutable evidence' that the quantity of beer which is
being imported from the Continent for personal consumption is increasing all
the time and is now running at the rate of almost 1m pints a day.
'Undoubtedly much of this is for re-sale and therefore illegal,' he added.
The Tobacco Manufacturers Association yesterday welcomed the announcement of
the committee's review.
Mr Clive Turner, director of the association's industrial affairs, said:
'The illegal importing of tobacco and beer is costing the government
millions of pounds and should be stopped.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Redwood to shake up rural Welsh quango
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Welsh quango which was attacked by MPs is to be revamped, with some of its
functions transferred to local authorities.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the
Development Board for Rural Wales, which the Commons public accounts
committee censured in May, would retain its core functions. But it would
have to liaise more closely with the Welsh Development Agency, and Mr David
Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the WDA, would take over as chairman of both
agencies.
The development board, based in Newtown, Powys, was set up nearly 20 years
ago to stem depopulation of rural Wales by promoting economic and social
development. It has a staff of 120 and a budget of Pounds 26.8m, including a
Welsh Office grant of nearly Pounds 17m.
Mr Redwood said in March that he was reviewing its future. This led to
speculation it would be subsumed into the WDA, which in turn triggered a
campaign by business and political leaders in Wales for its retention.
The Welsh secretary acknowledged yesterday that there was 'considerable
support' for the development board's work in property development and
business services. These functions would remain with it. To increase local
accountability, two additional councillors would be appointed to the board.
Councils will take over the development board's responsibility for a variety
of grant schemes from next year, Mr Redwood said. Its tourism activities
would transfer to the Wales Tourist Board and the WDA would take 'a strong
lead' in promoting inward investment.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe said last night: 'There will certainly be no takeover of the
DBRW by the WDA.'
The Commons public accounts committee heavily criticised the development
board in May and Mr Glyn Davies, its chairman for the seven years, resigned.
The committee's report said it had failed to comply with housing acts by
operating two sets of rules for housing allocation - one set of which was
unpublished. Under the undisclosed rules, the housing officer and his
ex-wife were given homes they were not qualified for under the public rules.
There was also criticism of a car-leasing scheme.
Ivor Owen writes: Mr Redwood said he had no plans for primary legislation to
deal with what Mr Rhodri Morgan, a Labour spokesman on Wales, described as
the 'legal difficulties' faced by the development board.
The minister said he had decided to review the board's future long before
any doubts arose because he wished to develop policy in a new direction.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Woolwich overdraft rate cut by half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for current account customers intensified yesterday when
Woolwich, the third largest building society, said it would slash its annual
percentage rate on authorised overdrafts to 9.8 per cent from 19 per cent
with immediate effect.
The move comes a week after Abbey National reduced its annual percentage
rate (APR) on authorised overdrafts from 18.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent and
two days after Midland Bank promised to pay customers Pounds 10 for each
failure to meet set standards of service in transferring a current account.
Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich, said the rate had been cut
to maintain its competitive stance and was 'a further indication of the
favourable effect that building societies are having in reducing the costs
of banking services'.
Woolwich, which introduced its current account four years ago, also reduced
its unauthorised overdraft rate to an APR of 29.5 per cent from 31 per cent.
The building society has just 375,000 of the estimated 33m current accounts
in the UK. It said its current accounts had recently become profitable,
allowing it to offer the reduced overdraft rate. Abbey National has 1.5m
current account customers.
Most banks said yesterday that they had no plans to react but would watch
developments. Barclays Bank, which has 7m current account customers,
described the Woolwich cut as 'a classic move by a niche player trying to
get a bigger slice of the cake'.
Halifax, the largest building society, with 750,000 current account holders,
said it did not intend to make changes to its overdraft rates, particularly
since it cut its authorised overdraft APR from 14.9 per cent to 12.4 per
cent last month.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Rolling-stock companies to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three companies which will own British Rail passenger rolling stock and
lease it to train operating companies are to be sold to the private sector
next year, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday.
The government has put a value of Pounds 3bn on BR's rolling-stock assets, a
high figure intended to smooth the shift towards a commercial leasing market
for locomotives, freight wagons and carriages.
By valuing BR's often aged rolling stock at what it calls modern equivalent
asset value, the same formula chosen for the track and other infrastructure
owned by Railtrack, the government believes that train operators will have
an incentive to invest in new rolling stock. But this valuation should not
make life difficult for operators because they will be compensated for any
higher leasing charges by higher subsidies, railway industry sources
believe.
Under the leasing regime planned by the government, train operators would
sign lease agreements, probably for about seven years. When these agreements
expire the operators would renegotiate new ones with the by now privately
owned leasing companies.
The announcement of details of the government's proposals has been eagerly
awaited by the train operators and represents a further important step in
the privatisation of the BR network.
The government has created three companies to own a mixed portfolio of BR's
11,000 items of passenger rolling stock so as to inject competition into the
leasing sector. It is unlikely to allow any private-sector bidder to own
more than one company.
Bids are expected from banks, financial services companies, leasing
specialists and also possibly from rolling-stock manufacturers. Consortium
bids may also be made, the government believes.
'Freed from the constraints of operating in the public sector, the three
companies will be able to bring private-sector expertise and commercial
practice to the supply of rolling stock,' Mr MacGregor said.
Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, said the taxpayer would be
the loser because the government was 'desperate to privatise some part of
the railways before the next general election'.
Mr Andy Thompson, secretary of the Finance and Leasing Association, said:
'There is no ready way of determining the value of rolling-stock assets and
difficulties may arise if the value put on them by potential bidders does
not match that of the government.'

<TEXT>
The Commons Treasury and civil service committee is planning to publish an
interim report on building societies in September to coincide with the
government's consultation paper, Roland Rudd writes.
Mr John Watts, chairman, said the committee had decided to speed up its
investigation following Wednesday's announcement by ministers that societies
will be able to offer a wider range of services while being more accountable
to their members. The committee has been reviewing the role of societies as
part of its wider investigation into financial services.

FT  08 JUL 94 / W Midlands businesses report faltering outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in the west Midlands has reached a plateau and confidence
about immediate prospects for corporate profitability has faltered,
according to a survey of business performance carried out by chambers of
commerce.
But the proportion of companies recruiting more staff has increased and, for
the services sector, there have been increasing difficulties in finding
skilled manual labour.
The West Midlands Regional Group of Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey,
published today, shows that the rise in domestic orders experienced in the
first quarter of the year was not repeated in the second.
In June, 42 per cent of the 455 manufacturing companies covered in the
survey reported home orders higher than three months before. But in March 46
per cent of companies reported fatter order books, up from 37 per cent in
December 1993.
In the services sector, the same pattern emerged. Of the 187 companies
taking part in the survey, 47 per cent reported increased orders in June
against 57 per cent in March and 38 per cent in December.
But there is a disparity of performance in overseas markets. The proportion
of manufacturing companies reporting higher export orders rose to 36 per
cent from 34 per cent but the proportion of service companies was down from
40 per cent to 26 per cent.
The survey suggests that companies are far more cautious about the immediate
future than cabinet ministers. In June, 44 per cent of manufacturing
companies and 46 per cent of service companies were expecting higher profits
over the next year, but in March the proportions were, respectively 47 per
cent and 50 per cent. Further evidence that tax rises and the fear of higher
mortgage rates have slowed down the recovery in the housing market emerged
yesterday with the publication of a national survey of estate agents.
The survey by the National Association of Estate Agents showed that 43 per
cent of its members had reported less business during June, compared with 22
per cent reporting more business.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Sharp rise for loan guarantee scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for the government's loan guarantee scheme increased sharply in the
first quarter of the year, Lord Strathclyde, small companies minister, said
yesterday. This was one of a number of factors demonstrating renewed health
of the smaller-company sector,
The minister was launching the Department of Trade and Industry's first
annual review of the state of small companies in Britain.
Applications for loan guarantees rose in the first quarter to 500 a month
from 300 a month in the same quarter last year. The scheme is designed to
support companies that either lack security or sufficient track record to
raise bank finance. However, the failure rate for companies supported by the
scheme remains high.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration and the Democratic party are launching an all-out
push to swing public support behind healthcare reform before Congress starts
drafting detailed legislation on the issue after this week's recess.
The campaign will include speeches by President Bill Clinton, Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton and administration officials, television advertising and a
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) bus tour, financed by backers of reform such as
unions, consumer groups and churches.
Ms Donna Shalala, health secretary, took to the road on Wednesday to
underscore the administration's commitment to universal healthcare, in a
message echoed by officials in a series of co-ordinated speeches across the
country. And yesterday saw the unveiling of a Democratic party television
advertising campaign.
The coming weeks will be critical for the prospects of reform as the Senate
and House leaderships struggle to craft bills approved by the congressional
committees with jurisdiction over healthcare into legislation to be voted on
by their respective chambers.
Voting is not likely to take place until next month, after which the Senate
and House versions must be reconciled in conference.
All four committees that agreed versions of the plan have approved
legislation that varies from the Clinton plan. But the main worry for the
administration is the powerful Senate finance committee, which was alone in
dropping universal healthcare insurance largely financed by employers.
Instead, the committee's version seeks to cover 95 per cent of the
population by the year 2002 through insurance industry reforms, tax
incentives and subsidies to low earners.

<TEXT>
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief executive of BCCI, is to appear in a
Washington courtroom today to enter a plea bargain over charges of fraud at
the bank, Justice Department officials said yesterday.
The plea agreement could mean he avoids a long public trial and receives a
modest sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to lesser charges and
agreeing to co-operate with investigations into the bank. Mr Naqvi has so
far not given the government much help in unravelling the way the BCCI fraud
was perpetrated.
The department would not comment on the hearing yesterday.
BCCI was closed down three years ago after international regulators
unearthed one of the biggest banking frauds in history, totalling over
Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn). Investors and depositors are still seeking
redress.
A plea deal may come under fire from Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York
district attorney, who initiated the BCCI investigation. The district
attorney's office said yesterday it was waiting to see the shape of the
agreement with Mr Naqvi. However, it did not rule out the possibility of
pursuing separate charges against him in New York state.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Donald Trump, casino operator, property developer and unrivalled exponent
of the art of self-promotion, yesterday achieved his greatest coup yet by
announcing that he had bought New York's famed Empire State Building - or at
least half of it, writes Richard Tomkins from New York. He has entered into
a 50-50 joint venture with a secretive group of Asian and European investors
who, it emerged yesterday, had quietly acquired ownership of the Manhattan
office block from a wealthy New York family in 1991. 'This is a great deal
for me,' said Mr Trump. 'It solidifies my position as New York's Native Son.
I get 50 per cent of all the upside and I intend to make my position worth a
fortune.' Although world-renowned for its awe-inspiring height and
architectural design, the Empire State Building is not regarded as a
particularly lucrative piece of real estate because it is encumbered by a
lease that runs until 2075. The Asian and European investors are believed to
have acquired it for barely Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m). Sources close to Mr
Trump, however, suggest that he may try to regain control of the building by
claiming the leaseholder is in default. The lease specifies the building
should be a class A office building, the sources say, but instead, it is
occupied by about 800 small businesses, mainly in the clothing industry.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Panama turns down US plan for Haitians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Panama's President Guillermo Endara withdrew his offer to house 10,000
Haitian refugees late yesterday, throwing US policy on Haiti into turmoil.
Mr Endara told a news conference in Panama City he wanted an agreement with
the United Nations, not with the US alone.
But according to some reports, Mr Endara wanted only US guarantees it would
pay to house and feed Haitians in camps to be established on US military
bases in Panama.
Several Panamanian groups criticised Mr Endara's earlier decision to take
boat people.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said 'obviously we're
disappointed' but the US would continue to seek other havens for Haitians.
Panama was to have played a crucial role in a Clinton administration plan
announced on Tuesday to bar Haitian boat people from receiving asylum in the
US, but to offer them safe havens in Panama, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda.
The US military was to have begun flying refugees from the US base at Cuba's
Guantanamo Bay to Panama today.
Earlier yesterday officials had been trying to clarify their day-old policy
on Haitian boat people, saying refugees would face easier standards to get
into safe havens in Panama than they had when seeking asylum in the US.
The administration - under pressure from human rights groups - agreed in
negotiations with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to allow a transfer
to safe havens for all Haitians who say they fear persecution. Previously
boat people had to provide evidence of persecution or be returned to Haiti.
There was no immediate sign the new US policy was discouraging refugees from
taking to the sea. More than 1,500 Haitians were picked up yesterday by the
US Coast Guard.
The Pentagon would not confirm reports yesterday that over 1,000 special
forces troops staged exercises a fortnight ago designed to simulate an
invasion of Haiti. There were such rehearsals before the 1987 US invasion of
Panama.
Meanwhile, a navy amphibious assault group carrying 2,000 US Marines
yesterday left for Haitian waters, where it will be on station to evacuate
US or other foreign citizens.

The Clinton administration and the Democratic party are launching an all-out
push to swing public support behind healthcare reform before Congress starts
drafting detailed legislation on the issue after this week's recess.
The campaign will include speeches by President Bill Clinton, Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton and administration officials, television advertising and a
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) bus tour, financed by backers of reform such as
unions, consumer groups and churches.
Ms Donna Shalala, health secretary, took to the road on Wednesday to begin
underscoring the administration's commitment to universal healthcare, in a
message echoed by officials in a series of co-ordinated speeches across the
country. And yesterday saw the unveiling of a Democratic party television
advertising campaign attacking the opponents of reform and funded from a
Dollars 5m war-chest.
The coming weeks will be critical for the prospects of reform as the Senate
and House leaderships struggle to craft bills approved by the congressional
committees with jurisdiction over healthcare into legislation to be voted on
by their respective chambers.
Voting is not likely to take place until next month, after which the Senate
and House versions must be reconciled in conference. Final voting on the
completed legislation could therefore come after the August recess, in
September or October.
All of the four committees that agreed versions of the plan have approved
legislation that varies from the Clinton plan. But the main worry for the
administration is the powerful Senate finance committee, which was alone in
dropping the cornerstone of the Clinton proposal - achieving universal
healthcare insurance largely financed by employers.
Instead, the finance committee's version seeks to cover 95 per cent of the
population by the year 2002 through insurance industry reforms, tax
incentives and subsidies to low earners.
The committee often accurately reflects the views of the Senate at large,
and some House members may also look to it for a lead on health-care.
But abandoning universal coverage is anathema to the administration. Fears
of having to accept watered-down legislation - or even no legislation at all
 -lie behind the publicity onslaught aimed at getting the public to lobby
their congressmen on the issue.
Opinion polls have produced contradictory findings on healthcare, but an
ABC-Washington Post poll at the end of last month found an overwhelming 78
per cent backing a guarantee of universal coverage.
Much of the battle for hearts and minds will be fought on the nation's
television screens. The Democratic party's advertisements launched yesterday
are a parody of the infamous 'Harry and Louise' campaign, sponsored by the
Health Insurance Association of America, which attacked the Clinton plan.
In the original advertisement a concerned couple picked holes in the Clinton
proposals. But in the Democratic version, Harry has lost his job and his
health insurance, both partners are sick in bed and complaining of the
financial burdens of illness. The health insurance industry threatened to
respond to the ads.
Also about to enter the battle is Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and
independent runner in the 1992 presidential election. Mr Perot last week
offered to fund Republican advertising on healthcare. The Republicans have
already run campaigns advocating more limited health reform measures and say
they will run more.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Baby Bells challenge 'one-man regulation': Martin Dickson on
the US phone companies' legal battle for new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the quirks of the American political system that for the past
decade the most powerful individual in the nation's fast-changing
telecommunications industry has been a 71-year-old judge of the US district
court in Washington.
Likened to a 'one-man regulatory commission', Judge Harold Greene has
sweeping powers to determine what businesses America's seven 'Baby Bell'
local telephone companies may enter and how they may conduct themselves.
This week the judge's fiefdom came under attack when four of the Baby Bells
 -Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex and Southwestern Bell - filed a motion
asking him to give up his control over them. In particular, they want him to
lift a ban, imposed because they are local monopolies, which prevents them
from competing in the lucrative long-distance telecommunications market and
the manufacturing of communications equipment.
If he refuses, as seems likely, the phone companies may fight the case all
the way to the Supreme Court.
The outcome could be important in determining the shape of the industry,
which is going through immense structural change as technological and
regulatory barriers crumble.
But the case could also be overtaken by events. In a separate process,
Congress is working on legislation to establish a new framework for the
industry, which would eliminate Judge Greene's powers.
A bill passed last week by the House of Representatives, and favoured by the
Baby Bells, would allow them to enter the long-distance market relatively
quickly.
However, the Baby Bells are bitterly opposed to another version of the bill,
due to come before the Senate commerce committee this month, which would
keep them out of some long-distance services until they face 'actual and
demonstrable' competition in their local phone businesses, which could take
years.
Some observers suggest that the Baby Bells have only started the court
battle to put pressure on Congress to pass the House bill, or to prepare
another line of attack if they do not get their way on Capitol Hill.
Whatever the case, Judge Greene's current role is largely the result of
Congress's failure to enact comprehensive telecommunications reform over the
past decade as it has been battered by lobbies for and against the Baby
Bells. The judge has filled the consequent legislative vacuum.
Judge Greene became involved in telecommunications policy on his first day
on the federal bench in 1978. He was handed what was to become the largest
anti-trust case in American history - US versus American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph - in which the Justice Department accused AT&amp;T of monopolistic
practices.
Judge Greene oversaw the so-called Modified Final Judgment (MFJ) which
settled the case. AT&amp;T agreed to spin off its local telecommunications
companies into seven separate businesses - the Baby Bells.
AT&amp;T retained its long-distance and manufacturing operations, but faced
greater competition. The Baby Bells were barred from long distance,
telecommunications equipment manufacturing and information services, for
fear they would use their financial muscle to quash competitors.
Judge Greene was left with responsibility for overseeing implementation of
the MFJ, along with his roster of regular court cases.
The Baby Bells have two big complaints. First, they must seek waivers from
him to be allowed to enter new businesses, or to carry out some aspects of
existing ones, and his court does not have the capacity to handle these
requests speedily. Waivers have taken five years or more to be approved.
He also has power over certain aspects of AT&amp;T's business and his long
review of the company's Dollars 12.6bn (Pounds 8.2bn) bid for McCaw Cellular
Communications has been one obstacle to consummation of that deal, announced
nearly a year ago.
Second, Judge Greene has been resolutely opposed to the Baby Bells entering
big new markets - despite a remarkable about-face in 1987 by the Justice
Department, which said that changes wrought by the AT&amp;T break-up meant it
was now acceptable for the seven to operate in the equipment and information
services business.
In 1991 the US Court of Appeals ordered the judge to remove his information
services ban, though he went down fighting, arguing that it did not make
sense to turn a key ingredient of the information society over to
'corporations who not so long ago were involved in major violations of
anti-trust laws'.
The Baby Bells argue that Judge Greene's remaining powers should be removed
because the telecommunications industry has changed so much since the MFJ
was agreed: they now face a measure of local competition from upstart rivals
trying to cream off business, while their entry into long-distance will
shake up what has become an 'oligopoly' dominated by three rivals - AT&amp;T,
MCI Communications and Sprint.
Their opponents, which include the long-distance carriers, consumer groups
and local rivals, insist that nothing has really changed and the Babies are
still monopolies, responsible for 98 per cent of local telecommunications
traffic.
This, in a nutshell, is the conflict which Congress is trying to resolve as
it weighs the most comprehensive change in telecommunications legislation
since 1934. It could still end in gridlock, keeping Judge Greene's hands on
the levers of power for a considerable time yet.

The Pentagon yesterday confirmed reports that more than 1,000 elite special
forces troops staged exercises two weeks ago in the south-east US and Gulf
of Mexico designed to simulate an invasion of Haiti, writes Jeremy Kahn from
Washington. Similar rehearsals were conducted before the US invasion of
Panama in 1989. The White House insists it is still pursuing economic
sanctions against Haiti's military junta and that armed intervention is not
imminent. A Navy amphibious assault group carrying 2,000 Marines meanwhile,
set sail yesterday for Haiti's waters, where it will be on station in the
event US citizens or other foreigners need to be evacuated from the troubled
country.

<TEXT>
Lawyers acting for Mr Dan Rostenkowski are seeking to mount a constitutional
challenge to corruption charges against the Democratic congressman, writes
Ken Warn from Washington. Mr Rostenkowski faces a 17-count corruption
indictment covering his activities over the past 20 years. The charges
include putting 'ghost' employees on his payroll, converting federal money
for personal and family use, and trading stamps for cash at the House post
office. In a hearing this week to review progress on the case, Mr
Rostenkowski's lawyers argued the alleged offences concerned House rules and
only Congress has jurisdiction over its own legislation. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson gave the defence until August 5 to file its
challenges. She said she was 'a bit disheartened' by the slow start in the
case and would brook no further delay. Mr Rostenkowski, formerly a key ally
of President Bill Clinton in the battle over healthcare reform, was forced
to stand down as chairman of the powerful House ways and means committee as
a result of the corruption charges.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Fans are opening their wallets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Cup is generating heavy extra tourist spending in the nine cities
where matches are played, according to business leaders.
A spokeswoman for the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau said: 'The games
(and opening ceremonies) were worth more advertising dollars than we could
ever pay.' In Boston, organisers are confident that the World Cup will
generate Dollars 255m worth of extra retail spending. In Orlando, retailers
were 'very, very happy,' said a spokesman.
Stadiums have been sold out for virtually all games, with ticket sales
especially strong in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and New York. In
Dallas, tomorrow's quarter-final between Brazil and Holland is a sell-out,
with scalpers asking Dollars 175 to Dollars 250 for Dollars 55 tickets.
Not everyone is happy. Hotels in some World Cup cities were left with empty
rooms when organisers over-projected sales. In San Francisco, John Marks,
president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, said hotel
bookings were well below those expected.
Orlando hotels near the city's theme parks reported a slight slow-down last
month, apparently caused by people waiting for the soccer crowds to leave.
'We've all been a little nervous about the domestic market backing off,'
said Phil Wright, president of the Central Florida Hotel and Motel
Association.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Sharp drop in subsidised trade finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The use of subsidised trade finance by the industrialised countries fell
sharply last year, but preliminary figures suggest that export competition
may once again drive up levels of tied aid financing.
According to a report from the US Export-Import Bank to Congress, the total
volume of tied aid credit offers last year fell to Dollars 6.9bn (Pounds
4.5bn) from Dollars 15.5bn in 1992.
The drop followed a 1992 agreement among the industrialised countries,
pushed by the US, designed to slow the pace of export credit subsidised by
governments in the form of soft loans or grants.
But the trend could be reversing. According to the report, countries
reported making Dollars 3.1bn in tied aid offers during the first four
months of 1994.
If the trend continues, tied aid offers could total Dollars 9.4bn for this
year.
In most recent years, France and Japan have been the most active tied aid
promoters. Last year France provided Dollars 1.23bn, Germany Dollars 950m,
the US, Dollars 900m, and the UK Dollars 830m.
This year the Germans have been the most active, offering Dollars 1.5bn.
About two-thirds of these offers were highly concessional. France and Spain
each offered tied aid credits worth about Dollars 400m.
The US this year has a Dollars 150m 'war chest' with which to subsidise
loans. Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank chairman, has vowed to match the
subsidised offers of US company competitors to eliminate financing as the
basis for making a deal. As of early June Eximbank had three tied-aid
preliminary loan commitments outstanding and was preparing another.
China, which has just opened the doors of its own trade finance bank, has
been the biggest beneficiary of subsidised export finance.
During the first four months of this year it received about Dollars 600m in
tied aid offers. Last year it received Dollars 2.3bn.
'In large part, the continuing heavy volume of tied aid offers to China was
owed to the Chinese central government's continuing efforts to use
commercial pressure to obtain aid financing which would have otherwise been
committed to other countries,' the report says.
'To pursue this end, the central government continues to impose a stiff duty
in imports financed by credits bearing a note rate of greater than 5 per
cent.
'To avoid paying this tax, Chinese purchasing enterprises must seek the
cheapest possible foreign financing, even if it means playing foreign
contractors and OECD credit agencies off one another.'
The US has grown increasingly concerned about the use of 'untied' financing,
mostly offered by Japan.
This practice in principle makes concessional credits available to foreign
suppliers but in practice, most of the subsidised lending backs the sale of
Japanese products.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Caricom shrugs off US concerns over Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRIDGETOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba's inclusion in the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), a regional
trading bloc formed this week, will not become a controversial and divisive
issue despite US concerns, the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) said
yesterday.
Caricom added that all prospective members had agreed the island should be a
member and Cuba met all the criteria for joining the economic co-operation
grouping.
The Caricom leaders, at their annual summit in Barbados, approved a draft
agreement establishing the ACS, which will include all the Community's
members, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, the Central American
states, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. The 25 members will offer associate
membership to 15 dependent territories in the region.
The agreement is to be signed in Colombia on July 25, creating what
officials say will be one of the world's largest trade blocs.
Caricom officials say that the community's members have been informed of
Washington's objections regarding Cuba's inclusion. 'We gather that the
United States feels that Cuba should first make political reforms and
improve human rights before it is allowed into the ACS,' a Caricom official
said. 'But again we say that the United States has not put these concerns to
Canada and Mexico, which have been Cuba's main trading partners in the
hemisphere. There is no basis on which Cuba can be excluded.'
Mr Jorge Bolanos, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, said the government was
unperturbed by US concerns, as these were expected.
'We knew from very early that this would not go down well in Washington,'
said Mr Patterson Thompson, executive director of the Caribbean Association
of Industry and Commerce. 'But we agreed unanimously on having Cuba in the
ACS, and the government has already initialled the draft agreement.'
'The US has nothing to do with this,' he said.
The ACS is the largest economic grouping in which Cuba has been involved
since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner, and the
dismantling of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon.)
In another move to strengthen economic ties with its Latin American
neighbours, Caricom has agreed the terms of a free trade pact with Colombia.
The agreement will be signed at the end of this month, and will be effective
in January next year.
It will allow specified categories of Caricom products preferential entry to
the Colombian market, with the community reciprocating on a phased basis.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: The double acts that strut and fret - Jurek
Martin in Washington looks at the performances of some of the tournament's
odd couples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Denmark had qualified, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern would not have been
the talk of the World Cup - far too subtle and self-effacing, too fond of
screen passes, unwilling to give their prince of a striker a good look at
anything other than a dead ball.
Inevitably, sports seem to produce inseparable pairs: Hoad and Rosewall,
Koufax and Drysdale, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Montana and Rice, etc. They do not
even have to play for the same side. Bird (Larry) and Magic (Johnson)
reinvented basketball in the early 1980s while playing a continent apart in
Boston and Los Angeles, and only a few times a season against each other.
So it is more than convenient to look at this World Cup in terms of its
twins, especially among the survivors. Batistuta and Caniggia engaged our
attention while Argentina were alive, and no finer goalkeepers have been
seen than old Preud'homme of Belgium and young Al Deayea of Saudi Arabia,
but they are all now back home.
Hristo Stoichkov and Gheorghe Hagi are a natural pair, and not only because
Bulgaria and Romania are neighbours. Neither looks like the sort to be met
in a dark alley. If Richard Nixon had sported a five o'clock shadow
resembling Stoichkov's, he would never have been elected dog-catcher.
Both are combative and both are artists at petulant gamesmanship, forever
seeking that niggling edge that can induce mistakes by the opposition. Hagi
drove John Harkes of the US into just such a silly reaction - and a yellow
card that took him out of the match against Brazil. How Jamal Al-Sharif, the
Syrian referee, survived the Bulgarian's menacing reproaches in the Mexican
game without going ballistic is a tribute to Arab tolerance.
But both are marvellous creative players able to finish what they start.
They might even be softies at heart. There was Stoichkov after the penalty
shoot-out with consoling arms draped around Jorge Campos, the psychedelic
Mexican goalkeeper. Lip-reading Spanish (Stoichkov plays for Barcelona) is
not easy, but Campos seemed to appreciate what he heard. Even Hagi smiled,
deathlessly, after Romania had done in Argentina.
Romario and Bebeto, the Brazilian attacking twins, apparently do not like
each other. Romario does not seem to like anyone. He even refused to sit
next to Bebeto on the flight to the US, which, presumably, was not in
economy class.
They may have developed a new theory in human relations - that if personal
contact is confined to kicking a ball it can be civil. Thus, two inherently
selfish, egotistic and highly-skilled people instinctively know where the
other is and what his intentions are; if they don't, they don't talk to each
other.
It is most logical to couple Roberto Baggio of Italy with Lothar Matthaus of
Germany. They do not play much alike, nor even mostly in the same part of
the field, but both came to the World Cup with the advance billing of
miracle workers and with the cares of their countries on their shoulders.
Not surprisingly, both have come close to being disappointing. Baggio had to
suffer the humiliation of being removed from the Norway game after barely 20
minutes when Italy fell a man short, and his temporary redemption came
perilously late, with two goals in the 89th minute and in extra time against
Nigeria.
Prior to then, on his own admission, he had been in a slump. He looked
care-worn, his ponytail drooping, no encouraging Buddhist mantra passing his
lips. At least he was a stoic about it - until he scored and exulted in a
manner that put even Maradona in the shade.
The super-cool Matthaus has not had to bestir himself so much and has been
handicapped by an injured foot, which meant he missed the excruciating last
half-hour against a rampant South Korea. But not until Belgium can he be
said to have imposed himself on a game, and even then he took second billing
to another odd couple, Jurgen Klinsmann and Rudi Voller.
It is hard to pair goalkeepers, who are solitary fellows given to screaming
at their own defences. But a certain affinity under the skin may link Thomas
Ravelli of Sweden, than whom no-one is more manic of face and manner, and
Claudio Taffarel of Brazil, a country with a long history of eccentric last
lines of defence.
Taffarel's calmness to date can only reflect the fact that he has hardly had
a shot to save in four matches (the one he missed, by Kennet Andersen of
Sweden, would have beaten Cerberus). If he flubs one, or if a defender goofs
 -look out.
As already noted in the FT this week, there is no slower pair afoot than
Ronald Koeman and Frank de Boer of Holland, though both compensate in other
ways. The contrasting speed merchants out of defence must be Sergi and
Albert Ferrer of Spain, who may or may not have trained in Pamplona.
Luis Enrique of Spain and Florin Raducioiu of Romania may be linked as
exemplary all-purpose forwards, mean enough to intimidate defenders and
quick enough to get outside them. Both play well with their backs to the
goal, laying the ball off and running at goal.
The finest actor on display remains Klinsmann, but Emil Kostadinov must have
a formidable theatrical reputation back home in Bulgaria, now being
magnified on the world stage. Gianfranco Zola of Italy and Emil Kremenliev,
also a Bulgarian thespian, gave virtuoso performances in the face of red
cards, especially the Italian with a truly passionate assault on surrounding
fences and advertising hoardings.
The pair - there had to be two of them - who have been sent home (Stefan
Effenberg of Germany and Ion Vladiou the Impaler of Romania) merely played
to the audiences and referees too much. That is something of which
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern would never have been guilty.

exhaust fumes, writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
Ansaldo said conversion would allow the plant to generate an additional
100MW of power without raising fuel consumption. The company's subsidiary,
Ansaldo Gie, is the lead company in a consortium with Daelim of Korea and
Sumitomo of Japan. Ansaldo said its share of the order was worth L110bn.
Proton, Malaysia's national car maker, is to assemble up to 50,000

The German government yesterday announced a new DM1.2bn (Pounds 492m)
programme to subsidise research in its recession-hit aerospace industry, a
move intended to help the sector fight competition from the US and Japan.
The plan announced by Mr Reinhard Gohner, parliamentary state secretary in
the Economics Ministry, is supposed to provide indirect research subsidies,
and therefore not to contravene Gatt rules banning direct subsidies.
'With this new programme, we are seeking to follow in the footsteps of both
the US and Japan by using indirect support, in order not to unleash new
competitive subsidies,' he said.
'The aim is essentially to create the conditions for the German and European
aerospace industry to maintain its international position, won not least
thanks to state assistance.'
The government will finance half the cost of the programme, to run from next
year, with industry providing the other DM600m. It will focus on energy
saving, and the reduction of noise and pollution, for four sectors: large
aircraft, engines, helicopters, and aircraft equipment. The programme was
greeted in the German industry, which has axed thousands of jobs in the past
year, as 'a first step'.
'At least the decision shows that the political establishment has finally
recognised how important the highest technology is for Germany,' Mr Detmar
Grosse-Leege, the spokesman for Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler-Benz's aerospace
subsidiary, said. He warned against any attempt to finance the civil
aviation sector of the industry with cash from space research, however.
'Given the brutal competition and the huge state support which the US
aerospace industry has received for years, the support of German aerospace
research is more urgent than ever,' he said. The German industry has claimed
repeatedly that the US unfairly subsidises its industry through the research
and development budgets earmarked for defence and space exploration.
Mr Gohner said that as far as large aircraft were concerned, the key area of
technological development concerned the use of new materials, such as carbon
fibres. As far as motors are concerned, the emphasis will be on developing
technologies to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution to around 15 per cent of its
current levels.

FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Economic blocs 'no threat to trade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trend towards regional economic blocs was likely to accelerate during
the 1990s, but there was no evidence that it had damaged the growth of world
trade, Mr Peter Sutherland, the director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, said yesterday, writes Guy de Jonquieres, Business
Editor.
'The conclusion that the world is witnessing the creation of three
inwardly-oriented 'trading blocs', based in North America, western Europe
and the Asia-Pacific region, is not supported by an analysis of trends in
the patterns of world trade,' he said in a speech in Sao Paulo.
Such groupings had had 'a negligible impact' on the structure of world
trade, except in western Europe, where trade between European Union members
had grown faster than with the rest of the world. But it was difficult to
generalise from that example, because EU integration went far beyond trade.
Furthermore, external trade had not changed much as a proportion of western
Europe's GDP since the end of the war.
Mr Sutherland said he was confident that regional integration would
complement multilateral trade, provided Gatt members swiftly ratified the
Uruguay Round trade agreement. He suggested, however, that the impact of
regional blocs should be more thoroughly monitored by Gatt members. Since
1986, 25 preferential trade agreements have been notified to the Gatt.

FT  08 JUL 94 / North Yemeni forces capture centre of Aden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North Yemeni forces of President Ali Abdullah Saleh appeared to have
secured victory in the two-month-old Yemeni civil war yesterday after
capturing Aden, the last main southern stronghold, and forcing southern
leaders to flee.
North Yemeni officials said their forces had wrested control of central Aden
after several days' fierce fighting in suburbs north of the city.
Their claim was backed by news agency reports from Aden saying northern
troops had won control of the airport and taken the city's central suburbs
of Crater, Tawahi and Maalla. The dispatches said that fighting in Aden had
subsided and that a captured Aden television centre was broadcasting scenes
of northern troops in the city centre.
With the capture of Aden and most of south Yemen's strategic sites, Mr Saleh
seems to have realised his presumed ambition of reimposing unity on the
country by force. But western diplomats in the region said that remnants of
the southern forces might continue to harass their northern foes through
guerrilla fighting and sabotage from Yemen's rugged hinterland.
Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, head of the southern government and former
vice-president of unified Yemen, has fled to neighbouring Oman from
Mukallah, which fell to northern forces earlier this week. An Omani official
said he arrived there on Wednesday night with some top officials.
In New York, Mr Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas, prime minister of the
self-declared southern government, called for the safe passage out of Aden
for 'those who want to leave' but denied this amounted to capitulation.
'People are resisting in many places,' he said.
Mr Abdul Karim el-Eryani, planning minister in the Sanaa government, who was
also in New York for talks at the United Nations, said he considered Mr
al-Attas' plea for safe passage signified 'the end of the war'.
Northern officials in Sanaa called on southern 'rebels' to stop fighting and
take advantage of an amnesty.
Aden's fall crowns a series of telling military blows against the
secessionist south. In the past few days northern troops captured Mukallah,
the south's second city, its airport and the south's sole commercial
oilfield at Masilah.
The civil war broke out in May after four years of uneasy unification
between North and South Yemen. Mr Saleh and Mr al-Beidh became increasingly
bitter enemies after Yemen's first multi-party elections in April last year.
The south's repeated call for recognition from powerful Arab friends and
neighbours went unrequited, though Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in particular,
were believed to be sympathetic to its cause and, according to western
diplomats in the region, may have supplied Aden's leadership with arms.
The six Gulf Co-operation Council states, along with Egypt and Syria, on
Wednesday called for a ceasefire but avoided giving the south diplomatic
recognition.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Causes of the war still fester: Resistance will feed off
south's alienation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For weeks Yemen's civil war had come increasingly to be a race between
opposing military and diplomatic forces. Anxious to avoid any foreign
intervention, the north had to secure a military victory as quickly as
possible, while the south, aiming for international recognition, had to
stave off military defeat as long as it could.
With the fall of Aden, the northern generals seem to have won. However, even
in the teeth of apparent defeat, southern political leaders insist they are
not vanquished.
'People are resisting in many places and south Yemen is a vast area,' said
Mr Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas, the southern prime minister, in an interview on
Wednesday, a day before the fall of his capital. His words were echoed by Mr
Mohsen Farid, the deputy premier, who said: 'Maybe the battle is over, but
the war is not.'
Indeed, the northern forces, essentially an army of occupation, may well
find themselves increasingly the targets of a small and determined south
Yemeni resistance.
Now reported to be seeking asylum in neighbouring Oman, Ali Salem al-Beidh,
the southern president, may be able to regroup his scattered leaders and
organise a guerrilla movement which will give General Ali Abdullah Saleh,
the northern leader, nightmares for years to come.
The northern leadership, claiming its victory over the south, insists that
its aims are unity, stability, and democracy. It will be a long, hard slog.
Not least, it will have to overcome the country's chronic economic malaise,
made worse by the two-month war.
Inflation has spiralled to some 400 per cent over the past four years and
promises to rise even more. War damage has added to the difficulties. The
Aden refinery, bombed out of commission by northern warplanes, used to meet
the country's domestic fuel requirement of 65,000 barrels a day. Now, while
searching for the funds to repair that damage, the country will have to
import petrol, using up scarce hard-currency reserves.
Yemen's civil war, which began with the decimation of southern military
units placed in the north, has been an acrimonious and bloody fight. Neither
side has released casualty figures, but international aid workers put the
total in the tens of thousands of dead and wounded. It will create lasting
acrimony.
'Lots of blood has been shed. They need to put the past behind them as fast
as possible,' says Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy to
Yemen. Good but, perhaps, hasty advice.
Since the unification of the north and the south in May 1990, southerners
have increasingly felt left out of the country's economic and political
mainstream, certain that the northern leadership has intentionally cut them
adrift. It was such feelings of marginalisation which led to the
southerners' desire to separate from the north again.
Without resolution of the country's underlying political and economic
problems - the very problems which brought on the war - Yemen is likely to
remain disunited, unstable, and undemocratic for many more years to come.
And Mr al-Beidh remains in the wings.

Australia's unemployment rate moved back into double digits last month,
although the apparent setback was dismissed as a technical distortion,
writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Seasonally adjusted, June saw unemployment at
10 per cent, against 9.8 per cent in May. But some analysts pointed to a net
30,400 full-time jobs created during the month, with full-time employment
moving back above 6m for the first time since February 1991.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Israeli-PLO talks aim to accelerate self-rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are to begin talks next
week in Cairo on an accelerated extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho
across the rest of the West Bank.
The agreement announced in Paris yesterday marks a critical step forward in
the peace process and reflects the greater trust and confidence both sides
have in each other following completion of the first phase: the
implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
However, Israel appears to have forced the PLO to accept a two-stage
negotiating process for the West Bank - accelerated talks on the transfer of
power followed by talks on redeployment of Israeli forces - rather than the
single-stage process demanded by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chair-man.
Mr Arafat wants the process speeded up considerably to allow the PLO to take
control of the West Bank well ahead of Palestinian national elections due on
October 15. He appears determined to hold quick polls to confound critics
who say he is undemocratic and afraid of elections which might see opponents
win considerable power.
Israel has cautioned on the need to move slowly.
A joint Israeli-PLO statement said yesterday that the Cairo talks would
break into two working groups. One group would discuss issues outstanding
from the first phase - such as Israel's refusal to release 6,000 Palestinian
prisoners, and arrangements for border crossings and safe corridors between
the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The second group would discuss giving
Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank more control over some aspects of
the local administration, as well as elections and financial matters such as
the transfer of taxes and customs.
Israel agreed in Paris to speed up transfer of power in the West Bank and
expand self-rule beyond the already agreed five areas of health, education,
tourism, direct taxation and social welfare. Only after the conclusion of
these talks would the two sides negotiate an interim accord for the West
Bank including the redeployment of Israeli forces out of Palestinian
population centres, which Israel is pledged to complete by the eve of
elections.
The third issue which is now open for discussion is the right of return of
Palestinians who fled their homes in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Palestinian leaders jostle to hold economic reins: Julian
Ozanne speaks to the finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinians are determined to resist World Bank and international pressure
and impose their own priorities on economic development and the allocation
of foreign aid, according to the new Palestinian finance minister.
In an interview Mr Mohammed Nashashibi called for donors urgently to give
more money to the embryonic self-rule authority, warned about the
difficulties of stringent tax collection demanded by donors, and said he
favoured renegotiating the free-trade economic agreement with Israel to
allow Palestinians to protect their industry.
Mr Nashashibi's remarks came as the controversial Palestinian Economic
Council for Development and Reconstruction (Pecdar) - the body originally
empowered to implement, monitor and co-ordinate aid-funded projects worth
Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.57bn) over five years - came under renewed pressure
after Mr Hassan Abu Libdeh, Pecdar deputy managing director, threatened to
resign.
Mr Libdeh's threat is the result of continuing political infighting within
the Palestine Liberation Organisation over who will wield power over
economic development. At the heart of the matter lies a struggle between
Palestinian economic ministers and fears that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman, will not desist from intervention in economics.
Mr Nashashibi, a 60-year-old Arafat loyalist and former banker, said there
had been a World Bank campaign to influence the composition of Pecdar to
marginalise the PLO political leadership in favour of technocrats. The PLO
had resisted this and would do so in the future.
'There was an attempt to prevent the political leadership from taking a
leading role in building the economy and they preferred to have technocrats
dealing with the World Bank without political sponsorship of the
leadership,' he said. 'This is not acceptable in any part of the world and
it will not succeed with us.'
Mr Nashashibi, a PLO executive member since 1972, said the PLO's
determination to inject its political priorities into economic development
had nothing to do with donor concerns about transparency and accountability.
'There will be no transactions under the table. Everything will be over the
table and we have internal and external auditing and proper procurement
procedures. Now the system is so open and so clear.'
The minister also said the Palestinian Finance Ministry was taking greater
authority over Pecdar and would be in control of the budget and of
negotiations over foreign funding of the estimated budget deficit of Dollars
168m.
Mr Nashashibi's growing power over finances, aid and Pecdar at the expense
of Mr Ahmed Qurie, economics and trade minister, may be one reason behind Mr
Libdeh's threatened resignation.
Mr Libdeh refused to indicate yesterday whether he was departing but said:
'We have to define roles in a very definite way. Regardless of who is in
control everybody must work towards the same programme, otherwise the thing
will blow up and the losers will be our people sitting at home hoping for
results.'
Mr Nashashibi, who studied at Ruskin College, Oxford, warned that the
fragile peace process would quickly collapse unless donors immediately
started disbursing aid promised for projects. Pecdar has presented donors
with a list of emergency projects and plans to issue tenders for projects
worth Dollars 200m in the next few weeks.
'Our people need to see something - not simply meetings in Washington and
Paris,' the minister said. 'After one month, if we do not implement
projects, I think the Gaza people will kick us out. What are the donors
waiting for?'
Mr Nashashibi also warned that the PLO still did not have enough money to
meet the costs of running self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, particularly paying
salaries to civil servants and 9,000 Palestinian police. Of the estimated
budget deficit of Dollars 168m, donors have committed Dollars 133m, with
Dollars 61m in a special fund administered by the World Bank and named after
Mr Johan Jorgen Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister. After long talks
the World Bank agreed that the PLO draw down the Holst fund by Dollars 13m a
month - a sum the PLO claims is still insufficient.
Mr Nashashibi said he had paid the civil servants for July but did not have
enough money to pay the policemen. He warned that the new self-rule
authority would need further start-up assistance as it would be difficult to
collect taxes to the level achieved under Israeli occupation.
'The way the Israelis collected taxes was inhuman and before jobs are
created by projects it will be difficult to collect the taxes needed.'
The minister was also critical of the PLO-Israeli free trade economic
agreement which had left Palestinians without the ability to apply their own
trade regime. He said he would press for a renegotiation of the agreement,
even if it meant closing borders.
'Let them close the borders. I am ready to see the borders closed. The
Israelis must realise they cannot continue overwhelming our economic future.
How can I have my own import policy and develop industry if my market is
open freely to Israeli products? You can never build your own economy if you
don't protect industry.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Nigerian army acts on oil strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military government used troops to limit the effect of an oil
workers' strike on supplies of fuel in the main cities yesterday, as the
industry prepared for the stoppage to intensify.
The strike is in protest against the annulment of last year's presidential
poll and the arrest two weeks ago of its deposed winner, Mr Moshood Abiola.
Mr Abiola has been charged with treason after declaring himself president
and is in police custody waiting for a plea for bail to be heard on July 14.
The government said yesterday it had made 'special arrangements' to ensure
supplies of petroleum products reached filling stations in Lagos and four
other southern cities - Ibadan, Engugu, Benin and Port Harcourt - after this
week's strike by Nupeng, the blue-collar oil workers' union, left most
filling stations dry.
It also said that the army would be providing help to ease the fuel shortage
and that three military barracks in Lagos were selling fuel directly to the
public.
In line with a tough stand it has recently taken against civilian opponents,
the government said that strikers who disrupted these measures would be
regarded as saboteurs.
The low official price of petrol in Nigeria, equivalent to some 2p a litre,
has led to smuggling abroad of refined products. Military officers have been
accused of taking part in the trade.
The oil producing companies have maintained normal output of crude despite
the strike by Nupeng, but the senior staff association Pengassan has now
warned it will go on strike by July 12 unless the government agrees to
'resolve urgently the political crisis' by upholding the result of the
presidential election as well as clearing all outstanding debts to joint
venture partners, estimated at Dollars 700m (Pounds 461m).
Pengassan blames recent job losses in the energy sector on the government's
failure to fund its 60 per cent share of the joint ventures. 'Between
December and May, 3,000 members or 20 per cent of our membership have lost
their jobs due to redundancies by oil service and exploration companies.
These are engineers and technicians formerly employed in seismic testing,
drilling and maintenance services,' an official said this week.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Geneva talks will determine Korean destinies: John Burton on
a fine line between war and peace on the peninsula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether there will be war or peace on the Korean peninsula will be largely
determined by a round of high-level US-North Korean talks that begins today
in Geneva.
The US agreed to conduct the talks after North Korea promised two weeks ago
to suspend its nuclear programme if dialogue with Washington was resumed on
possible diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
The talks, in addition to the forthcoming summit on July 25-27 between the
presidents of the two Koreas, have cooled tensions on the Korean peninsula
after confrontation appeared imminent last month over Pyongyang's
unsupervised removal of plutonium-rich nuclear fuel from its reactor.
Many observers believe the outcome of the two events may soon trigger vast
regional changes. 'If North Korea is unwilling to make concessions, then we
are heading for a crisis. But if North Korea is ready to strike a deal, we
could see an acceleration of developments that may eventually lead to the
reunification of Korea,' said one western diplomat in Seoul.
The US-North Korean talks will be the main test of Pyongyang's intentions.
The outline of an agreement to resolve the nuclear dispute is already clear.
The US wants North Korea to return to full membership of the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty and accept full international nuclear inspections.
This would include checks on suspected, but undeclared, nuclear facilities,
such as two nuclear waste dumps that could provide the answer to whether
North Korea reprocessed plutonium to build at least one atomic device in
1989.
In return for North Korea's compliance, the US is offering a number of
concessions. These include gradual normalisation of diplomatic relations
beginning with the establishment of liaison offices, the lifting of the US
trade embargo against Pyongyang, and US support to replace the North's
plutonium-generating graphite reactors with safer light water ones.
Several obstacles have prevented this agreement being concluded earlier. One
problem is procedural, with the US demanding that North Korea first accept
full nuclear inspections before concessions from Washington can be
implemented. In contrast, the North has demanded a package deal with both
sides taking steps simultaneously.
Another concern is that the North may attempt to up the ante by making new
demands at the Geneva talks, including the signing of a peace treaty
formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War that would require the US to withdraw
its military forces from South Korea.
One factor complicating the American negotiating stance is that it must
co-ordinate its actions with those of South Korea. The US is mindful that it
must not make concessions that would undercut Seoul's bargaining strength at
the Pyongyang summit or weaken the defences of South Korea.
The likely US negotiating strategy will be to link the outcome of the Geneva
talks with the results of the inter-Korean summit to prevent North Korea
driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington.
But North Korea is certain to resist that strategy. It may refuse to make
concessions to Seoul at the summit and blame lack of progress at the Geneva
talks for its intransigence.
Pyongyang could also threaten to start reprocessing recently removed reactor
fuel rods, with enough plutonium to make four to six nuclear devices, if
Washington does not offer concessions by the end of August, when the spent
fuel will be ready for reprocessing.
If the US-North Korean talks founder on these diplomatic obstacles,
Washington will have little choice but to revive its suspended effort to
impose UN economic sanctions against the North and increase the preparedness
of US forces in South Korea for a possible military solution to the dispute.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Cambodia outlaws Khmer Rouge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Cambodian government will immediately ask other countries to seize Khmer
Rouge assets and extradite to Cambodia Khmer Rouge guerrillas on their
territory, it said yesterday. The move came after the national assembly
formally outlawed the Khmer Rouge organisation.
The plea for asset seizures by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, senior premier in
Cambodia's coalition government, is directed mainly at Thailand, but is
likely to be coolly received by Thai army generals. This week, Gen Wimol
Wongwanich, Thai army commander, denounced Mr Morton Abramowitz, former US
ambassador to Thailand, as a 'devil' for mentioning Thailand's links to the
Khmer Rouge in a US newspaper.
Thailand has long supported the Khmer Rouge and continues to do so by
allowing the rebels to sell rubies and timber worth tens of millions of
dollars each year from guerrilla strongholds in western Cambodia to Thai
traders. The Khmer Rouge is also believed to keep some of its financial
reserves in Thai banks.
Prince Ranariddh spoke after the national assembly in Phnom Penh passed a
law banning the Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge's extremist leaders, blamed for the deaths of 1m Cambodians
when they ruled the country between 1975 and 1978, flouted an international
peace accord for Cambodia by refusing to join UN-organised elections last
year. They have continued to fight against the elected government, but kept
up an office in Phnom Penh until last month.
Under the new law, Khmer Rouge members face prison terms of up to 30 years
for secession and fighting against the authorities, although the law
provides a six-month amnesty period for rank-and-file guerrillas to
surrender and allows King Sihanouk to grant amnesty at any time.
Cambodian officials not only blame Thailand for backing the Khmer Rouge.
They suspect Thai involvement in a failed coup d'etat last week, though the
attempt appears to have been organised by Cambodian officials who opposed
the Khmer Rouge and criticised their own government's weakness in dealing
with the rebels.
Fourteen Thais are under arrest. The Cambodian government says it has
information that nine of them are members of a 'hit squad' with expertise in
weapons, explosives and radio communications. The Thai Foreign Ministry said
yesterday the 14 were merely tourists or people looking for work.
Mr You Hockry, interior minister, said yesterday: 'They are Thai people who
got involved. That is all I can say.'
Mystery surrounds a 15th Thai suspect who escaped. He was named as Lt-Col
Adul Boonsert of the Thai police, a former member of parliament. 'He is
still on active service,' said Mr You Hockry, demanding an explanation from
the Thai government.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Britain reassesses its Bosnian peace role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is re-assessing its role in the United Nations
peacekeeping effort in Bosnia, amid fears that failure of the latest peace
plan - a territorial division of the region - could trigger a re-escalation
of the conflict.
Ministers have raised the possibility that the 3,000 British troops in
Bosnia may have to be withdrawn later this year if the plan unveiled in
Geneva this week is rejected by the warring Serbs and Moslems. The Ministry
of Defence is expected to prepare detailed contingency plans against such an
eventuality. The reassessment follows a warning to cabinet colleagues from
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that a rejection of the proposed
settlement by one of the two sides would lead to a gradual breakdown of the
present ceasefire.
A subsequent end to the UN arms embargo would also raise the threat of much
more generalised Balkans war, with the conflict spreading to neighbouring
Kosovo and Macedonia. Amid renewed tension between London and Washington, Mr
Hurd believes it may well be impossible to prevent the US from lifting the
arms embargo on the Bosnian government if the Serbs reject the latest
settlement.
Despite the recognition in London that President Bill Clinton would face
irresistible Congressional pressure to lift the ban on weapons sales, the UK
government remains convinced that such a move could provoke a massive
escalation in the conflict. It fears the resumption of arms supplies to the
Bosnian Moslems would undercut decisively the neutrality of the UN forces.
Facing the risk of attacks by the Serbs, Britain and France would have no
alternative but to withdraw.
Nevertheless, Bosnian Moslem leaders yesterday said they would endorse the
plan, presented on Wednesday in Geneva, for Bosnia's partition, despite its
drawbacks.
The go-ahead from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Mr Haris
Silajdzic, prime minister of the Moslem-Croat federation, virtually assures
that their parliament will back the proposed maps.
Mr Izetbegovic said: 'The positive element is that the state of
Bosnia-Hercegovina will be preserved.' The maps create two mini-states,
giving 51 per cent of Bosnia to the new federation and 49 per cent to the
Serbs, who now control 70 per cent.
The plan was presented by the five-nation contact group, composed of
diplomats from the US, Russia, Germany, France, and the UK. Both sides must
decide on what they call the 'last-chance' peace plan by July 19. In an
apparent shift of tactics, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
softened his criticism. He said that his assembly's vote hinged on the
constitutional plan rather than the territorial division.
Earlier he sought to rupture the fragile unity in the contact group by
denouncing the plan as an 'American dictate'. Serb leaders have exploited
international divisions in the conviction that this will silence demands to
reverse their military gains.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Eight charged inbiggest Swiss bribery scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's biggest-ever corruption scandal moved closer to resolution
this week as formal charges were laid against eight people, including a
prominent magazine publisher.
The scandal centres on Mr Raphael Huber, the canton of Zurich's former
restaurant and bar inspector, who is alleged to have taken some SFr2.4m
(Pounds 1.15m) in bribes from permit applicants over a 10-year period to
1991.
Mr Huber has been charged with 25 counts of receiving bribes and abuse of
office. Three well-known Zurich restaurateurs, Mr Rudolf Bindella, Mr Hugo
Holenstein and Mr Alfred Tschanz, have been charged with bribing him.
Mr Beat Curti, publisher of the respected weekly news magazine Weltwoche,
was also charged with bribing Mr Huber. Mr Curti, who owns a supermarket
chain, acknowledged having paid SFr110,000 to Mr Huber between 1986 and 1989
but insisted this involved legitimate payments for business advice.
Mr Emil Frei, the prosecutor, said 30 other people were under investigation.
When the story of Mr Huber's alleged large-scale bribe-taking came to light
in late 1991, it shocked a country where the honesty of public officials has
always been taken for granted. Until then, no one seemed concerned that the
cantonal regulations gave the restaurant and bar inspectors immense
discretionary power to decide whether permits should be issued. Among other
things, these regulations said that an applicant had to prove to the
inspector that there was 'a need' for the establishment.
According to Mr Frei, Mr Huber established a reign of fear in the Zurich
restaurant and bar trade during the booming 1980s. Sometimes, it is alleged,
he took payments in the form of loans. At other times, supplicants were
encouraged to buy pictures painted by his deceased father at excessive
prices.
Although he was earning only a modest salary, Mr Huber managed to maintain
two flats in Zurich and build up a 90-hectare estate in Chianti in Italy,
complete with vineyard and artificial lake.
If convicted, Mr Huber would face a sentence of up to five years in prison.
The case is expected to come to trial early next year.
Meanwhile, the cantonal government has just put into effect new regulations
governing restaurant and bar licences.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Secret EU 'openness' policy: Council of ministers keeps lid
on workings of public access rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's council of ministers is refusing to disclose
information on how it is operating its 'openness' policy, claiming this
information is covered by secrecy rules.
This latest example of the council's reluctance to deliver on EU promises to
guarantee public access to information on decision-making by the 12 member
states is nevertheless offset by a shift in policy, under which for the
first time there will be a public register of how ministers vote in the
council.
The council refusal to reveal the reasons for its decisions on requests for
information came in a written reply to Mr Peter Brown-Pappamikail, an
official of the European Socialist group, the dominant force in the new
European parliament.
Under a new code of conduct on public access to documents approved by the
council - in an effort to quell criticism of its excessive secrecy  - last
December, Mr Brown-Pappamikail sought information on the criteria being used
by the council bureaucracy to approve or deny requests.
To the end of May, only six of 27 requests for information were fully met,
the council says.
In its reply to Mr Brown-Pappamikail, released yesterday by the
Euro-Socialist group, the general secretariat of the council says: 'This is
a particularly sensitive file and the preparatory documents which it
contains are covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.'
There is growing pressure, however, for a full disclosure of how the code is
being operated, especially because it contains a discretionary clause
allowing refusal 'to protect the confidentiality' of the proceedings in
council, the only legislature in Europe which meets behind closed doors.
The Netherlands is challenging this catch-all clause in the European Court
of Justice.
Nevertheless the council is trying to respond to pressure for greater
transparency and decided on Wednesday night, however, to establish a public
record on how national ministers vote in the council on EU laws.
This followed an appeal by the Financial Times against rejection of its
request for a record on qualified majority voting (QMV) - those decisions
which do not require unanimity - by EU ministers going back to 1989.
The council turned down this appeal, claiming it 'is not in possession of
any such statistics', and that before last December 'voting in the council
was confidential'.
But the final reply by the council to the FT - which once signed by the
current German presidency of the EU will have the force of law - says that
'for the future the council intends to arrange for statistics on votes made
public . . . to be compiled and periodically published.'
Some EU diplomats argued yesterday that this step could lead to more formal
votes being taken on laws dealt with under QMV, since ministers would need
to establish where they stood, in case of questioning by their national
parliaments.
At the moment, many QMV decisions go through without a formal vote, enabling
ministers and officials to claim they were opposed to the measures.
Despite this shift, the council came under renewed attack yesterday.
Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the race for the leadership of the British
Labour party, said at a meeting in Brussels: 'It is absolutely scandalous
that important decisions are taken behind closed doors in Brussels and
barely reported to national parliaments afterwards.'
Mrs Pauline Green, the British leader of the Socialists in the European
parliament, said: 'It is absurd that even the ministers' debates on openness
are cloaked in secrecy; ministers should be made accountable for their
votes.'
Denmark, in an annex to the council reply to the FT, records its abstention
on the decision to refuse access to past QMV records.
The reason, as the Danes argued again at a meeting of EU ambassadors
yesterday, is that it wants a full ministerial debate later this month on
the inadequacies of EU information policy.
In another annex to the reply to the FT, the Dutch delegation records its
vote against the council decision. Holland says the council should collate
past votes in council and hand them over.
'By showing this willingness to the applicant, the council would have the
opportunity to take a first step in implementing the conclusions of European
council in Corfu on transparency and open governance,' the Netherlands said
in its declaration.
The Corfu summit conclusions were self-critical of the steps so far towards
open government, stating that these 'require further elaboration'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Russia loses confidence of oil majors
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western oil companies attempting to operate in Russia are now scaling back
or freezing their operations in the country and even warning of pulling out
completely - citing high taxes, restrictive export quotas, bureaucratic
delays, and in-fighting and continuing hostility from Russian production
associations to their attempts to exploit the vast resources in Siberia and
other regions.
Though there have been some encouraging agreements, western executives say
the conditions do not permit major investments.
A range of medium to large projects are now frozen or in doubt. These
include:
An agreement signed three years ago by Elf Aquitaine to explore reserves in
the Volgograd and Saratov regions. This has been stuck in negotiations
between local, regional and federal authorities - an impasse which has meant
that no exploration work has yet begun. Mr Daniel Lefebvre, the French
project manager, said: 'So far it has proved impossible to work in
accordance with legal practice. We hope that it will become clearer by the
end of the year.'
An agreement negotiated by the German company Deminex - a subsidiary of Veba
 -also to exploit reserves in the Volgograd region - is delayed because of a
lack of guarantees on investment and a fixed tax regime and 'clear
commitments to transport the product', according to Mr Fritz Wenzel, a Veba
vice-president.
A Russian-US joint venture at the Chernogorskoye field in Nizhnevartovsk, in
the Tyumen region, is now under threat because the agreed amount of oil to
be exported has not been forthcoming, and the largest part of a Dollars 84m
(Pounds 55.2m) loan put up by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation has not been
disbursed.
A senior executive connected with the project said yesterday: 'The problem
is the high tax structure and the inability of the government to enforce the
reduction of the export tax as promised.
'One arm of the government is trying to enhance tax revenues any way it can
and the other is promising reductions to get investments.'
The fields in the Tyumen region, still by far the biggest producer, are now
encountering severe problems from flooding - but the oil associations are
reluctant to invite in western companies in any other capacity than
suppliers of technical assistance.
Meetings between western European oil executives and officials of regional
associations in the town of Surgut earlier this week showed that the Russian
producers were deeply reluctant to admit there was a need for the western
companies and the executives were confused about how they might find ways to
co-operate.
Mr Victor Deshura, chief engineer of Surgutneftegas, a regional production
association, told the oil executives this week that 'our problems are not
just about investment. I don't believe companies should come in here and try
to solve our problems. The intellectual level of our own people is high
enough.'
The region has already repelled efforts by, among others, BP to set up
production projects - and seems likely to continue to do so.
At the same time, Russian production continues to fall rapidly - as wells go
out of production because of flooding or exhaustion, and none are brought in
to replace their lost output.
The Petroleum Information Agency said yesterday that production in the first
six months of the year stood at 145.5m tonnes - 85.5 per cent of last year's
level.

lawyer had presented a power of attorney on behalf of both Mr Schneider and
his wife Claudia, whose property empire collapsed when they disappeared,
leaving debts of around DM5bn. His disappearance unleashed Germany's biggest

who had crowned him the country's 'construction king'. A spokeswoman for the
prosecutor said the authorities still had no indication of the Schneiders'

France is likely to have economic growth this year which is nearer 2 per
cent than the 1.4 per cent originally forecast by the government, Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, said yesterday. In the second quarter this
year, gross domestic product would rise 1 per cent after rising 0.5 per cent
in the first-quarter, Mr Alphandery told French radio. This meant that by
the end of June, France would already have achieved its official forecast of
1.4 per cent growth this year. 'I have good reason to hope that in 1994 we
will be nearer to 2 per cent (growth) than 1.4 per cent,' he said. Several
ministers had already said that France would beat its official forecast,
made in the 1994 Finance Act, of 1.4 per cent growth this year.

Turkey's privatisation programme suffered another setback with the
constitutional court ruling late yesterday to cancel the recently passed
enabling legislation which would have allowed the government to sell
companies without having to seek parliamentary approval. The move will delay
the programme at a time when Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, is trying
to speed up the sale of state assets to bolster the balance of payments and
avoid a debt rescheduling. The court decision means that separate
legislation will have to be presented to parliament for debate in the case
of the sale of every state company. 'Practically speaking, it means the
policy is doomed,' said the deputy leading the appeal to the constitutional
court to have the law annulled. Turkey was aiming to sell Dollars 2.5bn
worth of assets this year, including companies in the oil refining and
distribution sectors, the state airline, steel concern and the state
telecommunications.

France's parliamentary inquiry into Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled
bank which lost FFr6.9bn (Pounds 820m) last year, criticises its former
head, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, for mismanagement but exonerates him from any
personal misappropriation, according to leaks of the 200-page report due to
be published on Tuesday. The parliamentary inquiry, unusual in France, has
been headed by Mr Philippe Seguin, the national assembly president, who
apparently writes in his introduction that 'political interference has not
had a decisive impact' on the bank's situation. The French treasury is
reprimanded in the report for failing to keep a closer eye on the bank's
growing liabilities, including some FFr40bn in doubtful property loans that
have been hived off into a separate state-backed company. Reaping the
consequence of its earlier inattention, the treasury is now said to be
nervous about the plan by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new head, to
declare a FFr2bn-FFr4bn loss for the first half of this year, in an attempt
to wipe the bank's slate clean as quickly as possible.

The European Commission has begun legal action against Italy over its
failure to comply with European Union legislation on television advertising.
Brussels says Italy is contravening the 'Television Without Frontiers'
directive by allowing broadcasts that last less than 45 minutes to be
interrupted by advertisements more than once. It also says Italy has failed
to ban advertisements from news, children's programmes and religious
broadcasts that last less than 30 minutes. Further, the Commission objects
to an Italian law stipulating that public authorities must reserve at least
25 per cent of their advertising budget for local private TV and radio
stations. The case could pit Brussels against Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian prime minister, whose company owns three national networks in Italy
which together control almost half the broadcasting output. The Commission
is currently considering some assurances sent to it by Italy.

IBM yesterday gave the European Commission a year's notice that it intends
to drop an undertaking it gave in 1984 to supply on request information to
some competitors enabling them to design systems compatible with IBM
equipment. The undertaking was given after Commission complaints that its
dominant position in the information technology industry was harming
competition. The voluntary undertaking included computer memory and software
practices, and resulted in the suspension of proceedings against IBM in one
of the biggest competition cases ever to come before Brussels. The
Commission will review the case next year to decide whether IBM still
occupies a dominant position. Yesterday, IBM said: 'The information
technology industry and numerous business practices have changed
dramatically since we signed this undertaking in 1984. . . . the dynamics of
the industry have made most of the undertaking's terms obsolete.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Two summits for price of one in Naples: Peter Norman,
Economics Editor, previews the G7 meeting opening tonight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world economic summit that begins in Naples tonight will be the 20th of
its kind and the first in which Russia has been accorded equal status with
the leading industrialised democracies when discussing the globe's
geopolitical problems.
While the summiteers and the world's media will be getting two summits for
the price of one, the early signs are that the leaders of the Group of Seven
countries and President Boris Yeltsin will be hard pressed to pin the
adjective 'historic' on their weekend talks in a former royal palace
overlooking the Bay of Naples.
To some extent, this is as it should be. The G7 economic summits have been
subject to a law of diminishing returns for many years. Indeed, last year in
Tokyo the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada, accompanied as always by the European Commission president, decided
to make a virtue out of necessity and make this year's summit shorter, less
scripted and more informal.
But old habits die hard. Put together eight ambitious politicians (or nine
if you count Mr Yeltsin, who will join the talks halfway through) under a
Mediterranean sun with a multinational force of journalists for nearly 48
hours and they will start playing to the gallery. This instinct was apparent
earlier this week, when President Bill Clinton conjured up a clutch of
initiatives to revive what clearly seemed a flagging agenda to White House
planners.
The improved world economic outlook has created an unusually favourable
background. But faced with a batch of topics for discussion that are worthy
rather than gripping, Mr Clinton's advisers surprised other summit nations
by saying he would propose a global data super-highway, encompassing Russia,
and a multinational review of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund. The US is also keen to inject new urgency into further liberalisation
of world trade that would build on the successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round negotiations.
Whether the meetings will be flexible enough to cope with these
late-breaking ideas remains to be seen. The reforms initiated at Tokyo
should give the summiteers the chance to take up proposals at short notice.
The Naples talks have been arranged to give leaders more time to talk
informally with only one official per delegation present.
But there is also evidence of the usual advance scripting and the
airbrushing away of awkward issues. The economic communique, to be released
tomorrow, is virtually complete and drafts reportedly contain no reference
to the weakness of the dollar on currency markets. Indeed, it has become
apparent that perhaps only Japan wants to give the matter a thorough airing.
German officials have gone out of their way to play down the significance of
the dollar's fall, suggesting that it is either a US problem or a bilateral
US-Japanese affair.
Although the finance ministers (who, like foreign ministers, attend the
meeting) can be expected to discuss financial market developments and the
rise in long-term bond rates, decisions are unlikely in the absence of
central bank governors, who do not attend.
Instead, the 'sherpas' (senior officials who prepare the summit) have primed
their masters to put their weight behind the campaign to reduce unemployment
adopted at the ministerial meeting in Paris last month of the 25 member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
More references can be expected to the need for better education and
training, openness to new technology and help for small and medium-sized
companies as ways to combat unemployment. However, it remains unclear
whether France, in particular, will allow explicit recommendations for
greater labour market flexibility, which the OECD says are essential to
reduce the 35m unemployed in the industrial world.
Proposals are well advanced for broad agreement to make safer Chernobyl-type
nuclear reactors in Ukraine and other states of the former Soviet Union. The
summiteers could come closer to agreement on that than on most other issues.
The European Union summit in Corfu offered Ecu500m (Pounds 385m) in grants
and loans from union funds to close Chernobyl and help provide Ukraine with
alternative nuclear capacity. The EU idea, being strongly promoted by
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is that other nations should contribute to
the effort so that altogether about Dollars 1.5bn is available.
However, the Naples meeting will not be able to put to rest all fears about
the former Soviet reactors. This is because Ukraine itself will be expected
to contribute to the clean-up by covering local costs and agreeing to
conditions that will make it eligible for subsidised loans from the
industrialised nations. Some difficult negotiations lie ahead to achieve
this.
Russia, by contrast, is not queueing up for large financial assistance
although it hopes to benefit from any agreement to allow the IMF to issue
some of its own reserve asset, known as the special drawing right, to member
countries. Instead, the summit is intended to give a deliberate signal that
the industrialised democracies regard Russia as a full partner in
international affairs.
Whereas previously the G7 countries and the European Commission have
discussed the global political agenda among themselves before reconstituting
as 'G7 plus one' with Russia, this year Russia will be a participant to all
geopolitical discussions.
The crises in Bosnia, North Korea, Yemen and central Africa, and the more
hopeful developments in South Africa, will be discussed on Sunday.
Naples will be a time for wheeler-dealing and contact-making. It would be
indelicate for the four EU countries present to be caught cooking up a deal
on the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president. But discreet
whisperings in the corridors cannot be ruled out.
The other leaders will also be anxious to monitor the international debut of
Japan's new prime minister, the 70-year-old Socialist Mr Tomiichi Murayama.
There is no danger that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and
summit host, will hide his light under a bushel. Naples is Mr Berlusconi's
first great opportunity to strut his stuff on the world stage.
The Italian media magnate-turned-politician can be expected to do just that
 -underlining what the other heads of state and government already know:
that summits are about domestic politics as much as about statesmanship.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Turkish current account boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's current account showed a surplus of Dollars 342m (Pounds 225m) in
April, the first sign of the effect of government austerity measures. The
current account deficit in the first quarter was reduced to Dollars 778m
compared with Dollars 1.8bn in 1993. The figures appear to support
government forecasts that the current account will be close to balanced this
year, against a record deficit of Dollars 6.3bn in 1993, following the sharp
contraction in domestic demand and the lira's devaluation. Official reserves
fell Dollars 3bn in the first quarter, as the central bank sought
unsuccessfully to prop up the lira. There was also a Dollars 1.4bn
short-term capital outflow in the period, compared with an inflow of Dollars
1.3bn in 1993, as banks closed their foreign exchange positions. Tourism
revenues were steady at Dollars 690m. Debt servicing in the first quarter -
principal and interest - rose to Dollars 2.4bn, against Dollars 1.3bn in
1993, reflecting increased foreign borrowings last year.
Orders for west German builders were up 3.8 per cent in April from a year
earlier and rose 6.2 per cent in the first four months of 1994. New housing
orders were up 18 per cent in April and 27 per cent in the first four months
of 1994.
German crude steel output rose 8.4 per cent to 20.16m tonnes in the first
half this year from a year ago.
Poland had a current account deficit of Dollars 30m in May after a surplus
of Dollars 45m in the previous month.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Japanese PM to make debut in supporting role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new Socialist prime minister, makes his debut
on the international stage at Naples, facing the world's spotlights with
little of substance to say.
Mr Murayama is aware that his Group of Seven partners will be eager for
evidence of government action to stimulate Japan's economy, and to curb the
massive trade surplus, a factor in the recent rise of the yen and decline of
the dollar.
To this end, he has gone to Naples with a promise to extend the current
year's one-off income tax rebate to future years, but with no figure in
mind. He has a deregulation package, prepared 10 days ago by the previous
government, but already criticised by the US and the European Union for
falling short of expectations.
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin should expect no more than
comradely correctness from Japan's prime minister when they meet at Naples.
Mr Murayama, who will hold a bilateral meeting with Mr Yeltsin on Sunday,
will have little choice but to maintain Japan's euphemistically named
Russian policy of 'expanding equilibrium'. In plain English, that means any
increase in bilateral Japanese economic aid will continue to be linked to
progress on their territorial dispute.
Tokyo would, as it did at last year's G7 summit, provide its share of any
multilateral aid package. But Japan's first left-wing prime minister for
nearly 50 years is unlikely to change its curious position as the only G7
country that has not yet normalised relations with a post-cold war Moscow.
Within these constraints, Japan's relations with Russia are gradually
unfreezing. Mr Yeltsin pleased the Japanese government at his summit last
autumn with the then prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, by formally
accepting for the first time that there was a territorial issue and that the
two sides should try to solve it.
On the Japanese economy, Mr Murayama will tell his G7 partners of plans to
enlarge an existing Y430,000bn (Pounds 2,738bn) public works programme,
covering the 10 years to 2000, but he will be unable to provide further
details. Finally, he will be able to point to a sharp 6.7 per cent decline
in the current account surplus in May as a sign that the troublesome gap
could be starting to shrink.
Japan will also be hoping to obtain something from the summit, yet the
chances look poor. It is keen, like France, to see exchange rates on the
agenda, though Mr Jiro Saito, the vice-finance minister - the ministry's top
bureaucrat - does not believe currencies will be the main theme.
Tokyo is worried that the US has not been more vigorous in defending the
dollar and is keen to see concerted international intervention. Here, Japan
faces the double problem of attracting US support and arguing against
Germany's belief that intervention cannot reverse the market trend.
Japanese officials are expecting US President Bill Clinton to treat his
first meeting with Mr Murayama as a diplomatic courtesy call. To officials'
relief, they do not expect him to demand concrete progress this weekend on
the long-running US-Japan trade dispute, as had seemed possible when the
Hata administration was in power. That will now be left for July 14, when
officials on both sides relaunch negotiations on market access for US cars
and car parts.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Chernobyl decision urged by France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France said yesterday the Group of Seven should decide in Naples to help
furnish Ukraine with an alternative nuclear energy supply to Chernobyl -
using Ukrainian, even Russian, equipment if western suppliers remained
hesitant because of unresolved civil liability problems.
Ms Anne Lauvergeon, the French summit 'sherpa' who has visited Ukraine to
try to work out a plan for Chernobyl, said Ukrainian and Russian companies
could do much of the work.
She was responding to a warning at an international conference this week
that western suppliers' fears about their liability for possible claims
arising from equipment supplied could undermine any decision in Naples.
Lord Marshall, a former UK nuclear industrialist who chaired the conference
on nuclear liability, organised by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, said special immunity agreements which the US
had reached with Ukraine and Russia, and which the European Union hopes to
negotiate soon, still provided inadequate cover for western nuclear
suppliers. Nor were Russia and Ukraine yet ready to follow east European
countries in signing the Vienna convention on nuclear liability, partly
because no large western countries had.
As a result, he said, western companies found it 'hard to justify to their
shareholders why they should supply nuclear equipment to the east, for not
much profit and the small possibility of a big loss'.
Ms Lauvergeon said the G7 had to convince Ukraine it was not just acting as
the mouthpiece of western anti-nuclear lobbies. It was also important to
offer Ukraine the same sort of general financial backing for its economic
reforms and political stability as had been offered Russia.
The plan, discussed in the G7 since 1992, to close Chernobyl's four
reactors, finish three other near-completed reactors elsewhere in Ukraine,
and bring them up to western safety standards would cost Dollars 1.5bn, the
Elysee official said.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Harsh words for German telecoms plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's independent monopoly commission warned yesterday that plans for
the reform and privatisation of the state telecommunications monopoly,
Deutsche Telekom, will do nothing to improve competition in the industry.
In an outspoken indictment of the bill, due to be given final approval today
in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, the anti-monopoly watchdogs
condemned it for failing to produce any benefits either for business users
or private consumers.
It accused the government and opposition, who negotiated the compromise
reform, of 'political short-sightedness' in failing to speed the pace of
competition in Germany's telecommunications market. Only thanks to the
European Union will the main area of telecommunications - voice transmission
 -be opened to free competition from 1998.
A special section of the monopoly commission's annual report is devoted to
an analysis of the reform of the telecommunications and postal services. It
concludes that the reform has maintained the monopoly situation in the
industry, distorting competition, restricting the range of services, and
keeping costs unnecessarily high.
'It is true that Germany possesses a well-functioning and modern system of
communications,' the report says. 'But as far as the range of services is
concerned, the time taken to execute contracts, for example with orders for
telephone and data-connections, and the cost of supplies, there is
substantial room for improvement.'
Precisely because telecommunications will soon achieve the same economic
importance in Germany as the motor industry, the need for competition is
urgent, it says. By postponing the opening of the market (until the EU
deadline of 1998), the reform will mean fewer jobs will be created.
The report, drawn up under the chairmanship of Professor Carl Christian von
Weizsacker, also points to serious gaps in the legislation in preparing for
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, which is supposed to begin some time in
1996. One question concerns the continuing state control over the
organisation, through a holding company set up to manage all three arms of
the old post and telecommunications services - the postal service, post bank
and the telecommunications monopoly.
The commission suggests that the federal government must consider a capital
replenishment to increase Deutsche Telekom's depressed equity ratio of
barely 20 per cent, a result of the huge capital costs of rebuilding a
telephone infrastructure in east Germany.
It suggests that the unresolved question of how to finance Deutsche
Telekom's DM36bn (Pounds 14.7bn) pensions' commitments could be an even
greater problem for the privatisation process.
Prof von Weizsacker said yesterday that, in spite of all its failings, he
would not urge the Bundesrat to reject the reform just because it was
inadequate. He called instead for the government to begin work immediately
on a further phase, to open the whole telecommunications market to
competition as urgently as possible.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Russians 'now proto-member of a new G8'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Naples summit this weekend could mark a sea-change in western views
about Russia's ability to re-emerge as a stable society with a dynamic
economy, according to the authors of a projection of Russian trends to the
year 2010.
'Russia will be participating in the Naples summit both as an object of the
G7's concern and as a proto-member of the new G8,' Mr Daniel Yergin told
bankers and oil industry executives at Lehman Brothers in London this week.
'The most important outcome is likely to be a shift in focus from the
provision of aid to the encouragement of trade and investment in Russia.'
According to this view Russia was 'no longer perceived as the Evil Empire
but the newest of the emerging markets,' he added.
Mr Thane Gustafson, co-author with Mr Yergin of Russia 2010, added that
after months travelling the country he concluded that 'big private money in
Russia is acquiring new political power, and this is the underlying factor
behind the political calm which has appeared in recent months.'
One under-appreciated factor working in Russia's favour was the way faxes
and other modern communications technology could facilitate integration into
the global economy. Other positive factors included Russia's well educated
population, vast natural resources and the force of 75 years of pent-up
demand.
But one of the most important issues still facing Russia was how to attract
back the Dollars 40bn to Dollars 50bn of flight capital which Mr Gustafson
called 'hover-capital' - poised to return, provided the Russian government
allowed a form of amnesty as advocated by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman
of the Russian central bank.
'Recent years have seen a vast transfer of wealth from the state to private
hands. Russia now has several dollar billionaires, hundreds of millionaires
and increasingly powerful banks. Most of these fabulous fortunes were
accumulated when the rouble was heavily undervalued two years ago and assets
flooded out of the country. Now the new capitalists are powerful and are
starting to look for investment opportunities in Russia. They reflect the
irreversibility of economic reform in Russia where the command economy
simply no longer exists,' Mr Gustafson said.
While capital flowed out of Russia in vast amounts, factory managers were
becoming the new owners of Russian physical assets through the mass
privatisation process. 'This means that the new owners of property, mainly
factory managers, have property but no capital. What is needed is a marriage
between the new proprietors and those who own capital now held overseas.'
Mr Gustafson said the case for an amnesty was stronger because a nearly
bankrupt government was unable to balance the budget or invest because it
was only able to levy taxes on the captive state sector and was incapable of
raising taxes from the vibrant private sector. 'The solution has to be found
through private domestic and foreign investment not the state investment
which played the key role in Soviet and Czarist times.'
Until now, however, Russia had received less than Dollars 2bn in equity
investment from the west, compared with more than Dollars 100bn that has
flowed into China. Increasing this flow would require action and new
thinking by both the government and investors, said Mr Gustafson.
As G7 leaders in Naples prepared to discuss ways of making investment and
trade more attractive, Mr Gustafson suggested to potential investors that
the way to make profits was through 'hands-on management' by executives
based in Russia and an awareness 'that the best protection is not a good
lawyer but a good partner'.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Railtrack closer to deal with union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signalling workers' dispute that has disrupted Britain's rail network
over the past four weeks is much closer to a settlement than either
Railtrack or the RMT transport union are prepared to admit in public.
Railtrack believes the glare of publicity has diverted attention from the
attractive details of its three-part productivity package which it presented
to union negotiators at the conciliation service Acas on June 27.
The package would give the signal staff on average an extra Pounds 335 in
their pay packets between now and the end of September. This would take the
form of a 6 per cent unconsolidated rise in basic rates from July 1 and an
immediate Pounds 200 lump sum for every signal worker in return for agreeing
to be paid by credit transfer.
In addition, all staff would get a 2.5 per cent annual pay rise, payable at
once.
Railtrack has calculated that the first two parts of its self-financing
efficiency package are worth more than the extra Pounds 240 signal staff
would have received by October 1 if the company had agreed to a 5.7 per cent
interim pay rise. Such an offer, designed to restore signalling staff
differentials, was discussed with the RMT in early June before the one-day
strikes began.
The company hopes that by the end of September a full restructuring deal can
be negotiated with the union that will provide most signalling staff with
rises in their basic rates of 13 to 26 per cent.
Railtrack is spelling out clearly on its telephone hotline what the total
package would be worth to each signalman. So far the staff have lost around
Pounds 260 each in pay for going on strike.
Both the company and the union accept the need for a restructuring deal and
agree on the need for a joint working party to hammer out final details by
October 1 to enable signal staff to benefit from improved pension
arrangements. After that date the pension fund will be split up and the
improvements will not be possible.
Railtrack believes it has now shaped a highly attractive package for staff
and that there is enough common ground to resolve the conflict.
Relief signalling staff have told Railtrack, however, that they need more
detail on the way they are to be compensated for the cut in earnings they
will suffer as a result of the proposed package. The company is keen to
stress that the details of the self-financing deal are open to negotiation
but not the principles behind it.
Yesterday, Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, asked Railtrack to provide
what he called 'vital information' on the package. He wants detailed figures
on the effect of the savings Railtrack would achieve over the next 15 years
and specific earnings and weekly hours required by each grade.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said yesterday after hour-long talks
with Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, that he hoped there could be a
settlement of the signalling staff dispute 'before too long'.
Although he added that his meeting at the transport department was
'routine', Mr Horton said there had been, 'among other items', a discussion
of the conflict that has closed down most of the railway network for the
past four Wednesdays.
Yesterday it was revealed in a written Commons answer that part-time board
members receive a Pounds 500 payment for each board meeting they attend in
addition to their annual Pounds 10,000 salary.

FT  08 JUL 94 / G7 cautious as US pushes for still freer trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAPLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday ran into opposition from its chief trading partners about
suggestions that they should launch a multilateral trade liberalisation
effort at this year's world economic summit in Naples.
Clinton administration officials have put forward vague proposals that the
Group of Seven countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy
and Canada, together with the European Commission - should take the
initiative to liberalise trade further, especially in the telecommunications
sector.
The idea from the US, which emphasised that the summit's agenda was still up
for negotiation, is that the G7 should build upon the successful Uruguay
Round negotiations completed earlier this year.
However, Mr Terusuke Terada, Japan's foreign ministry spokesman, yesterday
said that Japan believed priority should be given to ratifying the Uruguay
Round to ensure it takes effect as planned at the start of 1995. That point
was echoed by senior officials from the European Commission in Brussels.
As final preparations were under way for the economic summit which begins
this evening, Japan appeared to water down earlier suggestion from Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, its recently appointed socialist prime minister, that the
meeting should discuss the weakness of the dollar.
Mr Terada said the summit was not really the place to discuss such a
delicate question as currency fluctuations and this specific issue was not
on the agenda. He did not exclude the possibility that currencies might be
discussed by G7 leaders in the course of a general debate on the world
economy.
The capacity of financial market turbulence to disrupt the plans of the G7
leaders for a harmonious summit was graphically illustrated yesterday when
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, was obliged to interrupt a
press conference on the summit to deny market rumours that his economic team
was resigning. 'I can categorically deny this fact. You know these rumours
sweep the markets', Mr Berlusconi said.
He said he would seek the endorsement of fellow leaders for the creation of
an international task force to intervene in cases where human rights were
being grossly abused, such as in Rwanda.
The idea has been coolly received in pre-summit discussions. But the Italian
prime minister yesterday appeared determined to add this to an already
crowded agenda.
The summit is due tomorrow to discuss economic questions such as methods for
getting the 35m unemployed in the industrialised world back to work, and
safety measures for former Soviet nuclear power stations in the Ukraine and
other former Soviet republics.
Late tomorrow and on Sunday, the G7 leaders will be joined by Russian
president Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Berlusconi said yesterday that it was an important step forward to
include the Russian leadership in a full discussion of world issues.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Lords warn on job references: Managers encouraged to watch
their words in assessment of staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, LISA WOOD and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal scales tipped in favour of job hunters yesterday when the House of
Lords ruled that employers have a duty to take reasonable care when writing
references about former staff members.
The case opens the possibility of court actions against companies on the
grounds that they have been negligent in assessing the conduct and behaviour
of employees, so damaging their chances of gaining work with other
organisations.
Although legal experts and companies were divided about the practical impact
of the Law Lords' ruling, the case seems certain to lead to managers
thinking more deeply about the implications of the thousands of references
written every day.
One effect, however, could be to encourage the practice of giving
confidential references over the telephone, making it virtually impossible
for disgruntled employees to bring legal cases.
In yesterday's opinion, the Law Lords ruled, by a majority of four to one,
that Guardian Assurance, a subsidiary of the Guardian Royal Exchange
investment group, had not taken sufficient care when writing a reference on
Mr Graham Spring, a former insurance salesman.
The reference stated that Mr Spring had 'little or no integrity and could
not be regarded as honest'. Mr Spring claimed this was untrue and that the
reference meant he could not get another insurance job.
Mr Tony Morgan, director of the Industrial Society, a body promoting good
employment practice, said: 'A reference can affect the rest of somebody's
life, so integrity is vital. This ruling will focus employers on good
practice, which is to provide references which are fair and authentic, not
opinionated and anecdotal.'
Mr Witold Pawlak, Mr Spring's barrister, said the decision was of 'immense
importance' and 'fills a gap in the law'.
Mr Fraser Younson, vice-president of the Employment Lawyers Association,
said employers already had to be circumspect in giving references because
they owed a duty of care to the recipient company. The Law Lords had now
extended that duty to employees. The effect could be that employers adopt a
more tentative approach to references.
The judgment's most immediate impact is likely to be in the insurance
industry, which faces legal action by hundreds of former sales agents who
have lost their jobs in the past four years.
Other industries which have suffered in recent years from allegations about
damaging references include accountancy, medicine and the legal profession.
A practical difficulty in future cases, however, may be that it is often
difficult for an employee to see his or her reference, which is normally
given confidentially to potential employers.
In Mr Spring's case, it took five court legal hearings before a High Court
judge ordered GRE to hand over the reference. GRE said about Mr Spring's
reference: 'It is fair to say it should have been crafted in a different
way.'
The legal outcome for Mr Spring is still hazy since his case has to return
to the Court of Appeal for more judgments which may settle his claim for
damages, thought to amount to tens of thousands of pounds.

FT  08 JUL 94 / Benefactor digs deep to save the miners' gala
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Durham Miners' Gala, the biggest and most evocative annual working class
demonstration in Britain, has been given a new lease of life by a wealthy
businessman.
The self-made man, a New Zealander now living in Ireland, is providing
substantial financial backing for tomorrow's gala, the 110th, and has
offered to underwrite the event for the next two years. In addition to this
pledge, which may cost him more than Pounds 60,000, he has said he will
consider backing the event beyond 1996.
The mystery benefactor, who has requested anonymity but will be on the gala
platform tomorrow, is believed to be Mr Michael Watt. His Wimbledon-based
company, CSI, is one of the leading agents representing sporting
organisations selling broadcast rights to television companies. Staff at Mr
Watt's London office confirmed he was to attend the gala.
Mr Watt recently represented Rugby Union authorities when they invited
tenders for the television rights of the Five Nations tournament. He has
also represented the West Indian cricket board in Test match coverage. Mr
Watt owns several successful racehorses, including Loki, trained by Mr
Dermot Weld, one of Ireland's better-known trainers. Earlier this week, Mr
Watt sponsored two races at the Bellewstown racetrack in the Irish midlands
under the title of the Durham Miners' Gala Festival Extended Handicap. An
IPounds 5,000 prize went to each winner.
The benefactor came forward after leaders of the National Union of
Mineworkers in the north-east, faced with the sudden demise of the Durham
coalfield's remaining pits, appealed for help in staging the Pounds 20,000
gala.
The union declined yesterday to name him, saying it must respect his wish
for anonymity.
'He's an excellent bloke,' Mr Dave Hopper, general secretary of the
north-east NUM, said yesterday. 'He has a very strong commitment to working
class people. He's a committed trade unionist, he's been through the mill
and understands what workers are about. He feels the miners have had a very
raw deal.'

FT  08 JUL 94 / Archer faces probe into alleged insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Archer, the Conservative peer, is under investigation for alleged
insider dealing, the department of trade and industry confirmed last night.
The investigation centres on the takeover of Anglia Television by MAI, the
television and financial services group, earlier this year.
In a rare public statement, the DTI said that Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, appointed two inspectors last February 'to
investigate possible insider dealing transactions by certain individuals,
including Lord Archer'.
The statement said Mr Heseltine had decided to initiate the investigation
'following a report from the Stock Exchange over transactions close to the
announcement on 18 January 1994 of an agreed bid from MAI for Anglia
television group'.
Lord Archer was not available for comment last night. But he was quoted in
today's Times as saying the allegations were 'completely untrue'. He was
reported to have said: 'I did not buy any shares. I am not going to make a
statement. That sort of accusation is libellous. Thank you.'
The 54-year-old peer, formerly Mr Jeffrey Archer, is a successful novelist
and a former Tory MP. He was deputy chairman of the Conservative party when
Lady Thatcher was prime minister. He is thought likely to be offered a
position by Mr John Major in the prime minister's forthcoming ministerial
reshuffle.
He has made no secret in recent weeks of his wish to be appointed party
chairman in place of Sir Norman Fowler.
Lord Archer has also been tipped as a prospective minister for sport, with
special responsibilities for promoting Britain's National Lottery scheme.
His wife, Mary, has been a non-executive director of Anglia television since
1987.
MAI launched an agreed Pounds 292m bid for Anglia television on January 18
of this year. The bid - which sent Anglia's shares up 180p to 664p that day
 -was the third for an ITV company after the government first proposed
relaxing the rules on ITV ownership in November of last year.
The DTI said last night that its investigation was being conducted by an
accountant and a lawyer, both of whom were independent of the department. It
said that the matter was being conducted 'in accordance with normal
practices in such cases'.
According to the DTI's statement, Mr Heseltine is waiting to receive a
report into the allegations from the two investigators. The DTI added: 'When
received, the report will be considered in detail before any decisions are
made on whether any further action should be taken.'
Department of Trade officials have a long-standing practice of not
commenting on the affairs of individual companies or persons while they
remain subject to such an investigation.
However, the DTI said yesterday that it had decided to make its announcement
'in view of the statement made to the press by a company'.

John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell and member of the board of Deutsche
Bank, is used to playing in the big league. So the sight of his name as the
contact for a small deal done yesterday by P&amp;P, a computer software company,
raised a few eyebrows.
Business at Morgan Grenfell must be pretty slack when the chairman gets
involved in a deal for a company with a market capitalisation of Pounds 45m.
However, it seems that there are now two John Cravens.
How long will it be before Craven junior gets the Deutsche Bank board
minutes?

The future of the CDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.36bn) restructuring of Trizec,
the North American property group, will probably be decided by the Alberta
Court of Queen's Bench at a hearing in Calgary on July 19.
Trizec's senior debt-holders and preferred and common shareholders have
voted to accept the restructuring terms, but the junior debt-holders, owed
CDollars 310m, rejected it and were expected to take further legal action
seeking an additional CDollars 25m compensation.
'We're not fighting senior creditors and all we want is our day in court,'
said Mr Rick Orzy, their lawyer. 'We have new evidence to show that we are
being short-changed,' he added.
The senior creditors, who stand to receive CDollars 917m cash and Trizec
shares in the settlement, were expected to lodge a technical motion in court
yesterday, enabling them to seize their collateral.
'Ultimately, the court of Queen's Bench must decide on the restructuring,'
said Mr Derrick Tay, lawyer for the senior creditors. 'But there is ample
evidence already filed to show that the restructuring terms are fair.'
The senior creditors were also considering several other options, Mr Tay
added, but he declined to elaborate.
Trizec, formerly controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family,
stands to get a CDollars 1bn cash infusion from Horsham, a holding company
of Toronto financier Mr Peter Munk, and the US O'Connor Property Group.
Mr Munk would be chairman, and Horsham and O'Connor would have majority
control of the reconstituted Trizec.
The Quebec government has sold its Sidbec-Dosco Steelmaker to Ispat
Mexicana, part of the Indonesian-based Ispat steel group, for CDollars 45m
cash, the assumption of CDollars 280m debt and a commitment to inject
CDollars 30m of working capital,
The government has been trying to privatise Sidbec and early this year hired
Goldman Sachs of New York to find a buyer.
Ispat Mexicana's bid was the best of three received, the government said.
Ispat will also invest CDollars 100m in Sidbec over the next five years.
Sidbec returned to profitability in the first quarter this year with higher
North American steel prices.
In 1993 its sales were nearly CDollars 500m and it lost CDollars 98m. Steel
shipments were just over 1m tonnes.
Sidbec's plant near Montreal is modern, using the Midrex pre-reduction
system, but the adjacent rolling mills require investment.
Nova, the Canadian energy group, said a consortium led by its wholly owned
subsidiary, Novacorp International, has been named as the preferred
purchaser of a 49 per cent interest in the 1,300km Moomba-Sydney natural gas
pipeline in Australia, Reuter reports from Calgary.
Nova said Novacorp's partner in the consortium was Petroliam Nasional Berhad
of Malaysia. It said Novacorp will hold about 25 per cent of the investment,
and Petroliam will about 24 per cent; the remaining 51 per cent interest
will be held by Australian Gas Light of Sydney.
In addition the group the group said its Nova Gas Transmission unit planned
to boost spending in north east Alberta in 1994-95.
The company said the original spending plans for the region were about
CDollars 20m for the 1994-95 year. But they now expected to spend more than
CDollars 240m to accelerate deliveries from the area.
Nova said the additional spending in north-east Alberta did not represent
new capital investment, but rather an acceleration of capital spending
previously planned for 1995 and 1996.
Nova Gas has said it planned to spend CDollars 2bn on construction over the
next three years.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Building societies given chance to widen services: Boards to
be more accountable to members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies will be able to offer a wider range of services but will
also have to be more accountable to their members, under government plans
released yesterday.
Setting out the plans, which affect business loans and societies' ownership
of insurance companies, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, made
it clear that the government did not intend to relax the stringent statutory
controls which have made societies so difficult for other institutions to
take over.
'We don't want to be spoil-sports but I don't want a duckshoot of the
building societies,' he said. He added, however, that he wanted to see the
benefits of mutual ownership being passed more directly to society members,
perhaps through dividends.
A second stage to the Treasury's review of societies' legislation will
examine how to promote change in the sector, whether societies' powers could
be more systematically streamlined, and how society directors could be more
effectively held to account by members.
Yesterday's announcement includes a requirement for societies' boards to
inform their members at the next general meeting of any non-confidential
takeover offers from organisations other than societies.
This falls short of the call from some senior bankers for an end to the
power of boards to block an offer from another institution by refusing to
put it to society members for a decision.
The government's plans will also allow societies to broaden the range of
business lending they can carry out by enabling them to set up subsidiaries
to make loans which are not secured on land.
Putting this in the context of the Treasury's separate inquiry into the
funding of industry, Mr Nelson said this would provide a welcome new source
of funds for business. It would also, he added, 'introduce a new element of
competition into an area traditionally dominated by a small number of high
street banks'.
Societies will be able to wholly own general insurance companies offering a
limited range of cover related to housing - buildings and contents insurance
and mortgage payment protection. At present, there is a limit of 15 per cent
on a society's stake in a general insurance company.
As widely expected, the ceiling on the proportion of funds that societies
can raise on the wholesale money markets is to rise, from 40 per cent to 50
per cent.
The initiatives, which will begin to come into effect over the coming
months, mark the end of the first stage of the Treasury review.
In the second stage, a consultation paper will be published, probably in
September. The exercise is intended to be completed by the end of this year.
Alongside the emphasis on accountability, which could lead to reserving some
board places for members' representatives, it will also look at specific
changes to the legislation, including the pay-outs that can be made to
members of societies which come together in a traditional merger.

Mannesmann, the big German industrial group, said its management board
chairman Mr Werner Dieter was still campaigning for a post on the
supervisory board, but had withdrawn his bid to be group chairman, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt. He would not run for supervisory board chairman
until an investigation into allegations of fraud against him was over.
'Mr Dieter has informed the supervisory board that in the event of his
election to the supervisory board he would not be available as the board's
chairman as long as there is no result of the special investigation,'
Mannesmann said.
Shareholders will elect supervisory board members at the annual general
meeting tomorrow.
Landis &amp; Gyr, the electrical engineering group, said it was reorganising its
two Building Control and Energy Management product divisions into three
customer-oriented market segments, Reuter reports.
Landis said the new divisions will be known as Utilities, Commercial
Buildings and Residential Buildings.
The creation of a market segments organisation is a consequence of Landis'
strategic direction of becoming stronger oriented toward end-user markets.

FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF announces two Dasa
joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson-CSF, the French defence-based electronics company, yesterday
announced two joint ventures with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) in an attempt to
demonstrate that it had not been deflected from its expansionary course by
losses from the Credit Lyonnais bank that put it FFr2.3bn (Dollars 425m) in
the red last year.
The Thomson-CSF and Dasa joint companies are involved in 'smart' munitions
and missile propulsion. They would have a combined turnover of FFr1.9bn.
'We have not yet finished our expansion,' said Mr Alain Gomez, president,
noting that only external acquisitions during the past four years had
enabled Thomson-CSF to keep its turnover steady last year at FFr34bn.
The French government confirmed this week its decision to renew Mr Gomez's
tenure as president of Thomson SA, the group holding company, as well as of
Thomson-CSF.
Mr Gomez disclosed that he had recommended to the government that before
privatisation - which will possibly take place next year - the subsidiaries
and the holding company should be merged into a single unified group.
He said, however, that this course of action should only be taken after an
improvement in the balance sheet of Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had
already transformed its 1992 operating loss of FFr335m into an operating
profit of FFr155m last year.
Thomson SA recorded an overall net loss last year of FFr3.03bn, which was
largely due to Thomson-CSF's FFr2.3bn net loss.
As a 21.5 per cent shareholder in Credit Lyonnais, Thomson-CSF had to absorb
a proportional FFr1.48bn share of the bank's 1993 loss, and to set aside
FFr1.77bn in provisions against possible bad property loans by the bank.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Australia's opposition leader shown to be no easy game for
Keating: Alexander Downer is questioned by Nikki Tait on policies he wants
to pursue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Alexander Downer was elected leader of Australia's coalition
opposition in May, commentators wondered if Mr Paul Keating would eat him
alive.
After all, Australia's prime minister is reknowned for his verbal sniping
and relentless political assault. By contrast, the 42-year-old Mr Downer was
unfamiliar figure outside Canberra. If a popular impression existed it was
of an establishment scion, who came from one of South Australia's
blue-blooded families and was steeped in Liberal party tradition. His father
was immigration minister in the conservative Menzies government of the late
1950s; his grandfather, Sir John William Downer, was premier of South
Australia.
But, a month and a half on, perceptions are changing fast. Mr Downer has
proved adept at parrying personalised attacks which are the hallmark of
Australian politics, and is proving hard to needle.
When Mr Keating raised the 'class spectre' by attacking Mr Downer's
membership of the 'men-only' Adelaide Club, for example, the opposition
leader pointed to the prime minister's own fondness for grand living (French
Empire clocks, Sydney harbour views). When it was disclosed that Mrs Nicky
Downer, Mr Downer's British-born wife, had never sought Australian
citizenship, the opposition leader talked of women's rights.
He has given his party's standing in the opinion polls a boost. Even Mr Bob
Hawke, who unwillingly passed the prime minister's mantle to Mr Keating in
1991, reportedly told patrons of Canberra's casino last month Mr Downer
would be Australia's next leader.
But a bigger, and more serious, question still looms. Can Mr Downer can find
policies which will distinguish the opposition from the government and yet
woo Australia's change-resistant electorate? After all, the Labor party has
used a decade of power to push Australia down a measured economic reform
path, neatly cornering much of the middle ground.
In an interview, the speed with which Mr Downer bites on this question
suggests that he appreciates its sensitivity. 'Ah. That's not difficult at
all,' he declares, arms stretched along a sofa in a pose of self-confident
ease. 'The Labor party is equivocal about business, equivocal about
investment, and equivocal about industrial relations and microeconomic
reform.
'I think in areas like tax, improving the operations of tax system,
improving how our labour market works, our credentials are entirely
different from Labor's. They are simply incapable of reforming the labour
market in a way that will improve productivity in Australia and bring it up
to international standards, because of their umbilical link with the Actu
(Australian Coucil of Trade Unions). It's something we can do much more
easily.'
This may sound simplistic, but it is also astute. Mr Downer has picked on
business's two most frequently expressed complaints. Many industrialists
would agree with the opposition leader when he goes on to describe
Australia's labour market - a large part of which still depends on a
centralised system of 'awards' and arbitration - as 'out of its time zone'.
Meanwhile, the government's own industrial relations reform legislation,
passed late last year, has been unpopular, with its measures to encourage
decentralised work place bargaining more than offset - in the eyes of
industry - by enhanced workers' protections. So what, in more precise terms,
is Mr Downer going to do about it?
'In terms of the labour market, what Australia needs is much greater
flexibility through enterprise bargaining,' he says. 'Now there have to be
guarantees for workers, so they're not going to suffer declines in their
wages, but there has to be a mechanism put in place which facilitates the
negotiation of enterprise agreements, which will lead to substantial
improvements in productivity.'
Pushed a little further, he agrees the first element means some minimum wage
guarantees. But he refuses to be drawn on the latter: 'How we'll move to
enterprise agreements, we'll announce when our policy's announced.'
What about tax, then? Mr Downer's predecessor made a bad political
miscalculation when he suggested that Australia needed to shift from direct
to indirect taxation by introducing a goods and services levy (rather like
Europe's Value Added Tax). Unsurprisingly, then, his successor is treading
carefully.
'There won't be radical tax reform,' says Mr Downer. 'There'll be gradual
reform of the tax system and that will be phased over some period of time.
That does include improving the way our indirect tax system works, but not
changing its nature, just improving the way wholesale sales tax works.'
He insists that he 'wouldn't place new restrictions' on foreign investment
and adds: 'I certainly support the deregulation of international financial
markets, with Australia integrated into those markets. But as an Australian,
I'd like to feel that we had a greater capacity than we do have at present
to invest in our own businesses - and that will only happen if we can build
up household savings.'
Could that not hinder the managerial and technological transference which
tends to accompany foreign investment, and may be very valuable to
Australia? This is an inconvenient complication, and Mr Downer becomes a
little dismissive. 'Sure - all of those arguments I well understand. I'm
just saying that all other things being equal, I'd like to see Australians
investing in Australia. It's simply an emotional point.'
One point on which Mr Downer does concur with his predecessor is on the need
for Australia's Reserve Bank, the central bank, to be truly independent of
political influence. 'All of us remember Mr Keating, when he was treasurer
(finance minister), saying that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. It is
inappropriate for the Reserve Bank to be in the pocket of the treasurer.'
So just suppose the current opinion polls hold good for another two years,
and Mr Downer heads to The Lodge, what would he see Australia contributing,
in global terms, during in the latter half of the 1990s? For the first time
in a lengthy interview, Mr Downer looks a little nonplussed. But he recovers
quickly, and makes refers to 'building on the Apec process' a regional forum
which he would use to develop 'non-discriminatory but liberalising trading
arrangements' in the Asia-Pacific, playing a useful role in the area's
defence.
It is a solid, pragmatic answer - if short on imagination or higher
aspirations. It is delivered, moreover, with all the confidence of a third
generation politician. Mr Keating may have his work cut out.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Brussels clears first of three airline aid cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A big injection of government capital into TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned
carrier, will not contravene European rules on state aid provided the
airline restructures itself, the European Commission ruled yesterday.
The Commission's decision has cleared the way for the beleaguered Portuguese
airline to benefit from up to Es180bn (Dollars 1.1bn) in borrowing
guarantees and tax exemption which will finance a 'genuine' restructuring of
the company.
Yesterday's news comes as a foretaste to the much more controversial
decision on state aid to Air France to be taken at the end of this month.
The French case will be more closely examined by competitors who argue that
government assistance to the French carrier discriminates against them.
Many in the Commission believe that the end of July deadline for the
decision on Air France is too ambitious. Brussels will be exceptionally
cautious in what it demands of the French for fear that competitors, such as
British Airways, will take the case to the European Court once a decision
has been made.
The decision on TAP also raises the prospect that the Commission will find
in favour of Greek government aid to Olympic airlines, in another impending
state-aid case. The Greek aid package amounts to Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.4bn), to
be split into two parts with Ecu1.1bn absorbing Olympic's previous debts and
Ecu9m earmarked for future capital projects.
The conditions attached to the decision on TAP stipulate that the tax
exemption in favour of the airline be abolished by the end of the
restructuring period; TAP will also not be allowed to increase its European
market share; and the Portuguese government will have to submit an annual
report on the restructuring to Brussels four weeks before the date of the
aid payments.
Furthermore, TAP will not be allowed to acquire additional shareholdings in
other carriers and no more aid can now be granted. This last condition is
understood to have been insisted on by commissioners Sir Leon Brittan and Mr
Karel Van Miert.
Portugal told the Commission earlier this year of its plans to increase
TAP's capital. It said it intended to take over part of the company's debts
and guarantee loans made to the airline, as part of an overall package to
reduce its workforce and cut most of its transatlantic routes.
The Commission added yesterday that aid used to plug the deficits run up by
TAP in flying to the islands of the Azores and Madeira were compatible with
European rules. The remoteness of the islands meant the government had to
find some way of meeting its public service obligations.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (20): The hangover begins to clear - While
finance remains tight, Lord Weir sees plenty of potential in international
project business in developing countries / Guest column
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord WEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from general background conditions, the prospects for international
project business in developing countries are largely affected by three
factors. First is the availability of credit and finance. The second factor
affecting individual supplier countries is their competitiveness relative to
others. Third, is the existence of demand from credit-worthy buyers.
Finance remains tighter than in the past. The international debt crisis has
not gone away. Banks and export credit agencies still suffer from the
hangover left by that ill-judged lending binge, but time is a great healer
of hangovers.
Banks have made progress rebuilding assets, and the self-inflicted wounds to
their lending psychology will recover. Equally, as the world economy
recovers, the strain on governments' budgets reduces thus encouraging
official support for projects.
The UK should continue to be competitive. The benefits of the devaluation
when the UK left the EU have not yet been eroded by unfavourable inflation
differentials. I suspect, however, some of our relative advantage has
disappeared, as European competitors reduce export prices to maintain
workload while recession affects their domestic markets.
In considering the effects of devaluation, the apparent gross amount of
devaluation had to absorb several negative factors, before leaving any net
gain in competitiveness.
These included a rise in import costs, and the competitive gap and adverse
effect on margins, caused by over-valuation. Adding the effect of action by
competitors, referred to above, the net benefit of devaluation has been more
modest than appeared.
Nevertheless, exchange rate considerations provide no real excuse for
exporters.
On export credit terms, exporters will always want improvements. There has
been a significant reduction in premiums and, more important, there is now a
welcome recognition within the DTI, of the importance of continuing in this
direction.
Competitors in the international project business move up and down the
league table of relative advantage. The weakness of the dollar causes
problems of its own, but is hardly unfavourable for US contractors.
The French continue to enjoy enviable government support somewhat offsetting
the probable over-valuation of their currency.
Italy will become less competitive as privatisation starts to produce long
overdue financial discipline to an engineering sector, much of which is
state-owned.
For a mixture of reasons, German costs are high. The strength and resilience
of German management suggests, however, that this may be temporary.
Japan suffers from a high exchange rate. However, their contractors can
offset this by purchasing equipment overseas and they are doing just this.
Such a league table is complicated. It is easy enough to suggest positive or
negative factors affecting each country, but to set out exactly where each
competing country stands is neither easy nor, perhaps, possible.
The third main factor affecting this business is the existence of demand
from creditworthy buyers. Here, it is naturally easier to identify the
demand than to find the creditworthy buyer, when the finances of many
developing countries have been devastated by the international debt crisis.
In South America the demand is there. The existence of creditworthy buyers
is a reflection of the competence of financial and economic management in
individual countries. There is some way to go, but there are encouraging
developments:
Chile has made significant sustained progress.
Argentina - for years in the economic hospital - has largely tamed inflation
and made a positive start to structural economic reform. Its progress
provides an example to other countries of the benefits of promoting economic
reform.
The prospects for Colombia are good, supported by major natural resources.
Venezuela needs greater stability for its potential to be developed.
Brazil is as big a question as ever. Its potential for project business
remains enormous, but is unfortunately counter-balanced by economic problems
of an equal magnitude.
The possibilities in South America are certainly better than they have been
for years, but require a much more positive view from British contractors.
The developing countries in Africa remain sad cases. Most discouraging is
Nigeria whose natural resources are such that in the period since
independence, with effective government, it should have almost ceased to be
a developing country at all.
Across much of central Africa, mis-government has impoverished populations
and damaged public finances to a degree that project business is rarely
supportable except through pure aid.
There are exceptions, and in spite of considerable economic difficulties,
Zimbabwe, Ghana, the Maghreb countries, and Egypt remain areas where
international project business is possible, even if well below their needs.
By far the best prospects remain in Asia. The possibilities in China are
vast and so well-known that it is hardly necessary to describe them. The
speed with which they can be realised mainly depends on the amount of
finance that can be made available.
Sources of finance will continue to improve as China's exports increase, as
companies in China have more direct access to western capital markets, as
well-rooted economic growth encourages lenders to support projects and
increasing economic self-confidence makes the country more willing to borrow
internationally.
India also represents great potential with vast demand. The country has
benefited enormously from economic reform. Liberalisation is breaking down
the bureaucratic structure and the negative elements of protectionism and
socialist ideology which inhibited industry for so long.
The consequent growth in the economy and exports will support project
business, as will the developing stock market now providing an outlet for
domestic savings The point of no return has almost certainly passed, as far
as liberalisation is concerned, and further benefit will come from a
favourable perception of India by the international financial markets.
In the rest of Asia, prospects are favourable as Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand cross the borderline dividing developing countries from the
developed. Behind them, the Philippines and Vietnam will offer increasing
opportunities.
To sum up, therefore, the message must be that although there remain areas
of difficulty, overall prospects for project business in developing
countries are good and provided outside factors do not limit the
availability of finance, will remain so for a good time to come.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (19): ECGD support grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK exporters' confident performance in developing markets could be further
strengthened if an overhaul of the Export Credits Guarantee Department
project financing scheme seduces foreign buyers. Rules on risk-sharing and
limits on commercial risk cover are being relaxed.
For five years, the ECGD has been offering cover for so-called
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects, where exporters take on concessions
to build and operate infrastructure such as power stations and toll roads.
It has received about 100 enquiries and looked at 20 projects in detail but
only one - a Russian polyethylene plant in which the John Brown Group has a
stake - was carried out on BOT terms.
The late 1980s saw a flurry of interest in BOT financing, particularly in
booming south-east Asian markets. But this was a new game for western
exporters and for governments in the buyer countries. Many projects never
got off the ground, while others were financed through more established
means, such as traditional state-guaranteed export credits.
But with many developing nations privatising utilities, BOT is back in the
limelight. The UK is well placed to compete as its leading infrastructure
operators - in power, water, gas and telecoms - are now in the private
sector. Their experience of running such services can be combined with the
construction and engineering expertise of the traditional project
contractors.
Faced with the resurgence of interest in BOT, last year the ECGD - like many
other export credit agencies - began a review of its little-used insurance
scheme.
Until now it has only been prepared to cover commercial risks up to 60 per
cent of the value of the loan financing a project. It felt that banks and
contractor-concessionaires should be prepared to take substantial share of
the risk themselves, as a token of their own faith in the project.
Now, the ECGD has decided this risk-sharing can be incorporated in other
ways. Henceforth, it may provide full cover for loans meeting up to 85 per
cent of the cost of a project, an approach that puts BOT on equal terms with
traditional export credit. In cases where it feels obliged to accept a lower
exposure, it will still provide a full 100 per cent cover for the loans,
even if these are meeting only 70 or 80 per cent of the project cost.
It has also relaxed a previous insistence that governments in buyer
countries promise to pay indemnities if they make policy changes that affect
the viability of a BOT project (for example, by limiting charges for
electricity sold by a power station). The decision on whether to seek
compensation will now depend on the circumstances of each case.

developing country markets are producing a growing supply of big business
deals / Contract awards / Diary, FT Exporter reviews recent export contracts
and developments in UK support for its exporters and provides a calendar of
upcoming international trade fairs

UK exporters are continuing to make their mark in hotly-contested developing
country markets. Significant deals have recently been won in China, Vietnam
and Africa.
Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, underscores the strength
of opportunity for UK exporters in China. 'The Chinese economy is growing by
leaps and bounds. By the end of this century, it will be eight times bigger
than it was at the start of the '80s. This matches the best performance of
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.'
He adds: 'Our exports to China were up by nearly 40 per cent in the first
four months of this year compared with last year's performance. But there is
much more out there to be won - by Britain's small and medium-sized
companies as well as the big players.'
Indicative of recent UK export wins in the face of stiff international
competition is Taylor Woodrow International's Pounds 60m management contract
for the re-development of Kowloon station in Hong Kong in a market which the
company sees as a gateway into China - in a competitive bid involving six
other international contractors. Bruce Russell, managing director of Taylor
Woodrow International, says: 'We were competing on the strength of our
management skills and know-how, not price.'
Mr Russell describes the deal as a low-risk project representing part of the
company's strategy of breaking into the Hong Kong market. 'We have always
regarded Hong Kong as an opportunity area and a stepping stone into China,'
he says.
Two export strategies are being exploited. 'First, to enter as a
construction adviser or design and construction partner on the back of
foreign inward investments, principally in light industrial and commercial
development projects,' Mr Russell says. 'Second, self-developed and financed
BOOT (build-own-operate-transfer) projects relating to infrastructure
developments in power, water and transportation'.
Taylor Woodrow aims to conclude agreements on several additional Chinese
projects in the near future. 'The Chinese authorities are proving very
receptive to foreign participation. We are on a fast-track learning curve,
and so are they,' says Mr Russell.
Other notable successes to China in recent months include:
CAD Centre, the Cambridge-based supplier of computer-aided design systems
for the process plant and power industries, won orders worth Dollars 250,000
for the sale of process plant design software to four customers in the oil
and chemical sectors. 'We regard China and Asia as an area of great
opportunity for our products,' says managing director Bob Bishop.
APV received contracts for the supply of processing equipment to China's
manufacturing sector, including a Pounds 6m order for dry yeast processing
equipment for a large liquor producer.
Trafalgar House subsidiary Cemetics International won a Dollars 6m contract
to supply equipment and field advisory services to the Shanyang Smelter
sulphuric acid plant in Liaoning province. Cemetics has won 17 contracts to
supply equipment to sulphuric acid plants in China since the mid-1980s.
Others have registered their first successes in China. Birwelco, the
Halesowen-based specialist engineering contractor to the water, process and
waste industries, won - for a British company - a key engineering contract
in the water treatment field in China.
Working in collaboration with Yorkshire Water, which itself won a Dollars
5.5m plant and equipment supply contract, Birwelco will be involved in the
design and construction of a rapid gravity filtration plant for the Daqing
oilfield in Heilongjiang province in north-west China. The contract, signed
with the China National Technical Import Corporation in May, is part of a
Dollars 150m oilfield development project.
'China represents a completely new market for us,' says Brian Cartwright of
Birwelco. 'We secured the contract against fierce international competition
because we had the best and most economical tender. We are looking at other
market areas including Thailand and Taiwan, where there are enormous
opportunities'.
The company is working on a feasibility project for a waste-powered energy
plant in Taiwan in association with local state authorities and private
enterprise.
Elsewhere, Vietnam is unfolding as a rewarding export target. Serck Baker,
the process engineering subsidiary of Meggitt, specialising in the design
and supply of equipment to the oil and gas sector, won its second export
contract to Vietnam in June, just weeks after the delivery of its first
Vietnamese export contract.
In conjunction with Sembawang of Singapore, Serck Baker will design, project
manage, engineer and procure oil and gas production equipment for a major
Vietnamese energy production project. The multi-million dollar deal
represents Serck Baker's largest-ever export project.
'The Far East market has always been an important market for us, and
continues to be,' says Jim Dawson, director of Meggitt Energy Division. 'And
with the decline in North Sea development, this market becomes a great deal
more significant.'
Smaller companies are also demonstrating the advantages of market
diversification. Carbolite, producer of laboratory furnaces, has notched up
successes in Turkey, China and, more recently South Africa and India, with
exports accounting for more than two-thirds of its Pounds 7m annual
turnover. As part of a recent Pounds 350,000 export contract, the company
will supply a continuous hardening and tempering line for an Indian
manufacturer of cutting strip.
Norman Short, marketing director, explains: 'We look strategically at all
markets where we believe export demand is going to come in the next five
years. We are looking at Vietnam and are currently negotiating the
appointment of a locally-based and well-equipped distributor.'
Meanwhile, the defence sector, galvanised by shrinking defence budgets in
maturing markets, continues to seek new ventures in the developing world. In
late June, Radio Racal won a Pounds 7.5m contract for its Tacnet tactical
area communications network and field telephone system from a major African
customer, for use by the country's armed forces.
The deal, the result of two years' negotiations, involved competitive
demonstrations alongside French and Israeli manufacturers' equipment. 'This
particular deal was significant in that it represented a breakthrough in
ousting an incumbent competitor - a French radio company - who had been
supplying the customer for several years' says Adrian Day, managing director
of Racal Radio Group. 'They fought us hard, but our product and
cost-effectiveness proved superior.'
Earlier in June, the company won a Pounds 25m contract to supply the
Republic of Korea's navy with a new command control console. It has also
booked record export volumes into Latin America. 'This year our export order
intake is running at twice or three times the level seen over the past five
years,' says Mr Day.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (17): Providing a window on the world - Mark
Ford looks at the range of support provided by the EU to help small and
medium-sized exporters in Europe to expand their markets / Small and
medium-sized enterprises and the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
As Europe seeks to compete with an emerging generation of supranational
trading blocs the European Union has made support for small businesses one
of its top priorities. UK companies can benefit from a range of facilities.
According to a European Commission document on the subject: 'European policy
meets a need to provide Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) with a
European dimension and a 'window on the world' thus helping them to operate
less within compartmentalised national markets'. SME development is one of
Europe's highest priorities - but export strategists in small firms must
look at the range of support that can be obtained from the EU from two
perspectives. Direct support for export related activity is available but
the bulk of support for small firms searching for wider markets is through
initiatives that encourage the development of internationally competitive
personnel, products, processes and services. An SME is generally accepted to
be a business of fewer than 500 employees with fixed assets having a book
value of less than Ecu75m (Pounds 57.75m) and with not more than one third
of capital held by a larger firm. In particular policy areas, EU programmes
and facilities often favour companies which are smaller than the defined
maximum size. The importance which the EU attaches to small firms is
manifest in the existence of DGXXIII for Enterprise Policy, Distributive
Trades, Tourism and Co-operatives - the EU's directorate (the EU's
equivalent to a national government department) dedicated to SME
development. There are two main objectives within the EU's policy towards
SMEs. The first, according to the Commission, is to 'help create a
favourable administrative, regulatory, cultural and social environment
sufficiently open and simple so as not to handicap firms in terms of costs
and profitability'. The second is to provide practical assistance to new and
existing SMEs seeking to develop European and wider markets.
To meet these objectives, programmes and facilities are introduced within
six project areas for SME development:
training;
information;
exports;
establishment of firms and innovation;
inter-firm and inter-regional co-operation; and
the provision of finance to help SMEs operate in a European context.
Finance, in the form of loans and grants for SMEs, is made available most
often through intermediary national or regional representative bodies, for
training, research and development and innovation that can either directly
or indirectly help UK companies improve skills or develop products for
competing in wider markets.
Facilities which indirectly help SMEs to become more competitive in
international markets include a range of initiatives to encourage
co-operation. Financial assistance is available, for example, for projects
in which SMEs pool their resources with other small firms, with larger firms
and with universities and research institutes to develop and market
internationally competitive products, processes and services.
Information is perceived to be a leading resource for companies
investigating new export markets or who are seeking partners with whom they
can collaborate.
European Information Centres provide advice on a range of subjects relevant
to SMEs; BC-NET is the EU's computerised system which matches organisations
seeking and offering financial, commercial or technical resources.
Facilities which directly help SMEs to export to new and wider international
markets are contained within the EU's General Export Promotion Programme in
which potential export markets for SMEs are targeted where it is felt that
promotion on an EU scale would have an impact on trade development and
facilitate market access for EU businesses. Current targets include Brunei,
China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Thailand and Japan.
Still more opportunities for SMEs result from EU policies towards countries
on its southern and eastern flanks. Various agreements and EU-sponsored
initiatives encourage EU businesses, including SMEs, to bid for work in a
range of projects from infrastructure improvements to the provision of
training in the emerging democracies in the former Comecon countries and in
North Africa.
Activities promoting exports for SMEs from member states include the
provision of financial assistance for firms exhibiting in EU-sponsored
pavilions at trade fairs and technical seminars designed to promote
technological innovations emanating from European organisations. Trade
missions are organised for sectors in which EU businesses are
internationally competitive and market studies are organised to identify
public purchasing and sectoral opportunities for EU companies.
Since 1979 the EU has provided special assistance for firms looking to break
into Japanese markets. Activities funded by the Export Promotion for Japan
programme have included long-term stays, short-term visits, study trips,
sectoral market studies and commercial visits to Japan.
The programme is open to all EU firms with the potential to export to Japan,
but businessmen and engineers from SMEs are particularly encouraged to
participate as are companies seeking to export sports goods, food and drink,
analytical and measuring equipment and jewellery.
The Executive Training Programme (ETP) offers young executives from EU
member states the opportunity to acquire, through experience, knowledge of
Japanese business methods and culture. In addition to a 12-month Japanese
language course, participants attend a parallel programme of seminars and
factory visits and six months' work experience within a Japanese company.
According to John Patrick of PA Consultants, which administers the programme
for the EU, there is an increasing emphasis within the ETP on the rapidly
expanding economies of the Pacific Rim. But he is concerned that too few
candidates come from small firms. 'The problem is that perceptions about who
the programme is for are wrong - people from small firms perceive that ETP
is for large multinationals but we are very keen to attract candidates from
SMEs - especially from the manufacturing sector.'
Export strategists in UK small firms are perhaps becoming too introspective
and may be disoriented by years of relentless political rhetoric persuading
firms to export to Europe. That small exporters are not taking up
opportunities to learn about more distant markets seems to beg a question.
Why work hard on developing export strategies for a recession-hit Europe,
while ignoring facilities provided by the EU which help SMEs open the
'window on the world' and look into the flourishing markets of the Pacific
Rim?

markets targeted by the EU's General Export Promotion Programme Sarah Murray

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (16): Competition for orders is tough - The
World Bank and other agencies are a vital source of finance for projects in
developing countries, writes Alan Spence / Multilateral lending agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Project financing by the World Bank, regional institutions such as the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the EU and other multilateral agencies is big
business. International companies secured project contracts financed by the
World Bank worth Dollars 9,098m in 1992 alone. In heavily indebted
developing countries and cash-strapped regions, such as eastern Europe, the
intervention of multilateral international financial institutions (IFIs) is
often essential if a project is to go ahead.
Competition for orders can be severe. It is not unusual to find dozens of
companies pre-qualifying for the more attractive orders. The EU's Tacis
programme for the former Soviet Union received more than 200 requests to
pre-qualify for one military conversion contract.
Project cycles may be long and even having the guarantee of World Bank or EU
financing does not ensure that the contract will be trouble free. But the
rewards may be substantial. World Bank-financed orders totalling Dollars
607m went to UK exporters in 1992 and in 1993 the figure rose to Dollars
727m.
The World Bank says it finances more than 200 projects every year, leading
to the award of some 30,000 contracts. About 70 per cent of these are for
equipment and other capital goods. Contracts for dams, power networks and
other big ticket contracts make headlines, but a high proportion of
multilateral financing backs much smaller orders. According to the World
Bank typical contracts secured in early 1994 by UK companies were ASC, which
has a Dollars 12.95m order for grain handling equipment for China, and
Telspec, whose Dollars 5.99m contract is to supply loop carrier equipment to
the Slovak Republic.
In regions such as Africa, accessing multilateral-funded contracts is often
the only way to do business. 'Most of our sub-Saharan business is based on
aid,' a UK exporter says. His company employs specialist teams to monitor
aid-related business opportunities across the globe. 'Such is the range of
aid-related lending that many companies either focus on just one or several
related countries where they can build up specialist knowledge.
For SMEs and even multinationals, such approaches may not prove practical.
Support from government to help identify opportunities is available to most
exporters. The UK's Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI), for example,
provides specialist advice through its World Aid Section (WAS), which
receives some 20,000 telephone enquiries and 3,000 company visits annually.
The WAS helps to target markets and sectors for UK exporters unsure of what
is on offer. It holds the details of more than 5,000 projects on its files,
published through the DTI's Export Intelligence Service.
For a company seeking to tap multilateral financing for the first time, the
initial priority is to learn more about the multilateral's operations and
business practices.
Bidding for multilateral finance work can be a protracted process. One
exporter, who has secured a Dollars 1.6m supply deal in south-east Asia
financed by the ADB, sums up a wider view: while he is pleased with the
business, there are frustrations. 'It takes a long time for the bureaucratic
wheels to turn,' he says.
Local contacts are essential. Having identified that international financing
is available for a project - often through an advance tender notice
published by the World Bank, ADB or other agency in their own or commercial
publications - a company should seek out the relevant implementing agency.
WAS officials suggest providing the buyer with product information and
establishing contact with officials.
The World Bank's international competitive bidding (ICB) process is designed
to allow local and international companies equal opportunities to bid. ICB
sets out standard rules for bidding. These include regulations stipulating
that documents must be written in English, Spanish or French.
A margin of preference must be given to local firms. Manufactured goods with
a minimum of 20 per cent of domestic content are afforded a margin of
preference equal to the applicable customs and import tariff, or 15 per cent
of the cost, insurance and freight price of the imported goods by the
competitor.
Contracts must be awarded to the lowest evaluated bid, although this may not
be the cheapest.
WAS officials say it is crucial that firms price their bids competitively,
comply precisely with all contractual specifications and pay special
attention to security and deadline arrangements. This can prove expensive.
ICB tenders issued by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) specify security to accompany the bid of 'not less than 2 per cent of
the total bid amount in any freely convertible currency'.
Increasing flows of financing from the World Bank, EBRD, the EU's Phare and
Tacis technical assistance programmes means that eastern Europe is a
substantial area for aid-related growth. This is critical in countries where
mobilising other forms of export financing can prove highly problematic.
A pointer to the future is the EBRD's policy of signing agreements with
bilateral agencies and banks to back export-related projects. To assist
private sector buyers, the London-based bank has recently signed agreements
with the Export-Import Bank of Japan, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio
Exterior (Bancomext) and the Austrian government.
These accords give EBRD backing to export credits, insurance and guarantees
and investment-related financing - helping banks and export credit agencies
to increase their funding capacity in difficult markets.
The EBRD has also established a Dollars 10m trade facility for Macedonia,
guaranteeing designated correspondent banks of the Skopje-based Komercijalna
Banka against non-payment of unconfirmed letters of credit.
The facility is intended to increase commercial trade finance flows to a
'difficult market'. It marks the recognition that in many parts of the world
IFI support is essential if contracts of all sizes are to be signed - and
that the development finance institutions and their clients can no longer
live by prestige projects alone.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (15): Exporters find more on offer - Paul Melly
looks at the variety of cover available for both commercial risks and
so-called 'political' risks / Short-term insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for credit or political risk insurance to protect trading income
from payment losses overseas is changing. The choice of underwriters ready
to take on export risk is wider than ever, even if their appetite is limited
by a shortage of capacity in the reinsurance market.
The underwriters - licking their wounds from the Lloyd's demise and European
recession - may feel more gloomy. This, in some cases, has led to premium
rises.
But for exporters, who find difficulty obtaining bank finance without
insurance policies, a wide variety of insurers offer varied forms of cover
against commercial business risks and so-called 'political' problems such as
war, nationalisation or a shortage of hard currency in the buying country
(transfer risk).
Lloyd's has focused on political risk business since restrictions were
introduced on trade credit risks in the 1920s after a Lloyd's underwriter,
which had provided financial guarantees, experienced heavy losses.
However, in response to the worldwide trend towards privatisation which is
gradually transforming many traditional sovereign 'political' risks into
purely commercial ones, Lloyd's is gearing itself up to becoming a
significant source of trade credit risk underwriting.
Liberalisation of the European market has spawned a host of new insurers and
spurred old established ones to become more flexible and move into new
areas.
In many cases, the exporter will find several different companies are
willing to offer cover, according to Nigel Bovingdon, managing director of
the Credit Insurance Association (CIA), a leading broker.
Operators may have certain specialist niche skills. But several major
factors may influence the exporter's choice of underwriter and, conversely,
the underwriter's selection of exporters.
Is cover needed for credit risks or political risks, or both? Does the
exporter need cover for just a few selected deals or a continuing flow of
business? Does the exporter want the freedom to decide how much to sell to
customers or does he want to rely on an insurer to set maximum credit limits
on the amount of exposure he may have towards each customer abroad?
In such a complex market, it is often easier for the exporter to rely on the
advice of a broker, who will analyse his particular trading needs and shop
around to find the most suitable underwriters.
NCM Credit Insurance - before privatisation the short-term arm of the Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) - is the market leader in the UK in
terms of insured turnover and is able, along with its main UK competitor,
Trade Indemnity, to handle companies of any size.
NCM normally covers a broad package of business, written under an annual
policy and it is usually able to cover a significant amount of business in
'difficult' countries in the developing world, provided an exporter can
balance these risks with an amount of export sales to more stable and
prosperous markets in Europe, North America or south-east Asia.
NCM has underwriters specialising in particular countries, an approach that
contrasts with its main rival Trade Indemnity, where the underwriters
specialise in industry sectors and each looks after a portfolio of export
clients. A TI customer deals with the same underwriter for all aspects of
the underwriting process.
Like NCM, TI offers 'whole turnover cover', with a policy covering a spread
of business over the course of a year and it, too, offers a limits service.
It is keen to cater for large companies, though is prepared to make its
policies available to smaller clients - reducing the size of its minimum
cover to Pounds 10,000 per policy from Pounds 25,000 earlier this year.
A third operator in this vein, offering whole turnover cover and a limits
service, is Namur Assurances du Credit. This Belgian group has just been
taken over by the German insurance giant Gerling. Together, they have a
network of local underwriting offshoots that will soon cover most of the
European Union. In Britain, it is Namur that will continue to provide the
group's credit insurance service.
Namur, NCM and TI can all supplement protection against normal commercial
problems with political risk cover.
They could soon face increased competition from France's Coface, which has
expanded its operations in Britain after concentrating at first on companies
with a French connection. In France, Coface underwrites commercial risks on
a private basis, while acting on behalf of the government to cover most
political business. In the UK, it has made private political risk
arrangements so that it can offer a full service to exporters.
Germany's Hermes is also seeking to establish a significant niche in the UK
market.
The US has emerged as a valuable source of extra export insurance capacity,
through Citicorp International Trade Indemnity, American International Group
and, recently, Foreign Credit Insurance Association of America (FCIA), owned
by the Great American Insurance Company, which formerly acted as managing
underwriter for the Export-Import Bank of the US. When this association
ended, acting on behalf of Great American, FCIA began underwriting on a
private sector basis for US export business. Since last year it has been
taking on European export clients as well.
Another US-backed newcomer is TUA, which writes both whole turnover and
single risks on behalf of Reliance Insurance Company of the US.
Among UK insurers, Sun Alliance covers one-off risks and some continuous
export turnover, particularly 'key account' cover of an exporter's main
buyers. Commercial Union is a mainstream political risk underwriter, which
can provide credit insurance policies designed to cope with certain
specialist business risks.
Few private sector underwriters are able to match the medium-term cover
provided by ECGD and other national export credit agencies for exporters of
capital goods. One that does is Exporters Insurance Company, which began its
operations in 1990 and will consider risks of up to 15 years. It is a mutual
insurer, and to qualify for cover, exporters must first become members.
This is expensive, but for large exporters requiring specialist cover it can
be worthwhile, especially because EIC will often cover deals on much more
relaxed payment terms than those demanded by national export credit
agencies.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (14): Stepping into the breach - Jon Marks finds
that private insurers can facilitate exports in difficult markets where
standard cover is often unavailable / Private market export credit insurance
/ Getting Paid, the private insurance market, short-term credit insurance,
multilateral aid programmes and EU initiatives all help exporters secure
payment

It can be costly and often it is not available when it could help most. But
for companies faced with the need to secure their export orders against the
risks of a customer not paying, the private insurance market should not be
ruled out as a means of facilitating exports.
Private insurers cover political and commercial risk in difficult markets.
An attraction of private political risk cover is that - by basing its risk
assessment on the intrinsic characteristics of individual deals - it may be
used when the standard export credit agency (ECA) cover is not available.
ECAs and banks whose exposure limits and risk ratings are largely based on
perceptions of country risk, may be constrained by macro-economic or wider
political considerations. 'Unlike traditional, government-backed business,
the market brings with it commercial rules, helping to rationalise the
market,' says Louis Habib-Deloncle, head of the recently created Paris
insurer Unistrat Assurances and founder of the Paris Pool of political risk
insurers.
However, given the risks involved, private insurance may often be out of the
question outside the OECD and official cover continues to dominate.
Problems at Lloyd's and wider problems faced by global insurance markets
mean the private market's capacity to insure deals is more constrained than
it was in the 1980s. The private market is mostly short-term and can cover
contracts of up to Dollars 30-40m. For confiscation cover, deals of up to
Dollars 150m could be insured. Most deals are much smaller.
But if the deal is right, the private market may insure risks which ECAs and
banks usually avoid. This is reflected in the pattern of claims, says Kit
Brownlees, managing director of political risk brokers Investment Insurance
International (III), part of the Bain Hogg Clarkson group. The private
market has been little affected by the Russian debt crisis, which has
damaged ECAs and other creditors, because Lloyd's and other underwriters
never took up much Russia risk.
Cuba, however, was a market that most ECAs would not touch, but was open for
private insurance of state-guaranteed letters of credit (l/cs) until Havana
decided to stop making repayments in the late-1980s. Mr Brownlees believes
Cuba represents the worst loss experienced by the market. In other cases,
the private market has stepped in when ECAs have gone off-cover and banks
have mainly reached their country ceilings.
This was the case for Iran in 1992-93, when high profit margins made private
insurance a valid option. The private market had capacity because Tehran
continued to honour all its l/cs and ECAs had taken up most previous
business. Iran's subsequent debt crisis has left private insurers, as well
as the ECAs, forfaiters and other trade financiers who rushed in before it,
confronting losses.
Much private market business involves countertrade and other
commodity-related business. 'In these deals we are covering performance
risk, not country risk like an ECA would do,' Mr Brownlees says. In Zambia,
for example, ECA cover is highly constrained but private insurance is
available for the supply of equipment to Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), backing sales against payments linked to copper exports.
Working within the Lloyd's of London system, III, has the largest share of
the private political risk broking market, followed by Unistrat and American
Insurance Group (AIG). Others underwriting political risk business include
The People's Insurance Company, based in Singapore, and the Bermuda-based
Exporters Insurance Company (EIC).
AIG is developing its international reach. In France, analysts say its
excess loss policies and other products are taking growing market share.
EIC is among several newcomers to the business. 'The growth of newcomers
like EIC is providing a whole new capacity,' Mr Brownlees says. Increasing
capacity is essential if private political risk insurance is to become
relevant to more exporters. 'Customers increasingly understand how to use
the market, but they see the capacity is too small,' Mr Habib-Deloncle says.
Lloyd's problems mean that overall levels of private insurance have markedly
reduced since the 1980s. Other insurers have also found themselves
confronted with problems leading to a reorganisation in the market in recent
years.
The private sector is more of a complement than competition to ECAs,
according to Xavier Denecker, director of the French credit insurer Coface
responsible for communications.
In France a series of reforms and the introduction of new policies has
increased the flexibility of Coface which is now majority privately-owned.
'Public sector insurers must show they are working in the national interest
and keep within strict limits on country risk,' Mr Denecker says. 'Private
insurers can guarantee all operations and here is their real niche'.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (12): Trust is often the only insurance - Risk
finance and other financial products are often too costly for smaller
companies. Mark Ford finds that these companies frequently look for
alternative ways round the problem / Small businesses in the UK
</HEADLINE>

Small firms have been instrumental in the effort to boost UK exports - but
it seems that they are often financing the risks themselves.
A recent survey of UK exporters found that approximately half do not have a
foreign exchange strategy to protect the value of receivables and a similar
proportion do not use credit insurance. These findings suggest that owners
or financial decision-makers in small firms choose to ignore what appear to
be useful financial products for exporters.
However, several reasons are put forward by those who own or work with small
exporting firms to explain why these seemingly useful financial products,
promoted by banks and financial institutions, might be unpopular with small
firms.
'We have to take a calculated credit risk with overseas customers since any
more finance charges or costs would punish profits drastically,' says
Durgesh Patak, head of accounts at Birmingham-based Perfos Tooling, which
employs 25 people and exports about Pounds 1m worth of engineering
components each year.
'We feel that the banks' export services are geared more towards large
multinationals rather than the small scale engineering company which, after
all, makes the components that build the British manufacturing economy.'
Mr Patak stresses that his firm's bank generally provides an excellent
service - but, for Perfos to seek more overseas customers, financial
products at the right price must be available.
The leading clearing banks, predominant in the market for the provision of
finance for UK small firms, claim to offer an excellent range of products to
facilitate international trade.
Yet, according to the survey - which was carried out for the Institute of
Export and NCM Credit Insurance by the London-based Bank Relationship
Consultancy (BRC) - many firms still say that their bank gives them no
advice on trade finance. Staff restructuring within the clearing banks has
led to a growing number of travelling advisers in many fields, including
international trade finance. But however good the product is, if it is too
expensive - or if it is perceived to be too expensive - the customer will
not buy it.
According to Joan Rundell, an independent export consultant who works with
many small exporters in the West Midlands, export credit insurance policies
offered directly by the insurers themselves can be inappropriately
expensive. She suggests that an alternative, but still proportionately
expensive, way for small firms to finance international trade is through
products such as Barclays' Small Exports Scheme. In this scheme, firms can
obtain loan finance and take out credit insurance which is covered under the
umbrella of the bank's own credit insurance.
Fears about the length of time exporters have to wait for payment are
compounded in the case of sales to some less developed countries. Goods
invoiced in sterling might, because of currency shortages, be paid late and
in alternative currencies. Mrs Rundell cites cases of UK firms receiving
only 75 per cent of the face value of their invoice.
So what options are open to small firms who face currency, political or
credit risk? The BRC survey suggests that most firms still finance export
risks from working capital or through overdrafts which are not designed for
or well suited to this purpose.
The BRC survey finds an increasing number of UK companies are prepared to
offer foreign customers prices in their own currency instead of in sterling
 -a common reason for foreign buyers rejecting UK suppliers.
From the small firm's perspective this would seem to be a logical strategy -
if institutions are unwilling to insure a risk then it might as well be
converted into a competitive advantage by offering customers the option of
purchasing in their own currency.
A paucity of statistics on small firms' export performance makes assessing
the level of their international market penetration problematic. However,
the general feeling among small firms in the West Midlands is that
manufacturing firms, including consumer goods, producers of pottery,
jewellery and sundry giftware products, are improving their performance.
Mike Turner, overseas trade manager at Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.
suggests that chamber members - most of whom are small manufacturing firms -
have been reporting increasing exports for some time now and this year the
improvement is gathering pace.
A chamber survey revealed that, in the first quarter of this year, 33 per
cent of firms reported export orders up (30 per cent did so in December
1993), 49 per cent (41 per cent in December 1993) reported export orders the
same and, significantly, only 18 per cent (30 per cent in December 1993) of
members reported falling orders.
West Midlands firms are keen to explore new and more distant markets. 'There
is an upward trend in exports, especially in far eastern countries and
particularly south-east Asia. Japan is emerging as a potential market and
sales to the Middle East remain steady following the Gulf War,' says Mr
Turner.
'Of great interest to our members is South Africa, where we are organising a
trade mission of 23 people, and in October we will be targeting Thailand,
where we feel the market is about to take off.'
Small firms have clearly been instrumental in industry's effort to export
the UK out of recession. Moreover, it seems that they have often both
financed and taken the risks inherent in selling to overseas markets.
Even if small exporters do use financial products - which for smaller
businesses are only available from a handful of banks - these products are
most often proportionately more expensive for small than for large
exporters.
Instead of insuring against a business relationship turning sour by using
products such as credit insurance, the small exporter, it seems, is more
likely to build a sustainable business relationship with overseas customers
based on trust and good communications.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (13): Expectations confounded - In spite of its
recent strategy of overseas expansion Marzotto, the clothing and textiles
group, has experienced a severe cutback in profits. Andrew Hill talks to its
chairman / The Italian experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To get to work, Pietro Marzotto, chairman of Italy's largest clothing and
textile group, drives a large silver Lexus saloon, rather fast, through the
streets of Valdagno, the small northern Italian town where Marzotto has its
headquarters. He likes to show visitors how his family put Valdagno on the
map, and in the process built not just an international company, but a
social infrastructure of schools and sports clubs in the town.
But Mr Marzotto is less sentimental when it comes to talking about the group
itself, and figures for the past 10 years show why he cannot afford to be
anything other than ruthless in business.
In that time, he has seen Marzotto's net profits grow from L10.1bn (Pounds
4.14m) in 1984 to L50.3bn in 1989, only for recession to cut the profit back
to L10.2bn last year. The main difference between now and 1984 is that
turnover reaches nearly L2,000bn annually, compared with L400bn 10 years
ago.
The really irritating part for Mr Marzotto is that this setback has come
after a concerted strategy of expanding internationally, through acquisition
and export, and in spite of the 1992 devaluation of the lira. More galling
still for the charismatic chairman (although the whole world market for
Marzotto products was comparatively depressed in 1993) is that one of the
main reasons for the 74 per cent decline in profits was the poor performance
of the group's Italian clothing activities, particularly in classic
menswear.
Of total turnover last year, L1,205bn - nearly 62 per cent - came from sales
outside Italy. But overall Italian sales fell by 16 per cent, and in the
clothing sector by 22.7 per cent. The only element which saved Marzotto from
an even worse year was the performance of Hugo Boss, Germany's biggest
menswear designer, which recorded a 73 per cent increase in its 1993
profits. Marzotto owns nearly 64 per cent of the voting stock of the German
company.
The 1992 and 1993 results were a serious disappointment for many analysts of
the Italian market, who had expected Marzotto - as a big exporter in an
internationally competitive sector of Italian business - to lead the way for
all Italian exporters on the back of the currency devaluation.
But the international downturn confounded those expectations, particularly
in the clothing sector, which accounts for 65 per cent of group sales. As
the group points out in its 1993 report and accounts, 'in countries (such as
the US and UK) which experienced growth in GDP, consumption did not increase
notably; while in those where production slipped, the decrease in
consumption was several times greater than the reduction in income'. The
group picked out Italy, Germany, France and Spain as particularly difficult
markets in 1993.
There was at least some benefit from the lira devaluation in the group's
other sectors of cloth, threads and yarns. Thread and yarn sales outside
Italy increased by 32 per cent, more than offsetting a slight fall in
Italian turnover, and cloth sales increased by the same amount abroad,
against a decrease of 12 per cent on the home market.
Not surprisingly, the experience of 1992 and 1993 has only made Mr Marzotto
more determined to reduce the share of the Italian market in Marzotto's
results. He sees Italian sales coming down to 35 per cent of the group total
in 1994 and to 30 per cent by the end of the decade. 'Italy will remain
fundamentally firm, but the others will grow,' he says.
According to Mr Marzotto the 1992 devaluation merely returned the Italian
exporters to normal competitiveness, which had been lost during the
difficult 1988-92 period when all Italian companies were fighting to keep
costs down. Now at least there is a basis on which to start growing exports
again, and the process has already started. Mr Marzotto confirms that export
orders for 1994's winter season of clothing are up strongly, and he is even
more confident about the company's ability to increase its share of the
export market in the commodity cloth and thread sectors.
That said, Marzotto's expansion by acquisition means it is increasingly
becoming difficult to talk about 'exports', because Marzotto products are
often manufactured outside Italy. Of the group's 10,131 employees, more than
three-quarters are still in Italy, but during 1993 it was the home country
which bore the brunt of job cuts (accounting for 923 out of the 1,260 jobs
lost), and that process seems likely to continue.
In spite of his family's past philanthropy, Mr Marzotto is hard-nosed about
the group's duty to its Italian employees. 'We still have a responsibility
towards Italy, but we have to look at costs,' he says. He points out that in
the Czech republic, where Marzotto is buying a yarn manufacturer,
productivity may be lower but labour costs are a tenth of those in Italy,
while in Tunisia, where the group has another thread factory, they are 8 per
cent of Italian costs. It comes as little surprise to learn that Hugo Boss's
comparatively strong growth is partly based on a gradual move of its
remaining German factories to the east.
Does that mean that the days of the 'Made in Italy' marketing strategy -
promoting Italian products for quality and design - may be numbered? 'For
certain markets this marketing policy is still valid,' says Mr Marzotto,
'but we think it's our label which indicates quality now.'
The next two years - as its export markets emerge from recession - are
likely to provide the real answer to the question of whether Marzotto has
benefited from the lira devaluation and its heavy emphasis on expansion
abroad. Mr Marzotto is adamant that the aims of the company are now firmly
embedded in the group's management structure. 'It's a mentality more than a
structure: looking more towards the (rest of) the world. It's a mentality
which affects top management and which is affecting all the levels of the
group,' he says.
One thing is certain, and that is that Pietro Marzotto himself is not
constrained by any of the old chauvinistic concerns which kept markets and
minds closed. Asked why he chooses to drive a luxury Japanese car, rather
than a traditional Italian saloon, such as the ubiquitous Lancia, he says
simply: 'We don't make anything to compare with this.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (11): Payment guarantees a step nearer - Jon
Marks and Kevin Godier say an EBRD move to provide guarantees against
non-payment by Macedonia is an important step for exporters trying to secure
payment in difficult markets / Credit watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS and KEVIN GODIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 10m trade facility provided by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for Macedonia marks a small, but
potentially significant step forward for exporters trying to secure letter
of credit (l/c) and other payments guarantees in difficult markets.
The EBRD facility provides guarantees against the non-payment of l/cs
confirmed by four correspondent banks on the Skopje-based Komercijalna
Banka: Deutsche Bank, Swiss Bank Corporation, Turkiye Garanti Bankasi and
Citibank. L/cs are a standard trade instrument around the world, but can be
hard to secure in economies with poor credit ratings, where banks are loth
to build up even the most short-term exposure. 'The reality, based on
western risk perceptions, is that in countries like Macedonia many banks
need at least 100 per cent cash collateral for l/cs,' says David Hexter,
head of the EBRD's financial institutions group.
The EBRD, like other multilateral institutions, is not a natural alternative
supplier of export credits. Only minimal amounts of this form of financing
is available to more difficult markets - and after a period of debate over
how best to stimulate trade flows. However, the general principle of trade
facilitation allowing the EBRD to intervene in trade finance has been
accepted, Mr Hexter says.
The EBRD guarantee makes confirmation a more attractive prospect for
correspondent banks. It should help to build confidence in, and new contacts
for financial institutions such as Komercijalna Banka, whose opportunities
to develop trade are diminished by wider risk considerations. Similar
facilities could follow in Russia and Belarus.
The EBRD trade facilitation project focuses on a key problem: how to build
capacity to secure commercial deals in difficult markets. Even in countries
with more established credit ratings, there may be limited capacity to
provide the support needed to allow adequate flows of imports. It is often
necessary to shop around to find a bank which will open an l/c, or to find a
forfaiter or another specialist trade financier to facilitate a deal.
A good indicator of capacity and country risk perceptions is whether
forfaiters are prepared to provide financing. Forfaiting is a specialised
trade finance instrument. The forfaiter, usually a bank, buys the exporter's
debt at a discount, providing cash up-front and reducing the exporter's risk
to zero. To do this, the forfaiter must be attracted by the margins offered
and see repayment prospects as a 'good risk'.
Usually, the longer the maturity (repayment period) the forfaiter is
prepared to buy, the better the risk.
Banks and specialist trade finance houses, such as forfaiters, make the
following country observations:
Colombia is attractive to banks, who are increasingly prepared to confirm
l/cs of over 360 days. Forfaiters will finance deals of up to three years.
Ecuador: securing confirmation for even sight (immediate payment) l/cs is
problematic until wider debt problems are overcome, but a few market
specialists may back 180-day deals.
Venezuela: the collapse of Banco Latino in January has reinforced bankers'
caution about doing even short-term deals. These are mainly limited to the
largest five banks and the best-known corporates. Forfaiters may provide up
to one-year financing, but the market is cautious.
South-east Asia is another focus for the emerging markets boom, but trade
financiers generally tend to be more cautious than the investment community
and funding capacity may be limited.
Vietnam continues to excite exporters but banks are less enthusiastic while
payment and exchange delays of up to five months remain. An overhaul of the
banking system is under way and Standard Chartered Bank already reports
significant improvements in handling l/c business.
Laos: smaller short-term deals are possible. Barclays Bank is among those
opening Laotian Bank for Foreign Trade l/cs (up to 90 days) for consumer
goods.
Cambodian l/cs may be confirmed by specialists, with Asian banks taking a
lead, but capacity to do deals is constrained.
India continues to win praise from bankers for its economic reform and,
while l/cs (usually sight drafts of up to 180 days) remain the norm for
trade transactions, private importers are increasingly buying goods without
l/cs.
In the Middle East and North Africa, the increase in oil prices recorded in
June has come too late to improve the outlook for the most indebted
countries.
Iran continues to arrange bilateral reschedulings of l/cs and insured debt
with its leading creditors. Agreement has been reached on debt worth more
than Dollars 6bn, usually following the pattern of a ground-breaking German
rescheduling. Accords are expected soon with France and Italy.
Algeria has agreed to reschedule its Dollars 14.5bn official debt with the
Paris Club of creditor governments. This will provide an estimated Dollars
5.3bn debt relief in the year to May 1995. Substantial new funds from the
IMF, World Bank, EU and other institutions, and Ffr6bn in fresh export
credits from France are in the pipeline.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (10): Downgradings can prove fatal - While
ratings agencies are not as influential in assessing risk for trade deals as
they are in the capital markets, there are times when they are able to
influence a deal / Credit ratings / Market Studies, FT Exporter analyses
credit issues, how the small UK exporter can penetrate foreign markets and

Exporters who need to assess trade finance risks face similar problems to
potential investors in emerging markets.
Both are confronted with the need to know exactly how much should be paid
for lending to countries where political and macroeconomic considerations
have a strong influence over day-to-day commercial transactions. Both look
to landmark deals to provide a benchmark for future lending rates. Both call
on a variety of sources of information to help assess credit risk.
The leading US ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's Investor
Service, are an influential guide for investment bankers.
They and other agencies are able to influence the pricing of trade deals -
but not to the extent that their reputations in other sectors of the
financial market would suggest.
However, this could change as exporters, banks and credit insurers seek to
further refine their risk assessment techniques.
'For trade financiers, ratings agencies are a factor, but only a minor one,'
says the chief analyst of a leading London trade finance house. Generally
'bankers go by their own experience and that of other bankers in this
market', he adds.
For trade deals in eastern Europe and developing markets, many of the
countries where trade financiers operate are not yet rated by the leading
agencies. Some agencies, including IBCA, are trying to increase their
ratings of sovereign risk in order to broaden the audience for ratings
services.
There are three ways that ratings can have an effect on trade deals:
When trade-related lending is rated, through a deal being financed by a
commercial syndication. This is not all that common, but when applicable it
does set the price.
J. P. Morgan Securities in New York has arranged a Dollars 110m export
pre-financing facility to allow Altos Hornos de Mexico (AHMSA), a Mexican
steel producer, to sell steel to a German buyer, Thyssen Handelsunion.
The deal, in which Thyssen pays for its steel directly to an agent for the
borrower, allows AHMSA to refinance part of its debt and modernise
production. The loan has been syndicated in two tranches with pricing set in
relation to the NAIC 2 and BBB- rating set by one of the smaller agencies,
Duff &amp; Phelps.
When a bond rating sets a benchmark.
The appearance of newcomers, such as Slovenia, in the bond market can have
an effect as trade financiers digest their ratings when pricing deals. This
becomes most relevant when the bond is priced at a cheaper rate than that
which the trade market has set.
Among the established markets that are in line for new Standard &amp; Poors and
Moody's ratings is Pakistan. The ratings will be incorporated in banks'
wider perceptions of Pakistani risk, but they will not have a direct effect
on trade deals, according to bankers.
'Pakistan is already an established trade finance market with most banks
doing short-term - where the terms are tough,' the analyst says.
'A bond rating will only be part of a wider trend, especially as the ratings
agencies do not affect a country's BIS weighting, which could change trade
pricing,' he adds.
When a country is downgraded.
This is the time when ratings agencies can have the greatest effect on
trade, as is well demonstrated by the problems facing Turkey, a major
market.
The Turkish experience of risk downgradings by Moody's and S&amp;P has been
traumatic. The agencies first awarded investment grade ratings in 1992 as
the Turkish treasury increasingly turned to bond issues to meet its
sovereign borrowing requirements.
As early as spring 1993, S&amp;P sent out warning signals of poor economic
performance and Moody's followed in October by putting the country on
'credit-watch'. Downgradings from both agencies in mid-January then
triggered a run on foreign exchange.
Although the downgrades apply to bonds, they have contributed significantly
to a decline in market confidence. The January 1994 crisis has spread to the
rest of the economy, plunging industry into recession from boom conditions
in 1993. The lira has, since the beginning of 1994, devalued by more than 50
per cent.
Although by June stability was returning to domestic finances and an
International Monetary Fund-led stabilisation programme is now in prospect,
international confidence remains fragile.
In early June, George Dallas, head of S&amp;P's sovereign ratings group, told a
conference in Istanbul that it seemed unlikely that Turkey would be upgraded
in the short-term - even though the country's fundamentally stong economy
might restore ratings later.
Deterred by successive downgrades, the international markets have closed to
fresh lending to Turkey. This includes standard trade deals and especially
the sort of pre-export financing so favoured by Turkish banks in recent
years.
Denied fresh inflows for refinancing or roll-overs, the banks have engaged
in a race for lira liquidity in order to cover their foreign liabilities in
one of the most open foreign exchange regimes in the world.
There remains a huge demand for foreign exchange to finance trade deals. In
spite of the domestic switch to lira, demand for foreign exchange liquidity
from Turkish banks remains substantial, as one Istanbul banker puts it,
availability of credit, not the price, is the issue for instruments such as
letters of credit (l/cs). Obtaining these depends on relationships, rather
than the market.
From about 300-400 banks which participated in Turkish trade finance last
year, only a core of about 40 are still active players. Forfaiting and
factoring transactions have also dried up, as have leasing operations,
notably when burdened by long-term fixed rates.
Banks are wary about taking on new Turkish risk. In some cases they are
still attracted to the country's longer term potential - as was signalled
when in late June the treasury negotiated what was seen as a competitive
rate in the circumstances for a six-year Euroloan, valued at DM 400-450m for
the Cayhiran thermal power station.
'Turkey is a big economy and some deals may continue to go ahead,' says a
European banker with a large portfolio of Turkish trade paper. 'But we have
stopped: we pulled back when we saw what Standard &amp; Poors was saying.'
The ratings agencies may be less influential in trade deals than in other
markets. But when it comes to downgrades, their influence can be telling on
the business environment.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (9): In pursuit of the client's interests -
David Dodwell finds out how the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's
data-base benefits the territory's small operators / The HKTDC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From a desk-top computer in his tiny office in Hong Kong's teeming Mong Kok,
John Williams dials down his modem line to the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council's trade data-base, TDC-Link. His company makes highly sophisticated
car burglar alarms, and he wants to check on new export opportunities.
Within three minutes, he has a list on his office printer of 32 companies
spread across Europe, the US, Japan and south-east Asia that in the past two
months have inquired about buying car burglar alarms. The list not only has
company names, addresses and telephone and fax numbers, but also the names
of purchasing managers.
'It certainly beats cold-selling,' says Mr Williams. The software package to
hook him up to the TDC computer cost just HKDollars 300 (Pounds 25).
TDC-Link, in operation since 1991, is one of a number of services provided
by Hong Kong's TDC to reduce the barriers and risks many small companies
experience when they come face-to-face with the challenges of exporting. In
a territory made up almost entirely of small companies, this is a priority.
It is one of a number of services that trade promoters in other parts of the
world would do well to take note of - in particular in countries such as the
US, the UK, Germany and France, where governments acknowledge that 'big
industry' accounts for too large a share of international trade, but confess
to immense problems in drawing small companies into cross-border commerce.
TDC-Link is underpinned by a vast computer data-base built up by the TDC
over a decade. It carries details of 57,000 Hong Kong companies and records
of 250,000 buyers or suppliers worldwide.
In addition, its data-base of companies across mainland China grew last year
from 60,000 to more than 110,000. The TDC's 51 offices worldwide are feeding
trade inquiries into the data-base at a rate of 13,000 a month.
Apart from raw trade inquiry information, TDC-Link carries market and
product or sector reports prepared by its own research staff, a news
data-base, a global directory of brand names, import regulations, quota
prices, shipping schedules, and even real-time exchange-rate and stock
market information.
For Hong Kong companies without computers, or lacking modem access, the TDC
operates five Data-shops across the city-state which provide one-stop-shop
access to the same range of information.
So far, the service is available only to Hong Kong-based companies, but that
does not mean foreign companies are completely shut out: a TDC Phone-Fax
service, set up in April 1992, takes trade inquiries by telephone from
anywhere in the world, and aims to supply the information required by fax
within 30 minutes. The TDC's four Phone-Fax operators handled 47,000
inquiries last year.
It is moot why trade promotion agencies in countries such as the UK and the
US have failed so far to establish similar services. The answer must in part
be that exporting has not until recently become the focus of high-level
government priority.
But it must also partly be due to the fact that in most countries, trade
promotion - or rather, export promotion rather than trade promotion, since
few share Hong Kong's recognition that most companies have to import in
order to export - is the responsibility of a government department, subject
to civil service rules, and perhaps most important of all, subject to
treasury spending restraints.
The Hong Kong government broke this link in 1966 when it set up the TDC as
an independent trade promotion body funded not out of taxes, but by a tiny
levy on imports and exports.
The decision gave the TDC financial independence and - as the territory's
trade has grown - unimagined affluence to pursue the interests of its
clientele: Hong Kong's traders.
The levy first set in 1966 was for 0.05 per cent on all imports and exports
 -a sum that industry as well as government regarded as a modest enough tax
on trade to be acceptable.
By 1986, following the hectic emergence of Hong Kong's role as entrepot for
trade between China and the outside world, the TDC was facing embarrassing
affluence. The response was to trim the levy to exclude re-exports.
As Hong Kong's trade has continued to grow strongly - to a point where in
1993, the territory had become the world's eighth most important trading
power - the time came early this year to cut the levy afresh, particularly
in view of a trend in recent years to charge for services, even though in
many circumstances this was at a subsidised rate. The levy now stands at
0.035 per cent on all direct imports and exports.
'The levy on trade has served us well,' says one Hong Kong trader. 'It is a
puzzle why chambers of commerce and trade organisations in other countries
have not taken a similar route.'

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (7): Overseas markets remain crucial - In spite
of a recovery on home ground, Andrew Baxter finds that the proportion of
sales going abroad must remain high if manufacturers are to maintain their
pole position in the industry / UK construction equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is one of Europe's most important centres for the manufacture of
construction equipment, and exports have been a vital element in achieving
and maintaining that position.
Whether British or foreign-owned, equipment manufacturers usually export
50-80 per cent of their products, although the percentage varies depending
on the companies, the product lines and the state of the UK market.
The traditional boom-and-bust cycle in the UK construction industry means
that in a recession as deep and long as the most recent one, the percentage
of sales going to the home market will inevitably fall. The importance of
strong positions in as many export markets as possible cannot, therefore, be
overstated.
With domestic market conditions recovering strongly from the trough of
recession, and some continental markets still flat, the proportion of sales
going to export markets could fall back for some companies - but not by
much.
This is because of the strength of markets such as the US - which recovered
from recession a year earlier than the UK - and continuing growth in
markets, such as those in south-east Asia, which have been immune to
recession.
Statistics from the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group's off-highway
research division emphasise the importance of exports - whatever the
conditions in the home market.
Last year, it says, 16,070 backhoe loaders were produced in the UK. Of these
just 2,667 were sold in the domestic market. As for mini-excavators, UK
factories produced 2,954, of which 643 were sold in the UK. In the smaller,
more specialist category of asphalt finishers for roadmaking, just 25 of the
220 units produced in the UK were also sold there.
The effects of the UK construction industry recession are illustrated by
statistics for rough-terrain lift trucks. In 1991, just 850 of the 3,250
UK-produced units were sold in the UK. Two years later, 2,103 of the 3,795
units manufactured in the UK went to the domestic market.
At J. C. Bamford, the largest UK-owned construction equipment producer,
overseas sales have hovered between Pounds 233.5m and Pounds 271.9m in the
past five years. UK sales, meanwhile, have been much more volatile, ranging
between Pounds 149.4m and Pounds 78.8m over the same period.
JCB's direct exports were up nearly 40 per cent in the first five months of
this year, compared with the same period of 1993. Exports to North America
have more than doubled, while those to continental Europe  - viewed by JCB
as its 'home market' - rose by 25 per cent as markets emerged from
recession.
A long-term growth prospect for JCB, meanwhile, is the Asia Pacific region,
which accounts for 6 per cent of exports. Sales in the first five months
soared by 64 per cent.
At Fermec, the Manchester-based producer better known by its MF Industrial
brand, exports represent more than 80 per cent of its business. In the first
five months of this year, exports to North America have risen more than 400
per cent while sales to the rest of the world beyond Europe - mainly
Australia, Thailand and Israel - have more than doubled. Fermec attributes
the success to its new range of backhoe loaders and, in North America, to a
new supply agreement with Kobelco America, the Japanese-owned distribution
company.
Foreign-owned producers are also heavy exporters from their UK plants.
Caterpillar UK, the British part of the world's biggest construction
equipment producer, had sales of Pounds 235.4m in the period from December
1992 to November 1993. Of this, Pounds 28.8m derived from the UK, Pounds
66.2m from continental Europe, Pounds 89.2m from the US and Pounds 51.2m
from elsewhere.
Komatsu, the world's second biggest producer, has its European factory for
hydraulic excavators at Birtley near Newcastle. Of nearly 1,200 units
produced last year, 272 went to the UK market, but that was dwarfed by the
615 units which went to Germany.
Further north, the Scottish contribution to the exports picture should not
be ignored. Lanarkshire-based Atlas Hydraulic Loaders says that more than 52
per cent of its 1993 sales were exports, the bulk going to the continent and
Germany in particular.
Excluding exceptional sales to eastern Germany in the first six months of
last year, this year's exports by Atlas, part of Germany's Atlas Weyhausen,
are ahead of 1993's.
Exports to France are up 220 per cent, to the Netherlands up 50 per cent, to
Australia up 50 per cent and to Chile up 67 per cent. Exports to the Gulf
states have fallen considerably, but this is not an important market for
Atlas.
At Terex in Motherwell, at least 70 per cent of the dumptrucks, loaders,
scrapers and other plant made by the US-owned company is exported. The
plant, which was once at the periphery of Terex, is now its global centre
for construction equipment.
A supply agreement with O&amp;K in Germany accounts for a significant part of
exports, but China is probably the plant's biggest market - because of
equipment that is shipped complete and broken down kits which are supplied
to a joint venture in China that assembles one of the Terex rigid dumptruck
models.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (8): Sector yet to recover from the crisis - The
industry, which suffered more than most from the effects of recession, has
still a long way to go in rebuilding its competitiveness in export markets
/ German machine tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German machine tool industry has long prided itself on its powerful
presence in export markets, claiming a 27 per cent share of world trade.
Even during the now-fading recession, it boasted that it was gaining share
at the expense of the Japanese who were labouring under a high yen and
relatively high dependence on their weak domestic market.
But the gains came at the cost of evaporating profits and a slump in
production which dragged output last year to half its record 1989 level.
The machine tool business was the first part of the German engineering
industry to plunge into recession. The blows rained hard and fast, starting
in 1990. Much of the rest of the sector was enjoying the fruits of the
German unification boom, shipping cars, consumer durables and building
machinery equipment. But east German demand for machine tools failed to
materialise as the region's industry crumbled.
Meanwhile, recession and political and economic turmoil struck the sector's
main export markets elsewhere in Europe. German machine tool makers have
traditionally exported a good 60 per cent of their output, maintaining a 20
per cent share of world markets. Some 70 per cent of all foreign sales go
elsewhere in Europe (17 per cent to the former east bloc), and only 10 per
cent each to the US and south-east Asia.
This dependence on Europe was arguably the worst structural problem exposed
by the economic turmoil. The VWD manufacturers association pointed out last
year that the industry was most strongly established in the slowest-growing
markets. Its products were too expensive and failed to meet market needs.
Without counter-measures, it said, German volume output would fall to 50 per
cent of that in Japan by the end of the decade.
Much management energy has been expended on regaining cost-competitiveness.
The main methods have been reductions in staff and vertical integration.
Schutte, a typical medium-sized private company, for example, has halved its
workforce to about 660. Pittler, one of the bigger concerns, claims its new
policy of buying certain components from low-cost east European suppliers,
has reduced overall materials costs by 20 per cent.
Inventive, customer-specific technologies and software - increasingly
developed in partnership with the end-user - have helped German
manufacturers compensate partially for the losses in the market for
mass-produced standard machines which is falling increasingly under Asian
control.
But convincing ways have yet to be found for the industry to establish
itself firmly in fast-growing Asian markets. Some observers believe the
industry should accept that opportunities are limited and concentrate on
specialist niches and the 'home' European market.
They argue that 'local' suppliers in Asia are already firmly settled, and
that the risks and the costs of establishing plant or even distribution and
service networks are too high for most German companies in the sector. Many
are small or medium-sized, highly-specialised enterprises with only modest
volumes. They are often privately-owned, and their finances have been
weakened by the recent crisis.
Suggestions that they may gain critical mass through merger or takeover have
been met with a resistance peculiar to Germany's fiercely independent
entrepreneurial Mittelstand. Indeed, the board of the only significant
recent merger - between Deckel and Maho - filed for protection from their
creditors within a year of the deal's conclusion.
However, not everything has been lost. The joint distribution and service
network between Deckel and Maho, which was seen as one of the main sources
of synergies, has been taken over by Gildemeister, which is in turn
interested in building a reciprocal sales/service relationship with
Cincinnati Milacron of the US.
Even wider synergies are apparently being sought within a holding group,
Autania, which last year came under the control of the publicly-owned
WestDeutsche Landesbank. Autania, which claims to be Europe's biggest
machine tools 'group', has stakes in about 20 different companies. It was
built up by the Rothenberger family as an investment vehicle, but WestLB has
grander plans. On taking control, the bank announced the individual stakes
were to be increased, and Autania was to be transformed into a 'world market
alliance'.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (6): The move towards global purchasing - Kevin
Done looks at the way Ford's CDW-27 project is showing how many of the
company's planned reforms can be implemented / Global sourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This autumn Ford, the world's second largest carmaker is launching the US
versions of its so-called CDW-27 world car programme, a Dollars 6bn project
that has helped to lay the foundations for one of the most radical
organisational shake-ups in the US car maker's 91-year history.
The programme has already spawned the Ford Mondeo large family car, which
was launched in Europe in spring last year, and Ford is preparing to put the
sister cars, the Ford Contour and the Mercury Mystique, on sale in north
America.
The CDW-27 project has convinced the company that it is possible to design,
develop and engineer a car in one region - in this case Europe  - for
manufacture in at least two regions - north America and Europe - for sale
around the globe. It has given Ford the confidence to develop a bold
strategy for restructuring its entire automotive operations - including the
way that it deals with its components suppliers around the world.
It is merging its European and north American operations into a single
operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations, with effect from next January.
It is setting up five so-called global vehicle centres, one in Europe and
four in the US, to break down the group's regional barriers. Each centre
will have worldwide responsibility for the design, development and
engineering of particular vehicle ranges.
The CDW-27 project, Ford's first successful world car programme, has
prepared the way for the reorganisation and brought Ford for the first time
to the global purchasing of components and systems.
Ford maintains that this will provide 'economies of scale, world-class
supplier productivity and cost levels, improved quality, faster time to
market, better product innovation and enhanced supplier design involvement
and support.' It will also mean that it will be able to choose the best
products to be offered worldwide in any particular category.
The CDW-27 project is showing how many of the planned reforms can be
implemented. Versions of the Mondeo/Contour/Mystique will be assembled at
Ford plants at Genk, Belgium, at Kansas City in the US and at Cuautitlan,
Mexico. For the Mondeo programme alone Ford is spending Dollars 2.5bn a year
on components bought from outside suppliers.
According to Albert Caspers, Ford's new chairman for Europe, global
purchasing means that the share taken by north American suppliers has jumped
to 15 per cent for the European-built Mondeo compared with a share of only
1-2 per cent in Ford of Europe's traditional car programmes. 'We have also
brought many European suppliers to north America and some have made joint
ventures in the US,' he says. 'The philosophy was to develop a part only
once from one supplier for the world. This is the first project where we
have done this.'
Ford estimates that about Dollars 140m worth of components will be exported
annually to north America from Europe with about Dollars 260m worth of
components coming from north America to Europe as part of the Mondeo
programme.
The development of an integrated, global supply base has resulted in a
drastic reduction in the number of suppliers. The current US-built Ford
Tempo/Mercury Topaz range has more than 700 suppliers - all in North America
 -whereas the successor Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique models will have only
227 suppliers, drawn from around the world.
Kerry Caliman, CDW-27 project manager for purchasing for Ford's north
American automotive operations, says: 'the more business you can source
globally, using the same supplier for the same part for both North America
and Europe, the more you'll benefit from economies of scale and focused
quality control efforts'.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (5): Focus of trade constraints shifts - While
the demise of Comecon has led to an easing of controls, Alan Spence finds
that they have not disappeared altogether / High tech exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of high technology equipment to sensitive destinations has become
easier since the collapse of communism, but strict controls remain. The
Paris-based organisation Co-com - the co-ordinating committee on
multilateral export controls - went into voluntary retirement on March 30
this year after 47 years of curbing western military and high technology
exports to communist countries.
Members, comprising all the NATO allies except for Iceland, and including
Australia and Japan, will retain the current slate of banned items, although
enforcement will rely on national discretion.
The political and economic liberalisation within former Comecon countries
has reduced the western governments' need to control the sale to the region
of 'dual-use' technology - goods capable of, but not specially designed for,
military purposes.
But the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
does not mean that all restraints have disappeared. The focus of residual
controls has shifted to developing countries, especially, for example, North
Korea and Iran.
Reductions in trade constraints are reflected in the diminishing volumes of
export licences issued by the UK's Export Control Organisation (ECO), a unit
within the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). About 21,000 licences
were approved by ECO in 1993, compared to about 100,000 in 1988. And the ECO
estimates provisioning of about 18,000-19,000 licences for 1994.
Cocom's final year was marked by the easing of restrictions, especially for
exporters of telecommunications equipment, computers and precision machine
tools. UK computer manufacturer ICL reports Pounds 60m worth of business in
eastern Europe for 1993, a figure 'substantially up from the previous year',
says a company spokesperson.
Cocom began to reduce a long list of proscribed items in 1990, while also
removing fast-reforming countries such as Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia
from sensitive destination categories.
On the day of Cocom's demise, the US Commerce Department removed licensing
requirements on almost all low level telecommunications equipment and
computers to every ex-communist nation except North Korea.
Constraints on UK exporters were further relaxed in May with an amendment to
the 1992 Export of Goods (Control) Order (EGCO). 'I expect a one-third
reduction in the number of licence applications for industrial goods alone,'
said Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister in response to the amendment.
ECO annual licensing for industrial 'dual-use' exports has fallen from about
60,000 in the late 1980s to below 10,000 at present. Exports of weapons of
mass destruction (WMDs) and associated components are still covered by three
principal non-proliferation controls: the 1968 Nuclear non-Proliferation
Treaty; the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime; and the Australia Group,
which deals with chemical and biological warfare weaponry and components.
Under UK legislation passed in 1939 and amended in 1990, the legal onus lies
with the exporter to apply for a licence, when selling military equipment
and sophisticated dual-use technology overseas. Few cases are refused in
practice. Last year 300 applications were turned down. Successful UK
applications for military export licences average 12,000 per year, although
the May amendments to EGCO have increased restraints upon sales of armoured
vehicles, military components. digital controllers and testing equipment.
The growth area in control is developing countries where 41 destinations are
now subject to special licensing procedures.
Sanctions agreed by the UN Security Council include arms embargoes to
Somalia and Liberia, and complete embargoes upon trade with Iraq, Haiti and
Serbia-Montenegro. Certain goods are additionally prohibited from Libya and
Angola.
UK compliance procedures were upgraded in 1990 after difficulties with
Libyan exports. An 'end-use', or 'catch-all' control was introduced, forcing
would-be exporters to make reasonable enquiries to allay any suspicions
regarding use or destination.
This has been consolidated through the launch in March of the Export
Training Initiative - a package of materials for companies to promote
organisational awareness - and the publication of a Code of Practice for
Enforcement.
More than 200 annual compliance visits are made by ECO to UK companies to
reinforce the licensing process. These are mainly to companies with Open
Individual Export Licences which cover individual exporters for regular
shipments over two and three years to specified destinations.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (4): Attempting to take on the west - Helen
Mingay examines the way the emphasis on pre-war excellence is having marked
success in attracting international business / Czech manufacturers /
Strategy, industrial reform, global sourcing of car components and
technology transfer arrangements demand a variety of approaches to exporting
</HEADLINE>

Czech companies are entering the modern world of marketing by reverting to
their pre-communist past.
The Sellier Bellot Munitions Company, which has reverted to its pre-war
name, is advertising for a foreign partner, while the country's most popular
beer, Staropramen, is relying on its 1842 pedigree and name, which roughly
translated means 'from the ancient well'.
As British beer drinkers adopt continental lager drinking habits, Bass is
expecting its Czech connection will bring in the punters. Bass Breweries has
bought a 34 per cent stake in Prague Breweries and the company plans to
introduce Staropramen to the British market next year. The beer is already
selling in Sweden and Germany.
Prague Breweries is the first leading Czech brewer to bring in an
international partner, although other Czech brands are already making an
impact on the western markets. Last year Germany alone imported half a
million hectolitres of Czech lager. Guinness won the contract to market the
Pilsner Urquell beer in the US and UK, while Sainsbury has a contract to
brew its 'own brand' with a Czech brewery.
The strategy of stressing a reversion to pre-war quality seems to be having
some success. Like other central European countries of Hungary and Poland,
the Czech Republic has registered a remarkable increase in exports to the
west, a process which began immediately after the velvet revolution and was
intensified by the mass privatisation programme.
The division of Czechoslovakia, formally enacted on 1 January last year,
slowed the march of Czech exports, as many companies were forced to
restructure their production, causing interruptions to supplies for western
markets.
Western importers now report that this period of dislocation is well behind
them and that supplies are coming in smoothly.
With the demise of communism, the larger Czech companies tended to recruit
officials from the communist foreign trade companies, which had been
responsible for exports. Other officials set up export/import companies and
agencies.
The large headline deals such as those involving car manufacturer Skoda and
in the beer industry only form part of the picture.
The Czech republic has always exported a wide range of engineering products,
and has a reputation for excellence in specialised items such as hunting
guns and gliders.
Many of these smaller companies also continued marketing through their well
established agencies in the west, with little change from the communist era.
In the UK, for example, the Vitrea company continues to market Czech
glassware, while the Exico company continues to deal in shoes, toys and
leather goods and electric motors.
'We still have the majority of Slovak factories, as well as Czech products,'
says M. Sebek, managing director of Exico. 'There has been little change
from our point of view since the communist era,' he adds.
However, Exico's sales and marketing operations are now in the hands of a
western partner. Many other companies, such as the Sellier Bellot Munitions
Company, can be found advertising for a foreign partner which would be
likely to take over export sales.
Volkswagen's investment in Skoda has led to a fully-fledged advertising
campaign in the west. The campaign aims at a rehabilitation of the car to
release it from its former communist image and a revamping of the marketing
effort in separate companies under the VW wing.
Sales to the UK are showing a constant improvement, registering a 177 per
cent growth at 5,000 cars sold, compared to the first five months of last
year.
A company spokesman admits that these figures are inflated, however, as
deliveries were interrupted last year as the Czech factory adapted to new
conditions prevailing following the division of Czechoslovakia.
The sales effort concentrates attention on the benefits of 'a lot of car for
your money', adding somewhat less complimentarily that 550 improvements have
been made to the model since the VW investment.
The marketing strategy has had to find a delicate balance between the
relatively cheap price of the models and the fact that Skoda is now a car
matching up to contemporary standards.
'It is not bristling with the latest technology, but it is a fairly modern
car,' says John Edwards of Skoda Automobile UK.
'Historically, the Skoda has been compared to the Lada from Russia. We do
not like to be compared with the Lada as now they are two very different
cars,' he adds.
The price advantage, primarily generated by low wages, will continue to be
the best selling point for the Czechs. But the remarkable reorientation of
exports to the west in such a short space of time vindicates their emphasis
on pre-war excellence.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (3): A platform for policy - While it is not a
trade policeman, Jon Marks finds that the Paris-based organisation is able
to exert considerable influence over the way exporters do business / The
OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade makes rules regulating global
trade. The European Commission intervenes to remove distortions to trade
within the EU's single market. The IMF and other Bretton Woods institutions
provide economic policy frameworks and financing flows. But in the universe
inhabited by multilateral institutions the role of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development is less clear.
Since its foundation in 1960, the Paris-based organisation has provided a
talking shop and platform for industrialised nations to recommend policy
measures for enactment by its 25 member states. The OECD's powers to enforce
policy are much weaker than those of other multilaterals. 'Members agree to
play by the rules, but it does not mean becoming a trade policeman,' an
official in Paris says.
Even so, the OECD may still exert considerable influence over the way that
exporters do business - and in some cases it may intervene directly in a
deal. To promote a 'level playing field' in international trade, the OECD
has taken a lead in curbing the use of subsidies and controlling the use of
export credits, which it regulates through the consensus rate.
It has sought to influence policy in areas from competition policy to
criminal activity, and could expand its influence into other trade-related
activities, such as the provision of export credit insurance.
The OECD exerts its influence through the application of 'peer pressure' on
each of its 22 member states, who are urged to follow its recommendations,
even if they are not obliged to enact them as law.
In April, Mexico became the first new member for more than two decades.
Further expansion will follow, changing the look of the OECD.
On 8 June, the OECD's annual ministerial meeting approved the start of
negotiations on membership with four central European 'partners in
transition' - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - and with
South Korea, one of the group the OECD calls DNMEs or 'dynamic non-members
economies'.
Seoul wants to join by 1996, the year when talks with the central Europeans
may open. In Latin America, Mexico may be followed by three other DNMEs:
Argentina, Chile and Brazil.
The OECD has a new co-operation agreement with the Russian Federation and is
committed to building closer links with China. This is essential if the OECD
is to reflect the economic realities of the next decade - and to bring
Beijing into the OECD fold.
China's attraction to exporters, its capacity to absorb credit and
insistence on obtaining the cheapest possible interest rate means that the
most notifications of the unfair use of aid funding and application of
sub-consensus export credits have been received for contracts there.
The use of subsidised credits has been monitored, since the OECD's
ministerial meeting in 1991, by a committee based in Paris. The 'Helsinki
rules' committee aims to ensure that aid finance is only offered on the
basis of developmental criteria, rather than national interest.
'Only a small part of official cover and development aid for projects comes
under scrutiny, but there is some business where you meet it every day,'
says to an official working with the Helsinki rules. This is especially the
case for telecommunications, power and other projects which may be financed
from alternative commercial sources.
The Helsinki rules apply to financing of more than two years for all
contracts, except military and agricultural deals. The OECD Helsinki group
meets 11 times a year, when governments present potentially aid-funded
projects for consideration and hear complaints against competitors whom
suppliers say are using subsidised credits to obtain unfair advantage.
'We are building up a history of cases and we have the feeling that project
promoters are getting a better understanding of the procedures,' a Helsinki
committee official says. 'Either governments know the financing will not
pass, so they do not even propose it, or they know the project is good and
feel secure enough to present it to the committee'.
There are several grey areas, however. 'An application to fund a
telecommunications project in the capital could turn out to be very
different from an application for similar work in a rural area,' the
official says.
To iron out other forms of distortions to international trade, the OECD's
competition law and policy trade committees have been working on issues such
as anti-dumping. Other committees are examining criminal activity.
There are plans to introduce measures to control money laundering worldwide
by 1999. 'Our goal is that all countries with significant financial centres
should implement our recommendations in the next five years,' John Gieve,
under-secretary at the UK treasury and chairman of the OECD's financial
action task force on money laundering (FATF), said in June this year.
Bribery in international business transactions is the next target. The OECD
has produced a recommendation on bribery which, it says, 'is the first
multilateral agreement among governments to combat bribery of foreign
officials'.
Recommendations include making payments to foreign officials illegal (but
not to private business people) and removing their tax deductible status,
says Mark Plieth, the Swiss official chairing the working group. The new
OECD anti-bribery code will draw on the FATF's money-laundering experience.
The OECD could play a new role in other areas of trade policy. One is the
global harmonising of levels of insurance cover provided by export credit
agencies (ECAs). There is a long way to go before European, North American
and Asian practice comes together to provide a level playing field for ECA
cover.
In the pipeline is a ground-breaking recommendation on exports by
shipbuilders. For the first time this would introduce binding arbitration
and damages in commercial procedures between states, as well as for
companies.
The potential for the OECD to become more than just a rich nation's club has
given impetus to the competition to appoint a new secretary-general for the
end of September. Whoever emerges from the four candidates, among them the
incumbent, Jean-Claude Paye, the decision, in keeping with OECD conventions,
must be reached by consensus.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (2): Five-tier rate system controversial - While
cheaper premiums in growth areas may help some, struggling east German
businesses will be hit by more expensive rates for countries of the former
Soviet Union / German credit insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's export credit insurance system came of age on July 1 with the
abandonment of a 50-year-old system of uniform premium rates. A five-tier
system was introduced which effectively reduced the former standard premium
by two-thirds for cover on deals with lowest-risk countries, and doubled it
for companies doing business with the world's economic laggards.
While the government saw the change as an occasion for celebration, industry
and the opposition remained as resolutely glum as they had through more than
two years of consultation.
Certain media commentators were downright aggressive. One leading newspaper,
for example, described the move as an insurance policy for the Bonn
government paid for by exporters. East German politicians complained that
because of the heavier premiums for deals with their manufacturers'
traditional Russian and other east bloc countries, export credit insurance
would now exclusively benefit west German companies.
Bonn was insistent that the changes should go through. Germany was behind
the times, it said, being the only major exporter to apply uniform tariffs.
It also had international agreements to honour: subsidy rules in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade required export credit insurance schemes to
be independent and self-supporting. The old system was increasingly failing
to meet these criteria.
At the same time, the Bonn administration was under strict orders from the
Bundesbank to cut state spending wherever possible. Mounting deficits in the
state-sponsored Hermes insurance programme, administered by the Allianz
group, were a clear target. The federal budget subsidised the Hermes
programme to the tune of a record DM5.1bn last year, and a further
escalation to DM7.5bn (regardless of the impact of the new premiums) has
already been earmarked for the current year.
As Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, pointed out recently, DM4.5bn of the
1993 Hermes deficit was due to outstanding debts from the former Soviet
Union. While he failed to mention that countries such as Russia and the
Ukraine - still important outlets for east Germany's struggling industry -
had been placed in the worst risk grade, he made much of cheaper premiums
for other countries where west German exporters are hoping to find new
growth.
Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea are now in the top rank - 'countries
without special risks'. For export credit insurance purposes, they are now
on equal terms with large industrialised nations for which the services of
Hermes play no role. Premiums on deals with China and the Czech Republic are
reduced by a third.
Mr Rexrodt insisted that higher premiums for Russia and former Soviet Union
states offered no disadvantages to German exporters, since competing nations
had long since been paying more for cover there.
While the minister side-stepped the implications for east Germany, his
ministry officials had earlier ridden rough-shod over protests. At a March
meeting in the Baltic state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, regional leaders
protested that Hermes operated exclusively on behalf of west German
interests. A Hermes representative was able to demonstrate the charge as
untrue with figures which at the same time starkly illustrated just how
important the system was to the region's economy. While Hermes covered 6 per
cent at most of all German exports, the proportion rose to 50 per cent in
the former GDR.
But Hans Birner from the federal economics ministry could offer nothing more
than a repeat of Bonn's earlier urgings that east German industry should
find new markets. Small and medium-sized companies especially should not
place their faith in the eastern market, he said. Their chances lay in the
west. Any companies still concentrating on the former Soviet Union should
re-examine their strategies, he added.
The opposition Social Democrats, meanwhile, have been drafting their
economic strategies in preparation for the federal elections due in October.
The party's leading economics spokesmen last month agreed that under a
future SPD government subsidised financing should be made available for
important foreign contracts, and that overseas development policy should be
interlocked more closely with trade policy.
None of the officials would expand on the 'interlocking' proposal - a
delicate issue in the light of recent trade-and-aid developments elsewhere.
Dieter Spori, economics minister in Baden-Wurttemberg, still irritated by
the award of a South Korean high-speed rail contract to GEC-Alsthom instead
of his local company, Siemens, said cheap financing was essential. It was
not acceptable that German 'purism' should cost it opportunities. Export
promotion should not end with Hermes credit insurance.
German companies found it difficult to establish themselves in developing
markets such as China, where US and French concerns had considerable help
from subsidised finance and diplomatic support, Mr Spori claimed, turning a
blind eye to evidence of clear progress. Some 400 Sino-German joint ventures
are already established, and German exports to China last year rose 67 per
cent to DM9.6bn.
A recent survey of more than 700 companies by the Munich-based Ifo economics
institute yielded 70 per cent of the sample asking for subsidised interest
on loans for deals in new markets, while more than half rated the
government's foreign trade policy as bad. Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of
the Siemens group, was even to be heard grumbling during a trip around China
late last year with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Though German development aid contributed partially to an underground
railway contract in Canton (announced during the visit) he let it be known
that he and the rest of German industry expected more co-operation from
government.
He suggested that Mr Kohl should use his political weight to roll level the
playing field within the European Union, and particular attention should to
be paid to France.
Mr von Pierer objected strongly to state-backed interest rate guarantees,
where competitors such as the Anglo-French combine GEC-Alsthom, were able to
tender for long-term engineering or infrastructural contracts with fixed
rates in the knowledge that the French government would cover any difference
when bills came to be paid.
It remains to be seen whether the chancellor, current head of the council of
ministers, who has pledged several joint EU initiatives with France, which
takes over the council next January, is prepared to tackle the issue.
But at least he has shown himself willing to support with his considerable
personal presence a plethora of recent industry initiatives, advisory groups
and commercial 'fishing trips', especially in south-east Asia.
The government has also launched an 'Asia Initiative'. German ambassadors
have been instructed that henceforth the promotion of and assistance to
German business interests have equal ranking with their other tasks.
The Asia Initiative also provides a talking shop to complement the
networking efforts of industry's own newly-founded Asia-Pacific Committee.
What is lacking, according to the Asia-Pacific Committee, is central
guidance and co-ordination of diverse projects in which efforts are
duplicated and which may threaten to irritate the most patient potential
customers. Chancellor Kohl and Mr Rexrodt led separate business groups to
the people's republic last year . . . and so did Hans Kasper, finance
minister of Saarland, and Erwin Teufel, prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg.
His party, including more than 100 of his local business leaders, was touted
at home as the biggest commercial delegation ever to visit China.
The Bavarian government, not to be done down, recently took an impressive
stand at a technology fair in Bangkok, in which the independent-minded state
presented itself as 'the thirteenth-largest exporting nation' in the world.

FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (1): The doors are opened wider - Alan Spence
and Jon Marks examine what the arrival of Gatt's successor early next year
will mean to exporters / The World Trade Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE and JON MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new world trade order to be led from 1995 by the World Trade
Organisation promises significantly higher trade flows - if it can avoid
becoming bogged down in bureaucracy.
The prevailing economic orthodoxy dictates that barriers to free trade
constrain growth in developing and industrialised economies. Distortions to
the practice of free and fair trade are, in the long run, bad for the
producers as well as the purchasers of goods.
Ironing out distortions and moving towards a more open trading environment -
widely known by its English nickname, the level playing field - should
therefore be a priority in creating any new world order.
And so it is, with the successful conclusion of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) Uruguay Round promising much for exporters by
further opening economies to the rigours of competition. Gatt economists
have calculated that the new terms of trade introduced by the Uruguay Round
could add some Dollars 755bn to world exports in the period to 2002.
The critical question now is how well the WTO - the body which will succeed
the Geneva-based Gatt and encompass associated responsibilities after
January 1 1995 - can deliver on the Gatt promise to create a more open,
prosperous international trade order, without itself adding an extra layer
of bureaucracy to the process.
The WTO's creation lays the ground for a new, more structured order in world
trade. The organisation, for which a headquarters and director-general have
yet to be chosen, will police international trade, basing its work on the
final act of the Uruguay Round. This document contains 28 agreements to
which have been added some 26,000 pages of national tariff and services
schedules.
The WTO will comprise Gatt and parallel organisations that are responsible
for services and intellectual property. Its general council will be
responsible to a ministerial conference that will be held every two years.
The Uruguay Round introduces a dispute settlement mechanism - described by
the Gatt as 'the new teeth of the WTO' - and the general council will, when
necessary, arbitrate in disputes through the new disputes settlement body.
This should further internationalise the practice and policing of free
trade. To ensure this, the WTO will have the power to sanction offenders,
including the ordering of compensation payments. Those who refuse to comply
will face authorised trade reprisals.
Exporters should benefit from a strengthening of the rules and procedures
governing trade. For the first time, the trade in farm products, textiles
and services are brought under the Gatt disciplines.
Service exporters are expected to be among the main beneficiaries of the
changes. The Uruguay Round has brought basic fair-trade principles, such as
non-discrimination, to the services sector for the first time.
The Uruguay Round intellectual property agreement is expected to encourage
technology transfer - a critical step in promoting industrialised economies.
The further opening of public procurement to international competitive
bidding has been calculated to expand contract awards tenfold.
The WTO will consolidate these trends at a time when world trade is becoming
progressively more liberal. During the seven years it took to negotiate the
Uruguay Round, more than 60 countries announced unilateral measures to open
their markets.
Even so, bilateral disputes are clearly not a thing of the past and profound
differences between rich and poor nations over how the international
economic order works hold the seeds of problems in the future.
At the Uruguay Round signing in Marrakesh on 15 April, this view was clearly
expressed by Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian commerce minister. Different
levels of development between rich and poor nations, he said, have 'enough
latent heat to melt down the most elaborately engineered structures'.
In many sectors the WTO promises progress, but there is still much to do:
Manufacturing: frontiers are becoming more open, with richer countries
agreeing to cut their tariffs by 38 per cent in the period to 2002, from 6.3
per cent to 3.9 per cent. Some 43 per cent of imported industrial products
will enter duty free, from around 20 per cent now.
Industries that can especially expect to benefit include pharmaceuticals,
construction, farm and medical equipment, steel, wood and paper.
To aid developing countries, the WTO intends to reduce tariff escalation,
allowing industrialising economies to export more processed versions of
primary products.
But anti-dumping remains a contentious issue. The Uruguay Round failed to
impose tighter discipline over what is seen by those criticised for dumping
as an instrument of non-tariff protectionism.
Textiles and clothing: tariffs are set to be reduced, but exporters complain
that most reductions will come at the end of the transition period to 2002.
The US and Australia will retain higher tariffs than most of Europe and east
Asia.
Agriculture: the introduction of tariffs on imports - rather than non-tariff
barriers - could afford EU farmers even more protection than at present.
Other measures are more positive: under the associated so-called Blair House
accord, subsidised dumping is to be limited over six years. This will affect
the largest importers of subsidised EU and US cereals, including Russia and
China.
Also to open are rice markets such as Japan and South Korea, where barriers
to farm imports must be converted into monetary tariffs and then reduced by
36 per cent. Tariffs on tropical products - the subject of a furious dispute
in the EU over bananas - are to be cut by 40 per cent.
The WTO agreement, therefore, offers a great deal of promise. New markets
will open. At the Uruguay Round signing in Marrakesh, Tsotomu Hata, the then
Japanese deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister said. 'As a
result of the Uruguay Round, the Japanese market offers greater
opportunities for success by foreign exporters, depending upon their
efforts.'
If the door to Japan and some other protected markets opens wider, the
figures for increased exports given by Gatt experts may not be as
over-optimistic as some of the more cautious trade analysts believe.
Exporting remains a difficult business, but if the WTO works as planned,
bureaucrats may help to make things easier for those at the sharp end - the
practitioners - and the face of exporting will be transformed.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (5): Equities for the family - The stock
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance won an overall
majority in March, it was clear that equity investors had great
expectations. A leaked exit poll on the second day of the two-day general
election prompted a 4 per cent increase in Milan equities in a day.
The reaction was hardly surprising. In the short term, investors and
prospective politicians alike had been expecting a prolonged period of
haggling to form a coalition - a replay of old-style Italian politics. The
prospect that a single grouping, with a free market manifesto and a
pro-business attitude, could win a decisive victory was bound to charge up
the markets.
In the weeks that followed, the equity market continued to feed off such
optimism, in spite of the fact that Mr Berlusconi took his time to form his
government. In the first three months of the year, the Comit index rose 3.6
per cent to 693.52, but by the beginning of May it had surged to more than
800.
More shares were traded in Milan on some days during that period than on
Wall Street, and on one occasion the exchange was unable to open for
business because of the sheer weight of small orders it was having to
process. The scheduled changeover to full on-screen trading had to be
postponed by a day.
The significance of this unprecedented activity was twofold. It showed that
small investors were increasingly drawn to equities - a form of investment
which has generally been spurned by Italian households in favour of
government bonds - and it sent a strong signal to the new government that
there would be trouble if expectations were not fulfilled.
In recent weeks, it has looked as though disillusionment is already creeping
into the Italian equity markets. As this survey went to press, the
government was wrestling with the consequences of a constitutional court
ruling which could force payment of pensions arrears to the tune of more
than L30,000bn. That has scared both equity and bond investors, and combined
with a general slump on world markets to push the Comit index down to its
pre-election level, although analysts still suggest that the long-term
prospects for Italian shares are good.
But to be fair to the government, proposals have already been tabled which
indicate the government's willingness to act on its campaign promises to
bolster the stock market.
At the beginning of June, for example, the government agreed a decree which
would harmonise withholding tax on shares at 12.5 per cent, the same level
imposed on government bond interest payments. The effect was not so much to
reduce the overall tax liability of owning shares, but to simplify the
system.
At the same time, and more importantly, the government agreed a series of
measures to encourage more small companies to list their shares on the stock
market, and thus improve the liquidity of the Milan borsa. Among the
incentives was a proposed three-year reduction in tax for smaller companies
coming to the market before the end of 1996.
On a wider scale, the government has committed itself to continuing the
privatisation programme first launched by the Amato government two years
ago. The recent sale of Ina, the state-owned insurer, and the future
privatisation of Stet, the telecommunications holding company, Enel, the
electricity generator, and Eni, the energy and chemicals group, should
attract more attention to the stock market and further improve liquidity.
As Mr Attilio Ventura, the chairman of the Milan stock exchange, put it in a
recent speech: 'In Italy, more than in other European countries, the success
of the privatisation programme depends on the involvement of small savers,
given the great weight of financial wealth held directly by households.
Historically, most of the financial activity has been concentrated on bank
deposits and government paper. Fewer than 10 per cent of Italian families
hold shares - the lowest level among the industrialised countries.'
But, as Mr Ventura's comments indicate, if demand for 'state-owned equity'
increases, it could be offset by a drop in demand for state debt. Treasury
officials admit that it is a delicate balance. However, they point out that
proceeds of privatisation issues are often used to cancel debt, so there is
not necessarily a contradiction between the two aims.
In any case, reforms are also under way in the bond market. Foreign
bondholders, for example, can now take advantage of a fast-track scheme for
refunding withholding tax, which, under the cumbersome old system, could
sometimes take up to 12 months to come through.
The Treasury is trying to restructure its own portfolio of debt, so that
family shareholders are encouraged to take on longer-term debt, and the
market for short-term debt instruments - such as the 3- to 12-month bonds
(known as Bots) and floating notes - becomes more professional. It is
estimated that some 90-95 per cent of Bots are held by private owners,
whereas most of the three- to 30-year bonds are held by banks and foreign
investors.
Central bank figures also illustrate that a reshuffling of household
portfolios is almost inevitable as the stock market increases in prominence.
In 1991, for example, only 4 per cent of household savings were held in
shares, and 36 per cent in public debt.
'There has already been a shift from Bots towards other forms of investment
and in a way we encourage this movement, because families have been a strong
presence on our Bot market, which makes it very illiquid,' says one treasury
official.
This suggests a more sophisticated personal and professional investor is
emerging in Italy, encouraged by reforms in the banking market. Banks have
always been the main retail network for the purchase of government paper.
They are now performing a role as outlets for privatisation issues, and for
life insurance, personal pension and savings schemes. If that means that
households move towards balanced portfolios of equities and bonds - either
owned directly or through fund managers - then stock and bond markets could
benefit equally.

FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (1): What Berlusconi needs to do now - In
Naples tomorrow the Group of Seven summit will be hosted by a prime minister
whose policy moves do not yet match his PR skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician, is patently full of
good intentions.
He wants to reform Italy's cumbrous bureaucracy, place the state at the
service of its citizens, and liberalise what is still one of Europe's most
regulated economies.
He also wants to please. Among Italy's 53 postwar prime ministers, he is the
first to use opinion polls systematically, and he takes great trouble to
discover what concerns the public. His decision to approach politics as if
it were a marketing exercise played a large part in his remarkable electoral
performance. Entering the arena only this January, he became prime minister
four months later at the head of his Forza Italia movement.
Yet two months after taking office with his right-wing coalition, Mr
Berlusconi's performance has been slow, indecisive and disappointing. Faced
with an opposition which is split between the left and centre and still
coming to terms with the Berlusconi phenomenon, the prime minister has been
weak on policy and strong on public relations. His popularity is
uncontested, with approval ratings of more than 70 per cent, and he received
another clear endorsement from the electorate in last month's elections for
the European parliament.
People like his uncomplicated language, his engaging smile, his business
success and the hint of showbiz in his style. The public at large seems to
regard it as irrelevant that his brother Paolo has been arrested on
corruption charges; that his Fininvest empire is being scrutinised by Milan
magistrates; that Mr Berlusconi was a prime beneficiary of the
much-discredited system of parties that his new government is seeking to
bury.
Outside Italy, Mr Berlusconi has yet to dispel considerable reservations
both about the conflict of interest with his Fininvest business empire and
the nature of his government. No other European democracy has allowed a man
who owned the second largest private business group with a virtual monopoly
of commercial television to enter politics without first distancing himself
from these business interests.
The provisions he has made in this respect are far from impartial. He still
retains ownership of Fininvest and has merely appointed three lawyers, at
least one of whom has previous links to Fininvest, to draw up proposals by
September on how to avoid a conflict of interest. Such conflicts are bound
to arise when he is obliged to deal with a range of issues from the
introduction of pension funds to telecommunications privatisation and the
reorganisation of broadcasting.
Mr Berlusconi also underestimated the negative impact of including in his
government five ministers from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. He did
not want them as allies; but having failed to find supporters in the centre
among the former Christian Democrats, Mr Berlusconi had to turn to the MSI,
which is well-entrenched in the south.
The new premier genuinely believes that through its inclusion in government,
the MSI will be sucked towards the mainstream of politics. Mr Umberto Bossi,
leader of the populist Northern League and the other main partner in
government, shares that view; and already Mr Gianfranco Fini, the MSI
leader, has distanced himself from the more ugly elements in his party,
which has changed its name to the National Alliance.
Nevertheless, Mr Fini has done the government a serious disservice through a
series of public declarations that show his admiration for Mussolini and
much of what he stood for. This runs counter to the spirit of the postwar
republic, which has tried to bury the Mussolini experience. For the time
being, the MSI in government will limit Mr Berlusconi's ability to expand
the base of his parliamentary support to groups in the centre.
It is worth stressing that the government coalition is unusually
heterogeneous. Forza Italia is still no more than a Berlusconi supporters'
club run by former Fininvest employees claiming to be free marketeers; the
League is federalist and rooted only in the industrialised north; the MSI
calls itself 'post-fascist', supporting a strong unitary state and continued
state control of strategic economic activity.
In their different ways, each appeals to the large Italian middle class,
which felt alienated from the discredited traditional parties and wanted a
change. But there was no prior policy co-ordination between them. Indeed,
Forza Italia, the League and the MSI never formed a proper electoral
alliance. Mr Berlusconi made separate deals to support candidates with each
of the two leaders.
Now that they have agreed to work together in government, both the League
and the MSI risk losing their identities under the aura of Mr Berlusconi and
the dominance of Forza Italia. Thus the League, in a vociferous manner, and
the MSI more subtly, continually assert themselves, making the coalition
inherently unstable.
Mr Bossi's party, which commands the largest number of deputies in the
coalition, can play on the government's weakness in the senate where it
lacks a clear majority. It would not be difficult to sabotage legislation
there. Mr Berlusconi knows this and on several occasions has used the threat
of fresh elections to keep the League in line. Mr Bossi will be loyal while
he sees the government advancing down the road to federalism and so long as
fresh elections appear against the League's best interests.
Sorting out a balance within the government and trying to establish new
rules with an almost wholly new set of players has meant that the government
has only just begun to function as a policy-making body. The slow start has
been compounded by poor co-ordination among ministers and a general lack of
experience. Of the 23 ministers, all but two are novices, many both to
government and parliament.
Co-ordination will be vital if the government is to manage its ambitious
agenda of modernising the state. Mr Berlusconi says he will embrace
extensive privatisation, move towards a more federal structure of the state,
reform the public administration, deregulate extensively, rework social
benefits and overhaul the inefficient tax system.
So far, the most serious error has been the failure to communicate the right
signals on economic policy to the financial markets. Mr Berlusconi has
appeared over-anxious to ride on the benefits of having inherited an economy
pulling out of recession and set to grow 1.5 per cent this year. His
instincts have been to stimulate the recovery and make good his campaign
promise of creating 1m jobs to reduce the 11.5 per cent jobless figure. The
first measures have been in this direction  - tax breaks on investment and
new jobs, unfreezing public works contracts blocked by the corruption
scandals, ending a temporary ban on local government recruitment.
Laudable in themselves, these measures have raised fears about inflation and
deflected attention from the public accounts which were rightly top of the
agenda of the previous Ciampi and Amato governments. With the public sector
deficit at more than 10 per cent of GDP and the stock of debt now equivalent
to a staggering 120 per cent of GDP, Italy is well out of line with the rest
of Europe.
It was not surprising, therefore, that the post-electoral euphoria over a
business-friendly government should be wiped from the Milan bourse and the
lira weaken at the first sign of bad news. This was last month's
constitutional court decision obliging the government to pay L32,000bn in
pension arrears.
The need to find this money, though probably not until next year, was a
brutal reminder of just how little room for manoeuvre any Italian government
has while the budget deficit is so large and the mountain of debt keeps
rising. It was all the more important for the new government to give the
right signals since the 1994 budget deficit is likely to be closer to
L160,000bn than the projected L144,000bn due to overruns on social security
spending and lower tax receipts.
The government can recover the confidence of the markets - providing a
convincing outline of the 1995 budget is produced quickly. But the 1995
budget plans, due out this month, will be the litmus test of Mr Berlusconi's
credibility in more ways than one. The budget will demonstrate whether he is
willing to act tough, cutting health and especially pension benefits.
His style has been to avoid confrontation, to seek to please. But if Mr
Berlusconi wishes to reform Italy and usher in the Second Republic, it would
be a pity if the opportunity is squandered in facile populism.

FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground again on currency
worries - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor

Nervousness regarding progress at the US Federal Open Market Committee
meeting increased yesterday and UK shares turned down smartly in
mid-afternoon. Trading volume remained light, however, and equities closed
above the day's lows.
The second half of the session was dominated by the dollar and the US
Federal bond markets, both of which turned lower as New York absorbed
strongly worded comments from the German economics minister. Markets grew
fearful that the Federal Reserve might either take no action on rates or
lift them by  1/2 percentage point. Either course would threaten problems
for currency and bond markets.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 down at 2,946.7. Around 4 points of the
Footsie fall reflected the heavy setback in GEC, which was among the most
actively traded shares after severely disappointing City analysts with
virtually unchanged profits. A market now looking for growth of around 6 per
cent overall in UK corporate earnings this year is no longer prepared to be
forgiving of slow progress, even when accompanied by a cash mountain, as is
the case with GEC.
The reaction to GEC's figures helped to upset equities in early trading.
However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3 per cent in May,
and industrial output by 0.1 per cent, was favourably received, as was the
UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady
economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said
to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A
second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be
the house responsible.
Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mark was a discouraging factor at
first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate
concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress.
The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to
trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the
day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the
dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch
television for any move by the Federal Reserve.
Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer
at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of
the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against
recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable
levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59 per cent of the day's total.
Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in
equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC
and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail
business was worth only Pounds 968.8m, still well below the levels to which
the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase.
The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the
Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further
dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served
to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy
council.

FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: US sellers of Pru
</HEADLINE>

Prudential, the UK's biggest insurance group, was among the FT-SE 100's
poorest performers following news that AM Best, the US insurance ratings
agency, had lowered its rating for Jackson National, Prudential's US
subsidiary.
The agency cut the rating because of the interest rate-sensitive and limited
nature of Jackson's products.
The stock fell 6 to 294p, with much of yesterday's turnover of 9.1m said to
have been carried out by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank.
The weakness was in stark contrast to most of the other life assurance
stocks, which responded to a recent buy recommendation from Morgan Stanley.
The house said the smaller companies had been left behind and would
outperform. Britannic rose 14 to 421p, Refuge 6 to 286p and United Friendly
33 to 523p. Lloyds Abbey held at 342p after an agency cross of 3.2m shares.
Dixons, the stores and property group, climbed sharply on the release of
full-year figures but some analysts reined in their enthusiasm, arguing that
the price move did not reflect a return to the good times.
The group profit of Pounds 73.3m was in line with analysts' forecasts and,
more significantly, there were no shocks from exceptional costs. The 6.6p
dividend was also marginally higher than most forecasts. Analysts lifted
current year forecasts by about Pounds 8m to between Pounds 85m and Pounds
100m. But some said there had been significant short selling ahead of the
figures and argued that yesterday's jump of 19 to 189p merely reflected
traders buying shares back again.
J. Sainsbury shed 6 to 396p after the agm statement. Analyst Mr Bill Myers
at Yamaichi said there was nothing worrying in the statement and the selling
of the shares was possibly a bit overdone. The company said sales were up by
7.1 per cent, in line with City forecasts.
Publishing and media stocks held firm, receiving support from the latest
advertising figures, which had begun to leak into the market towards the
close of trading.
The Advertising Association reported that the first quarter of the financial
year saw real spending growth spurt ahead by 8 per cent. This prompted the
association to raise its growth forecast for the year to 13 per cent, from
10 per cent previously, suggesting total advertising expenditure of Pounds
7.7bn. The upbeat forecasts provided a welcome balm to newspapers suffering
a crippling price war.
Mirror Group Newspapers, which faces severe competition from a cut-price Sun
and also has a 40 per cent stake in the Independent, gained 3 at 131p. The
Telegraph, which recently cut its cover price to 30p, bounced 2 to 357p.
Among the agencies, which account for about 15 per cent of total spending,
Gold Greenlees Trott and Abbott Mead Vickers held at 177p and 664p
respectively.
Pharmaceuticals issues were supported by the after-effect of continued US
buying. Glaxo was 12 higher at best and closed 4 up at 559p. There was
further assistance from news that the company had received permission to
manufacture and market a nasal drug, Flixonase, in Japan.
Taunton Cider sparkled with a rise of 12 to 162p after improved profits of
Pounds 20m and stating that since the start of the year it had reversed
inroads made into its business by launching aggressive promotions and
cost-cutting which had left its own operating margin untouched.
British Airways was one of the best performers in the FT-SE 100 as it
continued to benefit from better than expected traffic figures reported on
Tuesday. The shares added 11 at 403p on 6.5m traded. NatWest Securities
urged investors to buy the stock.
Morgan Crucible tumbled 16 to 326p on reports that Cazenove was negative.
