FT  21 SEP 94 / Personal View: Blueprint for a European government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK VIBERT

<TEXT>
A recent report on European integration from the German Christian Democrats
recommended that 'the Commission . . . take on the features of a European
government'. Such a prospect will cause anxiety among members of the
European Union wishing to see it develop a decentralised structure. So what
approach should they take to this CDU suggestion?
One answer would be to do nothing and hope the recommendation fades away.
However, in view of suggestions elsewhere in Europe, including the European
parliament's view that the Commission's powers be increased, that would be
unwise. The alternative would be to accept that the functioning of the EU's
key institutions needs to be reviewed. As part of such a review, the
Commission's role would need a thorough examination, and the 1996
inter-governmental conference provides the opportunity.
There are two views of the future role of the Commission. One is that it
should increasingly take on the character of the 'government' of Europe. The
other is that it should become a more effective manager of the Union's
programmes. The two views conflict. They reflect different assessments of
where the weaknesses lie in the Union's present institutional arrangements,
as well as fundamental differences about where institutional
responsibilities for core functions in the Union should lie.
The role of a modern government is to determine the direction of public
policy and, where legislation is necessary, to initiate, prepare and attempt
to carry through that legislation. There are two bodies that can potentially
perform this role in the European Union. One is the Commission. The other is
the Council of Ministers, acting in the light of more general guidelines set
by heads of government.
The role of manager of public programmes is carried out in modern government
either by specialised agencies or within the departments of the civil
service. The view that the Commission should develop as 'manager' envisages
it as an agency of government (Council of Ministers) and in the role of
civil service. This does not necessarily mean that the Commission would
become directly responsible for the execution of policy in all areas. Much
of the responsibility must continue to rest with member states. However, the
Commission would need to develop its role as 'honest broker', mediating
policy differences between member states.
There is a reasoned case for not developing the Commission as Europe's
government. Any democratic government would require electoral legitimacy.
The Commission could not continue as an appointed body. It would have to be
elected either by the European parliament or by direct popular vote in the
Union (most plausibly, through an election to select its head). In the first
case, parliament would gain a level of control over the government unmatched
by any other democratic representative assembly. In the second case, to vest
such powers in a single person would seem a colossal mistake in the light of
Europe's history. Either 'solution' would be enormously central-ising.
The case against the Commission developing as the government of Europe
cannot simply rest on a negative agenda. The capacity of the Council of
Ministers to set policy and to run business in a more orderly way will need
to improve. This will call for changes in voting, in the presidency
arrangements and in the Council secretariat.
Developing the Council of Ministers as the government of Europe also raises
questions about democratic legitimation. The Council cannot be dismissed by
the directly elected European parliament. Thus there would develop a
separation of powers more akin to the American system than the 'fusion' of
powers often held to be characteristic of parliamentary democracies.
National parliaments would have a role in the legitimation of policies
carried into the Council by their own ministers. This in turn means that the
relationship between national parliaments and the European parliament would
have to be much more carefully struc-tured.
If some member states wish to run ahead of the rest and implement their own
view of the institutional development of Europe, as suggested by the CDU
document, they should be aware that such action is likely to divide Europe
again. The concept of a multi-track, multi-speed Europe is one of managed
differences. To assign responsibility for core functions in a way which also
affects key institutional relationships could, however, lead to unmanageable
divergence. Nobody, least of all the German Christian Democrats, really
wishes to see this happen.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The complex wrangle around the European Commission's final revision of the
Acquired Rights Directive has become a test for Europe's legislative
procedures - and for the Commission's commitment to a new balance between
social protection and job creation.
The directive, which protects the rights of workers when organisations
change ownership, became a political issue when it started to interfere with
the UK government's programme for contracting-out public services. In its
attempts to narrow the scope of the directive to exclude the contracting out
of activities like cleaning and catering, the UK initially stood alone. But
as public sector reforms spread across Europe, the UK government has
acquired allies.
The result is a rather obscure paragraph in the revised directive which says
that only whole economic entities are subject to the directive, as opposed
to more narrow activities. However, lawyers are quick to point out that in
the famous Schmidt case, involving a German bank, the European Court of
Justice ruled that one woman cleaner represented an economic entity. So
there may be less room for manoeuvre than is implied by the revision.
Part of the problem is the immense complexity involved in drafting
legislation for countries with 12 different approaches to the transfer of
ownership. Just as awkward is the unpredictability of the European Court
itself, which is not bound by precedent and which has recently been handing
down judgments which have outraged several conservative governments.
Underneath all this is an even more important issue for Europe's labour
markets. The original directive was based on the laudable premise that
long-term relationships should be encouraged between employers and
employees, and that a change of ownership should not introduce instability
into those relationships.
That principle cannot, however, be applied to the short-term contracts which
are typical for services contracted out from the public sector. So any
revision of the directive which excludes low-skilled services is likely to
reinforce the trend towards a dual labour market, of well-protected insiders
and less secure outsiders.
That in turn would create a problem for Europe's social dimension. Beginning
with last year's Delors white paper, a welcome new balance has been struck
between social protection and job creation, which points towards relaxation
of the acquired rights directive if it threatens to prevent the creation of
more low-paid, service sector jobs.
But the same white paper stressed that the burden of deregulation should not
fall on the weakest sector of the labour market, as would follow from a
simple loosening of the directive. The uncomfortable logic for Europe's
social thinkers may be, therefore, that the directive should be scrapped
altogether.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To boldly go where no bank has gone before is the mission of the
International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank
Group. The question, however, is whether the bank's Starship Enterprise
retains a useful role and, if so, what.
The IFC is small compared to the World Bank itself; its annual report,
published yesterday, shows that it approved Dollars 4.3bn for 231 new
projects in fiscal 1994. But for most of its 35 years, the IFC has been able
to claim, with some plausibility, that it provides an important, if
peripheral service in bringing equity and loan finance to projects in
developing countries that private banks would not touch.
Since the late-1980s, two things have changed. Some of the countries in
which it has been most active, notably in east Asia but, to some extent,
even in hitherto lagging Latin America, have made large strides in
development of their private sectors. At the same time, the availability of
capital for companies based in emerging markets, which are the IFC's
potential clients, has soared.
The problem the IFC faces is that the 'window' in a country's development
during which its funds can play a uniquely valuable role is narrowing. On
one side, it is limited by its insistence on a 'commercial' rate of return
(although this criterion is somewhat fuzzy in the least developed sectors).
On the other side, it has the whole pack of international commercial banks
and investors at its heels, sniffing for any sign that country and project
risk has fallen to tolerable levels. The problem is acute in a role of which
the IFC is particularly proud, that of helping the development of capital
markets themselves.
In Africa and the former Soviet Union, for example, both regions that are
particularly in need of assistance, the IFC has invested and lent
comparatively little because of the difficulty of finding projects which
meet its criteria. Yet success stories, such as South Korea and Chile, have
already outgrown the need for IFC participation.
In defence of its role, the IFC points out that demand for its funds is
increasing. It also argues that international finance houses often fail to
service second-tier companies in developing countries. It is right, too, to
stress that financial markets may lose their current taste for developing
countries as quickly as they gained it.
However its principal donors will put the IFC under increasing pressure to
justify its role. Fearing budgetary cutbacks, it has started to explore
raising its own funds by issuing bonds secured against mature assets. If it
does sustain its activities by raising funds in that way, it will still have
to demonstrate that an adequate supply of reasonably high-quality
investments remains available to it. The challenge to the IFC, therefore, is
to demonstrate that it is not taking on excessive risk and, more
fundamentally, that it still has an essential role.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Pensions: a tough Italian job - Berlusconi needs to reform
the system in the teeth of trade union opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a hectic car chase through the outskirts of Turin, police arrested a
man suspected of armed robbery. An identity check revealed he was registered
as an invalid and drawing a pension.
This incident 10 days ago illustrates one of the worst areas of abuse in
Italy's bloated state pensions system. Almost one in three of the 21m
pensions paid out annually goes to invalids, a proportion without equal in
Europe. Everyone knows many such 'invalids' are bogus. In southern Italy
local politicians recognise invalidity pensions as the simplest way of
providing long-term unemployment benefit.
As the Italian government wrestles with a reform of the pensions system, it
and the other interested parties now agree that fiddles like this should
end. The trouble is that they agree on very little else.
Curbing Italy's generous and incredibly complex state pensions system has
become a crucial test of the Berlusconi government's political and financial
credibility.
Cuts in pension benefits are supposed to be the centrepiece of the 1995
budget, now in the final stages of preparation. They are the benchmark by
which sceptical financial markets will judge the rightwing coalition's
ability to tackle Italy's debt-ridden public finances.
At the heart of the problem is the growing gap between pension contributions
and pensions payments which in Italy's 'pay as you go' system is met by the
government. Pensions absorb over 40 per cent of the state budget; this year
the gap between contributions and the amount needed for pension payments is
L84,000bn - equivalent to half the total budget deficit.
Effective reform of the pensions system would stand a strong chance of
halting the inexorable increase in the budget deficit. Without it, on
current trends the deficit will reach close to L185,000bn in 1995,
equivalent to more than 12 per cent of gross domestic product. That would
spell a further rise in Italy's public sector debt - already at the
dangerous level of 125 per cent of GDP.
Such reform, however, looks like being difficult to achieve. Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, prime minister, faces intense opposition from trade unions,
which are anxious to defend existing pension benefits and are threatening a
general strike over the issue. He has made clear he does not wish to
antagonise them, and on Monday for the second time in a week postponed a
'definitive' negotiating session. This is now due to take place tomorrow.
What is more, the government is weak and is itself divided over pensions
reform.
The treasury under Mr Lamberto Dini talks tough, well aware that unless the
forthcoming budget shows tangible progress on the pensions issue, the
consequences will be immediately felt in the exchange rate of the lira and
the yield on Italian government bonds. The labour ministry, on the other
hand, champions the interests of the unions, in the process undermining the
treasury.
The explanation for Italy's growing pensions gap is not that individual
pensions are generous - the average pension is around L1m a month. Rather
the system is poorly structured and administered and pays too many
unnecessary pensions.
Compared with other European countries (see chart) the retirement age is
low, and pensions tend to be higher as a proportion of final salary. There
is little or no incentive at present for the growth of a private pensions
industry.
As important is the complex nature of the pension system. The treasury says
17 different systems are applied to salaried workers, three more for the
self-employed and 11 for the professions. Each category enjoys a different
set of privileges. Some, such as agricultural workers, pay in minimal
contributions. Journalists, doctors and even Italy's 3,000 customs agents
pay into separate state-run schemes.
The privileges for public sector employees are especially extravagant. Women
can retire after a mere 15 years work on 80 per cent of final salary. Men
can get away with 20 years' work. Others like teachers can retire, take
another job, and take their pension only on full retirement. The pension
they then draw will still reflect the automatic seniority pay increases due
to teachers every two years.
The government of Mr Giuliano Amato made an attempt at pension reform in
1992. It froze indexation of pensions to inflation and provided for a
gradual increase in the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and 55 to 60
for women, to be complete by 2002.
However, this has proved less than adequate in the face of the constant
pressure on the budget from debt service costs. What is more, talk of the
need for further cuts has triggered a flood of requests for early retirement
from public sector employees: of the 459,000 pension requests between
January-August, 340,000 are for early retirement.
Pressure on Mr Berlusconi to act on pensions has been increased by his
determination to avoid tax increases, which leaves him reliant mainly on
spending cuts to bring the overall budget deficit to below 8 per cent of
GDP.
The prime minister's hands are tied by tax-cutting election promises, and he
is looking for extra budget revenues to one-off devices dreamed up by Mr
Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister: an amnesty on illegal building -
yielding otherwise lost building registration taxes - and a partial waiver
of Italy's 1.3m contested tax assessments.
Such measures have deepened the scepticism among foreign observers about
Italy's public finances. Remarked one market analyst: 'We are always weary
of one-off measures like these pardons which in the case of Italy have a
poor record of providing the funds promised.'
The government wants to make three basic changes to the pensions system to
bring Italy more into line with the rest of the European Union. It wants to:
simplify the system, end anomalies and bring contributions into line with
payments;
accelerate the increase in the retirement age - currently 56 for women and
61 for men - from one year every two years to one year every 18 months, and
increase the pension contributions period;
change the rate at which pension provisions accrue from the current 2 per
cent a year, well above the EU average, to 1.75 per cent a year.
All sides - government and unions - agree on the need to end the difference
between the treatment of private sector employees and the more favourable
position of those in the public sector. There is also unanimity on the
importance of shifting more of the burden on to the individual by fostering
the growth of private pension funds.
Thereafter agreement evaporates. The unions oppose the government's plan to
raise the retirement age. They are against the idea of extending the
contribution period, and say they will block the plan to alter the accrual
rate.
Matters have been complicated by the failure of a cross-party commission set
up to make recommendations on the pension issue to reach a consensus. Mr
Berlusconi approved the establishment of the 18-person commission in early
August hoping its academics, trade unionists and politicians would come up
with a platform that could be sold as 'neutral' to all concerned. The
proposals, finalised on Monday, were effectively split into two separate
reports, with agreement on only a few broad concepts.
Last week union leaders won a concession from Mr Berlusconi. Instead of
seeking a specific sum in benefit cuts - the treasury wants some L8,000bn -
the prime minister agreed to consider overhauling the structure of pensions
first. Almost inevitably, that will mean a smaller saving in the 1995
budget.
Time is running out for agreement. The budget has to be submitted to
parliament in detail before the end of the month. On Monday, Mr Berlusconi
adopted a tougher tone: 'The existing pensions system cannot work and if we
go on like this the state will not be able to pay pensions in the future.'
But the prime minister's previous behaviour suggests that, faced with the
choice of mollifying the unions or appeasing the financial markets, he will
back away from a domestic confrontation.

Smiles all round in Cape Town yesterday as John Major put the seal on South
Africa's return to the fold, making the first prime ministerial visit since
Harold Macmillan stopped off to deliver his 'winds of change' speech in
1960.
From the sublime to the ridiculous. Major tried a joke or two, claiming that
Norma throws bread rolls at him if he drones on too long.
Zulu leader Chief Buthelezi managed a better, if somewhat more obscure jest,
telling reporters that he had always considered Lady Thatcher to be a man -
a Zulu compliment, apparently.
It was left to Nelson Mandela to lend a proper tone to proceedings. Rather
than kow-towing to the parade of UK business types jostling round Major, the
great man peered over their shoulders and was heard to say: 'Yes, but where
is Sir Colin Cowdrey?'

Traditions die hard at the 116-year-old Chartered Institute of Bankers
where, after a quarter of a century as a humble scribe, the new
secretary-general Gavin Shreeve is getting used to tea and biscuits served
daily in his heavy wood-panelled office.
Actually, far from relishing the cosy ways, Shreeve appears impatient to
shake things up at what is the main professional body for British bankers.
For starters, the lease on the offices at that grand City address Number Ten
Lombard Street expires next year and staff will have to get used to a new
abode - or rather two.
The CIB already has an office in Canterbury and the plan is to move most of
the rest of the staff down there, keeping in London only a few employees and
the institute's rather splendid library. Inquiries are being made around the
Threadneedle Street area - which the CIB old-timers seem to regard as more
than a bit of a let-down.
Come on chaps, if it's good enough for the Bank of England  ..

For once, British Telecom, which has just torn up a Pounds 1,000 bill
incurred by a toddler 'phoning' his great grandparents in the West Indies,
can teach other companies a thing or two about customer relations. The House
of Fraser group, for instance, has been having a rather unseemly wrangle
with a pensioner.
Ten years ago, Walter Mealey sent Pounds 1,006 to one of its stores for some
furniture, which he then decided against buying.
He left the money at the store reasoning that, if he could find nothing else
to spend it on, House of Fraser would eventually pay him a reasonable rate
of interest.
Most unwise. If he had put it into almost any building society, his original
sum would by now be worth more than Pounds 2,000, thanks to fairly high
interest yields during the 1980s.
After lengthy correspondence, the store has now sent him a cheque for Pounds
1,250 - the original sum plus Pounds 244 interest, which the group calls a
'gesture of goodwill'.
Obviously the annual percentage rate on goodwill doesn't match that charged
on most store cards.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As if in rebuttal of Observer's jibe yesterday - relating to a Pounds 4.6m
reduction in parliamentary costs, thanks to lowered 'activities' - word
reaches us of the peripatetic Tim Eggar, who has just spent his third
consecutive night on an aeroplane.
Sunday evening saw him whizz back from Chile, part of a business delegation.
On Monday he joined a night flight to Baku, attended the signing of British
Petroleum's Azerbaijan oil deal, and flew back last night. Presumably a
well-earned rest tomorrow then? 'He has a full diary,' says his office.
Well, he is minister for energy.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Observer: Danger man's meaty memo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What precisely is Gunther Burghardt's game? Earlier this year, the boss of
the new Brussels directorate of external political affairs was patting
himself on the back, telling the European Commission's internal magazine
what a significant contribution his DG1A, as it is called, had made to a
common European foreign policy.
The impression was of a clued-up operation, dispatching secret telegrams
hither and thither and generally functioning like any national foreign
ministry. So has DG1A had its feet up this summer?
The question arises because of the content of a memo circulating at the
highest level of the Commission presenting a rather sorrier state of
affairs. It whinges about an 'almost total lack of strategic planning, a
repeated disregard for agreed EU rules, coupled with regrettable ups and
downs in the performance of the Council Presidency system'.
It lays into France for acting unilaterally in Rwanda, Britain and Italy for
getting into a huddle on eastern Europe, and Greece for slapping a trade
embargo on Macedonia. The draft concludes: 'The very notion of a common
foreign and security policy sounds increasingly hollow.'
Could it be that the author hates the whole idea of closer co-operation?
Actually no, since the memo is penned by none other than G. Burghardt. In
which case it looks suspiciously like a ploy to bolster the Commission's
foreign policy role ahead of the 1996 review of Maastricht.
There is fighting talk of more funding for EU budgets and even of
introducing an element of majority voting on foreign policy matters. All
anathema to the French and the British. No, DG1A has not had its feet up all
summer.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The role of a third party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Liberal Democrats are right. Cannabis should be decriminalised.
The law prohibiting use or possession of small amounts of the drug is
difficult to enforce and, in consequence, low on the list of police
priorities. Chief constables would like to see it removed from the statute
books. As matters stand, its distribution is managed by gangsters at the
wholesale level and petty criminals at the retail. This is absurd. There
would be some risk in decriminalisation, since all drugs are potentially
dangerous. Yet there is no evidence that cannabis is any more harmful than
either tobacco or alcohol.
The above would be a sensible set of propositions for Mr Paddy Ashdown to
put forward. Instead the leader of the Liberal Democrats has expressed
distaste, bordering on alarm, following his party's vote at its annual
conference in Brighton in favour of ending prosecutions of 'pot' smokers.
Perhaps he anticipated the prissy horror expressed by some of Britain's
tabloids. Possibly he feared the loss of some support for his party, which
has in the past been dogged by its image as a home for sandal-wearing,
muesli-eating activists.
If so, his concerns were misplaced. The Liberal Democrats may or may not be
destined to play a role in national government. That depends upon whether
the Labour party finds that it can govern with their support, but not
without it, after the next election. Meanwhile the third party commands the
allegiance of between a sixth and a fifth of the voters, a mandate
substantial enough to support its aspiration to be taken seriously.
To deserve to be taken seriously, Liberal Democrats must put forward radical
ideas, particularly when many people know in their bones that a particular
proposal is right. That above all is their role, and they can claim some
success in pursuing it. They have brought political opinion a long way
towards constitutional reform, with a large part of the Labour programme
lifted straight from Lib-Dem manuals. Notions such as the earmarking of
taxes may yet become topics for respectable debate. Some activists'
favourite schemes, such as a minimum wage or the abolition of the monarchy,
deserve to be rejected by the party leadership, but that is no reason why
they should not be aired.
The two larger parties are extremely cautious about saying anything that has
not been market-tested, sanitised and measured against its supposed impact
on the electorate. Mainstream politicians who come up with original ideas
find themselves forced to abandon them by the relentless inquisition of the
popular press. This is a stultifying atmosphere, in which fresh approaches
to intractable problems are unlikely to emerge.
The Liberal Democrats should be different. Mr Ashdown should loosen up a
little. He would do us all a favour, and perhaps win greater respect and
support that way than by trying to be Little Sir Echo.

FT  21 SEP 94 / No accounting for standards: On the eve of its latest
directive, the UK regulatory body faces intense criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were only three things wrong with British accounting when the UK's
Accounting Standards Board began life four years ago, says Sir David
Tweedie, the board's chairman: the profit and loss account, the balance
sheet and the cash-flow statement.
In other words, just about everything.
In the late 1980s, following the collapse of many seemingly healthy
companies, his view was shared by many, and the ASB was welcomed as a
potential saviour.
Seven accounting standards later, the board itself is under attack, as
secretive, unaccountable and over-prescriptive, and with tomorrow's issue of
accounting standard FRS 7, it faces the strongest wave of criticism yet.
'I'm damn sure this new standard is going to be badly received by industry,'
says Sir David. 'If there was ever a honeymoon, it will end in divorce after
this.'
FRS 7 is designed to limit the costs that a company can meet through setting
up a reserve on its balance sheet when it buys another company. Such
reserves have been used by some companies to cover all sorts of costs which
would otherwise have appeared on their profit and loss account. By removing
these costs from the profit and loss account, companies can boost their
headline profit figure.
The board's aim in curbing this practice is to ensure that users of
financial accounts get a fair picture of a company's true profit. But the
financial directors and auditors that prepare and oversee companies'
financial accounts say that FRS 7 is unnecessarily hardline, and far too
detailed.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed Elsevier, and chairman of the
100 Group of leading company finance directors, typifies the changing mood.
'I am not a critic of the ASB, but I do think there is a trend over time for
it to become much more prescriptive,' he says.
Audit partners in the leading UK accounting firms say that auditors and
company directors need to be able to exercise judgment in the way in which
financial results are presented. It is never the case that there will be a
single correct way of presenting something in order to give a true and fair
picture, they say. Nor is it necessary to ban, outright, a particular
practice to prevent it from being abused.
Sir David says he would love to issue streamlined standards, which allow
auditors to exercise judgment, but that, privately, auditing firms often
welcome detailed guidelines so that they can stand up to pressure from
companies that want to bend the rules.
Auditors are, in effect, hired, fired, and paid by executive management,
which may want to present financial information in the best possible light.
'You need a tough auditing profession. It will never be independent as long
as the people who mark the homework are the students,' says Sir David.
'Auditors are put under terrible pressure.'
In an effort to protect auditors from this pressure, the board has issued
seven standards, produced a statement of principles to underpin them, and
issued guidelines on an 'Operating and Financial Review' in which directors
can describe their company's performance in their own words. It has also
circulated draft standards on a range of other topics.
But both preparers and users of accounts have criticised the board for this
pace of change, saying they are overloaded with draft regulations.
Sir David is robust in defending the board on this charge. 'We consulted
people on what to do, and we've actually hit the scams,' he says. 'We are
issuing about two standards a year. That is hardly excessive. And industry
can't have it both ways: they can't ask to be consulted and then complain
about the consultation documents we produce.'
A more fundamental criticism, however, is of the way in which the ASB makes
its decisions. Its nine members are selected by an appointments committee,
and weighted towards auditors and finance directors. Its meetings are held
in secret and the minutes are not made public.
While the ASB engages in extensive consultation, its sub-committee, the
urgent issues task force, does not. The taskforce acts swiftly to change
rules to prevent companies exploiting individual loopholes that are too
narrow to justify a full accounting standard.
Its lack of openness has raised concerns that it may bow to pressures from
interest groups, or abandon rule changes for reasons that would not have
been considered sufficient if aired in public.
Several of the more controversial topics the task force planned to tackle
were dropped before they reached the agenda, while others were substantially
diluted, abandoned or introduced with long implementation dates allowing
companies already planning such practices to adopt them unscathed.
Sir David admits that there is a problem, and says he would ultimately like
to see both the board and the urgent issues task force meet in the open.
However, with other board members opposed, this could be some way off.
In the meantime, the board plans to hold public hearings in the next few
months on accounting for goodwill - an area on which it will be difficult to
reach a consensus.
Views are mixed on what the ASB's achievements have been in improving
financial reporting.
'It has done a valuable job but I think it's still too early to judge,' says
Mr Peter Scott, head of Hemmington Scott, a financial information company.
'There is far better quality of information now and it was necessary to have
clearer rules. But I'm not sure we're up to interpreting them yet."
Mr Allister Wilson, a technical partner with accountants Ernst &amp; Young,
says: 'I think the whole financial reporting scene has certainly changed for
the good. But that reflects a combination of the recession, the Cadbury
committee on corporate governance and other factors as well as the
Accounting Standards Board.'
Arguably more important than the board itself is its sister body, the
Financial Reporting Review Panel, chaired by Mr Edwin Glasgow, QC. It has
the power to reprimand companies or take them to court to force restatements
if they breach standards. No such enforcement power previously existed.
The panel has so far found against companies in 22 of its completed cases.
No company has yet challenged the review panel in court. And, with its
authority unsullied, it has instilled a new sense of fear in both finance
directors and auditors that they will be publicly criticised if they do not
comply with accounting standards.
But the panel is still only in a position to act on accounting abuses that
are obvious from inspecting the public accounts - in which many
manipulations will not be transparent. Furthermore, Mr Wilson argues, the
review panel 'only gives out parking tickets' - picking on smaller companies
and less contentious issues while leaving some more important abuses
untouched.
Some companies have demonstrated quite clearly that they are still
determined to exploit loopholes. A decline in acquisition and merger
activity during the recession has reduced the scope for companies to account
creatively.
Whether the fragile structures now in place will be sufficient to prevent
long-term abuses as industry comes out of recession is less certain.
The standards and their interpretation by the review panel could yet be
tested in court, with the possibility of a verdict that could undermine the
ASB's credibility by overturning its view of what constitutes a true and
fair picture of a company's health.
Mr Wilson is one of many who believe that only a US-style Securities and
Exchange Commission, which could not be challenged in court, would guarantee
the quality of financial reporting in the future.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Great parody - but no swastika
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHN SIDDONS-DOWNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your 'Guide to the week' (September 12) you mention the auction of
Charles Chaplin's costume that he wore in the film The Great Dictator. As
Adenoid Hynkel he was a great parody of a similarly ridiculous dictator with
the same initials. But you are mistaken in saying Chaplin's uniform
incorporated swastikas - the motif was a parody of the original and at no
point was a swastika shown.
Indeed it seems strange that, years before, these two men of small stature
both adopted the toothbrush moustache and a most individual manner of
walking (or marching) as their prime visual features. If only today we could
have such a brilliant satire of, say, Mr Zhirinovsky . . . now there's a
thought to rescue the British film industry.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good result in Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALNOOR HALARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The headline, 'Canada crumbles' (September 14), seemed to be
contradictory and presumptuous in the face of good news from the election
results in Quebec. The narrow margin of the popular vote in the election
demonstrated that Quebeckers do not want independence. The result would also
have been a non for independence even if the vote had been held soon after
the contentious Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords.
I am a Canadian from the west and have discussed with several Quebeckers the
possibility of separation during my visits to Quebec. I always get the
feeling that it is the politicians and the media who have been wanting and
propagating independence. The people of Quebec have never wanted and will
never want independence from Canada.
Your editorial headline therefore should have been more thoughtful and have
read 'Canada wins'.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Trends in Swedish jobs growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PER AHLSTROM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Swedish elections' (September 15), repeats the
questionable statement, often made in the Swedish election campaign, that
Sweden 'saw all of its employment growth between 1960 and 1993 derive from
the public sector'. Statistics should be used in a more careful way. I do
not have the employment figures from 1960, but from 1963 to 1993, employment
in the private sector (excluding agriculture) has developed like this:
 ---------------------------
Period          Jobs    Gov.
 ---------------------------
1963-1976    +62.600    soc.
1976-1982    -98.200    con.
1982-1991   +214.000    soc.
1991-1993   -304.500    con.
 ---------------------------
It is a curious fact that there is such strong correlation between the
political colour of the government and the development of the private
sector. For a non-biased observer it might look as if the economic policy of
social democrats was more advantageous for the private sector than the
conservative's.  Managers in the private sector argue that conservative
governments - in spite of their performance statistics - are better for
business than social democratic governments. Conservative governments have
just had bad luck, they say.
Be that as it may, the so-called Swedish model, which really is a social
democratic model, has performed well under social democratic governments. It
cannot be declared a failure because of the present crisis, which has been
managed by parties opposed to the Swedish model, even though they are
Swedish.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nitrate level incompetence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A S MONCKTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alison Maitland's article on livestock farmers threatened with being
forced out of business by the government's plans to cut nitrates in drinking
water was accurate ('Farmers attack proposals on nitrate levels', September
13). But it did not include the latest incompetence.
The government says it must reduce the level of nitrates (to 50mg per litre
instead of about 55) because the EC nitrate directive says it must. But it
does not admit it signed this directive in 1991, knowing that it was based
on false statistics. If it had not signed, it would not be binding.
Its own statistics are that, if you lower nitrates, you increase the risk of
cancer. It has known this since 1985 (CMD 85/14 spells it out). It also says
that the level was based on World Health Organisation figures, which it must
obey.
The published WHO document (in 1993) states that the lower limit is solely
because of methaemoglobinaemia (blue baby syndrome); and it says that in
areas where there have been no cases over many years the limit need not be
applied. There have been no cases in the UK for more than 20 years.
The government has publicised that the reason for the new nitrate level is
because of cancer risk and blue baby syndrome - I have been to just such a
public meeting. It lies, and it knows it. A S Monckton,

FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not bottom of league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYNLEY SIDAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Fifth of UK companies expecting to relocate' (August 30),
stated that a recent survey by Black Horse Relocation placed Sunderland
second bottom in a league table of 40 best cities for relocation.
We are, of course, all aware of the limitations of statistics - I could
produce a survey by an equally reputable organisation which places this area
at the top of the league for attracting inward investors.
Perhaps the difference between the two surveys is that Black Horse spoke
only to UK companies. Could it be that UK businessmen are stuck with
out-of-date preconceptions about the north east? Foreign investors come to
the north east with an open mind and what they find is ideal sites, superb
workers and substantial help and encouragement from a range of regional
agencies and local authorities. In the last decade Sunderland has attracted
one of the UK's largest concentrations of Japanese and US companies and, as
'seals of approval' go, I don't think you can say fairer than that.
In the last 15 months TRW, the American components company, Lucas, the
British electronics company, and Goldstar, the South Korean electronics
giant, have all voted with their feet by moving into the city - creating
more than 1,200 jobs between them. The Bristol-based company, The Insurance
Service, has also just chosen to open in Sunderland and it plans to create
another 300 jobs over the next three years (ironically Bristol was top of
the Black Horse survey).
I hope it is now clear for all to see that Sunderland is the choice of
several of the world's leading companies who are capable of judging for
themselves without the burden of outdated prejudices.

FT  21 SEP 94 / NGOs rule OK: Politicians are widely regarded as unrivalled
in incompetence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is an NGO? A forest of hands shoots up in one corner of the classroom,
where the students doing the special course in 'global governance and
humanitarian diplomacy' sit. Elsewhere, blank faces.
How about this then: what is a quango? A smile of recognition spreads across
the class. Yes, a quango is a 'quasi non-governmental organisation'.
Logically there must have been NGOs before there were quangos, but somehow
the simulation has become better known than the real thing.
Both terms are cumbersome, which is no doubt why both are better known by
their acronyms. Why should one need to define an organisation as
'non-governmental'? Surely that must apply to the vast majority of
organisations that exist. Can one not take it for granted that organisations
are non-governmental unless otherwise specified?
It depends on the context. The reason you hear about NGOs mainly in an
international context is that until recently international relations was
presumed to be exclusively the affair of governments. In a domestic context
we think of bodies like Oxfam or Save the Children as simply charities. But
when they appear at a UN conference, or distribute western aid in Africa,
they become NGOs because in these roles we expect, or would in the past have
expected, to find government officials.
Conversely the term quango is better known in the domestic context because
it refers to bodies set up by governments in areas where they do not feel
entitled to act directly - areas which belong in some sense to the private
rather than the public domain. Those areas have greatly expanded in the last
20 years or so, with the advance of ideologies that seek to limit the role
of the state, and the virtual rout of those that cherish the state as an
organ of popular sovereignty and/or social engineering. What the
proliferation of quangos tells us is that, in practice, the state does not
find it easy to abandon its responsibilities, even when controlled by people
whose ideology commits them to 'rolling it back'.
It is perhaps a tribute to the success of that ideology that the two terms
carry opposite value judgments. NGOs, almost by definition, are good,
because government, almost by definition, is bad. Quangos are bad because
they are in fact governmental, though hiding behind the benign mask of
non-governmentalism. Or, to use another term that has lately become very
fashionable, after two centuries on the dusty shelf of political science
jargon, NGOs are part of 'civil society'. Quangos wish to be seen as part of
civil society, but are not.
As Ernest Gellner points out in his recent book on the subject (reviewed by
David Goodhart in the FT of September 3), the rise of civil society is
directly related to the fall of Marxism. Marxism sought to abolish 'the
separation between the social and the political'. It followed the path
charted by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in seeking to do away with any autonomous
organisation that might come between the citizen and the state. Civil
society, which could be defined as the sum of all such organisations, became
the key slogan of anti-Marxist intellectuals in the last years of communist
eastern Europe.
But they were up against an undemocratic regime. Against a government
imposed by force, non-governmental groups, formed by the free choice of
their members, could claim a superior democratic legitimacy. What is more
surprising is that a similar moral hierarchy seems to obtain in democratic
societies. One might suppose governments chosen by the people in free
elections would be in a quite different category from those imposed by
force. Yet apparently they are not. It has become a cliche to say that all
the democracies are affected by a crisis of legitimacy; that electorates
throughout the world are disillusioned, not just with ruling parties, but
with politicians as such.
Half a century ago it seemed obvious to JB Priestley - whose English Journey
the BBC has been rebroadcasting on Radio Four - that, if an industry was
badly run, a state representing the people had a right and duty to take it
over and run it better. One scarcely hears that argument now - certainly not
from Tony Blair's Labour party. We now assume that, however incompetent
capitalists may be, politicians would be worse.
We would rather entrust famine relief in Africa to a rock singer than to the
minister for overseas development. Yet the minister belongs to a government
we chose (even if, in the current British case, the minister herself was
rejected by her constituents at the last election and now sits in the House
of Lords). No one voted for Bob Geldof: he never asked anyone to. It is as
though the very act of asking people to vote for you is so demeaning as to
render you unworthy of their support.
In the area of humanitarian relief, NGOs have taken such a leading role in
some developing countries that they are now becoming unpopular, because they
are indeed quangos: armed with western government funds in countries whose
own governments are acutely dependent on it, or have collapsed, the NGOs
often both decide and implement what should be government policy. But their
own ideology is often well to the left of the western governments which give
them the money to spend.
Not surprisingly those western governments sooner or later find this
irritating. Conservative politicians can occasionally be heard to wonder why
these unelected do-gooders should be regarded as superior in virtue and
wisdom to themselves. But that is a rod conservatives have pickled for their
own backs.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: Timothy West's 'Macbeth' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACUALAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the last two Macbeths you saw were Alan Howard (National Theatre, spring
1993) and Derek Jacobi (Royal Shakespeare Company, winter 1993-4), then you
may well find it refreshing to turn to Timothy West (Theatr Clwyd, right
now). It is rare today to hear anyone speak Shakespeare so naturally (I wish
I had seen his Falstaff), and to hear an actor speak verse with such
communicative ease. His technique is virtually invisible: no bravura feats
of legato breath-control, no lieder-like strokes of special word-painting,
no here's-something-I-prepared-earlier calculation. He simply utters the
words, in calm phrases, as if he was thinking them for the first time.
So it sounds ungrateful to say that West almost never convinces as Macbeth.
His kind of naturalness is itself wrong, for it involves scaling the nervous
heights of the role down to a level too ordinary. Early on in the big dagger
soliloquy, he began to remind me of a housemaster confronting some baffling
disturbance in the corridor outside the dormitories; and, once I had seen
the resemblance, I could not shake it off.
He addresses the hallucinatory dagger with utmost reasonableness: how
strange that he cannot grasp the thing. Then, it hits him: this is indeed a
hallucination. Well, he is resigned to that; hallucinations do happen, after
all, in difficult circumstances; but we must all just buckle down and help
him through this trying time. When it comes to 'Nature seems dead', he can
darken his voice and enlarge his vision to something beyond the everyday.
But not for long. Even Banquo's ghost only disturbs him for as short a while
as possible. His spirit does harden, and he does grow distant from his wife,
and he wears his criminality with greater ease, yes; but the vast scale of
Macbeth's overwrought thoughts eludes him wholly.
Still, his way of speaking affords the simple and invaluable pleasure of
keeping our attention on Macbeth as it unfolds moment by moment. This
pleasure is provided nowhere else in Helena Kaut-Howson's staging. Everyone
works very hard indeed to project. Earnestness and eagerness hang heavy in
the air, but never dispel the production's basic dullness of spirit.
Alexandra Mathie (heroine of Helena Kaut-Howson's recent Jane Eyre) brings a
genteel vein of spinsterly anxiety to Lady Macbeth. As usual, the witches
are ghastly; these ones wail a great deal, thrash artificially around the
stage, and seem much more unhappy than Macbeth himself. (They reminded me of
the actress Kathryn Hunter even before I noted that she is listed as
Kaut-Howson's co-director.)
But nobody here seems to be in the same play as anybody else. The production
boasts some of the worst lighting - by Nick Beadle - I have ever seen.
Sometimes it tries to be naturalistic, as for the nocturnal scene after
Duncan's murder - and yet when the torches leave the stages, Malcolm and
Donalbain are left in as much stage light as before. Or it tries to be
eerily dramatic, as when Lady Macbeth is suddenly lit by sidelights and a
footlight to give three huge shadows; the effect, however, is one of tawdry
melodrama. Often the person speaking is none too visible. Pamela Howard's
designs have all kinds of unusual touches. I enjoyed the backpack Macbeth
wears, and the curious black-feather ruff his wife wears with her Victorian
tartan frock for the banquet. But my favourite was the pair of Eskimo boots
she wore for her first appearance.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: Comedy gets the specialist treatment - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comedy on television today is far more varied than it used to be which is
surely a good thing. However, even more than most programme areas, comedy is
becoming subject to political correctness which is surely a bad thing. If
you doubt the increased breadth of comedy consider It's Just A Ride, the
tribute to the late Bill Hicks screened 10 days ago by Channel 4. Even 10
years ago it would have been unthinkable for any channel to transmit this.
True, there was little, if anything, from Hicks' own material in this
programme which had not already been shown in the last few years on British
television, albeit late at night, but even on a second viewing it still had
the power to surprise. Many would describe Hicks, who died earlier this year
at the age of 32, as foul mouthed, and it is true that he used four letter
words with a frequency which virtually drained them of value. That alone
would have kept him off television until recently.
But Hicks' value was as a social commentator, even if some people found his
material more painful than funny. He was a comedian in the tradition of
Lenny Bruce and all those licensed jesters down the centuries who have used
their position and their flair to show us unpleasant truths about ourselves
and our societies. One of his fellow comedians, paying tribute in this
programme, said 'With me, I'd do a joke, then a little bit of truth; a
spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. But with Bill there weren't no
spoonful of sugar'. That is undeniable and consequently watching Hicks could
be uncomfortable, but the significant point is that today viewers can see
what was prohibited 10 years ago, and that is progress. Anyone offended by
his language could switch off at the first swear word. Nor is the increased
variety in comedy merely a question of access to 'stronger' material.
Where there used to be only two categories - situation comedy and stand up
comedy - we now have shows such as Have I Got News For You, Whose Line Is It
Anyway? and Clive Anderson Talks Back. Anderson began a new series on Friday
with an edition that showed off all his strengths: funny and flirtatious
with Goldie Hawn and startlingly honest with football expert Jimmy Hill and
comedian Jim Davidson, who readily admitted that he was willing to ridicule
anyone - 'Welsh women with beards, black people, daft Irish' and so on.
In this, Davidson now looks daringly old fashioned, even shocking, because
comedy is rapidly becoming the paradigm of political correctness. The irony
is that apartheid ('separate development'), so recently the number one hate
on every liberal agenda, is now being positively - some would say
obsessively - pursued by supposedly liberal broadcasters. We are given a
separatist comedy programme for gays, and a special enclave is set aside for
black comedians so that they can develop their own material within their own
culture, uncontaminated by whites. At this rate it will take the
broadcasters very little time before they start providing special series of
the sort described with such scorn by the late James Cameron (yes, lovely
liberal Mr Cameron - after all his years as a war reporter he saw humanity
with a sad but clear eye). When Channel 4 began, he declared that its more
'specialised' output seemed to be aimed at 'black lesbian social workers
living in Hull'.
If you really did make such a programme the target audience would probably
give it a phenomenally high 'RI' or Reaction Index, which is the
researchers' calculation of the viewers' appreciation of a programme. This
has always shown that the more specialised the appeal, the higher the RI.
Steam train freaks appreciate steam train programmes even more than soap
fans like Coronation Street. But however much homosexuals liked Channel 4's
Just For Laughs: The Queer Comics, and however much black people may enjoy
BBC2's black enclave The Real McCoy (well, some homosexuals and some black
people, anyway), they constitute only a minority of the viewing population.
In fulfilling their desires, what are the broadcasters doing to everybody
else?
For straight viewers Just For Laughs managed to be simultaneously
embarrassingly over defensive and irritatingly arrogant. On the one hand,
gays wanted pity because even their own parents did not understand them, and
on the other hand homosexual men want to be seen as superior to straight men
for all sorts of reasons - they understand women so well, for instance. The
Real McCoy, which excludes white people, features some performers who
certainly could hold their end up in a multiracial talent contest and others
who seem to get into this programme solely because their patois or some
other aspect of their material ensures that they will not be understood by
whites.
No doubt the broadcasters would claim indignantly that their motives in
making these programmes were of the highest, designed solely with the
interests of frequently persecuted groups in mind - precisely the claim made
by South Africa's late white government. But whether preached in
Johannesburg or London, the argument suffers from the same innate
condescension, the unspoken assumption that members of the group concerned
are incapable of making their way in the world without special treatment.
The odd thing about this belief, seemingly so widespread among broadcasters
today, is that all the evidence is against it. You only have to have one
Julian Clary starring in his own very explicitly homosexual series, and one
clearly black Lenny Henry starring in his, to prove that those with talent
can succeed regardless of whatever minority they may belong to. When the
non-black, non-homosexual viewing majority see the success achieved by Clary
and Henry without recourse to any special enclaves, what are they expected
to think about the abilities of those selected by the broadcasters to appear
in their blacks-only or gays-only programmes? The answer seems unavoidable.

Q: How do you justify writing 'New Series' on top of a collection of
repeats? A: You imitate the record industry, and package a lot of old
material under a title such as 'The Best Of'. Today BBC2 launches its 'New
Series', A Feast Of Floyd, containing programmes as much as 10 years old,
beginning with the episode in Provence where Floyd cooks fish soup (8.00).
That is followed at 8.30 by another 'New Series': University Challenge,
which is a mere 32 years old. Granada are still the producers, even though
it now appears on BBC2, but Bamber Gascoigne's place is taken by Jeremy
Paxman. In Trial And Error David Jessel produces new evidence in the case of
Raymond Gilmour, a man who, in 1981, was convicted in a Scottish court on a
majority verdict after confessing to police to the murder of a 16-year-old
girl. There was no forensic evidence, no evidence to corroborate his
confession, and the detective superintendent in charge originally rejected
the confession as false. Then a Serious Crime Squad was brought in, and
Gilmour confessed again (9.00 C4).

FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: Jane Austen adapted for the stage - 'Emma'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dickens translates well to the stage, Jane Austen does not. One jostles us
with a teeming kaleidoscope of places, people and events of almost grotesque
vividness, the other, as Charlotte Bronte disdainfully observed in a
brilliantly wrong-headed piece of criticism, is a Chinese miniaturist. The
narrator's ironic tone is all. Present the plot of an Austen novel as a
series of happenings, even with the help of the author's dialogue, and an
element is missing.
Mike Alfreds' production of Emma for the Cambridge Theatre Company
recognises the danger. As director-adaptor Alfreds seeks to remedy this not
so much through the occasional sound-track narration as with ironic devices
all the stage's own. Paul Dart's light set is paved with a Greek-revival
pattern inscribed with such Austenesque concepts as 'genteel address',
'principle', 'conversation', 'manners' - as well as such vices as 'folly'.
Inscriptions appear, too, as a sort of surtitle, on the back wall, setting
the scene or commenting: 'Marriage - a Grim Era', 'The Countryside - No City
Dust Here' and 'Night Waned - the Dawning'. Crossword addicts will detect
the anagrams.
Ultimately the play skims the novel's surface. This is in part due to
Anne-Marie Duff in the title-role, as yet lacking the ability to chart
Emma's sublime self-confidence and final chagrin, painfully achieving
self-knowledge as she meddles with other people's lives for their own good
and gets it all wrong. Emma should be stripped bare, as Walter Allen put it
in The English Novel, but this slightly monotonous young woman has little to
strip away. Like Juliet, the character needs to express youth, indeed
callowness, leading to transfigured maturity. The actress ably suggests the
bossy pushfulness that might have characterised the older Emma without her
emotional come-uppance and own good sense; beyond that an all-purpose
cheerfulness does not quite suggest the depth of Emma's involvement with
others or her own ripening feelings. The production reflects the ripples on
the pool of Jane Austen's society but fails to suggests the currents
beneath.
The appreciative Richmond audience laughed gently at the jokes, and there is
much to enjoy in the fluid transformation of crate-like chests into
furniture, carriages and even a grassy bank. At the moment not all the cast
(including Emma) is audible or sufficiently pointed, though Carolyn Jones is
funny and touching as humble, grateful, garrulous Miss Bates. Emma's father
is reduced to a running gag about hypochondria which Michael Elwyn pleases
the groundlings with mightily. Peter Hamilton Dyer's Mr Elton, the
fortune-seeking curate, is a rounded individual, not a set of mannerisms
which emphasise the Quality Street trap that Austen sets for actors. And
everyone could do with lessons in voice projection from Celia Bannerman who
brightened your critic's youth with a huge-eyed, heavy-lidded Bennett girl
in a television Pride and Prejudice. Her Mrs Weston is still radiant and
good-humoured, which is more than can be said for her admirer after all
these years.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: The South Bank puts in its bids for lottery money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Bank Centre, the UK's largest arts complex, re-launched itself yet
again yesterday. It presented a new image in expectation that its Pounds 65m
redevelopment plan for a brand new building (or rather the retention of most
of the existing ones, but covered by architect Sir Richard Rogers in a
transparent canopy) will be accepted as a worthwhile National Lottery funded
millennium project.
Research suggests that the very words 'South Bank' deter potential visitors,
so in future it will stress its constituent parts, like the Royal Festival
Hall and the Purcell Room. So welcome the abbreviated logo, SBC.
The SBC will also persevere in broadening its range of music. Audiences have
fallen from 80 per cent to under 60 per cent in the last two decades. In
future there will be less classical music but it will be better themed and
promoted. 'No bread and butter concerts - all jam', in the words of music
director Graham Sheffield.
To this end Pounds 150,000 will be spent on an advertising campaign aimed at
building a new audience: there has been a sharp slide in regular concert
goers. At the same time some of the outside bookings at the Festival Hall,
which were scheduled by tradition rather than the expectation of a large
audience, like youth orchestras and the annual NatWest concert, are being
encouraged to switch to the smaller Queen Elizabeth Hall.
Non-classical audiences are courted with jazz at the Purcell Room; all night
concerts of Indian music; and six nights of Shirley Bassey in early October.
Apart from the major Deutsche Romantik festival starting next week and a
Purcell tercentenary season, the SBC is marking time until it knows the fate
of its lottery bid. Sir Richard Rogers said yesterday that he aimed to
create 'a people's palace. This is the obvious bridge joining the southern
London community and the northern.' His reputation makes the SBC's
application for Pounds 45m from the lottery much more feasible.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Technology: Not in my back yard - Non-whites are more likely
to live near toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-whites in the US are more likely than whites to be living in an area
with a commercial hazardous waste facility, according to a recent US study.
The disproportionate exposure to pollution of blacks and Hispanics was first
acknowledged 10 years ago, but research shows that the problem of
'environmental racism' is worse today.
Yet the waste management industry is a vocal part of the emerging consensus
of businesspeople, environmental activists and government who agree that
'environmental racism' is a trend that must be reversed. But
African-American researchers say the problem continues to grow in spite of
the consensus and support for environmental justice in the Environmental
Protection Agency.
The study, Toxic Waste and Race Revisited, was sponsored by the Centre for
Policy Alternatives, the National Association for the Advancement of
Coloured People (NAACP) and the United Church of Christ Commission for
Racial Justice. It analysed 530 commercial 'off-site' hazardous waste
treatment, storage or disposal facilities operating in the early 1990s and
compared them with demographic profiles of postal code areas in the 1990
census report.
It showed that last year non-whites were 47 per cent more likely than whites
to live near a toxic waste site. In 1990 it was nearly 31 per cent; in 1980
it was 25 per cent.
Ben Goldman, one of the authors of the report, acknowledges that the study
does not explain the causes of the growing inequality, but says its findings
are a 'disturbing setback that is all the more disturbing because of all the
attention being paid to environmental racism'. The term was coined by
Benjamin Chavis, former NAACP executive director, after an environmental
demography report in 1987 showed evidence of a persistent link between toxic
waste sites and ethnic communities.
Last year, Irma Hunter Brown, a black representative in the Arkansas state
legislature, who lives near a toxic waste facility, pushed through the
Environmental Equity Act, which prohibits a new incinerator or toxic waste
facility within 12 miles of an existing site unless approved by the affected
community.
In the Albuquerque area of New Mexico, the South West Organising Project, a
non-profit environmental group, has been campaigning against the
disproportionate impacts of groundwater contamination and industrial air
pollution on the state's Hispanic communities.
Business leaders in waste management, who might be expected to dismiss
environmental racism as part of the same economic system which fails to
distribute wealth evenly, echo the environmentalists. Charles McDermott,
government affairs director for WMX Technologies, the global environmental
services company, says: 'Our society has not done enough to ensure
environmental equity.'
However, he disagrees with Goldman's methodology and says the Toxic Waste
and Race Revisited survey renders 'skewed results'. McDermott argues that
using large and irregular postal code areas as measures of community give an
inaccurate picture of the whole.
To provide a meaningful study, he suggests using census data that give
smaller boundaries of 4,000 people as a community. Research using this
method at the University of Massachusetts claims treatment, storage and
disposal facilities are more likely to be located in predominantly white,
industrial, working-class neighbourhoods.
Although McDermott endorses the University of Massachussetts research, he
agrees that 'environmental justice is a very real and serious problem'. He
points to the EPA's 1992 study on lead poisoning which found that in
low-income families, 68 per cent of African-American children suffer lead
poisoning, double the percentage of white children affected.
Another piece of EPA research, he says, has shown that in comparison to the
white population, a higher proportion of African-Americans and Hispanics
live in areas where air pollutants exceed federal limits for carbon
monoxide, sulphur dioxide and lead.
But McDermott cautions delicacy in dealing with the 'complex problem'. In
particular, he believes that dealing with the problem locality by locality
is the best way to protect America's communities. Rather than blanket
regulation industry by industry, he wants state licensing for waste
facilities to include requirements to assess the cumulative effects of sites
emitting pollutants over a single area.
The suggestion is shared by several prominent people on Capitol Hill. The
Environmental Justice Bill, which has yet to come to committee in Congress,
includes provisions to make permits for waste facilities issued by the
federal Environmental Protection Agency contingent on tests for cumulative
damage in the area.
The Clinton administration, which counts itself a member of the
environmental justice movement, pre-empted the legislation by issuing an
executive order last February to address environmental justice in minority
and low-income populations.
The EPA's environmental justice office has invested in education for
non-white communities to 'help them make better choices', but it shies away
from suggestions of siting regulation. Bob Knox, deputy director of the
Office of Environmental Justice at the EPA, says the road to environmental
equity, on which they have been travelling only two years, is a long one.
Discrimination and pollution were endemic for many generations. 'Remember
that the voting rights act was only 1965 and a lot of sites were placed
before that,' he says.
There is also debate over which is more important in contributing to the
problem: whether blacks are moving into low-cost housing areas where there
is already a build-up of polluting industries, or whether industry is
locating polluting factories in areas where there is a relatively high
proportion of non-whites.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Technology: Aerosol industry tries to clear the air - Now
that CFCs have gone, manufacturers are phasing out other harmful ingredients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you cannot be bothered to shine furniture, just spray the polish in the
air and the boss will believe you have done the job. This practice is one of
the many reasons why people love aerosols.
Except for Swedes and Finns, who prefer to roll on their deodorants, all
leading world markets are showing increased aerosol sales. The UK alone
produced 935m aerosols in 1993, up 6.25 per cent on the previous year,
according to the British Aerosol Manufacturers' Association.
There was a small dip in aerosol sales in the late 1980s as consumers became
more aware of the effect of CFCs. The drop was sufficient to prompt the
industry to look at alternative propellants.
'Our research across Europe confirms that since CFCs were removed from
aerosols, consumers are largely unaware of any remaining environmental
issues, such as recyclability, flammability, volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) and amounts of packaging,' says Paul Scott, environment consultant
with Dragon International, a corporate reputation consultancy.
'But the aerosol industry is addressing all the environmental issues and
some new products will show significant improvements in VOC emissions and
the ratio of packaging to usage,' he says.
VOCs are the vapours given off by a range of volatile chemicals used in
industry, such as solvents, and contained in consumer products, such as
house paint, petrol and those aerosols which use hydrocarbons (for instance,
butane) as a propellant or as part of the formula.
VOCs collect in the atmosphere and react with sunlight to form photochemical
smog and low-level ozone. These city smogs, which also drift into rural
areas, affect breathing and can be particularly harmful to young children
and the elderly. European countries have signed a UN treaty to reduce VOC
emissions by a third of 1988 levels, by 1999.
Industry is also looking at ways to reduce its VOC emissions. SC Johnson,
the multinational that owns leading cleaning, polishing and hygiene brands
such as Pledge, Glade and Mr Muscle, has taken a lead by replacing butane
propellant with compressed air in its Pledge polish spray. The company is
committed to reduce the ratio of VOCs to its raw materials by 25 per cent
between 1990 and next year. This will help the company meet the UN target.
Aerosol dispensers create a fine spray by propelling the liquidised product
through a small hole. The propellant is usually a liquid gas which occupies
the same space in the canister, sometimes separated from the product,
sometimes mixed, depending on the formulation. Press the release valve and
the pressure exerted by the gas forces the product up the spout and through
the nozzle. The gas evaporates, leaving the product to settle.
CFCs - non toxic and non flammable - were the ideal propellants until it
became known that they damaged the ozone layer. Hydrocarbon gases, such as
butane, were established propellants before CFCs were invented and they were
generally used to replace CFCs in household and industrial aerosols. Other
benign gases, such as nitrogen and nitrous oxide, are used in food and
personal hygiene products, but are unsuitable or too expensive for more
general use.
In the late 1980s various technologies were offered to provide aerosol
delivery without gas propellants. Few have been taken up. Most new
technologies required the reformulation of the products because CFCs and
hydrocarbons were integral to their performance, helping to disperse or foam
the product as it came out of the can.
Much hope was placed in compressed air. There were two possibilities:
pressurise the container when filling it, or provide a pump for the customer
to create the pressure for each spraying session. Hairsprays using the
pump-and-spray technology were launched in the late 1980s. But after an
initial take-up customers tired of pumping and reverted to traditional
aerosols.
The aerosol industry points to the market's rejection of pump-and-spray as
an endorsement of liquid-gas propellants. But cynics suggest that the
industry has failed to promote and develop the technology sufficiently and
is using the market's reaction as an excuse to use options that are less
environmentally acceptable.
Johnson argues that the customer will not tolerate any reduction in quality.
It has therefore taken the technically more complex route and used
compressed air in a pressurised container to propel its Pledge furniture
polish in much the same way as with butane.
Johnson set about overcoming the known problems of using compressed air,
especially the gradual reduction in pressure as the container empties. The
product was also re-formulated to work with the new delivery system. Solvent
is still used, but VOC emissions have been reduced by a third overall.
After five years of research and development Johnson perfected the
technology and converted its Dutch factory filling line, which serves
Europe. Compressed-air Pledge was launched in Italy and is being introduced
to other countries this year.
Philippe Darquier, vice-president, group director for Europe, says
compressed air will become the dominant propellant in the future. This is
good for the environment and Johnson's business. 'We see great commercial
advantage from being the first in,' he says.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Management: The divide Europe failed to bridge -
Anglo-German differences are still profound despite the single European
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The traditional differences between German and British management styles
were underlined this week by the first comparative study of middle
management in the two countries.
The report*, by the Anglo-German Foundation, looked at 60 German and UK
middle managers working in the brewing, insurance and construction
industries between 1991 and 1993. It found striking differences in their
qualifications, career paths, attitudes and their whole concept of
'management'.
The German managers saw themselves primarily as specialists who owed their
authority to their superior technical knowledge. They aimed to convince
others primarily by the content of their arguments, not their presentation.
They wanted consistency and punctuality, rather than personal drive or
enthusiasm, from their subordinates. They guarded their home life jealously,
kept rigidly to office hours and some even chose to 'clock in'.
In the UK, technical work was viewed as something that should be abandoned
in the search for promotion into management. British middle managers saw
themselves as scaled-down senior managers whose role was to take the 'larger
view'. They were comfortable with uncertainty and had a notion of the job
being 'what you make it'. Their subordinates were expected to display
initiative, responsibility and honesty.
They relied on persuasion and networking to win support and tolerated long,
relatively unfocused meetings. They were prepared to work late and at
weekends, but had few qualms about making private phone conversations or
visiting the bank or dentist during working hours.
The research found that qualifications played a larger part in propelling
people through the organisation in Germany. Those middle managers with only
a technical or commercial apprenticeship stayed in each job for an average
of eight years. Those with university degrees stayed in their positions for
an average of four years.
In the British companies, there was 'a striking willingness' to ignore
prescribed qualifications if the 'right candidate' did not happen to possess
them.
The British managers had greater internal job mobility, partly to avoid
stagnation and partly because jobs were less tied to qualifications. The
German managers were used to middle managers staying within the same
functional area of a firm through their working life.
The German companies put a greater emphasis on co-operation than their
British counterparts. In Britain, objectives were set up in a way that
fostered 'ownership' and accountability, rather than co-operation.
Structural, as well as cultural, factors played an important part in
explaining this gulf in attitudes. In contrast to the organic growth of
German companies, the UK companies were likely to have expanded through
mergers, making it more difficult to integrate functions.
As a result, the British managers tended to take part in more cross-over
meetings in steering committees, working parties and project groups. German
companies had at least one and sometimes two fewer tiers of hierarchy than
the UK ones.
One reason why German middle managers tended to identify downwards was that
industrial unions encompassed every type and grade of employee. Another was
that managers tended to share an apprenticeship background with their
workforce. This system instils occupational pride, reducing the onus on the
manager to motivate workers.
The findings of this report, which were discussed at a Coopers &amp; Lybrand
seminar this week, may have important implications for both nationalities
which go beyond the much-rehearsed arguments about the advantages of
vocational qualifications.
Rosemary Stewart, a fellow in organisation behaviour at Templeton College in
Oxford and one of the report's authors, urges British and American managers
to ask whether their emphasis on 'management' is overdone. 'Perhaps more
involvement in, and more knowledge of, operations would make for greater
effectiveness,' she says.
She also urges British managers to look at the more simplified organisations
of the German companies - possibly why Germans produce equivalent output
with fewer staff.
German managers may need more job mobility and could benefit from learning
from the experience of other managers. At a time of rapid change, German
managers may need to be more adaptable, flexible and innovative. Benedikt
Koehler, General Manager at Norddeutsche Landesbank in London, says: 'The
British style of management is superior when it comes to innovation.'
Bryan Rigby, chairman of the employment policy committee at the CBI and
trustee of the Anglo-German Foundation, sees changes coming as German and
British companies face up to similar pressures. 'The British are starting to
plan better,' he says. 'The Germans may be becoming more flexible and
adaptable.'
The single European market will help narrow the gap between management
styles, according to Alfred Kieser of the University of Mannheim, an author
of the report. 'A degree of convergence is unavoidable,' he says. 'But it
will take a long time.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / People: Consumers' champion to leave her Shelter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued turbulence at the Consumers' Association is guaranteed with the
appointment of Sheila McKechnie, currently head of the housing charity
Shelter, to the director's post at CA.
McKechnie, 46, will take over in January from John Beishon, who retires at
the end of the year after a controversial eight years in the post.
Beishon's abrasive style has not endeared him to many of the staff at the
organisation which publishes the consumer bible, Which? magazine.
Hostilities came to a head recently when union members at the association
went on strike over pay.
Insiders who had hoped, after Beishon's departure, for a return to the more
gentlemanly old ways will be disappointed. McKechnie, a forthright and
energetic Scot, has not been known to sidestep confrontation during her 10
years at Shelter.
It is just as well that CA is going to be kept on its toes; the number of
subscriptions to Which?, the organisation's main source of income, has
plunged to about 600,000 from a peak of nearly a million in the mid-1980s.
McKechnie is widely credited in the voluntary sector with having
re-established Shelter's role, bringing it back into the limelight after a
period of languishing in obscurity. Her job now will be to update Consumers'
Association's appeal to today's increasingly sophisticated consumers.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Management: Capitalism on the steppes - Kenneth Gooding
visits a Kazakhstan gold mine - one of the first to use western-style
business techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a country where you discover that the office manager is a prominent
heart surgeon. He can no longer afford to follow his profession because it
does not pay enough to support him and his family.
This is a country where the plant has a 'vodka room' rather than a vending
machine dispensing tea and coffee. With vodka costing the equivalent of 5
cents for a full-strength bottle, it is a cheap perk.
This is a country where prices have risen 20 fold since 1989 so there are
not enough bank notes to go round. For the past six months most
public-sector workers have instead been given vouchers to exchange for food
and other essentials. Sometimes cheques are issued to top up the vouchers.
But the local banks do not have any money to honour them.
This is Kazakhstan, once part of the former Soviet Union.
Mark Wilson, who has worked for mining companies in many western countries,
says managing in Kazakhstan is different from anything he has previously
experienced.
He found it difficult to adjust to the fact that while people were well
educated - it is claimed that the literacy rate in Kazakhstan is higher than
in the US - they had not been taught to show initiative or be willing to
take responsibility.
Set Kazakhs a target and they will attempt to achieve it, even when common
sense suggests that pressing on regardless could have costly, even
disastrous, results. For example, at first Wilson found his employees would
keep a machine running at full stretch to achieve production targets,
ignoring all warning signs that it needed attention until it ground to a
noisy halt.
It was also impossible to persuade any Kazakh to admit mistakes. Wilson
recalls one frustrating conversation with a group of employees after
something had gone wrong. 'Ok, who stuffed it?' he inquired. All heads were
shaken. He said: 'Well, it couldn't have been me, I was in bed.' They
brightened. 'Ah] Then you must have dreamt it.'
After decades of Communist rule, when everyone was promised cradle-to-grave
care, many Kazakhs do not understand the western approach to work, Wilson
suggests. 'Why bother to turn up for work on time and why stay sober after
lunch when you get the same treatment and pay, no matter what?'
The first time he fired someone for persistent lateness and drunkenness,
policemen were at his door early the next day to tell him he could do no
such thing. Wilson had a hard time convincing them that the man was working
for a privatised company and could be fired.
Wilson is project manager at the Bakyrchik Gold joint venture, one of the
first in Kazakhstan to involve western capital and management. For the past
year he has overseen the installation of new process plant to extract gold
from the ore at the Bakyrchik gold mine, on Kazakhstan's north-eastern
steppes, 1,000km from the capital Almaty.
In the past, Russian metallurgists had tried various ways to extract the
gold without success. They settled for sending the ore to nearby copper
smelters so the gold could add value to the concentrate they produced. But
this meant that the arsenic in the Bakyrchik ore went up the smelter
chimneys into the atmosphere.
Wilson applies western psychology when attempting to instill the 'fair day's
work for a fair day's pay' concept. He suggests that if you have to fire a
Kazakh employee, it is a good idea to wait until he or she has collected a
first pay packet at the end of the month. That way the employee knows what
rewards are available provided the rules are followed.
Bakyrchik joint venture employees are paid cash, not vouchers. They earn an
average of Dollars 100 (Pounds 64) a month, which in theory is about 20 per
cent more than the gold miners who are still employed by the state precious
metals organisation. But the miners are having to make do with vouchers.
Many of them cannot wait for the time when the joint venture takes over the
mine as well.
Wilson is helping to spread the capitalist message. Already about 20 per
cent of the joint venture employees have been persuaded of the benefits of
having savings accounts in local banks and regularly deposit 70 per cent of
their earnings in them (personal tax rates are very low). As there is little
to buy in the small town of Auezov, the frontier town next to the mine,
Wilson arranges buses to take employees to Semipalatinsk two hours away by
road, where there are at least a few goods in the shops or on sale in the
markets.
The relative affluence of the joint venture employees has divided the local
community. Those who work for the western-managed company are given the cold
shoulder by the rest of the town.
Recruiting is a problem because local people are not used to the idea that
they can be fired if they do not perform adequately. Wilson used to ask an
employee who had been working well if he or she had a friend who might be
interested in joining the joint venture. That does not work any more
because, when newcomers did not meet requirements and were fired, they
frequently blamed the friend who recommended them for the job.
The venture needs two more drivers, Wilson says, and he knows his personal
driver has two out-of-work brothers with driving licences. But his driver
will not ask his brothers if they would like to join Bakyrchik. 'He says
that if they do not measure up and I have to fire one or both of them, I
will be angry with him,' says Wilson.
There have been some cost benefits to operating in Kazakhstan, according to
Wilson. Some tanks in the new plant are made of titanium, bought at a cost
of Dollars 16 a kilo compared with the Dollars 110 it would have cost to
have them delivered from the US. The joint venture's ball mill was bought
locally for Dollars 93,000 compared with the Dollars 650,000 it would have
cost in the west.
On the other hand, Wilson points out: 'A light bulb you could buy in the
west for a few pennies costs Dollars 10. And it is impossible to get a
toothbrush here, or a toilet roll.'

Robert Wilkinson (above), the Stock Exchange's surveillance supremo during
the 1980s, has joined the board of Tradepoint Financial Networks as a
non-executive director.
Tradepoint, whose founders include a core of former Stock Exchange
electronic systems gurus, intends to operate as a screen-based system for
the trading of equities and other financial instruments in direct
competition with the Stock Exchange.
It plans to become a Registered Investment Exchange, like its competitor, a
regulatory status which will require it, among other things, to maintain a
surveillance function to detect market manipulation and to ensure that its
own requirements for listed companies and members are met.
Wilkinson says he will be assisting Tradepoint in setting up a surveillance
capability, familiar territory to him.
In 1966 he joined WI Carr and Co and subsequently became an equity partner.
In 1978 he was elected to the Stock Exchange Council, serving a term on the
Financial Accounts Committee which monitored members' solvency. 'It was not
a popular committee,' he recalls. In 1981 he became Stock Exchange Inspector
and, in 1984, the Exchange's first surveillance director, a post he retained
until retirement in 1991.

Capital Shopping Centres, the property company which made its Stock Exchange
debut in March, has found a new managing director in Douglas Leslie.
Leslie, 47, will join CSC from commercial property agents Donaldsons, but
spent 17 years with British Rail up to 1992. He is credited with developing
retail outlets in stations and having a hand in the development of numerous
shopping centres and offices on BR land.
Having never worked for a quoted company, though, he is unknown to most
investors and stock market analysts. CSC's shares have fallen to 209p from
its 230p offer price.
'He will need to be strong to stop the company becoming another corner of
Donnie Gordon's empire,' commented one analyst. TransAtlantic, the property
and insurance company also chaired by Gordon, holds 75 per cent of CSC's
shares.
But Gordon says the new md will have a free hand. 'He is very strong and
shows great poise,' he said. 'I don't have time to deal with the fine
details of a shopping centre operation.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / Recruitment: Counting the cost of out-of-sight employees -
Formulas for equitable expatriate employment packages need to address
broader issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expatriate employee from the UK can cost a company nearly three and a
half times that of his home-based counterpart, according to findings
published by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The EIU, the business intelligence arm of the Economist Group, has launched
a new service designed to help human resources management in multinational
companies reduce the costs of cross-border staff relocation and pay. The
service, which is regularly updated, draws on computer-based systems
collating tax and pricing information and living costs in 100 cities
worldwide.
The service will place the EIU in competition with other specialist
information services covering the expatriate field. These include P-E Centre
For Management Research, Organization Resources Counselors, Employment
Conditions Abroad and AIR Inc, of Boston in the US.
All these information services have identified a growing need among
companies and individual employees to find suitable comparisons and data for
creating overseas employment packages.
The multiple of three and a half times UK assignment costs is for employees
working in Tokyo, said the EIU. Other multiples it has published include
Paris (a multiple of three), New York (2.2) and Frankfurt (2.1).
'Given the increasing globalisation of business, these costs are a real and
growing issue,' said John Nichols, the EIU's human resources development
manager.
'For example, a London based employee on an annual salary of some Pounds
50,000 a year could cost his company up to Dollars 500,000 over a two-year
period when relocated to New York, assuming a traditional expatriate
package,' he said.
What does that typical package look like? The EIU, using an example of a
two-year assignment in France, gives the percentage split of costs as: 31
per cent employee's tax and social security, 22 per cent employer's social
security, 23 per cent expatriate benefits, 17 per cent net to the employee,
3 per cent in other benefits, and 4 per cent in one-off assignment costs.
Nichols says that, traditionally, companies have been prepared to 'build up'
pay for an assignment using the premise that the employee should be no worse
off than had they stayed at home. The use of incentives to move and the
addition of housing allowances, plus the rents employees can often get to
cover their UK mortgage payments, means that the expatriates are often
considerably better off.
Today, however, companies are becoming more cost conscious on expatriate
deals. 'These days they are requiring that the cost of living measurements
truly reflect the high cost of living and not the cost of high living,' said
Nichols.
Before human resource managers nod too vigorously in agreement, they should
note that employees with families in particular, are sometimes in danger of
losing out financially if they go abroad.
Organization Resources Counselors found that three-quarters of the 112
European, North American and Japanese multinational companies that replied
to a survey of human resource practices said they had no policy that
accounted for the loss of spousal incomes when paying expatriate employees,
nor did they intend to develop one.
On average, 15 per cent of companies said they were considering a policy and
10 per cent already had one. Breaking the survey down further, the greatest
enthusiasm for such policies appeared to be in the UK, said ORC.
Geoffrey Latta, vice-president of ORC's compensation services said:
'Companies recognise that this is a growing problem and are very concerned
about the potential costs of replacing lost income.
'If an expatriate's spouse is a lawyer or an investment banker, does the
company want to compensate for lost earnings? Doing so would make an already
costly process exorbitantly expensive. Professional couples may increasingly
opt out of international assignments, or we may begin to see more
long-distance commuter relationships.'
Rent-a-boss
Evidence that the market for temporary executives and the pool of available
experience is continuing to grow has emerged in a survey of 2,000 temporary
executives registered with Executives on Assignment, a Slough-based company.
Of the 1,200 who responded, nearly half of them had worked at director level
in their last permanent job. Some 12 per cent of the respondents were former
chief executives.
Executives on Assignment estimates the market has grown by 20 per cent in
the last year, although Bob Snell, managing director, admitted this was a
guess based on increased activity reported in his and other companies.
There is also evidence that companies are beginning to use interim
management more imaginatively. Richard McKeown, a company secretary featured
in this column a few months back, has so far successfully planned his career
in interim management with no intention of taking full-time work.
His latest posting appears to reflect a new trend among users of interim
managers. Instead of filling a gap between appointments which has been the
normal type of short-term post, he has been taken on to allow the full-time
company secretary time out to take part in a specific project. Snell said
that another trend among some chief executives was to use interim managers
as a means of employing a senior manager without taking the risk of
appointing the wrong person and the attendant cost of removal.
Martin Wood, director of interim management at PA Consulting, a London-based
consultancy, has found that companies are beginning to use interim
management as a strategic tool. He quoted a large company in the food
retailing sector which was taking on an interim manager to run a division
which needed a rationalisation programme. When he leaves, the new full-time
appointment will be a much less important and therefore lower paid job. 'The
interim manager will be more objective about what needs to be done,' said
Wood.
He adds that small private companies with turnovers of between Pounds 5m and
Pounds 10m are also starting to use interim managers where there is a
management succession problem or where an experienced manager has left to
set up in competition.
Earn as you learn
What sounds like the closest any employer has yet come to utilising a degree
course for an immediate gain has been developed by Coca-Cola Schweppes
Beverages (CCSB), the joint venture bottling company.
The company has recruited 100 university aspirants aged between 18 and 22 as
soft drinks merchandisers. At the same time they will be carrying out a
four-year study course for a BSc degree in Management from London
University.
Students in the 'earn as you learn' scheme have been recruited on a starting
salary of Pounds 7,500 a year plus a company car. While all needed to fulfil
the A-level criteria for the university course, they were selected in a
company assessment programme from 5,000 applicants.
The students will be working in 12 merchandising teams across the UK. Keith
Dennis, CCSB's personnel director who designed the programme at the
instigation of Derek Williams, CCSB managing director, says the company
plans to recruit a further 50 students next year.
All are on four-year contracts and their job specifications entail a weekly
input of about 35 hours on the job plus about 20 hours in study time for the
degree. They will study from home, under a distance learning arrangement
administered by the National Extension College.
Dennis said: 'Beyond the four years I clearly hope that a number of them
will continue with the company. At the end of that time, they should have a
degree from a good university and four years experience with a blue chip
organisation under their belt and no negative equity.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Lib-Lab pact talks may
start next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has begun to sketch out his
terms for a future partnership with Labour, believing the parties could
combine to defeat the Tories at the next election.
Mr Ashdown has been unwilling to publicly discuss relations with other
parties at this week's conference. But he is understood to believe that Mr
Tony Blair's election as Labour leader has created an opportunity to
transform the landscape of British politics.
Amid clear divisions within his own party and serious doubts over Labour's
response, the Liberal Democrat leader is determined not to rush into the
arms of Mr Blair.
But he has set out a series of conditions which Labour must meet before he
would consider serious co-operation. They include unequivocal backing for
proportional representation, a stance the Labour leader has so far refused
to adopt.
There is acknowledgement too among senior party figures that the extent of
any rapprochement will depend on the attitude which Labour adopts towards
the Liberal Democrats.
They demand that Labour local councillors must co-operate with their Liberal
Democrat counterparts, abandoning the alliances they have made with Tory
candidates in some town halls.
There is also an insistence that Labour must make clear its commitment to
political 'pluralism' and the principle that it will back the policies of
other parties.
If there is movement on these issues, Mr Ashdown does not rule out the
possibility that the parties could begin informal contacts on tactics and
policies next summer.
One possibility might be for the Liberal Democrats to indicate support for
particular items of legislation put down by a Labour government.
To this end, Mr Ashdown is understood to have asked Mr Charles Kennedy,
outgoing Liberal Democrat president, to examine whether the parties could
join forces in areas including constitutional reform and the promotion of
social justice legislation.
But Mr Ashdown is also understood to believe that there is scope to create a
more formal pact with Labour in the longer term, which could involve joint
selection of parliamentary candidates. In the event of a hung parliament
Liberal Democrat MPs could be included in a Labour cabinet.
In a speech to the party conference yesterday, Mr Kennedy also hinted that
the party leadership was developing a strategy of wooing Labour while
setting out clear conditions for co-operation.
He said that within the Liberal Democrat party 'there is the capacity to be
complimentary over other leaders'. He said: 'Pluralism in politics is a good
goal,' but 'you can only guarantee that goal by proportional
representation'.
Labour leaders have refused to entertain any idea of co-operation with Mr
Ashdown.

Delegates approved a resolution calling for a statutory licensing system for
the private security industry.
Mr David Heath, chairman of the Avon and Somerset police authority, led
complaints about the ease with which 'cowboy' operators were able to set up
businesses.
At the moment, he said, a man could walk out of Wormwood Scrubs prison,
equip himself with a peaked cap and an alsatian dog and call himself a
private security controller.
Mr Alan Beith, party spokesman on home affairs in the Commons, attacked Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, for transferring his department's
traditional responsibilities to the private sector.
He endorsed warnings by other constituency delegates that permitting private
security companies to mount street patrols could lead to vigilantes taking
the law into their own hands.
Mr Beith said: 'Privatisation of the work of the police is a particularly
dangerous trend.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Leaders defeated over
minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat conference yesterday defied its own party leadership
and aligned itself with Labour by backing the introduction of a system of
minimum hourly wage rates.
In the latest defeat in what is proving a distinctly uncomfortable
conference for party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown, activists rejected the
unanimous view of their 23 MPs that the Liberal Democrats should give
priority to market inflexibility over direct intervention in setting wage
rates.
The decision came as Mr John Monks signalled his determination to widen the
trades unions' range of political contacts by becoming the first TUC general
secretary to visit a Liberal Democrat conference. Mr Monks, who told a
fringe meeting that he wanted the party to move further in recognising the
legitimate trades unions, also plans to travel to the Tory conference in
Bournemouth next month.
During the employment debate at the conference, Baroness Williams, formerly
Labour minister Mrs Shirley Williams, led the rebellion against Mr Ashdown
over the leadership's attempt to limit government intervention on wages to
the creation of a low pay commission which would investigate individual
cases of exploitation.
Lady Williams' support for an alternative plan for the commission to set
minimum hourly rates - varying across regions - ensured it secured the
overwhelming backing of party activists. In spite of Mr Ashdown's call at
the start of the conference for the party to acknowledge the need for the
maximum possible flexibility in labour markets, the conference accepted Lady
Williams' judgment that a minimum wage would not hit jobs.
She told delegates that as long as it was set at a modest level - the
present suggestion is for one equivalent to 35 per cent to 40 per cent of
average earnings with variations between regions - a minimum wage was likely
to create jobs.
Mr Ashdown and his colleagues sought to put a brave face on the conference's
support for a plan he had earlier described as 'far too prescriptive, far
too centralised'. They insisted the approach agreed yesterday still pointed
to a much more flexible system than the fixed nationwide rate proposed by
Labour.
The leadership pointed also to separate plans approved by the conference as
evidence of the party's commitment to a dynamic labour market. Among the
proposals agreed at the conference were cuts in employers' National
Insurance Contributions to encourage companies to take on more workers, and
the introduction of a refundable training levy.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Treasury spokesman, said he expected the conference
formula to be incorporated into party policy at the next general election,
while Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, suggested Mr Ashdown had
wrongly seen the issue as a test of his personal authority.
Mr Monks welcomed the decision as a step in a direction of a national
minimum wage.

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Motion to scrap monarchy
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal Democrats yesterday voted by an overwhelming majority against a
policy of abolition of the monarchy, but called for 'a radical trimming' of
the royal family's budget.
In the first debate at a political party conference on the issue, several
speakers argued that the monarchy should be discontinued after the reign of
the present Queen because hereditary rule was unacceptable in a modern
democracy.
But delegates were strongly swayed by the argument that the party's standing
with the public would be badly damaged if it backed abolition.
Several party MPs had privately expressed concern that, after voting to
decriminalise cannabis, Liberal Democrats risked antagonising public opinion
by passing another unprecedented resolution.
Opening one of the best-attended debates of the conference, Mr Alex Wilcock
of Liberal Democratic Youth and Students said all government posts in a
democracy must be open to everyone, elected by the public and subject to
regular scrutiny.
'The monarchy fails on all these counts,' he said.
Another speaker, Mr Norman Baker, said he could not understand why a member
of the royal family like the Duke of Gloucester should receive an annual
salary of Pounds 100,000. 'You can tell a lot about a country that has a
Royal Mint, but a national debt,' he said.
However, Mr Archie Kirkwood, the party's chief whip in the Commons, appeared
to win over many of the delegates by arguing that they needed to attack the
abuse of power by government ministers rather than royalty.
Deciding not to call for the abolition of the monarchy 'subject to a
referendum', the conference instead called for a cut in the size of the
Civil List and 'the redefining of the roles of members of the royal family
apart from the monarch'.

Delegates approved a new policy statement on Northern Ireland in spite of
continuing doubts over the permanence of the ceasefire declared by the IRA.
The statement called for a power-sharing executive in Ulster, with
cross-border agencies providing an 'Irish dimension'.
Lord Holme, who played a leading role in framing the new policy, urged the
US authorities to join the British government in pressing for further
clarification.
He suggested that they should 'squeeze out' of Mr Gerry Adams, leader of
Sinn Fein, the word permanent or something akin to it before granting him
another visa.
A sharply contrasting view was expressed by Ms Mary Harney, leader of the
Progressive Democrats in the Irish Republic. In her role as guest speaker Ms
Harney said she had concluded that, even if the IRA was engaging in a
face-saving exercise, it would be 'ungenerous and churlish' not to recognise
that lives were still being saved.
Mr John Roberts, chairman of the party's Northern Ireland policy working
group, replied that it would be 100 times harder to achieve a long-term
settlement than it had been to win a ceasefire.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Reuters calls for trading to be open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the international information and news provider, has
joined the lobbying for securities regulators to insist on greater
transparency for trading on the London Stock Exchange.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
has asked market participants whether the exchange should alter rules which
allow long delays before the markets generally are told about large
transactions.
Also, the SIB is questioning whether marketmakers who deal with each other
anonymously via inter-dealer broker screens ought to have their deals made
public.
In the US, Reuters was instrumental in persuading the Justice Department to
require inter-dealer brokers in US government bonds to make their prices
available to the public via information providers such as Reuters itself.
Reuters is the parent company for several information providers such as
Instinet, which in the US has gained significant market share from the New
York Stock Exchange by acting as a bulletin board for the buyers and sellers
of shares.
In a long submission to the SIB from officials at its Instinet subsidiary,
Reuters argues that lack of transparency has raised transactions costs,
effectively discouraging the growth of so-called quantitative fund
management in the UK.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Subdued M4 points to weak inflation pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lending by banks and building societies to the private sector was subdued
last month, providing further indications that inflationary pressures in the
economy remain relatively weak.
Figures from the Bank of England show that lending by banks and building
societies - M4 lending - rose by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.9bn last
month. This was lower than the market consensus of a Pounds 2.2bn rise.
M4, the broad measure of the money supply which consists of notes and coins
as well as bank and building society deposits, increased by 0.4 per cent
last month compared with July. In the year to August M4 grew by 4.7 per
cent, down from 4.8 per cent in July.
Analysts yesterday admitted that the weakness of M4 was striking in light of
the overall strength of economic recovery.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets said: 'This
increase of Pounds 2bn is absolutely peanuts compared to the levels we saw
five years ago. This shows that this is not a recovery driven by demand for
credit.'
This patchy picture in the levels of lending was further underlined by
figures from the British Bankers' Association, which showed that lending to
the corporate sector continued to fall last month.
Overall lending by the main British banking groups to the private sector
rose to Pounds 1.6bn last month, up from Pounds 1.5bn in July.
However, lending to the non-financial companies sector fell, as the
corporate sector, which is now increasingly cash rich, continued to repay
its debts. Manufacturers repaid Pounds 185m in August, while property
companies repaid Pounds 227m.
Lending to individuals, in contrast, rose by Pounds 836m last month,
compared with July, while consumer credit rose for the fifth successive
month, with a Pounds 236m rise over July.
Personal deposits fell by Pounds 748m. Lord Inchyra, director general of the
bankers association said: 'The combination of a further increase in consumer
credit and a substantial fall in personal deposits suggests that consumers
may now be feeling the effects of higher taxation.'
Lending to financial companies also rose, with a Pounds 197m rise in the
level of lending to insurance companies and pension funds.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of water in the UK is the sixth-highest among leading industrial
countries, a new survey by National Utility Services has found. British
consumers pay 58.67p per cubic metre compared with 109.93p in Germany, the
most expensive country surveyed.
The UK's water price increase in the year to July of 4.7 per cent was the
fourth largest after Germany (8.5 per cent), the Republic of Ireland (6.7
per cent) and the Netherlands (5.8 per cent).

FT  21 SEP 94 / Power equipment recovery picks up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism about business conditions is rising among makers of electrical
installation equipment after one of the most severe and prolonged recessions
for many of them, Mr Stephen Lawson, president of the Electrical
Installation Equipment Manufacturers' Association, said yesterday.
Demand in some areas of the UK market for plugs, sockets, circuit breakers
and other equipment fell by 40 per cent during the recession but the patchy
recovery of 12 months ago had strengthened, albeit slowly and unevenly, he
said at the association's annual lunch.
The upturn in the construction industry had boosted sales of electrical
equipment, although construction activity was still down on pre-recession
levels.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Mortgage lenders to identify charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borrowers should be given clearer information about the valuation and
administration fees which mortgage lenders charge, the Council of Mortgage
Lenders said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
The council's decision followed pressure from the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, which reported in the spring that competition was being
distorted by the failure of some lenders to tell borrowers about the
administration fees that might be included with valuation fees.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said lenders would
now identify separately their charges for arranging a mortgage and the
payments to surveyors to valuations.
The MMC inquiry began more than two years ago after complaints that lenders
refused to take valuations from independent surveyors and used only small
lists of approved valuers.
Sir Bryan said that in a separate move the council had also adopted an MMC
proposal that where a lender would accept valuations only from certain
valuers this should be made apparent at an early stage.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Rail talks start today as employers cope with disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations will start today in moves to resolve the three-month rail
signal workers' dispute.
Officials from Acas, the independent conciliation service, held talks
yesterday at the headquarters of both the RMT transport union and Railtrack,
the state-owned company responsible for administering the network's
infrastructure.
The decision to restart talks follows Monday's decision by the RMT executive
to back a return to the negotiating table.
Union officials insist that there must be two sets of negotiations in
parallel. One would deal for the first time with the complex and
far-reaching restructuring package designed to modernise the work of the
signal workers. The other would be concerned with the union's original pay
claim for an 11 per cent wage increase for its signalling members for past
efficiency achievements.
Railtrack would have preferred the RMT to call off Friday's planned one-day
strike as a sign of goodwill but the company did not make this a condition
for the start of the negotiations.
The company is also unhappy about the RMT's decision to hold 48 hours of
disruption from September 29 and it hopes at least an interim deal can be
ready before the end of next week.
A survey of 200 central London employers has found that a third of them have
had production disrupted by the strike, Richard Donkin writes.
Most, however, have been learning to live with the strike, the Institute of
Personnel and Development, which carried out the survey, says.
Only 6 per cent of the employers said the strike had significantly affected
their operations; 30 per cent reported some effect and 63 per cent said
disruption was minimal.
Employees are also finding ways of circumventing the strike disruption. At
the beginning of the strike more than 13 per cent of the survey companies'
employees failed to get to work. The proportion has now fallen to 3 per
cent.
The most popular methods used by companies to minimise disruption involve
allowing staff to work from home, practised by 75 per cent of companies in
the survey; providing overnight accommodation, adopted by 43 per cent; and
providing buses for employees, used by 18 per cent.
Some 43 per cent of the employers were compensating staff for extra costs
incurred in getting to work. Half of the employers, however, expected staff
who found themselves strike-bound to take their absence as annual leave.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Alcohol retailers lobby for halving of duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beer drinker Kenneth Clarke will today meet a delegation from the Brewers
and Licensed Retailers Association, representing brewers and pub operators.
The delegation will ask the chancellor for a 50 per cent cut in beer duty in
November's Budget, Neil Buckley writes.
Brewers argue that only a cut of this size will solve the problem of
cross-Channel beer imports, now running at about 1m pints a day. The UK has
the second-highest duty regime in the European Union. The delegation, led by
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, and Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux
Group, will argue that a 50 per cent cut would not only lead to a recovery
in the beer market but would stimulate other associated revenues from the
industry - including other drinks duty, licence duty, value added tax and
corporation tax. This would lead, they say, to a Pounds 300m increase in
government revenues by 1997.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Travel companies hit timing trouble: A look at the effects
of launching next year's brochures during the summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Travel Trade Gazette dinner - a black tie affair at London's Grosvenor
House hotel - is usually an opportunity for the holiday industry to
congratulate itself on its outstanding performance.
As travel company executives gathered for the annual dinner last night,
however, many were prepared to admit they had got this year's marketing
badly wrong.
By Christmas, bookings for summer 1995 could be down by as much as 10 per
cent on last year. Some blame fragile consumer confidence, but several
travel companies said they must take some of the responsibility themselves.
Tour operators launched next summer's programme earlier than ever before -
in the first week of August, when a third of travellers had not even taken
this year's summer holidays.
Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the largest tour operator,
said sales of summer 1995 holidays had so far kept level with last year. But
there were signs, he said, that sales were slowing down. By Christmas he
expected them to be up to 10 per cent lower than last year.
Thomson was the first operator to start selling summer 1995 holidays,
publishing an 83-page brochure of family holidays at the beginning of
August. Airtours, the second largest operator, hit back by publishing its
full range of brochures, with 1,600 pages of holidays to destinations from
Turkey to Thailand.
Mr Newbold admitted that by launching brochures in August his company and
its competitors missed out on selling to people on holiday at the time. He
added, however, that there were competitive advantages - an early launch
means you can take market share off competitors.
Mr Peter Shanks, commercial director of Thomas Cook, the travel agents, said
that while he understood tour operators' desire to be first to market, they
managed to confuse both customers and travel staff. In August travel agents
were expected to sell summer 1994 holidays, winter 1994-5 trips and summer
1995 packages all at the same time.
Mr Shanks, who expected sales to have fallen 8 per cent by Christmas, said
some tour operators announced their programmes in such a hurry that the
brochures were not ready for another five days.
Mr Ian Smith, managing director of travel agents Lunn Poly, which is owned
by Thomson, said of the early brochure launch: 'It was a complete and utter
farce from the travel agents' point of view. You couldn't cope with the
number of customers coming through the door and people got disenchanted. We
also had a number of staff on annual leave.
'We would much rather see brochures launched in September or October. I
sincerely hope that the operators have learned something from this. There's
no competitive advantage in an early launch because everyone else then does
it too.'
In spite of the confusion caused by the early brochure launch, Mr Smith
disagreed with his colleagues about the effect it would have. He said demand
was strong and he did not believe sales would be substantially down by
Christmas.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, also predicted there would be no
slowdown in sales. Did he accept the criticism of the early brochure launch?
'Categorically not,' he said.
'He would say that, wouldn't he?' said Mr Francis Baron, chief executive of
First Choice (formerly Owners Abroad), the third biggest operator, which
published its brochures later than its two larger competitors.
Mr Baron believed the market would be 7 per cent to 8 per cent down by
Christmas. He said this was partly due to consumer caution about the
durability of the economic recovery but he added: 'The message this year was
very confusing. If you try to be too clever, consumers get suspicious.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / Watchdog wants more disclosure on investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Detailed plans for giving customers more information about investment
products such as unit trusts were set out yesterday in a paper published by
the Personal Investment Authority.
The watchdog for private investor protection is seeking comments by late
next month on applying a new regime to provide investors with more
information about certain investment products and about fees and charges.
At present the PIA intends the new regime to be compulsory from the
beginning of next year - the same starting date as the new disclosure regime
which will apply to companies and individuals selling life insurance
policies.
Although some companies that sell both unit trusts and life insurance are
keen to move to the new systems at the same time, others believe companies
should have more time to adapt.
The costs of producing the information in the form required are likely to
run into millions of pounds in total, but two factors will help to keep the
costs lower for life insurance disclosure.
The first is that much of the information must be produced anyway - the
change is primarily to the format. The second is that much of it can be
produced on a standard or specimen basis and does not have to be
client-specific.
The regime is intended to apply not only to unit trusts but also to offshore
collective investment schemes and certain personal equity plans.
The PIA believes that the information should come in the form of a 'key
features' document, as it will for the life insurance disclosure system.
While companies will have some freedom to use their own format, the document
must cover particular questions, for example how to follow the progress of
investments, and the impact of charges.
The aim of the new regime is to enable customers to make a fair comparison
between the different types of financial products available.
It should be simpler than the information that must be provided for selling
long-term life and investment policies but will have to be adaptable for
different ways of selling which are not allowed for life insurance - for
example through customers deciding to buy solely on the basis of an
advertisement in a newspaper or from direct mail.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Home loans fall raises housing recovery fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh reminder of the fragility of the recovery in the UK mortgage market
came yesterday with figures showing a slight drop in new net lending by
building societies in August.
The fall came before the impact of higher interest rates on home loans,
reinforcing fears among lenders that the housing market recovery might be
delayed until next year.
A fall in net new commitments - loans agreed but not yet undertaken - by
societies in August compared with July suggested that, even on previous
interest rates, prospects were at best flat.
This statistic is an important forward-looking indicator, since commitments
made in one month tend to translate into loans in the following few weeks.
Although the statistics - published by the Building Societies Association -
show that lending was higher than in August last year, that difference can
be accounted for by a change market shares won by societies as against
banks, rather than by growth in the market as a whole.
Last summer, societies' share of the mortgage market fell noticeably, as the
fixed-rate mortgages offered by banks proved particularly attractive.
Leeds Permanent Building Society, the fifth-largest, yesterday became the
latest society to increase its standard variable mortgage rate. It raised
the rate by 0.4 percentage points, taking it to 8.14 per cent.
The sharpest rise to date is from TSB, which has about 250,000 mortgage
borrowers. It raised its standard rate by 0.6 percentage points - more than
the recent base rate increase - to take it to 8.05 per cent from late
October.
Announcements from other large lenders are expected this week.
The BSA figures show new net lending at Pounds 1.13bn last month, compared
with Pounds 1.16bn in July and Pounds 814m in August last year. Net new
commitments totalled Pounds 3.02bn in August, compared with Pounds 3.24bn
the previous month, and Pounds 2.43bn in August 1993.
The figures underlined the need for lenders to strike a fine balance in
passing on higher rates.
They showed societies receiving net retail deposits of only Pounds 91m in
August, compared with Pounds 286m in July.
Mr Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, welcomed the fact that the figures
were the result of an inflow of retail funds, rather than one of the
outflows societies have suffered in many recent months.
However, he was cautious about future retail receipts, given the continuing
strong competition for personal savings.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Drivers to test system of traffic management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final stage of an ambitious traffic-management and driver-information
scheme which could eventually cover the motorway network was unveiled at the
Channel tunnel terminal in Kent yesterday.
The Pleiades project, partly funded by the European Union, involves the
collection of weather and traffic data for transmission to variable message
signs at the roadside and to in-car receivers.
Mr John Watts, roads minister, said: 'The response to transport growth
cannot be just to build more roads. We have to make better use of the roads
we have.'
Motorways in Kent are expected to carry increased traffic when the Channel
tunnel starts its car shuttle service next month.
The project is part of a wider evaluation of traffic management systems. Its
final stage involves trials to see how drivers make use of information in
their cars. Forty drivers will test the system over the next two months.
Traffic and weather information can be transmitted to the car's radio,
interrupting the programme being transmitted. The driver can punch a
destination into a dashboard console and a small display panel coupled with
a voice synthesiser will then provide details of the quickest route,
modifying it to take account of delays.
The cost of installing this sort of display is estimated at between Pounds
1,500 and Pounds 2,000 although the equipment is not yet available in the
UK.
Pleiades has cost Pounds 8m, of which half has come from the European Union.
The British government has spent a further Pounds 5m on upgrading motorway
information systems in Kent. Private sector partners in the project are
British Telecommunications, Ford, the AA, the BBC and Wootton Jeffreys, a
consultancy.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Lloyd's 'costly' advisers attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading underwriter yesterday attacked the 'amazing Pounds 500m per year'
that the Lloyd's of London insurance market spends on outside advisers who
assist in handling insurance claims.
Mr Mark Brockbank, who is chief underwriter to the largest Lloyd's
syndicate, told a conference in Singapore that the expenditure must be
reduced. 'Our control over these costs has, quite frankly, been lamentable,'
he said. 'However, I am determined that this situation should change.'
Lloyd's handled around Pounds 7bn in claims last year. Those involved in
claims assistance include lawyers, accountants, surveyors and loss
adjustors.
Mr Brockbank said: 'We must begin to set out formal terms of reference and
not be shy about discussing rates, estimates and, in certain cases, require
tendering in those we employ.
'In failing to do this we have been too gentlemanly. This cannot continue,
because while we have good relationships with many of our advisers, you are
our clients and it is you who end up paying the bill in future rates for
this approach.'
He said the NewCo project, a reinsurance company being set up by Lloyd's to
ring fence liabilities incurred before 1986, was a positive initiative which
would allow the market to keep control of its costs.
Mr Brockbank also urged underwriters to take 'a more proactive role in the
claims process' by appointing adjusters empowered to approve certain repairs
and expenses. While Lloyd's prided itself on paying all legitimate claims,
'unnecessarily delayed payment is almost as unacceptable as non-payment of
claims', he said.
In an interview later, Mr Brockbank identified legal fees as 'by far the
biggest cost component'. He also listed marine hull insurance as another
problem area for excess costs.
'We are just taking for granted how we do our business . . . This is an area
where we have to make some progress, and the sheer amount of money being
spent by the market will ensure that it is addressed.'

The state opening of parliament has been set for November 16. MPs are due to
return from the summer recess on October 17, leaving the government four
weeks to complete outstanding business from the 1993-94 session.
The only Commons business left to be dealt with is the criminal justice
bill, with MPs still to debate Lords amendments.
Peers have still to complete consideration of three measures: the European
Union accession bill, the deregulation and contracting out bill and the

Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, is expected to meet members of both
houses of the US Congress when he visits Washington next month. Mr Adams
yesterday applied for a US visa, George Graham in Washington writes.
Although congressional committees traditionally do not hold full hearings
for foreign visitors, Mr Adams is expected to meet members of the Senate
foreign relations committee for a 'committee coffee', and meetings are also
likely with members of the House of Representatives.
Other leading Northern Irish politicians have also been beating a path to
Congress's door. Mr John Hume was due to meet senators yesterday afternoon,
and a delegation of Ulster Unionists is to arrive in Washington today.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Northern Electric to shed 800 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric, the power company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, is to
shed 800 jobs, taking to 3,700 the planned cuts in the sector since the
electricity regulator announced a review of distribution businesses last
month.
The losses, to be spread over three years, are part of a restructuring that
will provide annual cost savings of Pounds 20m by 1997-98.
The company also announ-ced a tariff cut averaging 5 per cent from December
1 and said it expected to hold prices at that level through 1995 at least.
In addition the company said it expected cash flows to remain positive. It
would be moving towards sharing out earnings more equally between dividend
payment and company retention.
The job cuts drew strong criticism from unions which said they were further
evidence that electricity companies were putting the interests of
shareholders above those of customers and staff.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union, said:
'It will inevitably mean that standards of service will decline. One supply
company after another is laying off its workers to save money that can be
passed on in dividends to its shareholders.'
Northern is the fourth company to announce job losses since the regulatory
review. It follows Midlands Electricity and Norweb, shedding 1,200 each, and
Manweb, which is losing 500 staff.
Northern reduced its core staff by about 1,000, to 4,700, between
privatisation in December 1990 and the end of March this year.
All job reductions would be achieved through voluntary means. Northern made
no new financial provisions yesterday to fund the severances, although it
did not rule out doing so in the future.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said
yesterday after meeting Mr Bill Clinton, US president, in Washington that he
had asked for a new trade agreement between the US and Northern Ireland.
Mr Hume said before talks which included Mr Al Gore, the vice-president: 'I
am not just asking for money . . . I have specific interesting proposals to
help us with economic regeneration.' The proposals are believed to cover
duty-free entry to the US for some goods made in Northern Ireland and the
border counties of the Irish Republic and new tax arrangements for small
businesses to help boost exports.
Mr Hume is the first Irish politician to meet the president in Washington
since the IRA ceasefire. A party of Ulster Unionist MPs is leaving for the
US today while Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, yesterday applied for
a visa. Mr Adams is to meet Senate foreign relations committee members next
month. Meetings are also likely with House of Representatives' members.
Mr Adams said on Channel 4 News last night that Mr John Major had shown by
his behaviour over Northern Ireland that he was a 'Tom Fool'. He said Mr
Major was 'playing with words' in demanding that the IRA add the word
'permanent' to its ceasefire declaration.
George Graham in Washington writes: Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat
from Connecticut, met Mr Hume yesterday and is to meet unionists today. 'It
is very important that Congress and the executive branch be seen as
even-handed,' he said. 'My own view is that in the long term it's going to
be private-sector investment in Northern Ireland that is the most successful
catalyst for peace and stability.'
Mr Richard Holbrooke, assistant secretary of state for European affairs,
told a congressional sub-committee yesterday that a decision on further aid
to Ireland was likely next month.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Lonrho film sale probed by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is investigating whether Lonrho breached United Nations
sanctions by selling a film about the Lockerbie bombing to an Egyptian
company with links to Libya.
The outcome of the probe is likely to have an important influence on the
battle between Lonrho's joint chief executives, Mr Dieter Bock and Mr Tiny
Rowland.
Mr Bock wants to depose Mr Rowland, who took a personal interest in both the
making and disposal of the film.
Three weeks ago Mr Bock's position in the company was weakened considerably
when his fellow directors forced him to abandon a plan to propose at a board
meeting that Mr Rowland should be stripped of his executive powers.
He is likely to try to regain the initiative in the battle for power by
arguing to the international trading group's board that Mr Rowland is
responsible, if sanctions are found to have been breached.
The investigation into the film sale is being carried out by the Bank of
England's Sanctions Emergency Unit, whose role is to ensure that the
financial aspects of UN sanctions are not breached by UK entities.
Under the latest version of the sanctions, introduced on December 1 last
year, UK companies are required to seek the Bank's permission before
'parting with . . . investments to . . . a Libyan person (a company or
individual)'. The Bank's permission in this case was not sought.
The nearly completed film argues that the Libyans were not responsible for
the bombing of Pan Am flight 103. Its Pounds 632,948 budget was financed by
Lonrho's Metropole subsidiary, which is a third owned by the Libyan Arab
Finance Company.
Earlier this year, after Mr Bock complained about Lonrho's involvement in
the film, it was sold to a Cairo-based company, the Joint Arab International
Investment Company, or Jaico, for Pounds 200,000. On April 7, Barclays Bank
in Birmingham received Pounds 199,989 from the Cairo branch of Arab
International Bank, Cairo.
However, the signatory on the sale agreement on behalf of Jaico was Mr
Mohamed El Huwej, who is chairman of Lafico, the main investment vehicle of
Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader.
Because of this apparent connection between Jaico and Lafico, Mr Rowland was
formally requested by Mr Martin Bolland, Metropole's managing director, to
obtain a written statement from Mr El Huwej on his relationship with Jaico.

Dividend cover, the amount by which dividend payments are covered by
earnings per share, would move towards 2.0, the company said. Last year the
cover was 3.2.
The jobs announcement drew strong criticism from unions which said it was
further evidence that electricity companies were putting the interests of

Northern reduced its core staff by about 1,000, to 4,700, between
privatisation in December 1990 and the end of March this year.
The company's restructuring involves its core electricity distribution
business. The company will in future operate its distribution business
through two principal units, Northern Electric Distribution and Northern
Utility Services.
Northern Electric Distribution will manage the network while Northern
Utility Services will provide services including construction and
maintenance.
The company said the new business structures would enable it to provide
services with fewer staff than envisaged.
All job reductions would be achieved through voluntary means. Northern made
no new financial provisions yesterday to fund the severances, although it
did not rule out doing so in the future.

FT  21 SEP 94 / SNP gathers in good spirits after summer of successes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party gathers in Inverness for its annual conference
today with the spirits of its supporters high after a summer of electoral
successes.
The party has established itself as the second party in Scottish politics
after Labour and the conference is intended to outline to party members what
policies an independent Scotland governed by the SNP and within the European
Union would pursue.
Delegates will also hear the party's campaigning strategy for the years up
to the next general election, following on from its successes in this year's
regional and European elections.
The SNP won nearly 33 per cent of the Scottish vote in the European
elections, its highest level ever, and it added the North East Scotland seat
to its Highlands constituency. In May it took control of two of Scotland's
nine regional councils for the first time.
However, it narrowly failed to defeat Labour in the Monklands East
by-election at the end of June, in spite of a sharp rise in its vote.
The party's standing in the Scottish opinion polls has fallen back since
July when it reached a six-year peak of 30 per cent.
A System Three opinion poll at the beginning of September put the SNP on 24
per cent, well behind Labour on 55 per cent but far ahead of the
Conservatives on 12 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent.
Support for Labour in Scotland surged both after the death in May of John
Smith and later with the election of Mr Tony Blair as its leader. But the
SNP is portraying Mr Blair as a soft socialist who will adapt Labour's
policies to the wishes of the people of southern England rather than those
of the north.
The party is celebrating its 60th anniversary with a conference agenda which
contains few seriously controversial issues. The highlight is likely to be
the speech on Friday of Mr Alex Salmond, the party's leader.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Most large chains to sell lottery tickets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, the consortium which will launch the UK's national lottery on
November 19, has signed up most of the leading retail chains for its initial
network of 10,000 outlets where tickets will be sold.
The list includes branches of Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Safeway, WH Smith,
Menzies, Woolworth and the Co-op. Two of the missing names, Boots and Marks
and Spencer, did not want to get involved.
Esso and Shell garages will also have the computer terminals that issue and
validate lottery tickets. The tickets are expected to cost Pounds 1.
At least 55 per cent of the first 10,000 retailers will be independently
owned outlets, including grocers, newsagents, off-licences and post offices.
Mr Norman Hawkins, Camelot's commercial director, said yesterday: 'We are
confident that the retail outlets which form our launch network will enable
more than 80 per cent of the adult population in the UK to be within easy
distance of a lottery outlet at home or at work.'
The aim is to have more than 40,000 retail outlets by the end of 1996, with
the percentage of independents rising to 65 per cent.
The jackpot prize for the first live draw on BBC 1 on November 19 could be
as much as Pounds 2m. Larger top prizes are likely to follow when ticket
sales grow.
Camelot brings together the food and drinks group Cadbury Schweppes,
computer company ICL, the security printer De La Rue, Racal Electronics and
GTech, the US company which manufactures lottery equipment and runs
lotteries.
The consortium said it had put a great deal of effort into selecting its
outlets, which had to be in prime locations with at least 500 customers a
day and long opening hours. Retailers and their staff also had to be willing
to take part in detailed training programmes.
Camelot expects to sign a three-year television deal with the BBC later this
week. The Office of the National Lottery is set to confirm the details by
the end of next week.
The weekly programmes are expected to run for about 30 minutes and the BBC
is likely to make the programmes in-house rather than using an independent
producer.
If the lottery has revenues of more than Pounds 3.5bn a year - which is
thought possible - five good causes will get between 31.35 per cent and 34
per cent. During the period of the licence, which runs to 2001, the good
causes - arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport
 -could get a total of Pounds 9bn.
Camelot said yesterday that all aspects of the complex operation were on
schedule for the November launch.
Scratchcard games will be launched next year to back up the main lottery.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Street welcome turns sour as police wade in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A festive mood in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, turned sour yesterday
with a return of the political violence which has so often bedevilled the
republic.
Thousands of people took to the streets. Some wanted to watch the spectacle
of the US military operation as more troops rolled ashore; others wished to
celebrate what they believed was the end of military rule.
However, their jubilation was premature. Haitian police waded into a crowd
demonstrating against General Raoul Cedras, beating them and leaving one man
dead. US servicemen, working with the Haitians as their partners, had been
ordered not to intervene in domestic police business.
Although Operation Restore Democracy may have entered its second day without
a logistical glitch, domestic Haitian problems were already raising their
head.
Whether the US can end the operation as smoothly as it began will depend on
how it limits its role in reviving a decrepit political culture and a
bankrupt economy.
Huge crowds lined the mile-long quayside, jostling for a glimpse of the
trucks and jeeps rolling off US supply ships. At the airport, people clung
to the perimeter fence to watch the troops landing in vast C5 and C141
transport aircraft.
On the balconies and rooftops around the city, those residents not yet fed
up with the relentless drone watched convoy after convoy of low-flying
helicopters ferry army supplies to US positions.
By early yesterday morning, more than 3,300 US personnel had landed in
Haiti. With an amphibious landing at Cap Haitien later in the day to secure
a bridgehead in the north of the country, and commercial flights employed
with army aircraft to carry more people in, the number of troops was
expected to have at least doubled by this morning.
US troops fanned out from secure points through Monday night and during the
day yesterday to set up patrol stations. The American units have been sent
with French-speaking interpreters.
The intention is clearly to move towards multinational patrol groups,
including either a Haitian soldier or member of the UN coalition of forces
as soon as possible.
Before the violence of the demonstration altered the mood, the expanding US
presence inspired jubilation in some quarters.
Dancing celebrations gathered momentum quickly. In one instance, a group of
supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide rallied round a line of 10 US
trucks headed into one of the city's poorer districts.
As they walked, they chanted the increasingly common cry, 'mi no te Cedras'
('handcuff Cedras'). Soon the walk had turned into a skipping march and the
chant into a song, 'ba ma Aristide too suit' ('give me Aristide right now').
The group of hundreds grew to thousands who, having ripped branches from the
trees, waved them in a frenzy.
Observers were overwhelmed by big hugs, big smiles and the big promise that
'Aristide will bring peace, will bring money, will bring food'.
Up on the hills above the city, in the contiguous town of Petionville,
Haiti's wealthy elite remain sceptical that US forces will satisfy popular
needs or aspirations.
Many members of the Haitian bourgeoisie expect that an Aristide government
would be no better than rule by Cedras - and even, possibly, worse.
'One man is not a democracy,' said the manager of Haiti's only functioning
brewery.
According to his point of view, the Clinton administration has made a
miscalculation.
'This is not a human rights problem, there aren't cadavers piled up on
street corners. This is not a political issue alone. The problem is poverty
 -it is economics,' he said.

FT  21 SEP 94 / US armed forces sink their differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, PORT-AU-PRINCE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When US Army troops took off in helicopters from the deck of the aircraft
Eisenhower this week to land in Haiti, they were taking part in the first
full-scale experiment in getting the different branches of the armed forces
to work together more flexibly.
Although the landing was not opposed, it provided an operational test for
the Pentagon's new concept of Adaptive Joint Force Packages, intended to
break down the traditional demarcations between the various services' roles.
Amphibious assaults have in the past been the province of the marines, who
operate under the navy's flag. Yesterday the marines took over the city of
Cap Haitien, on Haiti's north coast, in a traditional amphibious landing
from the assault ship Wasp.
But the main landing in Port-au-Prince came from the 1st Brigade of the
army's 10th Mountain Division, using the Eisenhower as a 'lily pad', in the
words of Captain Alan Gemmill, the carrier's commander, for their Blackhawk
and Cobra helicopters.
This is believed to have been the first time that aircraft carriers have
deployed for hostilities without their air wings.
Service rivalries have been a pervasive problem for the US armed forces,
which still maintain separate air forces for the navy, marines and army,
quite apart from the air force itself.
Each service's insistence on developing its own equipment has greatly
increased procurement costs, and co-operation on joint operations has
sometimes broken down. But budget constraints have made each branch eager to
demonstrate its flexibility. The navy has a stake in showing its 12 aircraft
carriers can be adapted, as this is an area where the Pentagon is most often
suggested to be overweight.
The Adaptive Joint Force Packages concept is credited in particular to
Admiral Paul Miller, who as commander-in-chief of the US Atlantic Command is
the overall commander for the Haiti operation.
All services seemed happy with the first army/navy co-ordinated landing of
its kind. Officers from the Eisenhower showed a touch of pride in having
carried 51 army helicopters and the full array of surveillance aircraft.
Army Private Mazur, now landed in Haiti, said he had a new respect for his
colleagues on the water, who not only ferried him there but also built new
parts for army machinery on demand. They also showed him the way round the
aircraft carrier when he got lost.
By Monday evening, along with Pte Mazur, most of the 2,000 light infantrymen
on board had been lifted into Port-au-Prince.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Brazil candidates ignore fears of violence: A look at the
big issue which is not being addressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Heavy machine guns and assault rifles are commonplace on the streets of
Vigario Geral, a shanty town 20 minutes' drive from Rio de Janeiro's banking
district. The town's drug den, at the end of the main street, is patrolled
by heavily armed 'soldiers' working for the local trafficker, Flavio Negao.
In most respects Vigario Geral is just another Brazilian shanty town, or
favela. Its streets are unpaved and its sewage untreated. Although it was
settled more than 30 years ago, there is still no road access and the only
entrance is an elevated walkway over a railway line. The population of
25,000 has two telephones.
But in August last year 21 residents of Vigario Geral were executed by about
30 masked gunmen alleged to have been police officers seeking revenge either
for the murder of some colleagues or for an extortion attempt that had gone
wrong. The 21 who died turned out to be ordinary workers and none was
involved in the drug business. Thirty-three men are on trial for the
murders.
Violence is common in Brazil but the scale of the Vigario Geral massacre
stunned the country. It prompted the setting up of the Viva Rio movement to
tackle violence and improve the city's image.
According to most national polls, people rank violence as their first or
second concern but it is hardly addressed by the main candidates in
presidential and congressional elections to be held next month.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the front-runner for president, says security
is one of his five priorities. But in nightly TV broadcasts, which all
candidates are allowed under elections rules, he has spent much more time
discussing economic issues, health and even agriculture. Of the eight
candidates for president, four have yet to mention violence in their
broadcasts. Lula da Silva.
According to their advisers, the main candidates are less concerned about
violence because, outside big cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio, it is not a
daily issue. But even in the big cities, violence is not receiving much
attention. Mr Caio Ferraz, a sociologist living in Vigario Geral, says he
invited candidates for the governorship of Rio state to debate violence and
public security. None turned up, and two candidates did not even reply.
Politicians blame rising violence on the Brazilian state which, in the last
past 10 years of mounting economic and social problems, has steadily lost
credibility as the police, justice system and prison service have been
underfunded and overburdened.
'The police rarely come here,' says Mr Ferraz, 'and when they do, it is to
kill people. The government does so little that we have become a kind of
parallel state.'
Sao Paulo's 70,000-strong police force is 17,000 less than the level
required by state law. The state has one judge for every 20,000 people,
compared with one for 5,000 in Europe. The justice system is slow and
bureaucratic.
'If we arrested all known criminals there would not be room to lock them
up,' says Colonel Hermes Bittencourt Cruz of the Sao Paulo police.
It is probably worse in Rio, where the police force has been seriously
undermined by corruption and involvement in drug trafficking. Mr Antonio
Carlos Biscaia, attorney general, complains: 'Police go to drug traffickers
with arrest warrants but instead of arresting them, they negotiate the price
to let them go free.
Mr Biscaia says 40 per cent of the murders committed in one region of Rio in
the last three years are still unsolved.
'Crime is not unique to Brazil but our mechanisms to fight crime don't work.
Yet the politicians say Brazil has lots of other social problems, and
security is relegated down the list,' he says.
Analysts agree that tackling violence will require many years of investment
in education, reform of the judicial system and an economy able to create
jobs. An end to Brazil's worsening income disparity and more equitable
wealth distribution would also help, some argue.
What is important, says Mr Ferraz, is the political will to change the way
the state acts. He points to Vigario Geral's shortage of phones and unpaved
roads. By comparison, the government this month opened a 21km stretch of
dual carriageway road that runs right past the favela.
'The state has always excluded us in the favelas,' says Mr Ferraz. It is not
doing anything here to help us, only we are.'
Brazil's presidential hopefuls may ignore such complaints but dealing with
these problems and tackling violence will be urgent priorities for whoever
wins the elections.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Aristide sees rivals still in power: Profile of Haiti's
turbulent priest in exile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement producing the peaceful US occupation of Haiti has been broadly
approved, even if with some reservations, in the US. But the one man in
whose name it was effected remained noticeably unenthusiastic.
Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president who now lives in a
modest one-bedroom apartment in the middle of Washington, stayed silent for
a day and a half after President Bill Clinton announced the deal negotiated
with the Haitian military leaders. Yesterday he issued a terse statement
calling for 'a state of law so that there will be neither violence nor
vengeance in our nation', but pointedly refusing to endorse the agreement.
Mr Aristide's supporters have been less reticent. Randall Robinson, the
human rights activist, Michael Barnes, the former congressman from Maryland
in charge of public relations for Mr Aristide and Robert White, the
ex-diplomat, have all criticised Sunday's agreement for leaving the military
junta free from criminal charges for human rights abuses and under no
obligation to leave Haiti.
Nor was Mr Aristide's name other than perfunctorily mentioned in the
ceremonies marking the return of the US team headed by former President
Jimmy Carter. One of its members, Senator Sam Nunn, even went so far as to
disclose that he had told the junta not to equate democracy with one man -
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In reality, the ousted president probably has little alternative but to
accept once again the hand he has been dealt, if he wants to return to his
homeland for the year-plus left of his term. But he will surely go back a
different man.
The US administration has found him hard to characterise over the last three
years. A typical assessment came over the weekend from Bill Gray, the US
special envoy to Haiti. 'Who is Aristide?' he asked rhetorically. 'He's a
Haitian. A priest. An intellectual. An ideologue. Not your practical pol who
has lived in a functioning democracy.'
Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide certainly was - and perhaps in some measure still
is - a classic product of the school of liberation theology which has caused
so much controversy in the Roman Catholic Church over the last generation.
What separates him from the large class of politically activist priests is
that he carried his beliefs in defiance of Rome all the way into the elected
office of the presidency of his country.
He was born, on July 15 1953, in the southern fishing village of Port Salut.
His father, a land-owning peasant, died when he was young and in 1959 he
moved, with his mother and sister, to Port-au-Prince.
His education was at schools and seminaries run by the Salesian Fathers in
the Haitian capital, with his novitiate spent, in 1974-75, in the
neighbouring Dominican Republic. He obtained his bachelor's degree in
psychology from the University of Haiti in 1979 and, after further studies
in Italy, Israel, Britain and Canada, was ordained a priest in the Salesian
Order on July 3 1982, and was assigned as curate in the St Joseph parish on
the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.
From the very outset, Mr Aristide was an outspoken critic of the Duvalier
dictatorship. He used his religion as a club - or, as he once put it, 'the
Gospel, in its raw form, could act like a stick of dynamite'. More
practically, he set up centres for the homeless, community stores, car
washes and schools to cater to the needs of the destitute.
Duvalier's exile in 1986 in no way calmed his social and political activism
and he was a thorn in the side of the subsequent military regime. Twice, in
1987 and 1988, he barely escaped assassination attempts, in the second of
which 12 of his parishioners were killed and over 70 wounded at his church,
now Saint-Jean Bosco in Port-au-Prince.
But his relentless criticism of the status quo also brought him into severe
conflict with the local Catholic hierarchy, always close to successive
authoritarian regimes in Haiti, and with the Vatican. In 1987, the Salesian
Fathers tried to persuade him to stop preaching in favour of the poor and to
leave Haiti, but he resisted.
In 1988 he was expelled from the order. He appealed, but received no
response from Rome for two years - until the month he was elected president.
He then spent more than a year, admittedly depressed at the conflict with
his religious superiors, but also writing extensively.
The military regime was overthrown early in 1990 and general elections
called. Initially, Mr Aristide refused to run for office, but he registered
as a presidential candidate on October 18, the deadline for filing. On
December 16, he won over two-thirds of the vote and became Haiti's first
democratically elected president.
He was sworn into office on February 7 1991, but only after an attempted
coup in January, led by Roger Lafontant, former head of the Tonton Macoutes,
was undone by massive street protests by his supporters. In the course of
this, the Catholic cathedral in Port-au-Prince was burned and the Vatican
embassy sacked.
As president, Mr Aristide confounded expectations based on his lifelong
criticism of neo-colonialism and international financial institutions by
entering negotiations with the IMF and World Bank. He accepted the need for
reform, including higher taxes, a devalued currency and cuts in the state
bureaucracy.
His heart, however, remained clearly well to the left of centre on any
political chart, with programmes promoting literacy and radical
reorganisation of the peasantry.
But his party, the National Front for Change and Democracy, did not command
the legislature and increasingly he relied on organised popular
demonstrations to get his way.
At least twice Mr Aristide spoke approvingly of the use of the 'necklace'
(the burning tire placed round the neck of the victim). He also established
his own armed presidential guard, evidence, to his critics, of increasing
paranoia.
He attended the UN general assembly session in New York in September 1991,
at a time when coup rumours were rife. The denouement finally came after his
return, on September 30, with the army coup led by Lt Gen Raoul Cedras. Mr
Aristide fled to Venezuela and later in the year took up residence in
Washington.
His financial sustenance since then has come from the approximately Dollars
35m (Pounds 22.5m) in Haitian official financial assets in the US frozen by
the Bush administration in the wake of the coup. These funds have also
helped underwrite the vigorous international public relations campaign for
his restoration to power.
In Washington, he has been a predictably controversial figure.
Conservatives, including powerful forces inside the CIA, had long ago
suspected him of anti-Americanism and began publicly to question his mental
stability. His brief term in office, during which he compared himself with
Robespierre, provided plenty of ammunition for those determined to cast
doubt on his democratic credentials.
But he established influential alliances with the US congressional black
caucus, which proved pivotal in the unfolding Clinton administration
policies towards Haiti. He was also circumspect in criticising both the Bush
and Clinton administrations and demonstrated, in the abortive Governor's
Island agreement, considerable flexibility.
But in recent weeks, as the momentum towards his restoration by force
gathered pace, it became clear that Mr Aristide accepted that he had to
convince his US patrons of his democratic credentials.
Thus, last Friday, he confirmed what Mr Clinton had said the night before -
that, in accordance with the Haitian constitution, he would not stand in
presidential elections due in December next year. He had maintained that the
1991 coup had deprived him of three years of his term of office, which he
was entitled to reclaim.
The words he used were music to the administration's ear. In a democracy, he
said, 'it is the second election that is the most important'. He also
committed himself to amnesty and reconciliation and held out the hope that
his people could now move 'from misery to poverty - with dignity'.
But that was spoken under the assumption, reasonable given Mr Clinton's
commitment, that the junta would be physically gone when he got back - even
if out of the reach of Haitian or other justice. Now they are being spoken
of, if not as heroes, then as simple military men of honour with whom past
and present US presidents can do business. Swallowing this bitter pill will
surely test the Christian charity that was not always his most visible
trademark while president.

FT  21 SEP 94 / IFC financing to double by 1999
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm,
expects to double its financing in the next five or six years to Dollars 5bn
to keep pace with the rapid growth in emerging markets and the shift towards
private sector development.
According to its annual report released yesterday, it approved a record
Dollars 2.5bn in financing last year and increased its net income 82 per
cent to a record Dollars 258m (Pounds 166m).
'If you put together policy reform plus a vibrant private sector, the result
is a strong demand for financing in the developing countries. That means a
strong demand on the services of the IFC,' said Mr Jannik Lindbaek, the
executive vice president.
Last year's 15 per cent increase in financing helped to fund 231 projects
valued at Dollars 15.8bn. The projects ranged from farm privatisation in
Russia, to capital market development in Zambia, privatisation of
telecommunications systems in eastern Europe, investment in the first
leasing company in Romania, and the formation of private pension funds in
Peru and Argentina.
Past IFC projects have proved to be profitable investments. Sell-off of
mature investments last year produced Dollars 241m in capital gains.
The IFC has been placing increased emphasis on developing infrastructure,
where a quarter of financing went last year. However, its efforts in
infrastructure pall next to the need, which the World Bank Development
Report estimated at Dollars 200bn a year over the next decade.
To mobilise investment in infrastructure, the IFC is creating special
investment funds like the Asian Infrastructure Fund, which has a target of
Dollars 1bn. It has also stepped up its efforts to develop capital markets,
including setting up finance and leasing companies, commercial banks,
pension funds and life insurance companies.
According to Mr Lindbaek, this is 'for the long term the only acceptable
solution' to sustained development because 'domestic savings are then
channeled through domestic financial institutions into the project of the
country.'
The Dollars 579m in capital markets projects approved by the IFC last year
include four credit lines to commercial banks in Lebanon, investment in
Romania's first leasing company, and assistance in Vietnam and China for the
development of legal and regulatory frameworks in their capital markets.
Sub-Saharan Africa remains a big challenge for the IFC. and Mr Lindbaek
expects the agency to beef up efforts to set up small and medium enterprises
in the region.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Fears of overvalued Real
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's central bank yesterday intervened in the foreign exchange markets
for the first time since the July launch of a new currency, the Real. The
bank was reported to be buying moderate quantities of dollars in return for
Reals.
The move follows mounting concern that the Real is overvalued against the US
dollar. Foreign investment, mainly via the stock market, has flowed into
Brazil since the currency's launch, amid rising optimism about the country's
economic outlook.
The Real has appreciated nearly 15 per cent since July and yesterday opened
at 0.85 to the dollar.
But the rise in the Real has led to worries, especially among exporters,
that Brazil's trade performance might suffer. With foreign exchange reserves
of more than Dollars 40bn, and a trade surplus of Dollars 13.1bn last year,
the country faces no serious balance of payments risk. But the government is
also in the process of lifting import tariffs and is trying to soften the
impact of greater foreign competition on some less-competitive sectors of
the economy.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Trade gap in US goods near record: Overall July deficit
Dollars 11bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit continued its steadily worsening path in July,
recording the second largest monthly deficit ever for trade in goods.
The overall trade deficit climbed to Dollars 10.99bn (Pounds 7bn) in July,
compared with a deficit of Dollars 9.04bn in June, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
Total exports fell to Dollars 56.47bn from Dollars 58.36bn in June, while
imports remained virtually flat at Dollars 67.46bn.
Most of the swing resulted from a Dollars 1.7bn drop in exports of goods,
which took the goods deficit to Dollars 15.7bn, a total the US has exceeded
only once, in December 1985.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said that most of the decline in
exports was caused by one-time factors, including a gap in aircraft
production as makers sought to absorb slack in their order books, which cut
aircraft exports to their lowest in five years.
In addition, he said, the new car model year meant a decline in exports of
vehicle components for assembly in Canada, and there was an unusual Dollars
200m drop in exports of artwork.
'These factors are not indicative of the economy's long term trend,' Mr
Brown insisted. 'US exports, which have shown consistent growth, are still
10 per cent higher than this time last year.'
Despite the weakness of the dollar, which might have been expected to
improve US export performance, the trade deficit has continued to worsen all
year as the US, much further into its economic recovery than its main
trading partners, has sharply increased its imports of goods.
Using three-month rolling averages, US goods imports have risen by 10 per
cent since the beginning of this year, while goods exports have risen by
only 3 per cent.
A 15 per cent improvement in the US's surplus in services over the same
period has not been enough to offset this deterioration.
But economists expect that faster growth in Europe and Japan in the second
half of this year, coupled with slower growth in the US, will eventually
narrow the trade deficit.
The US's trade balance with most of its main trading partners worsened in
July. Its goods deficit with Japan widened to Dollars 5.67bn, compared with
Dollars 5.52bn in June, while the deficit with the European Union widened to
Dollars 1.93bn, from Dollars 1.32bn in June.
The failure to narrow the trade deficit with Japan fuelled speculation of a
clash when the deadline for completing the US-Japan framework talks expires
at the end of next week.
The only area where the US trade balance improved last month was Latin
America. Mexico led the way, with the US goods surplus rising from Dollars
198m in June to Dollars 595m in July as the benefits of the North American
Free Trade Agreement began to be felt. The US also recorded larger surpluses
with Argentina and Colombia, and smaller deficits with Brazil and Venezuela.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Japanese parties 'within days' of tax reform deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Officials of the three parties in Japan's coalition government last night
said they were within days of unblocking a long-standing deadlock over
controversial tax reforms.
They are aiming to reach an outline accord, by today or tomorrow, to extend
this year's Y5,500bn (Pounds 35bn) income tax cut to next year and make a
permanent cut of Y3,500bn thereafter, said officials. Coalition members were
also moving towards increasing the unpopular 3 per cent sales tax by an
unspecified amount in April 1997.
The government was hoping to release its tax package yesterday, but was held
up by the Social Democratic party's continued reluctance to accept any rise
in sales tax.
The SDP, many of whose members were elected last year on a promise to scrap
sales tax, yesterday agreed to leave a final decision to Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, the party leader and prime minister.
The final details, closely watched by an anxious US government, will have a
critical influence on domestic demand, just as Japan is at the early stage
of a tentative, consumer spending led economic recovery. This is the biggest
test of the unity of the coalition of conservatives and socialists since it
took power at the end of June.
Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs,
yesterday urged Japan to ensure 'there is no premature withdrawal of fiscal
support for recovery'. Japan had failed to carry out its promise to
deregulate, to create an economy driven by consumption and demand, he said.
'There is not enough strength in demand to dispel caution about the
outlook,' said Mr Summers, a view likely to be confirmed with today's
publication of Japan's gross domestic product for the second quarter to
June.
Washington wants the rise in sales tax to be delayed as long as possible, to
give full scope for domestic demand for imports to reduce the huge trade
surplus.
The tax package will therefore influence the US stance on whether to impose
economic sanctions on Japan, a decision due in 10 days' time, the deadline
for an elusive US-Japan trade accord.
A divided Japanese government last year agreed a one-off Y5,500bn tax cut
for 1994, pending further debate on a rise in consumption tax, sought by the
finance ministry, which is eager to bolster its declining tax revenue.
Another factor in the delay has been the insistence of the New Harbinger
party, the smallest member of the coalition, that any rise on sales tax must
be accompanied by cuts in spending on government administration.
Not surprisingly, civil servants have resisted the NHP's plan, the latest
round in a long power struggle between politicians and the bureaucracy.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Biological weapons under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from 80 countries are meeting in Geneva to discuss how to
strengthen the 1972 treaty banning biological weapons, with measures to
guard against cheating.
The treaty currently has no provisions to check compliance.
The two-week conference, which ends on September 30, will examine a report
produced last year which concluded that verification measures would be both
feasible and useful. The report lists 21 types of procedure, ranging from
data exchange to on-site inspections, although it concedes that no foolproof
method exists.
According to US intelligence, China, Iran, Syria and Russia possess
biological arms; and Eygpt, Taiwan and Libya may have them. Iraq's programme
has been terminated by the United Nations.
Verification of biological weapons poses technical and political problems,
which were thought insuperable when the 131-member Biological and Toxin
Weapons Convention was negotiated in the 1960s.
Biological weapons are harder to detect than nuclear or chemical arms; they
can be easily produced and stored in tiny quantities; and the agents and
equipment often have peaceful as well as belligerent uses, for instance
vaccines.
This has raised fears that checking for biological weapons would involve
snooping around unrelated military facilities. Western countries, notably
the US, are also concerned to protect the commercial secrets of private
biotechnology companies.
Mr Tibor Toth of Hungary, conference chairman, said he did not expect
anti-cheating measures to be approved this time. The likely outcome is a
decision to launch negotiations on verification procedures, which could be
endorsed at the next conference in 1996.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Burmese junta meets Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of Burma's military junta yesterday met Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
detained pro-democracy campaigner, in the first such face-to-face talks
since they placed her under house arrest five years ago.
Gen Tan Shwe, head of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council
(Slorc), and Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, the powerful chief of military intelligence,
were shown on state-controlled television meeting Ms Suu Kyi at an official
guest house in Rangoon. The commentary described the talks as cordial but no
further details were released; it was apparently the first time she has been
let out since being held.
Burma's military rulers are attempting to liberalise the economy after years
of stagnation while trying to improve their international image.
The economy is growing with the help of Singaporean, Thai and other foreign
investment, but efforts to regain international respectability have been
hampered by repeated human rights abuses. The armed forces killed hundreds
of people when they crushed a pro-democracy uprising in 1988, and then
ignored the results of an election in 1990 won overwhelmingly by Ms Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy.
The origins of yesterday's meeting lie in a trip to Rangoon in February by
Mr Bill Richardson, a US congressman and ally of President Clinton. He
became the first foreigner other than her relatives to meet Ms Suu Kyi and
said then she and Gen Khin Nyunt would determine Burma's future.
Reconciling the two sides, however, will be not easy. Ms Suu Kyi, daughter
of Gen Aung San, the man who led Burma to the brink of independence from
Britain, says she respects the army as an institution, but she has refused
to leave the country as demanded by the Slorc and insists on the need for
democracy.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Jobs for life hit by Tokyo reversal

The Japanese government yesterday gave its blessing to a symbolic challenge
to the industrial elite's system of lifetime employment, by approving
leading airlines' plans to hire stewardesses on short-term contracts.
The decision, by Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, confirms his
humiliating climbdown at the end of last month, when he was forced to
withdraw initial opposition to Japan Airlines' plans to recruit part-time
staff to cut costs. All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline after
JAL, is planning to do the same.
This is a rare setback for the traditional practice of administrative
guidance, where government ministries exert behind-the-scenes control on
companies, backed up with implied threats. Mr Kamei had hinted that the
ministry might refuse new JAL route applications if the airline refused
administrative guidance.
This is the latest example of how Mr Kamei's Liberal Democratic party, the
largest partner in the three-party coalition, has been striving with mixed
success to re-establish authority over the bureaucracy and industry since
returning to power at the end of June after a year's absence. The outcome of
the row could signal a weakening in government influence on the private
sector.
Mr Kamei's attempt to block recruitment of contract staff, ostensibly on
safety grounds, drew sharp protests from Japan's main business lobbies,
sensitive to increasing use of non-salaried labour.
Lifetime employment has come under growing strain as the rise of the yen has
obliged employers to sharpen cost competitiveness.
JAL diplomatically gave Mr Kamei a reason for changing his mind by revising
its plans, increasing wages of the contract stewardesses although they will
still earn much less than salaried staff.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Toshiba plans Y100bn chip plant: Productivity advances
expected at D-Ram facility in central Japan

Toshiba, the Japanese integrated electronics company, is to invest Y100bn
(Pounds 645m) over three years in a new semiconductor factory it will build
in Japan that will significantly boost its chip production capacity.
The proposed investment, announced yesterday, helps ease fears that Japan's
industrial base is 'hollowing out' as a growing number of Japanese
manufacturers have stepped up investments in overseas plants in order to
combat the adverse effects of a high yen.
When completed, Toshiba's chip factory - to be built in Mie Prefecture in
central Japan - will be the largest in the country.
With the new plant, Toshiba will add production capacity of 4.5m 16-megabit
dynamic random access memory chips (D-Rams) per month to its current
capacity of 3m a month.
The company also plans to raise productivity in its semiconductor operations
by 2.5 times over the next three years by cutting development time and
reducing the number of processes involved in manufacturing.
The new plant will eventually produce next generation 64-megabit D-Rams,
which are expected to be in strong demand by about 1997.
The race to increase semiconductor manufacturing capacity has been spurred
by buoyant demand for semiconductors, particularly D-Rams, from the computer
industry.
Toshiba, for example, saw revenues grow 6 per cent last year and expects to
see a 14 per cent rise to Y830bn in the year to March 1995.
Industry leaders, however, believe there is a pressing need for greater
investment in capacity to meet expected buoyant demand.
Japanese semiconductor makers have slipped behind in their capital spending
in recent years, compared with investments by US companies.
Korean semiconductor manufacturers, which have been fierce competitors in
the D-Ram market, are also stepping up investments.
Not to be left behind, Japanese semiconductor companies are increasing
spending this year on manufacturing facilities.
NEC, which is one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world,
is building a new chip plant in southern Japan, at a cost of Y95bn, to make
advanced generation chips and has indicated its intention to invest a
similar amount in another plant, possibly in Scotland.
Altogether NEC plans capital spending of Y110bn this year, up from Y90bn
last year and in line with its peak level of expenditure in the
semiconductor business in 1990.
Toshiba plans capital spending in its semiconductor operations of Y90bn this
year compared with Y80bn last year and a peak of Y125bn in 1990.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Zulu court split will reshape Natal politics: Buthelezi and
the king square up in struggle for traditional support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two bulls cannot share the same kraal, runs an old African proverb.
This traditional wisdom is about to be tested in the South African province
of KwaZulu/Natal as yesterday the stage was set for a confrontation between
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and minister
of home affairs in the government of national unity, and the traditional
monarch of the 9m-strong Zulu nation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, his nephew.
The outcome of the confrontation, triggered by the king's decision yesterday
to dismiss Chief Buthelezi as his 'prime minister', will shape the politics
of the province for the foreseeable future. For it could determine whether
its loyalty shifts from Chief Buthelezi, whose IFP secured 51 per cent of
the provincial vote in this year's election, to Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress.
What tipped the balance in the April election was the overwhelming backing
for the IFP in rural Natal, conservative, traditional and loyal to the king,
for the ANC's strength lay mainly in the towns and cities.
It is over this rural turf that Chief Buthelezi and the king will now be
fighting for control.
By dismissing Chief Buthelezi from the honorary post of traditional prime
minister to the royal house, the King is attempting to deprive the chief of
his most powerful political weapon: the ability to claim to act on behalf of
the Zulu nation.
Political analysts estimate that between 15-30 per cent of Inkatha's vote
was the direct result of the king's entry into the political fray on
Inkatha's behalf.
Although Inkatha's powerful political machine and complex patronage network
will continue to be able to mobilise large numbers of supporters, many
floating voters may now shift their allegiance to the ANC, damaging
Inkatha's prospects in next year's planned local elections.
It may also re-inflame political passions in KwaZulu-Natal, where Inkatha
and ANC-supporters have been in a virtual state of war that has claimed
thousands of lives since the mid-1980s.
Since the election, and Inkatha's decision to serve in the constitutionally
mandated government of national unity with the ANC and the National party,
violence has dropped markedly.
In the ongoing dispute between the ANC and Inkatha in the provincial
legislature on the allocation of cabinet posts and the location of the
regional capital, the king has remained studiously neutral.
However, in recent months there have been persistent rumours that the
relationship between the king and the chief had started to sour, partly as a
result of an apparent thawing of the king's attitude to the ANC.
King Goodwill has also dismissed his former bodyguards, who were political
appointments from the KwaZulu police controlled by Chief Buthelezi,
replacing them with national troops, and also held several personal meetings
with President Mandela.
For his part, Chief Buthelezi has consistently denied reports of a rift with
the king. However in the last two weeks he has lashed out at attempts to
'vilify' him by members of the royal family - an apparent reference to the
growing influence of Prince Mcwayizeni Zulu, a long-standing rival of Chief
Buthelezi's and a member of the ANC's national executive, in the Royal
Household.
The row over President Mandela's planned attendance at Shaka Day
celebrations this weekend, a ceremony central to the Zulu nationalist
tradition as a tribute to the kingdom's founder, appears to have brought
matters to a head.
Although President Mandela announced after meeting with Chief Buthelezi and
the king on Monday night that he had decided not to attend the ceremony, the
king appears to have chosen to use the issue as an excuse to break off ties
with Inkatha.
The roots of the conflict run back to King Goodwill's accession to the
throne in 1971. Before his coronation, the prince had sought to marginalise
Chief Buthelezi in Zulu politics. However after the coronation, the chief
used his newly-formed Inkatha movement to take control of the Zulu
'homeland', forcing the young monarch to follow his lead. The chief also
used his position as the king's uncle to claim the post of traditional prime
minister.
In the late 1970s Chief Buthelezi forced legislation through the KwaZulu
parliament that severely circumscribed the king's political independence and
since then has used his power over the KwaZulu budget, which provided the
monarch's salary, to insure that the king took no action contrary to
Inkatha's interests.
It is ironic that the King's new freedom to speak out against his former
mentor is in part the result of Chief Buthelezi's success in playing the
royal card during negotiations with the ANC earlier this year.
By making recognition of the monarch's status a condition of his
participation in the election, Chief Buthelezi was able to entrench the
position of the king as traditional ruler of KwaZulu in the new
constitution.
As a result, King Goodwill's status and salary are no longer dependent on
Inkatha and Chief Buthelezi has no direct authority over the king.
The king yesterday was reported to have cancelled the Shaka Day celebrations
this weekend. So far Inkatha officials are putting a brave face on the split
and insist that the celebrations will go ahead with or without the king's
participation.
However without the monarch's blessing, Inkatha will find it difficult to
generate the level of support the celebrations have traditionally enjoyed.
'It's a bit like celebrating Christmas without acknowledging the Christian
tradition,' said Mr David Welsh, political scientist at the University of
Cape Town.

Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday warned South Africa not
to allow demands for a rapid improvement in black living standards to block
free market economic reforms.
In a wide-ranging address to parliament, Mr Major urged President Nelson
Mandela's government of national unity to embrace free market policies that
would create jobs and prosperity by attracting 'hard headed investors'.
He said business confidence, the key to meeting high expectations, could
only be maintained through policies encouraging private initiative and
competition, and discouraging bureaucratic meddling: 'Your people are
impatient for results. Yet no government on earth, however benevolent, can
develop an economy with strokes of the pen.'
UK officials said the prime minister's message, which was repeated in talks
with Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, deputy presidents, was intended to
bolster free market sympathisers within the African National
Congress-dominated government.
British ministers have been encouraged by the government's gradual
acceptance of the need to privatise part of the state-owned economy to
finance its ambitious redevelopment proposals, which will be outlined in a
white paper today Mr Chris Liebenberg, finance minister, said earlier this
week that government discussions on privatisation were 'progressing very
nicely'.
Mr Major gave details of a Pounds 1.25bn assistance package for South
Africa, announced in July, which is described by British officials as the
biggest offered by any country since the elections. The package includes
Pounds 100m in aid, partly delivered through the Commonwealth and the
European Union, Pounds 1bn in export credit guarantees, and measures to help
education, health, sport and small businesses.

<TEXT>
The newly-elected Sri Lankan government's efforts to make peace with
separatist insurgents in the north of the island yesterday suffered a severe
setback when guerrillas sank a naval patrol boat, Mervyn de Silva and Stefan
Wagstyl write.
At least 30 sailors were reported dead or missing in the attack, 80 miles
north of Colombo. The raid came in the wake of attempts by Mrs Chandrika
Kumaratunge, the prime minister who took office a month ago, to start talks
with the Tamil Tigers, fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic
Tamils. To show goodwill, she lifted an economic embargo and hinted at a
possible ceasefire.
Hopes of an early settlement were raised when Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, the
Tigers' leader, gave a rare interview on the BBC's Tamil language service,
and voiced his support for peace. But he set tough conditions for talks,
demanding the Sri Lankan army abandon a heavily-fortified camp at Pooneryn
at the base of the Jaffna peninsula, the Tamil stronghold.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain yesterday called for a fresh international effort to bring peace to
Africa through a regional peace-keeping organisation based on the Conference
for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the UK wanted to work with
South Africa and other African countries to 'turn the tide' against violence
and war on the continent.
Mr Major announced the initiative during an historic address to an informal
joint sitting of parliament at the beginning of the first official visit to
South Africa by a British prime minister since 1960.
Earlier, he met South African President Nelson Mandela for talks on
rebuilding the two countries' traditionally close relationship, which was
weakened during South Africa's international isolation under the former
whites-only government.
Officials said the talks were conducted in 'an atmosphere of great warmth',
suggesting that the ANC-led government of national unity has forgiven
Britain for its less than enthusiastic endorsement of sanctions against the
former regime.
Mr Major urged South Africa to join the international community in bringing
prosperity to the whole of Africa by helping to pre-empt outbreaks of
violence, rather than trying to limit trouble after it had started.
'An entirely new effort at preventive diplomacy is long overdue. With our
friends in Africa . . . Britain wants to develop new mechanisms to head off
conflicts before they become unstoppable,' he said.
'We have in mind, for example, setting up regional peacekeeping cells. We
need more people trained to mediate and act as peace brokers. We would not
need a cumbersome bureaucracy, but a tight and properly resourced
infrastructure in Africa.'
The British proposals will be spelled out in more detail to the United
Nations next week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has long
sought a bigger role for pre-emptive mediation in international peacekeeping
efforts.
However, officials said the plan was intended to build on a recent
resolution by the Organisation of African Unity calling for better conflict
resolution procedures on the continent.
They said the initiative was not intended to involve large numbers of
troops, although the final shape of the peacekeeping force was likely to be
determined by the UN and the OAU.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU backs Ruggiero to head WTO - Former
Italian trade minister to challenge Mexican president for top trade job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The race for the top job at the World Trade Organisation, due to be created
next January, hotted up yesterday when Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian
trade minister, was formally nominated as the European Union candidate.
Unless others enter the race, the contest now seems likely to be between Mr
Ruggiero and Mr Carlos Salinas, outgoing president of Mexico. Though Mr
Salinas has been widely billed as the front-runner, many trade diplomats in
Geneva believe Mr Ruggiero has a better chance of securing the necessary
consensus of Gatt's 123 members.
Mr Ruggiero's nomination, agreed by EU foreign ministers when they met in
Usedom, Germany, this month, was yesterday handed to Mr Andras Szepesi,
Hungary's ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
chairman of the contracting parties (members), who is in charge of the
selection process.
EU officials said yesterday that the full weight of European diplomacy would
now be turned on winning the WTO post for Mr Ruggiero, who was nominated by
his own government last June. Mr Ruggiero himself, a senior executive with
Fiat, the Italian motor manufacturer, will be touring world capitals to
garner support. His main objective is to convince doubters that Brussels'
backing will not make him a champion of narrow EU interests.
Mr Szepesi has called an informal meeting of Gatt members tomorrow morning
at which he is expected to announce that Brazil is withdrawing its
nomination of Mr Rubens Ricupero, the former finance minister.
Mr Ricupero was forced to resign suddenly this month after the accidental
broadcast of remarks implying he was using an anti-inflation plan to boost
the election campaign of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the government's
presidential candidate.
Mr Ricupero's discomfiture has clearly strengthened the chances of President
Salinas, who may now hope to win the backing of all Latin American states as
well as Washington.
However, Mr Salinas has also attracted strong opposition. This is based
partly on fears, especially among Asian nations, that he will have too cosy
a relationship with the US, Mexico's partner in the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and partly on worries by some that his 'presidential' style
may not be what the WTO needs.
The only other declared candidate, Mr Kim Chul-su, Korea's trade and
industry minister, is said to have Asian and Australian support but is
generally considered to have little chance of success. EU officials are
hopeful that Mr Kim's backers will subsequently line up behind Mr Ruggiero.
The appointment is a more complicated choice than last year's selection of
Mr Peter Sutherland as Gatt's director-general, a post he is vacating for
personal reasons.
Mr Sutherland's candidacy swiftly gathered support because he was widely
perceived as the right man to tackle the completion of the protracted
Uruguay Round negotiations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeffrey Garten, US commerce undersecretary responsible for international
trade, yesterday predicted that large emerging markets, such as China,
Indonesia and India, will be the battlefield for 'a bloody fight' as
companies from industrialised countries vie for markets and government
contracts.
In a speech prepared for delivery yesterday in Chicago, Mr Garten said the
aggressive commercial policy adopted by the Commerce Department is being
integrated into US foreign policy 'as never before'. The US will continue to
champion human rights, but it has now accepted business's contention that
commercial engagement furthers human rights goals.
Mr Garten, who has become the chief interpreter of Clinton administration
trade policy, outlined Washington's mobilisation of both government
financing and resources for the US assault on 10 'big emerging markets'.
These BEMs also include Brazil, Argentina, South Korea, South Africa,
Poland, Turkey and Mexico.
Export promotion, he said had 'moved out of the shadows' to the centre of
trade policy. This has been demonstrated by the significant deregulation of
export controls, expansion of trade financing facilities, and the
establishment of export assistance centres around the US and commercial
centres abroad.
The aggressive US strategy deploys the president, cabinet members and other
senior officials in a co-ordinated pursuit of business. President Clinton,
for example, contacted the Brazilian president, Mr Itamar Franco, to push a
successful Raytheon bid for a Dollars 1.5bn environmental technology
project.
Mrs Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, is due to arrive in Pakistan today
with more than 50 US business executives 'to support Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's plans to boost Pakistan's electricity supply'.
US government and business leaders meet frequently to co-ordinate business
strategies and government policy. The US plans to expand training of foreign
managers and technicians, who would be be 'inclined to buy American goods
and services,' Mr Garten said.
'Stronger bilateral links between Washington and each of the BEMs are
critical,' Mr Garten said. In the Cold War, US linkages were often through
military exchanges and training programmes: 'Now and in the future, the most
important links will not be men in uniform carrying weapons, but men and
women in blue suits carrying laptops.'
Mr Garten said the BEMs must feel the new World Trade Organisation is
sensitive to their interests. 'Because they have such large internal
markets, they have more of an option of slowing their integration into the
world economy with protectionist measures than do smaller nations,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The six members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) are
expected to accelerate the establishment of their proposed free trade zone
when economic ministers meet in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, later this
week.
Ministers are likely to approve a plan drafted by senior officials to
shorten the phase-in period for the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta) to 10 years
from 15; this would put Afta formally in place at the beginning of the year
2003 instead of 2008.
'The sooner it's effective the better,' Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian
finance minister and deputy premier, said yesterday during a visit to
Bangkok. Asean comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand.
Afta's aim is to reduce tariffs on trade within Asean to between zero and 5
per cent. But its relevance has been questioned because of the low volume of
intra-Asean commerce (most trade is with Japan, the US and Europe), because
of global tariff cuts by Asean members and above all because each country
has the right to exclude from Afta any items it regards as sensitive.
So many products have been exempted from the Afta tariff cuts that some
Asean governments are trying to draft rules to restrict the practice. Some
unprocessed farm products, hitherto excluded from Afta, may in future be
included.
According to the latest draft agreement, tariffs on so called 'fast-track'
products will be cut to between zero and 5 per cent within five or seven
years, depending on whether the starting tariff is below or above 20 per
cent; for 'normal track' products, tariffs will be cut within seven or 10
years.
Asean's economic ministers will also discuss the protection of intellectual
property rights in the region and the future of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation (Apec) forum.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, a former finance secretary who represents the
Philippines at Apec, said recently Afta could become a 'building block' for
a broad Apec free trade area mooted for the year 2020.
Malaysia, however, is resisting attempts to make Apec into a formal free
trade zone that would include Australia, the US and Canada as well as Asian
countries, and has sought to win support for a proposed Asians-only
organisation known as the East Asian Economic Caucus.

FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Gatt targets Taiwan rice

<TEXT>
Taiwan is under pressure to open its rice market and drop restrictions on
Japanese car imports as it enters fresh talks on joining the General
Agreement on Tariff and Trade.
Taiwan, which hopes to join the world trade body by the end of the year, has
sent Mr Sheu Ke-sheng, vice-minister of economic affairs, to a final round
of meetings in Geneva with the US, the EU, Switzerland, Singapore and
Argentina, before decisive Gatt meetings in October and November.
The US is urging Taiwan to open its market to rice imports, a politically
sensitive area in Taiwan.
Taiwan is lobbying for an approach similar to that agreed with Korea, under
which imports will be phased in gradually over 10 years. But it may be
forced, like Japan, to accept a six-year adjustment period.
Beef-exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand want Taiwan to
end discrepancies in grading of beef imports which they believe grant
favourable tariff rates to US beef. And fruit exporters want tariffs lowered
from a maximum of 40 per cent to a maximum of 20 per cent on imports of
eight kinds of fruit.
Japan is keen that Taiwan end its ban on direct imports of cars from Japan.
Japanese cars may be sold in Taiwan only if they are made locally through a
joint venture or if they are produced in a third country.
Taiwan has already agreed in principle to get rid of this after entering
Gatt.
However the tariffication system to be imposed in its place is also under
debate. Taiwan is also being asked to cut tariffs on imported motor parts.
Gatt members are pressing Taiwan to dismantle its alcohol and tobacco
monopoly by the end of this year and accord foreign suppliers of cigarettes
and alcohol national treatment. Taiwan is proposing to send revised
legislation to parliament before the end of the year and implement a new
system by the end of June 1995.
Taiwan has also been asked to remove import quotas on fisheries products,
which it has agreed except in the case of squid and mackerel. Services is
the least contentious area, with the main Gatt members having in principle
accepted Taiwan's proposed concessions.

<TEXT>
Fincantieri, the Italian shipbuilder, yesterday began building its fourth
and last cruise ship for Holland America Line, part of the Carnival cruise
group.
Like its predecessors, the 54,000-ton, 220-metre Veendam will carry 1,600
passengers.
Fincantieri handed over the first ship in the series in December 1992, and
the third - the Ryndam - only last Saturday. The Veendam should be handed
over in mid-1996. Fincantieri, part of Italy's state holding company Iri,
claims to be the world leader in the construction of cruise ships, with a 30
per cent share of the world market in terms of tonnage.
Including the Crown Princess, a 70,000-ton cruise vessel delivered to P&amp;O in
June 1990, the company has built or is building 12 cruise ships this decade,
fulfilling orders worth an estimated Dollars 3.6bn. They include contracts,
for Carnival and P&amp;O respectively, for two vessels of around 100,000 tons,
the largest cruise ships ever to be built.
Separately, Fincantieri and Finmeccanica, the defence and engineering group
which is also controlled by Iri, have set up a joint company to contribute
to the Horizon project, which will develop a new generation of frigates for
the Italian, French and British navies. The new Italian company, Orizzonte,
will join an international consortium with DCN International of France and
Yarrow Shipbuilders in the UK, part of GEC Marconi Naval System.

France's trade and industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, yesterday denied a
magistrate's report that he had effectively allowed a contractor from his
home region of Lorraine to pay for much of the building of his Riviera
villa, and that what he had paid came from other corporate sources. The
minister claimed the leaking of judge Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke's report to the
Justice Ministry was a malicious attack on him, and dismissed any idea of
resigning. Mr Van Ruymbeke has put the head of St Gobain, Mr Jean-Louis
Beffa, under formal investigation in an attempt to track down what happened
to a FFr4.4m (Pounds 520,000) commission paid by a St Gobain subsidiary to
win a water pipe contract in Nantes. In seeking to verify claims that the
missing money ended up with Mr Longuet, the judge has unearthed other
information about Mr Longuet's St Tropez villa, his Lorraine-based
contractor, and his Paris consulting company, which he believes warrants
investigation. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, now has the
delicate task of deciding whether to call in another magistrate to
investigate his cabinet colleague.

<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Gava (left), a former Christian Democrat interior minister and an
important political figure in Naples, was yesterday arrested on charges of
alleged association with the Camorra, the Neapolitan Mafia. The arrest was
one of 76 ordered by Naples magistrates on charges of association with the
Camorra. As interior minister from 1988-92, Mr Gava had direct control over
the fight against the Mafia. Earlier in 1987 as finance minister he had
responsibility for the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. Mr Gava is
alleged to have developed his Camorra links in the early 1980s in the wake
of the transfer of vast funds to Naples and the surrounding region to make
good the damage caused by the devastating Irpinia earthquake. These funds
were diverted for political use and business investment which required Mafia
protection, the magistrates allege. In return for such protection the
politicians, allegedly headed by Mr Gava, provided political cover for the
Camorra. Yesterday Mr Gava's lawyer expressed surprise at the arrest and
claimed the charges were unspecific and lacked foundation.

The Central Bank of Ireland is to take over regulation of the country's
stock market after the splitting of the Irish stock exchange from the London
stock exchange, scheduled for next April, the government announced
yesterday. Under the Stock Exchange Act, due to become law by the end of
this year, the Irish stock exchange and its 10 member firms will have to
apply to the central bank for permission to trade. However, during the
transition period they will be considered as approved while their
applications are being dealt with. In order to be approved the Irish stock
exchange will have to become a limited company and its council replaced by a
new board. The Irish stock exchange has indicated that it intends to adhere
to the rules of the London stock exchange following the split.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Swedish Liberals await a call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bengt Westerberg, the leader of Sweden's Liberal party, said last night
that he had received a party mandate to negotiate with the Social Democrats,
the winners of Sunday's general election, over a possible coalition. But he
thought it was more likely that the Social Democrats, who fell just 13 seats
short of a majority in the 349-seat parliament, would form a minority
government.
A coalition between the Social Democrats and the Liberals would be warmly
welcomed by financial markets and Swedish business because they believe it
would bring tough action to curb the country's budget deficit. However,
political analysts say the weak showing of the Liberals in Sunday's
election, when they lost 20 per cent of their votes, makes the alliance
unlikely. Yesterday Mr Ingvar Carlsson, prime-minister elect, delayed until
today an announcement on his efforts to form a government following
preliminary contact with the leaders of the other parties. The uncertain
political situation continued to weigh on the markets, with bond yields
edging higher and the Swedish krona and shares both losing ground.

<TEXT>
Mr Heikki Haavisto, the Finnish foreign minister, yesterday caused
consternation in the government when he suggested the country would quickly
be able to renegotiate its entry terms to the European Union if voters
reject membership in next month's referendum.
By increasing uncertainty over the outcome and importance of the referendum
his suggestion is likely to increase tensions between his own Centre party
and the pro-EU Conservative party, the main coalition partners in Finland's
centre-right government. The Centre party, which leads the coalition, backs
membership but it has been anxious not to offend the anti-EU farming
community on which it relies for much of its support. Writing in the Social
Democratic newspaper, Demari, Mr Haavisto said he believed EU enthusiasm for
Nordic membership of the community was sufficiently strong for the two sides
to be able to negotiate a new membership package within a year.
The general view has been that the Nordic countries would have to wait at
least five years before they could re-apply for membership. Last week Mr
Esko Aho, the Centre party prime minister, upset the Conservatives and the
opposition Social Democrats when he said parliament should wait until after
the Swedish referendum before deciding whether to approve the country's
membership campaign.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Confusion surrounds EU directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has finally agreed a revised version of the
controversial Acquired Rights Directive but there is widespread disagreement
about what the revision means.
The directive affects the rights of workers whose services are contracted
out.
European employers and unions welcomed the amendment but disagreed radically
about what effect it will have. Employers bodies, and several countries such
as Britain and Germany, have been pushing hard for a narrowing of the
directive's scope while unions have been strongly resisting any significant
change. The revisions will still have to be unanimously approved by the EU
social affairs council.
The original directive passed in 1977 protects the jobs and working
conditions of workers whose businesses are transferred. It first became a
big issue when it began to interfere with the British government's attempt
to contract out public services to the private sector. Contracting out has
been severely impaired by the directive in Britain.
The German government swung its weight behind reform of the directive after
a recent ruling from the European Court of Justice decreed that a single
woman cleaner whose job was transferred to a contractor should be covered by
the directive. The revised directive seeks to clarify what type of operation
will remain covered. It also revises the rules on insolvent companies.
The key new paragraph states that the 'transfer of an economic entity which
retains its identity' will still be regarded as a transfer but the transfer
of 'only an activity of an undertaking ..does not in itself constitute a
transfer'.
Employers organisations claim this represents a significant narrowing of the
scope of the directive and could rule out many of the activities  - such as
cleaning and catering - which have been at the centre of the UK government's
contracting out strategy.
Mr John Hall, director-general of the Business Services Association, which
represents private contractors in the UK, said: 'This is a vast improvement
on the existing directive, and is even some improvement on the earlier
revisions, but it could still mean a field day for the lawyers.'
However Mr David Lea, assistant general secretary of the British Trades
Union Congress, said that the revision merely codified recent judgments of
the European Court and was welcomed by European trade unionists. In the
judgment on the single German cleaner the judge said that the woman alone
did represent an 'economic entity'.
Ms Melanie Tether, a British lawyer specialising in the directive, said that
it was not so much the new language but the political signal that was being
sent to the European Court to narrow the scope of the directive which was
likely to be crucial.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's balance of trade swung into a SKr400m (Pounds 34m) deficit in
August after a July surplus of Skr9.6bn, according to preliminary figures
from the Swedish statistical agency. Although the figures are distorted by
summer holidays and represent a narrowing of the Skr600m deficit during the
same month last year, they represent a trade performance well below the
predicted Skr2.5bn surplus. The victory of the Social Democratic Party in
Sunday's vote has tended to firm rather than weaken the Swedish krona as
markets wait to see if SDP leader Ingvar Carlsson can establish a strong
government.
Unemployment in Finland fell during August to 19.1 per cent, down from 20.1
per cent a month earlier, according to the Finnish labour ministry.
Switzerland's balance of payments position worsened in August. The Federal
Customs reported a deficit of SFr290.2m (Pounds 143.5m), and a revised
surplus of SFr315.3m for July.

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Slovak government yesterday suspended part of its privatisation
programme, postponing decisions on direct sales of state assets until after
next week's general election. The move is designed to remove political
uncertainty from the process ahead of the vote, scheduled for September 30
and October 1, and is in response to a pledge made by Christian Democrat
members of the ruling coalition that no privatisation decisions would be
made during campaigning. The National Property Fund, which administers state
assets, opened on August 1 for bids for stakes in state companies not
included in the voucher privatisation programme, which is not affected by
the suspension. The tender closed on August 30 and the NPF is expected
either to consider the bids after the election or to open another tendering
process. The latter option seems likely if the coalition loses.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Dutch budget deficit below expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpectedly strong tax receipts allowed the new Dutch cabinet to submit a
budget for 1995 yesterday that manages to keep the country's budget deficit
well below the projections made last month when the coalition government
took office.
The rise in tax receipts, fuelled by a resurgence in economic growth, means
that the 1995 deficit will represent 3 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP), compared with the government's own ceiling of 3.3 per cent set in
August. The 1994 deficit, which was also originally expected to stand at 3.3
per cent of GDP, is also now expected to come in at 3 per cent.
The buoyancy of the Dutch economy was underlined yesterday when the Central
Planning Office forecast that GDP would grow by 3 per cent rise in 1995, the
sharpest rate in the 1990s.
It also revised its forecast for growth in the current year to 2 per cent,
double the 1 per cent forecast released in the spring.
Government spending will rise to Fl 233.3bn (Pounds 86bn) in 1995 from Fl
200.2bn this year, reflecting a large, one-off payment of subsidies to
public housing co-operatives.
Tax revenue is projected to rise to Fl 153.5bn from Fl 150.4bn in 1994,
which is itself Fl 2.3bn higher than originally forecast.
Despite the better than expected economic and fiscal outlook for 1994 and
1995, the new left-right coalition government led by Mr Wim Kok, the Labour
leader, said it aimed to tackle structural problems in the Dutch economy,
such as stubbornly high unemployment and the country's big public debt.
'You can't allow yourself to be blinded by short-term economic recovery,' Mr
Kok said.
Mr Gerrit Zalm, the finance minister, said that the cabinet's budgetary
policies, drawn up in August, had been purposely based on cautious economic
assumptions so that the government would not have to modify spending plans
if it encountered economic setbacks.
The government previously set a deficit ceiling of 2.9 per cent for 1998,
the final year of its four-year term. Yesterday, it said it would use any
further tax windfalls to reduce this to 2.7 per cent.
If there is any money remaining, the government will also seek to earmark up
to Fl 100m for extra spending on policing.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Mauroy hitches bandwagon to TGV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   LILLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Mauroy yesterday inaugurated a FFr800m (Pounds 96m) shopping
centre, the latest stage in the colossal 'Euralille' commercial/transport
project in the centre of the north French city.
The venture forms a key part of his campaign to win a fifth six-year term as
mayor of Lille next year.
The former Socialist prime minister has been mentioned as a possible
Socialist presidential candidate if Mr Jacques Delors decides not to run.
But despite recent conservative inroads into his Socialist bastion, Mr
Mauroy's enthusiasm for municipal politics seems undimmed. To bolster his
record as mayor since 1971, he is counting heavily on the Euralille project
and on Mr Delors' own daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, the former labour
minister, who is running on his ticket as first deputy mayor in the June
1995 municipal elections.
But the politically double-edged nature of the Euralille project was
underlined yesterday when organisers of the new 66,500 square metre
commercial centre admitted that they had deliberately turned away textile
and clothing companies wanting to install themselves in the new centre in
order to protect these traditional industries of Lille, where unemployment
is already more than 13 per cent. 'In the interests of diversification, we
decided to make leisure and beauty a major theme of the centre which is now
95 per cent filled,' one organiser said coyly.
Exploiting the local textile industry's anxiety, Mr Alex Turk, a Gaullist
RPR law professor running for mayor against Mr Mauroy has criticised the
Euralille project for siphoning too much money away from other social
services and for over-emphasising commercial development, rather than just
settling for the still-ambitious goal of making Lille the hub of new TGV
high-speed train services between Paris, London and eventually Brussels.
Mr Jean-Paul Baietto, overall director of Euralille, said yesterday that the
city had only sunk FFr84m directly into the project, with its main
contribution being the gift of 70 hectares city centre site which had been
in French army hands from the 17th century until the early 1980s. More than
FFr3bn of the total investment was from the private sector, and much of the
balance from central and regional government and French railways.
But the delayed start to full commercial TGV services through the Channel
Tunnel was in danger of unbalancing the project, he conceded.
Some delay has been welcome, he said, because Lille started its TGV station
well after work on the Chunnel began. But the Lille station was finished
last May, 'and we will be in trouble if the Eurostar (TGV) trains don't
start arriving by next May', he said.
The next chunks of Euralille, described as Europe's biggest city renewal
project, due to open are a 5,000 seat theatre in November and a World Trade
Centre next January. The latter is supposed to provide a variety of services
to travelling businessmen.
The trade centre will include apartments, temporary offices, and banks and
travel agencies, and as such it is highly dependent on the Eurostars
bringing in the businessmen.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Danish Elections: Rasmussen senses backing for welfare

<TEXT>
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister,
yesterday promised to bolster the country's extensive welfare system if he
is returned to office, as expected, in today's general election. He told a
final campaign press conference he had sensed a change of attitude among
Danes in favour of welfare spending after a decade of restraints by
centre-right governments between 1982 and early last year.
'I am convinced that after the election we shall find there is wide support
for spending more money on the care of the elderly, home help services and
the hospitals,' he said.
The welfare state has been a central issue, as it was in the Swedish
election won on Sunday by the Swedish Social Democratic party. Although
government spending in Denmark is equal to 64 per cent of GDP - second only
to Sweden among industrialised countries - Denmark has not incurred the big
budget deficits amassed by its northern neighbour, allowing Mr Rasmussen to
avoid the cuts Sweden is now facing.
His chances of a second term were strengthened yesterday when the three
small centre parties in his coalition government reacted coolly to calls
from the Conservative and Liberal parties to join them in a new centre-right
coalition.
'If there is a non-socialist majority, there ought to be a non-socialist
government,' said Mr Uffe Elleman-Jensen, the Liberal leader and opposition
candidate for prime minister who is campaigning for restraints on public
spending to allow for lower taxes and higher private sector growth.
But his call was promptly rejected by the Radical Liberal party and the
Centre Democrats, who remain loyal to a partnership with the Social
Democrats. The Christian People's party, who opinion polls show may be
eliminated from the Folketing (parliament), were non-committal.
Opinion polls indicate the four-party coalition, which took office in
January 1993 without an election, will lose its one-seat majority. But they
suggest Mr Rasmussen will be able to continue as head of a minority
government dependent on the left-wing Socialist People's party. The
Conservative and Liberal parties are set to make gains, but not sufficient
to unseat Mr Rasmussen without the help of centre parties.
The prospect of a Social Democratic victory has led to speculation that Mr
Elleman-Jensen, foreign minister between 1982 and 1993, may seek to become
Nato secretary-general in succession to the late Mr Manfred Worner.
Yesterday, however, he emphasised his ambition to become Danish premier.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Road-map sought for EU applicants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France and Germany agreed yesterday to ask the European Commission to
produce a white paper next spring setting out a road-map for enlarging the
European Union to eastern Europe.
The idea is to emulate Lord Cockfield's celebrated 1985 white paper which
set out a list of measures for the European Union to adopt in order to
complete the single market by 1992, a Brussels official said yesterday.
EU officials hope the detailed pre-accession strategy will give the former
communist countries of central and eastern Europe fresh incentives to
consolidate economic reform, while persuading them that their aspirations
for EU membership are taken seriously.
The Franco-German initiative was unveiled yesterday at the end of a two-day
meeting in Paris of both countries' foreign ministers and ambassadors to the
six EU candidate countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania) as well as the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia.
The aim of the conference was to pool information on eastern Europe, but
also to ensure greater harmony between France and Germany on the EU's next
enlargement to the east than was evident earlier this year on entry
negotiations with Nordic countries and Austria.
French complaints that Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, had put
candidate countries' interests ahead of those of the EU had sparked a
diplomatic row.
Mr Kinkel, the current president of the EU's Council of Ministers, said the
white paper 'should map out the road ahead' for East Europe's eventual
integration. Among other elements, it should cover the difficulties of
adapting its economic, banking, legal and transport systems to EU norms.
One likely approach is for the Commission to draw up a list of between 100
and 150 measures for the East Europeans to adopt in order to make their
legislation compatible with EU standards. In return, the EU would phase out
progressively anti-dumping measures and thereby expand the single European
market eastwards.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister of France which takes over the EU
presidency from Germany in January, said the white paper idea would be
broached with Mr Jacques Santer, the Commission president-elect.
Both foreign ministers claimed that their governments were at one on
enlargement the east, but differences of emphasis emerged over how far the
EU should try to lift eastern Europe's standard of living to its own.
Mr Kinkel suggested that it was important to treat eastern Europe as a
whole, with reference to former East Germany, now incorporated in the
European Union. 'We cannot have wages in Dresden that are twice as high as
in Budapest, which are twice as high as in Bucharest.'
However, the French side emphasised possible costs involved. Mr Alain
Lamassoure, France's EU affairs minister, cited the alarming, though
hypothetical, example that if all east European and Baltic countries were
next year to enter the Union with unchanged farm and structural funds rules,
the Union budget would have to double.
Both ministers ritually disclaimed any ambitions for a Franco-German
'directorate' of the EU.

FT  21 SEP 94 / French appeal over access to Orly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday raised the prospect of a new clash with the
European Commission over aviation policy, announcing that it was appealing
to the European Court of Justice in an attempt to delay the liberalisation
of two of its most profitable domestic air routes.
A statement issued by the transport ministry said that immediate competition
on the routes from Orly airport in Paris to Toulouse and Marseilles would
'damage the balance of the country's internal air routes.'
It called for a suspension of an April ruling by the Commission, which
ordered France to open the routes by October 28, until the European Court
had made its decision.
The appeal is the latest step in a protracted battle to liberalise French
domestic air routes. It follows a bitter struggle earlier this year
concerning access to Orly airport for British carriers operating from
London.
The French government sought to oppose the opening of the London-Orly
routes, but ultimately yielded to pressure from Brussels and Britain to
allow Air UK, British Airways and TAT, its French affiliate, to fly to Orly.
That agreement and commitments to facilitate international traffic to Orly
helped clear the way for a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) capital injection for Air
France, the loss-making state-owned carrier.
A delay in the liberalisation of the two domestic routes would come as a
blow to TAT, which is 49 per cent owned by British Airways.
TAT officials were not available for comment yesterday, but the airline has
said it wants to start services from Orly to Toulouse and Marseilles as
quickly as possible.
The original decision by the Commission to order the opening of the routes
followed a complaint filed by TAT. Mr Bernard Bosson, French transport
minister, said France was not against the principle of opening the routes in
question but disagreed about the timing.
The French government has said it will open the Orly-Marseilles route in
April 1995 and the Orly-Toulouse route in April 1996.
It has said, however, that it would limit the liberalisation of each of the
routes to one new carrier.
The routes are currently operated by Air Inter, the domestic affiliate of
Air France. The airlines have resisted the liberalisation of profitable
domestic routes, claiming that it is required by the French government to
operate unprofitable routes in France.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Mirror's raid nets 15% stake in Scottish Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mirror Group, publisher of the Daily Mirror, yesterday launched a raid
on Scottish Television, spending Pounds 37.4m on a 14.9 per cent stake.
The move is the strongest evidence so far of the determination of Mr David
Montgomery, Mirror Group chief executive, to diversify from popular
newspapers into television.
The stake, which will make Mirror Group the largest individual shareholder
in STV, has been bought through its Scottish newspaper subsidiary, the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, to emphasise the Mirror's Scottish
credentials.
The raid does not appear to presage a further attack on the independent
Scottish channel even if UK TV ownership rules, which prevent a newspaper
group owning more than 20 per cent of an ITV company, are lifted.
Share prices of ITV companies not yet swallowed by larger predators received
a boost from the purchase, however. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees rose 29p to 392p
yesterday, neighbouring Grampian was up 29p to 354p and Ulster improved 37p
to 720p. HTV, however, fell by 1p to 164p, probably on the assumption that
the 20 per cent stake bought by Flextech this year will help to block
takeover attempts.
The Mirror Group bought 7.2m shares at 520p compared with the closing price
of STV shares on Monday of 443p. The main sellers are believed to have been
the financial institutions, Fidelity of the US, PDFM and Mercury Asset
Management.
Mr Murdoch MacLennan, chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record,
yesterday emphasised the opportunities for co-operation. 'We do not believe
it is necessary for the two companies to come under common control for these
benefits to be achieved.'
Scottish Television, appeared wary and merely noted the assurances that
common ownership was not necessary.
STV's share price ended yesterday at 501p - a rise of 58p on the day.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Bonds and stocks fall amid fears of inflation: US trade gap
widens; Wall Street and European markets drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World bond and stock markets fell yesterday after worse-than- expected US
trade figures and mounting concerns about the outlook for inflation and
interest rates in Europe and the US.
The immediate spur was US Commerce Department figures showing that the US
trade balance deteriorated significantly in July and recorded the
second-largest monthly deficit ever for trade in goods. The data added to
market fears about inflation prospects in the US and sharply depressed US
bonds and stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 67.63 in a broadly based retreat to
3,869.09. In the Treasury market, foreign investors sold heavily in response
to fears of a weaker dollar, with the US and Japan preparing for a fresh
round of trade talks. Bonds managed to recoup some losses during the
afternoon.
Late in the New York trading session, the benchmark 30-year government issue
was down  7/32 at 96 25/32 , raising the cost of long-term finance.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the yen in European and US markets. By
late afternoon in New York, the dollar was quoted at Y97.675, down from
Y98.51 late on Monday.
The falls exacerbated a broader slide in most European bond and equity
markets. Economists emphasised that the underlying reason for the retreat
was not so much the US trade figures but a growing fear in European and US
markets that US inflation pressures are mounting while the European interest
rate cycle is likely to rise.
The FT-SE 100 share index fell 41.8 points to close at 3,037.3. UK
government bonds also fell sharply in the morning, with the December gilt
contract touching a low of 97.50 before rebounding at the end of the day to
close at 98.03, down from the opening price of 98.15.
Short sterling futures were also weak amid heavy trading. Meanwhile, yields
on 10-year government bonds also rose through the psychologically important
level of 9 per cent.
The declines were reflected in most European markets, where stock markets in
the Netherlands and Germany fell by about 1 per cent. European bonds also
had a volatile day, further strained by concerns that German money supply
figures, expected today, might be worse than expected.
The main factor driving the equity markets' fall, economists said, was the
volatility in international bond markets, where dealers apparently remain
unconvinced about governments' ability to maintain low inflation.
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at UK brokers James Capel, said: 'The fall
in the Footsie is being generated as much by international factors as from
domestic figures.'
Broader inflation concerns, economists said, were likely to continue to
depress UK gilts in spite of the UK government's interest rate rise last
week. With the UK company results season now coming to an end, gilt markets
are expected to act as the key factor driving equity markets in the month
ahead.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at brokers SG Warburg in London,
said: 'There is a feeling in the markets that we have now crossed the
Rubicon, and what we have seen in the US in terms of rising inflation and
interest rates is migrating over to Europe now.'
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'It
is a combination of growth coming out stronger than expected, further upward
pressure on US rates and a sense that the German interest rate cycle has
changed.'

FT  21 SEP 94 / Tensions rise in Haiti as police kill demonstrator: Aristide
refuses to acknowledge Carter accord with junta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, PORT-AU-PRINCE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first signs of the difficulties facing US efforts to restore democracy
in Haiti came yesterday as the republic's police clubbed to death a
demonstrator welcoming the Americans.
Riot police used clubs and rifle butts to break up a crowd of thousands of
supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide at the port, leaving
several injured. According to US soldiers a Haitian policeman was shot and
wounded by a civilian.
US troops, who had been instructed not to intervene in domestic policing,
looked on. The clash raised fears about the conduct of Haiti's militia just
as the Clinton administration set out to win broader support for the deal it
reached with the Haitian junta on Sunday.
In Washington, General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs
of staff, said troops would not intervene unless 'this level of violence
becomes so great that it threatens the overall stability and security of our
multinational forces'.
The incident apart, US deployment was greeted peacefully as troops spread
through the country and marines took over the northern city of Cap Haitien.
Gen Shalikashvili, who insisted Haitian troops were continuing to
co-operate, defended Sunday's agreement, which provides for General Raoul
Cedras and other military leaders to leave power, but not necessarily the
country, by October 15.
He said Pentagon officers would brief Mr Aristide on their plans for
occupying Haiti. Mr Aristide reaffirmed his commitment to last year's broken
Governor's Island Agreement - under which Gen Cedras had promised to leave
power a year ago - but ignoring the latest deal, arranged by former
president Jimmy Carter.
The ousted Haitian president said he would 'remain vigilant to the
declaration of democracy expressed by the people of Haiti, as together with
the people of Haiti we move toward a new beginning'. But Mr Aristide's
advisers said the omission of any endorsement of the new agreement was
deliberate. Mr Aristide was also said to be uneasy that the US had not
started to disarm the Haitian military.
Briefing congressional leaders at the White House, Mr Clinton said: 'This is
a very different and a much better day than it would have been had we not
been able to successfully combine the credible threat of force with
diplomacy.' He added that Washington 'must be prepared for the risks that
remain for the troops, but we should recognise that we are in a much
stronger and safer position to achieve our goals in Haiti today'.
Members of Congress from both parties remained sceptical about the chances
of restoring democracy to Haiti, and unhappy about the prospect that US
troops would have to remain in large numbers, probably until at least
February.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Azerbaijan oil deal is signed in face of Russian protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The largest deal between foreign oil companies and a former Soviet republic
was signed yesterday in the Azerbaijani capital Baku - but the Russian
foreign ministry immediately refused to recognise the Dollars 8bn agreement.
The refusal, from Mr Grigory Karasin, chief spokesman for the Russian
foreign ministry, follows Moscow's stated intention to control and if
necessary stop all oil and gas exploitation in the Caspian Sea unless it
dictates the terms.
Russia is demanding that the pipeline route should pass through its
territory, giving it a stranglehold over energy exports from Azerbaijan. In
fact, western consortium members favour upgrading the existing pipeline to
Russia, given that an alternative route to Turkey would have to pass through
Iran.
However, the deal omitted agreement on a pipeline route to get the oil to
hard-currency markets, although the contract calls for its construction
within 4 1/2 years.
Representatives from a consortium of 10 companies, led by British Petroleum,
signed the 30-year contract with Azeri president Haydar Aliyev. The
production-sharing deal was the culmination of three years of negotiations,
variously described by Mr Aliyev as 'tense' and 'not easy at all'.
The Russian deputy energy minister was present at the signing ceremony,
which suggests a clash of interests between the Russian energy and foreign
ministries.
The consortium is likely to use oil swap deals with Russia or Iran to export
the relatively small volumes of early oil production. That will begin within
18 months and build up to 80,000 barrels a day by 1997.
The consortium plans to develop the fields in phases. The offshore fields
contain potential reserves of about 3.8bn barrels of high-quality crude oil.
Peak output could reach 700,000 barrels a day, a level that might 'reshape
the pattern of trade in energy supplies', according to Mr John Browne,
managing director of BP Exploration. Azeri production is 160,000 b/d at
present.
Mr Browne said the risk that a long-term transport solution might prove
elusive would be reduced by 'pacing investment according to the means of
getting the oil out'.
In addition to BP, consortium members include Amoco, Unocal, McDermott and
Pennzoil, all of the US, Statoil of Norway, Ramco of the UK, Turkish
Petroleum, Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, and Delta, a private Saudi
company. Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, has a 20 per cent
interest.
The most recent member of the consortium is Lukoil, the Russian semi-private
oil company which was given 10 per cent of the project from the Azeri
government stake after strong pressure from Russia for its inclusion.
However, it appears that that share - thought sufficient to satisfy Russian
demands - is not enough for the Russian government to bless the venture.
The deal must be ratified by the Azeri parliament - which has proved
volatile when faced with decisions it judges to be against the national
interest. A strong strain of opinion opposes the entry of western oil
companies.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Michelin bounces back into profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Michelin, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, bounced back into the black
in the first half of 1994, reporting a net profit of FFr410m (Pounds 49m)
after minority interests compared with a loss of FFr3.19bn last time.
The result reflected a recovery in the European car market after the sharp
recession of 1993 and the effects of the French group's restructuring
programme, Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said.
Michelin's rationalisation plan launched in 1993 aims to cut costs by
FFr3.5bn by the middle of next year. The workforce has been cut to about
120,000 from 129,000 at the beginning of 1993. Salary costs have fallen from
43.5 per cent of sales to 39.7 per cent.
'The results show we are on the right course', Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere
said. 'But they mark only the beginning of the re-establishment of the
financial situation'. It had taken FFr310m of provisions to cover further
staffing changes in France.
He cited continued growth in the US market and recovery in Europe as the
factors behind a rise in sales from FFr30.6bn to FFr33.27bn. In both
markets, however, the benefit to profits was restrained by the relative
strength of sales of original equipment tyres, which are sold directly to
manufacturers, as opposed to higher margin replacement tyres which are sold
to individuals.
In the US, the company expects the combined operations of Michelin and
Uniroyal Goodrich, acquired in 1990, to break even this year. After tough
negotiations with the United Rubber Workers union, Michelin said it had
implemented more efficient shifts.
Volume growth of 13 per cent in Europe, which increased market share, partly
reflected market new commercial strategy of offering a more diversified tyre
range.
Michelin has also seen strong demand for 'green' tyres, which reduce fuel
consumption by lowering resistance with the road. Michelin described the
tyres as the most important technological innovation since its development
of the radial tyre. It aims to produce about 14m green tyres this year.
A FFr2.5bn exceptional charge relating to restructuring was the principal
factor in the large loss in the first half last year. But even stripping out
exceptional charges, Michelin achieved a net profit of FFr732m against a
loss of FFr827m in the 1993 half of 1993.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michelin, best known for its dumpy Bibendum mascot, has been on a strict
dietary regime since 1990 when it swallowed Uniroyal Goodrich in a Dollars
1.5bn gulp. Digestion has not been easy. Net debt continues to lie heavily
on the group, and has fallen only 3.8 per cent since December 1992. Costs
remain high, in spite of two draconian rationalisation programmes.
Yesterday the company proudly announced that over the last year it had cut
salary costs by 3.8 percentage points to only 39.7 per cent of sales. A more
apt comparison might be with Goodyear, where wage costs last year were
equivalent to 24.4 per cent of turnover.
Michelin expects further help from a market which may not be that
co-operative. In the US, where its operations are still not in profit, the
market has enjoyed three years of growth and may soon peak. In Europe, car
sales have risen 6 per cent so far this year, but growth rates may be
slackening. The European high-margin replacement tyre market, where Michelin
is particularly strong, remains sluggish and there are no signs the group
can pass on higher raw material costs. Profits and cash flow will
undoubtedly continue to improve as Michelin rides the cycle, but if it wants
to become anything more than a large, but flabby tyre manufacturer, a
stricter regime is required.

Appearing as a character witness for Mr Walker, the peer told the Old Bailey

Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,

FT  20 SEP 94 / UAP takes full control of Colonia in DM1.2bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris yesterday announced it was mounting a DM1.2bn
(Dollars 780m) deal to pay Oppenheim, the private German group, for its
minority stake in a holding company in order to give the French insurance
group 100 per cent control of Colonia, its German insurance subsidiary.
In a complex financial deal, UAP has been able to reduce the amount of cash
paid to Oppenheim by exploiting Westdeutsche Landesbank's desire to raise
its stake in the French insurance company.
UAP will finance the deal 45 per cent in 'quasi-own funds' or bonds
convertible into shares, 33 per cent in ordinary bonds and the remaining 22
per cent in cash.
Last October UAP and Suez, the French financial group, swapped their
insurance holdings. Suez gained Victoire's French insurance subsidiaries,
and UAP took Victoire's 78.8 per cent stake in Vinci, a specialist holding
company controlling various European insurances companies notably Colonia,
the third largest German insurer with DM8.8bn worth of business a year. The
remaining stake in Vinci was held by the Oppenheim family, who had earlier
sold out control to Victoire.
'With the Oppenheims having a 'put' or option to sell their stake, it was
always clear that if they exercised it we would try to buy the stake,' said
UAP, adding that 'the only question for us was how to minimise our cash
outlay'.
UAP's opportunity arose when it was privatised earlier this year.
Westdeutsche Landesbank joined the 'noyau dur', or core of institutional
investors organised by the French government. Like other core investors its
stake was scaled back to 2.2 per cent by the French government, but the
regional German bank wanted a higher stake.
By putting up FFr482m (Dollars 92m) to buy bonds convertible into UAP shares
 -thereby providing the French group with cash to pass on to the Oppenheim
group - the German bank will now see its stake in UAP rise to 3 per cent.
One third of the Oppenheim group's DM1.2bn stake will be paid for in bonds
convertible into shares in the year 2000, one third in ordinary four-year
bonds redeemable in cash, and one third in cash.
This will leave the Oppenheim group with a 2.5 per cent stake in UAP.

Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, aims to build its fledgling
telecommunications subsidiary into an international operation with sales of
DM8bn a year by 2003, according to Mr Ulrich Hartmann, group chairman.
Further steps announced yesterday included the purchase of a 10 per cent
stake in the Iridium satellite communications group and agreement on a joint
venture with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway.
The group is also close to concluding an agreement on selling a stake in its
Vebacom telecoms subsidiary, set up in March this year, to an international
partner, Mr Hartmann revealed in a speech in Dusseldorf last night.
The group aimed to invest DM6bn by 2003, building up telecommunications into
a business with a 10 per cent share of the German market, and creating
10,000 new jobs in the process.
In a flurry of developments, Veba announced it was to invest Dollars 140m in
a 10 per cent stake in Iridium, and signed an agreement in principle with
Deutsche Bahn, which will give it access to the signalling and track
network.
Iridium, whose other key shareholders include Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint
of the US, plans to launch a network of 66 low-orbiting satellites in 1996
which will provide global wireless communications services. Veba's stake
will give it exclusive rights to run the service in northern and western
Europe.
Mr Hartmann said the aim was to offer new-generation mobile telephone
services from 1998, allowing users to call worldwide using the same handset
and number. The service to the remainder of the continent will be run by
Stet, the Italian group.
According to Mr Hartmann, Vebacom had applied for a licence from the post
ministry to run a ground-based network in co-operation with Deutsche Bahn,
based in Leipzig, to supply a limited customer base with high-performance
services.
The group's telecommunications business, based on the internal network of
its Preussen Elektra power generation and distribution division, is in the
early stages of development, but growing quickly. Vebacom already holds a
28.25 per cent stake in E-Plus, Germany's latest portable telecommunications
network, and has recently forged links with private concerns in France and
Switzerland.
Mr Hartmann said he expected Vebacom to start showing profits by 1999. While
the link with Deutsche Bahn appeared to be a pre-emptive strike against
other German corporations developing telecommunications divisions, and could
face strong political and industrial opposition, the revelation of
negotiations with several potential partners, signalled a major step
forward.
Mr Hartmann said he expected to reach agreement with a suitable partner
before the end of the year. 'I would not go into the business without a
strategic partnership,' he said.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Portugal trims rates as inflation eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's central bank yesterday cut two important money market rates by
half a point in a reversal of the European trend towards higher interest
rates. The measure, triggered by falling inflation, will support government
efforts to stimulate economic recovery.
The Bank of Portugal lowered the emergency lending rate for overnight funds
from 12 to 11.5 per cent and the liquidity absorption rate from 9.25 to 8.75
per cent. The variable repurchase rate for seven-day funds was cut by 0.25
points to 9.25 per cent.
Lowering these rates will reduce the cost of funds to banks and should
filter through the economy as lower lending rates for corporate financing
and investment, as well as reductions in personal mortgage and borrowing
rates. The repurchase rate is the average rate at which banks trade on the
money market.
The emergency rate is the cost of funds for banks whose reserves are short
at the close of trading. The absorption rate is the rate at which banks can
place excess funds with the central bank.
Falling inflation, a lower fiscal deficit and a stable currency have enabled
the central bank to cut money market rates gradually since they were
reintroduced in early July.
They had been suspended two months earlier to help fight speculation on the
escudo.
The central bank's decision to cut the compulsory cash reserve requirement
for banks from 17 per cent of deposits to 2 per cent from November 1 should
lead to further rate cuts. Existing reserves will initially be absorbed by
special bonds.
Mr David McWilliams, senior European economist with Union Bank of
Switzerland, said Portugal was bucking the trend in the rest of southern
Europe by lowering rates and securing a non-inflationary economic climate.
'It is an indication that the Portuguese financial system is becoming
increasingly market-oriented,' he said. Year-on-year inflation fell from 6.3
per cent in January to 4.8 per cent in August.
The fiscal deficit is forecast to fall to about 6.1 per cent of gross
domestic product from 6.9 per cent in 1993.
From a low of Es104.5 to the D-Mark during the currency crisis of May, the
escudo has appreciated to a current level of about Es101.7.
Lower interest rates will help foster recovery from last year's recession,
when GDP shrank 1.3 per cent.
The government is forecasting growth of about 1 per cent this year and 2.5
per cent in 1993.
Analysts said the Bank of Portugal had been under 'moral pressure' from the
government to lower interest rates but yesterday's move appeared to reflect
supply and demand on the money market. They expect the central bank to halt
rate cuts at the first sign of renewed pressure on the escudo.

Poll result 'the worst possible'

Fears that Sweden's new Social Democratic government would not be strong
enough to push through tough spending cuts yesterday alarmed financial
markets which marked shares lower and bond yields higher.
The main disappointment was the weak electoral showing by the Liberal party
which initially seemed to rule it out as a potential coalition partner for
the Social Democrats.
The market believes Liberal influence would strengthen the government's
resolve to push through strong measures to tackle Sweden's yawning budget
deficit, which last year ran at 13 per cent of gross national product, and
fast-rising debt.
'This is the worst possible scenario,' said Mr Christian Diebitsch, analyst
with Kleinwort Benson in London.
'We have a weak left-wing government which isn't strong enough to implement
spending cuts on its own and a Liberal party which isn't strong enough to
support them.'
He said the market was looking for a budget strengthening package of between
SKr100bn and SKr150bn (Dollars 13.5bn and Dollars 20.2bn), compared with the
SKr61bn package outlined by the Social Democrats before the election.
The market's early reaction was clearly negative, as long-term interest
rates rose, share prices tumbled and the krona weakened.
A rally later in the day brought a strengthening of the Swedish currency, as
it became clear that a Social Democratic-Liberal coalition had not been
ruled out by prime minister-designate Ingvar Carlsson.
But it was not enough to wipe out the bond and share losses.
The general stock exchange index closed 0.38 percentage points lower at
1,424.9 while the yield on the benchmark five-year bond closed 14 points
higher at 10.86.
Analysts said the market would not relax until the government produced a
tough financial package with clear strategic objectives.
Mr James McKay, economist with Kidder Peabody in London, said: 'The election
has failed to clear the political air, with the bond and currency markets
likely to remain nervous until the government's deficit-cutting credentials
are established.'
Worry about Sweden's shaky public finances means the Swedish ten-year bond
yield is already four hundred basis points higher than its German
equivalent.
The increase has weakened the Swedish krona and led to a reduction in growth
forecasts for 1995.
Mr Carlsson said yesterday his party would not come out with an economic
package before it formally assumed power in early October. But he pledged to
seek early implementation of a decision to tighten Sweden's budget-making
process.

Yorkshire Food Group is to pay Hobson, the homecare and food products group,
Pounds 7.6m for a packaging business.
The packaging interests are part of the FE Barber food division which Hobson
bought last April as part of a Pounds 111m deal for the food manufacturing
business of the Co-operative Wholesale Society.
Mr Andrew Regan, Hobson chief executive, said the move represented a
re-focusing of the Co-op businesses to their core areas.
'We intend to concentrate on what the division does best,' he said, and
added that Hobson expected to sell a further two subsidiaries from the Co-op
deal.
The final consideration for yesterday's sale will depend on the audited net
asset value of the business, with a maximum consideration of Pounds 8m
payable by Yorkshire Food.
Hobson is also keeping Pounds 2.6m of trade debtors owed to Barber, said Mr
Regan.
The packing division made pre-tax profits after corporate charges of Pounds
238,000 on sales of Pounds 23m for the year to January 8.
Mr Paul Haley, Yorkshire Food finance director, said the company had
identified Pounds 750,000 worth of charges which it believed would not
recurr under its new ownership. Net assets at the year end were Pounds
3.85m.
The business consists of two sites, one in Manchester and one in Glasgow,
and packs products including flour, rice, pulses and nuts.
Yorkshire Food intends to close down the Glasgow site. Mr Haley said 'a
small number' of the sixty people employed at the Scottish plant would be
offered alternative employment.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Medeva joins SKB in vaccine development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the rapidly-growing pharmaceuticals company, has formed an alliance
with its larger rival SmithKline Beecham that will 'secure the future of our
vaccines division', said Dr Bill Bogie, Medeva's chief executive.
The deal will give Medeva an unspecified royalty income from worldwide sales
of a new generation of combination vaccines that allow many drugs to be
injected at once. Dr Bogie estimated the world market for such vaccines to
be Pounds 650m a year.
Under the deal, SmithKline has been granted exclusive worldwide rights to a
protein called 69kDa, part of a new whooping cough vaccine that is easier to
include in combination vaccines.
SmithKline said the deal would 'allow us to accelerate our development
projects on combination vaccines.'
Whooping cough vaccines are already part of a combination of three vaccines
with diphtheria and tetanus (DTP) of which about 30m doses are sold each
year in Europe and the US. Dr Bogie said that a vaccine that combines six
drugs instead of the current three should sell for about Pounds 20 a shot.
Separately, the two companies agreed to co-develop and market in the UK new
combined vaccines containing DTP and a hepatitis vaccine.
They are also in talks in extending the arrangement to manufacturing.
Vaccines have for many years been the poor relation of other drugs mainly
because they are given only once.

Although turnover rose 5 per cent, Dinkie Heel's pre-tax profits were down
25 per cent from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 231,000 for the half year to June
30.
The company, which supplies components for footwear manufacture and repair,
saw turnover increase from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.65m.
Mr David Parkes, chairman, said profits had been affected by loss of
production, owing to the need to replace furnace equipment in June rather
than during the July holiday period.
Earnings per share were 1.35p (1.76p). The interim dividend is unchanged at

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Datrontech plans to come to market with
Pounds 50m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Datrontech, a leading supplier and distributor of computer memory and other
PC components, plans to come to market late next month through a placing
with institutional investors which is expected to value the Aldershot-based
group at about Pounds 50m.
The company was founded in 1987 by Mr Steve King, managing and marketing
director, and Mr Ian Boyle, sales director. Its expansion reflects the
underlying growth of personal computer sales.
These are expected to continue to grow at around 20 per cent a year, coupled
with the strong demand for PC memory fuelled by successive generations of
more powerful microprocessors and more complex software.
Last year Datrontech, which has 96 employees, lifted adjusted operating
profits to Pounds 2.6m from Pounds 1.9m in 1992 and Pounds 1.7m the previous
year on turnover which grew by 86 per cent to Pounds 46m (Pounds 24.7m), up
from Pounds 15.9m in 1991. It expects turnover to exceed Pounds 60m this
year.
Pre-tax profits in the half year to June 30 increased to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds
1.4m) on turnover of Pounds 35m (Pounds 23m).
Memory products accounted for 88 per cent of Datrontech's turnover last year
 -the company has about 5 per cent of the combined UK and Irish memory
market which was worth Pounds 646m, based on figures from Dataquest, the
market research organisation.
The company has a close relationship with California-based Kingston
Technology, one of the fastest growing private companies in the US, whose
memory products account for about 40 per cent of Datrontech's sales. Its
suppliers also include most of the main computer technology providers
including IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Creative Labs.
Although the PC memory market has become increasingly competitive,
Datrontech has managed to maintain above-average margins despite expanding
into the lower-margin original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market in the
UK. It emphasises its customer service policy and was one of the first IT
companies to introduce 'just-in-time delivery' and 97 per cent of orders are
met within 24 hours.
Datrontech is expected to raise up to Pounds 5m through the flotation.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Emerging markets help Edinburgh Fund to
Pounds 7.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Fund Managers, the fund management group, reported a 99 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits for the half-year to July 31, from Pounds 3.72m to
Pounds 7.39m. New products, particularly those aimed at the emerging
markets, together with the recovery in the financial markets, were largely
behind the rise.
Mr Peter Arthur, finance director, cautioned that the comparison with the
same period last year had to be set against the background then of depressed
market conditions; also, the 1993 interims did not include contributions
from two important acquisitions. Compared with the second half results,
which he considered more meaningful, pre-tax profits were 22 per cent ahead.
Two new investment trusts - the New Tiger Trust aimed at the far eastern
market and the Inca Trust targeting Latin America - had raised over Pounds
180m from investors.
Fund management income rose 63 per cent to Pounds 11.71m (Pounds 7.17m)
compared with the same period last year, while group turnover increased by a
similar amount to Pounds 12.85m (Pounds 7.84m). Earnings per share jumped 93
per cent to 26.7p (13.8p). The interim dividend is set at 8p (6p), with the
company expecting to pay a maintained final of 22p.
Edinburgh's geographical spread shifted year-on-year towards the emerging
economies. Funds under management in the UK slipped from 61 per cent to 55
per cent, while the Pacific Rim rose from 16 to 21 per cent and Latin
America from 2 to 4 per cent. Investment trusts increased their share of the
company's income, rising from 42 to 47 per cent.
The volatility in the world markets contributed to a fall in total funds
under management from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 3.8bn.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New service costs cut IoM Steam to Pounds
1.18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, the ferry operator, yesterday announced a
38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.18m for
the six months to end-June.
The cost of establishing the Mannin Line, a freight service from Great
Yarmouth to Ijmuiden in the Netherlands, launched in November, helped
depress trading profit by 42 per cent to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.91m).
Turnover of the company, in which Sea Containers has a 41.97 per cent stake,
increased 5 per cent to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 11.9m) despite lower traffic
levels on the company's core Isle of Man routes.
Mr Juan Kelly, chairman, said: 'In a group sense it is the Mannin Line which
is pulling us down, but we have always said that was a long-term operation.'
Mannin results were in line with expectations with a steady improvement
throughout the period. Nearly two thirds of the loss was incurred in the
first quarter. Finance costs in the second half are expected to improve
after the Pounds 3.2m purchase of a ferry in August.
The introduction in June of a new SeaCat service on the Isle of Man routes
helped to boost total passenger carryings by 11 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 5.42p to 3.48p and the interim dividend is held
at 1.75p.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional items check MAI increase to
9.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services and television group, reported a 9.5 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 80.2m to Pounds 87.9m for the year
to June 30. This year's figure reflects an exceptional gain of Pounds 8m on
the disposal of fixed assets and a Pounds 16.8m loss on disposal of a
discontinued operation.
Earnings per share rose to 16.6p (15.8p).
The results were boosted by MAI's newest business - television - with
Meridian Broadcasting making a Pounds 5m operational profit ahead of
schedule and Anglia Television contributing Pounds 5m since its acquisition
in March. The company says broadcasting will now become 'a major
contributor' to group profits and a strong base for future growth.
The exceptional items that helped depress MAI's share price yesterday
involved a loss of Pounds 16.8m from the closure of Safeguard Insurance
Services, which had ' performed poorly in difficult markets over the past
two years'. The net loss included goodwill of Pounds 16.2m written off to
reserves in prior years. There was also an Pounds 8m profit from the sale of
an investment in Havas SA.
Before the deduction of the net exceptional loss profit before tax was
Pounds 96.7m and earnings per share were 18.4p. The share price fell 23p
yesterday to close at 255.5p.
MAI's turnover increased 34 per cent to Pounds 709.7m (Pounds 527.7m). The
final dividend is 5.8p (4.9p), making a total of 7.8p (6.9p). Sir James
McKinnon, chairman, said the combination of consistent investment, constant
product improvement and innovation, close control of costs and favourable
markets helped the businesses achieve good profit growth.
MAI's money and securities businesses achieved an overall profit of Pounds
61.2m, an increase of 9 per cent. MAI said that volumes in the securities
broking markets closed after the interest rate increase in the US in
February although money broking volumes rose as the year progressed. The
company has recently got a new licence in Tokyo for brokering Japanese
government bonds.
' A lot of new markets are emerging,' Lord Hollick, the MAI chief executive
said yesterday.
Growth in car sales and a fall in bad debt lifted the profits of Wagon
Finance, the motor credit company to Pounds 11.4m a rise of 24 per cent.
MAI's information division, which provides marketing and financial
information, performed strongly and profits rose 35 per cent to Pounds
10.8m.
Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of between Pounds 115m and Pounds
116m for the current year.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Sanderson Bramall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sanderson Bramall Motor Group, the West Yorkshire-based motor distributor,
more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 3.01m in the
first half of 1994, boosted by acquisitions.
In August 1993 Sanderson bought Skipper Group from RTZ for Pounds 14m and in
April this year it acquired Petrogate for some Pounds 5.5m plus its debt of
just under Pounds 11m. These lifted the number of the group's dealerships
from 12 to 33. Of this, 24 are car dealerships and nine commercial.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 1.25m), including Pounds
864,000 (Pounds 75,000) from acquisitions. Turnover advanced to Pounds
189.9m (Pounds 64.4m), with Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 4.86m) from acquisitions.
The number of new commercial vehicles sold jumped to 1,564 (200), while new
cars sold rose to 6,490 (2,925). However, Mr Tony Bramall, chairman and
chief executive, said that the group's main profit centres were its
after-sales business, the value-added packages underpinning its new and used
car sales, and the used car operations. Used cars sold increased to 5,440
(1,780).
Mr Bramall explained that the used car operations benefited from the lack of
makers' restrictions imposed on new cars, that trade prices had held up
well, and that there had been none of the previously seen 'seasonal
drift-down'.
Since the acquisitions - which lifted gearing to the mid 80s, since reduced
to the low 70s via property disposals - the group 'needed to digest', said
Mr Bramall. It still had about Pounds 5m-worth of property to sell, half in
the second half and half in 1995.
The interim dividend is lifted to 1p (0.66p), payable from earnings per
share of 6.3p (3.7p). The interim is likely to be one-third of the year's
total.

ISA International, the Bradford-based distributor of computer consumables,
reported pre-tax profits up by 15 per cent from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 2.56m
in the six months to the end of June.
Turnover grew by 37 per cent to Pounds 91m (Pounds 66.6m). ISA said gross
margins had been reduced as a result of increasing exports to new markets.
Mr Jim Salmon, who took over as chairman earlier this month, said the
company had been in talks with a number of manufacturers about working more
closely together. The benefits should be seen in the next 12 months.
Earnings per share came out at 3.821p (3.293p) and the interim dividend is
being raised from 0.55p to 0.605p.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke moves into US gaming business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke Group raised its stake in the global gaming market with the
announcement yesterday of a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) deal to build a card
club in California.
The 60-table club is Ladbroke's first venture into the US gaming business
and fits into the group's strategy of establishing itself as a major player
in the worldwide casino market.
Earlier this month, the company ended a 15-year absence from the UK casino
business with the Pounds 50m purchase of three London casinos to add to its
international collection of 13.
Ladbroke was forced to give up four West End casinos in 1979 after
allegations of malpractice over its attempts to win business from rivals.
The US venture, in San Pablo in the San Francisco Bay area, is expected to
be the first in a series of moves to begin gaming activities across the US.
The company said: 'we are looking at a number of gaming opportunities around
the world, particularly in the US where the gaming market is going through
tremendous growth at the moment.'
Another card club is planned in Albany, also in the San Francisco Bay area,
where the group already owns and operates a racetrack. Ladbroke Racing
Corporation, the group's US division, now hopes to introduce slot machines
at its racetrack in Michigan. It owns two further tracks in Pennsylvania and
Texas.
The company intends to operate non-gaming facilities at the first card club,
while leasing gaming operations to SF Casino Management. At present,
Californian law prohibits a publicly traded company from holding a licence.
Construction of the club is expected to begin this winter, in order to be
open for business next autumn.
The group's pre-tax profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 51.3m for the six
months to end-June, with turnover rising to Pounds 2.29bn (Pounds 2.21bn).

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Kwik Save ends 'standstill agreement' with
Dairy Farm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save, the discount retailer, and its main shareholder Dairy Farm
International, are ending the 'standstill agreement' that prevents Dairy
Farm from selling its stake or making a full bid for the company without
prior notice.
The two sides said the agreement had 'outlived its purpose' and would lapse
after Kwik Save's full-year results in November. Dairy Farm, which holds
29.4 per cent of Kwik Save, added it had 'no present intention' of making an
offer for the company.
Kwik Save's shares closed down 3p at 604p. The shares have rallied recently
on rumours that Dairy Farm was preparing a bid.
Mr Derek Pretty, Kwik Save's finance director, said the agreement had been
reached after Dairy Farm, a Hong Kong-based company owned by Jardine
Matheson, first acquired a 25 per cent stake in Kwik Save in 1987 - later
increased by open market purchases to the present level. It gave Dairy Farm
board representation, and required it to give 30 days' notice of an
intention to sell its stake or make a bid.
Since then, the two companies had developed a 'co-operative, supportive and
positive relationship', with the two managements 'very much intertangled'.
Dairy Farm provided Kwik Save's last two chief executives, and its latest
chairman, Mr Simon Keswick.
Institutional investors indicated they did not favour the agreement, and Mr
Pretty said the 30-day 'window' would have had a disruptive effect on the
market for Kwik Save shares if Dairy Farm had indicated an intention to bid.
He said shareholders were adequately protected by the Takeover Code rules on
bids.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible advances 8% - Speciality
materials division hit by decline in defence markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials manufacturer, is increasing its
dividend for the first time since 1991 after reporting an 8 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 35m.
Mr Bruce Farmer, managing director, said the 3.5 per cent increase in the
dividend to 5.95p reflected confidence in the future. Earnings per share for
the six months to July 4 rose by 8 per cent to 10.3p (9.5p). 'We are now
seeing some upturn in demand, particularly in Germany and France, and price
increases are sticking.'
He added that the company was not suffering from the squeeze on margins
reported by many other manufacturers. Operating margins were steady at 10.2
per cent and Mr Farmer predicted they would improve in the second half.
The figures include profits of Pounds 3.6m and sales of Pounds 49.3m from
Holt Lloyd, the car care business sold to management for Pounds 63.5m last
month. Mr Farmer said the deal would not dilute earnings because much of the
cash would be recycled into bolt-on acquisitions. However, he stressed that
year-end gearing would be below 50 per cent, compared with almost 70 per
cent at the start of the year.
There was unchanged net cash inflow of Pounds 5.2m after capital investment
of Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 17.7m) and acquisition and deferred consideration
costs of Pounds 5.1m.
Mr Farmer said the main areas of continued weakness were defence, now
accounting for less than 3 per cent of turnover, and Japan. Australasia was
patchy but continental Europe had recovered more quickly than expected.
Group order intake was up 6 per cent compared with a 2.6 per cent rise in
sales to Pounds 412m (Pounds 401.6m). Morgan is seeing good growth from new
products such as components for safety air bags in cars which should
generate sales of about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) this year.
Operating profits rose 3 per cent to Pounds 42.1m with the carbon, technical
ceramics and thermal ceramics divisions all ahead. Profits from speciality
materials slipped to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 8.1m), hit by declining defence and
nuclear power markets.
The shares closed 4 1/2 p higher at 332p.
COMMENT
Morgan Crucible has responded to institutional shareholders' concerns by
generating cash and selling Holt Lloyd so the recent weakness in the shares
might appear churlish. The truth is that the shares had got a bit ahead of
themselves after a strong run. While profits growth is steady rather than
sparkling the drag from defence cannot last for ever, if only because it is
now so small. While other manufacturers complain of intense pressure on
margins Mr Farmer is confident Morgan's margins will swell from just over 10
per cent to more than 14 per cent over the next two to three years. The pace
should pick up in the second half driving profits to about Pounds 74m,
before the gain on the Holt Lloyd sale. On a multiple of only 15 the shares
are starting to look attractive again.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved margins behind Roxboro's 51%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in The Roxboro Group rose 14p to 246p yesterday as the specialist
electronics group announced a 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for
the six months to July 1.
Profits grew from Pounds 2.97m to Pounds 4.49m on turnover ahead 19 per cent
at Pounds 26.1m, compared with Pounds 22.1m.
The group came to the market in November at 230p and completed the
acquisition of Solartron, a sensors, transducers and instrumentation group,
for Pounds 43m in May. In a little over a month, Solartron contributed
Pounds 726,000 to operating profits from turnover of Pounds 4.72m.
Mr Harry Tee, chief executive, said that operating margins for the group had
risen from 14.1 per cent to 17 per cent. For the full 1993 year they stood
at 15.9 per cent. Solartron had been slightly margin dilutive, though Mr Tee
said he would be very disappointed if it was to be more than that over the
full year.
He said that the group - now reorganised into three divisions: specialist
components, sensors and instrumentation - was looking to expand further. He
wanted to strengthen Dialight, the visual indication company,
internationally, especially into Europe. The group also wanted to expand its
sensors operations.
BLP Components, the electro-magnetic products company, operated in 'smart'
metering, which, according to Mr Tee, was a market waiting to take off.
While the introduction of smart electricity meters depended on the regional
electricity companies and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, smart gas meters were more likely to grow in the short term.
The large after-market helped Weston Aerospace, which makes sensors for
aerospace applications, buck the trend in that sector and maintain high
margins. Mr Tee said that instrumentation had the weakest margins, though
there was good growth in vibration monitoring for turbines.
Earnings grew 42 per cent to 8.1p (5.7p) and the maiden interim dividend is
1.5p, as forecast at the time of the Solartron purchase.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fall in UK sales pushes Magnolia to Pounds
0.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following its warning in June that first half performance would be
disappointing, Magnolia, the picture frame and reproductions company, turned
in a loss of Pounds 309,000 against a profit of Pounds 76,000 last time and
announced a rationalisation in its UK operations.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 was down from Pounds 9.05m to Pounds
8.41m.
This was largely as a result of a decline in the UK market for traditional
wooden mouldings, said Mr David Wallrock, chairman. Demand had been in
steady decline throughout the recession and continued to be suppressed by
the flat housing market and increasing competition from plastic frames.
As a result, the group is to rationalise its UK wholesale business through a
writedown of stocks. The costs are expected to have little impact on
borrowings.
The plastic moulding side, established last year, now accounts for 50 per
cent of production and the group is also looking overseas for growth. Lira,
the Czech picture framing company acquired in June, has been trading above
budget but has not contributed to these results.
There were losses per share of 5.39p (earnings 0.92p).

FT  20 SEP 94 / GrandMet sets store by its spirits shelf: Pounds 140m of a
charge to reshape drinks arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While getting out of the US pet food market was seen in the City yesterday
as a smart move for Grand Metropolitan, the announcement of further
restructuring costs at the UK food and drinks group was not so welcome.
The Pounds 280m exceptional operating charge, to be taken this year, follows
last year's Pounds 175m charge for reorganising the North American food
operations.
When Lord Sheppard became chairman in 1986 GrandMet was running around 30
disparate businesses. He identified food and drink as the two sectors on
which the group should concentrate its efforts.
Yesterday he said: 'Over recent years GrandMet has moved from a multifaceted
conglomerate to a highly focused branded international food and drinks
business.'
Half of the latest charge will be devoted to International Distillers and
Vintners, the world's biggest spirits producer. IDV is the jewel in
GrandMet's crown, accounting for half the profits, but tough conditions in
some of its main markets, such as the US and Germany, have led to what the
group called yesterday 'uneven trading'.
At the time of the interim results in May, GrandMet said that destocking in
the US drinks market was likely to cost it Pounds 40m this year. Yesterday
it warned that IDV's profits are expected to be lower when the full-year
results are announced on December 1.
Last year's restructuring produced annualised cost savings of Pounds 70m,
and helped the group to increase its marketing spend by Pounds 50m over last
year's Pounds 879m. The latest programme is expected to bring in a further
reduction of Pounds 90m a year over the next two years.
Mr George Bull, who became chief executive last December, said the in-depth
review of the group's businesses over the last 18 months had been aimed at
improving long-term growth in earnings and cash flow.
'The benefit of these programmes will be an overall reduction in our cost
base which will allow increased investment in our brands,' he said.
The Pounds 140m allocated to IDV, which has 13 of the world's top 100 brands
and operates in 50 countries, will be spent on 200 different projects,
concentrating on plant rationalisation, office closures and redundancies.
The group has been encouraged by the success of the North American programme
 -mainly at Pillsbury - to take a hard look at IDV's cost base.
With limited room for growth in Europe and the US, and not much room for
price increases, GrandMet is excited by potential markets in Asia and
eastern Europe, both for drinks and food.
Restructuring the European food businesses - mainly Brossard, the cake maker
and Haagen-Dazs Europe, the ice-cream maker - will soak up Pounds 55m.
European food contributed Pounds 735m to turnover but only Pounds 15m of
operating profits last year. Again, the group would be looking to streamline
production and improve efficiency in order to get a satisfactory return.
A further Pounds 32m will be spent on a restructuring programme already in
progress at Burger King, the hamburger chain, and Pounds 20m on cutting
corporate costs.
Charges of Pounds 28m relate to a further reduction in the group's property
portfolio. The properties - put up for sale in June - include the former
Truman Brewery in London's Brick Lane. They are expected to generate more
than Pounds 60m of cash, helping to keep the net cash cost of the whole
restructuring package to less than Pounds 100m.
GrandMet said yesterday that before exceptionals, restructuring and tax,
profits for the year to end this month would 'show improvement over last
year', when it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 630m after Pounds 286m of
charges. Free cashflow - Pounds 549m last time - had 'remained strong'.
The exceptional Pounds 200m profit from the sale of the Alpo petfood
business to Nestle will be recorded in the 1994-95 accounts. Alpo, which has
net assets estimated at Dollars 150m (Pounds 95m), is expected to make a
trading profit of Dollars 47m for the year ending this month on sales of
Dollars 430m.
Nestle, the world's biggest food group, is paying Dollars 510m for Alpo, the
seventh largest operator in the competitive US petfood market.
The deal, which could make Nestle market leader in US dogfood, is subject to
review by the US Federal Trade Commission.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Tiphook directors insist chief should stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Central Transport Rental Group, formerly Tiphook, have
examined the details of chief executive Robert Montague's complex personal
finances, including an estimated Pounds 30m of debt, and are committed to
him staying with the troubled leasing company.
Following last Thursday's revelation, that the Royal Bank of Scotland's had
issued a bankruptcy petition against Mr Montague, (below), the Tiphook
founder has lain low, refusing to explain any difficulties concerning the
Pounds 2.3m bank loan.
The directors and newly-appointed chairman Ian Clubb, have analysed his
situation. Mr Clubb stated his continued commitment to Mr Montague.
It is not known what assets Mr Montague has linked to his debts. He owns a
13,000-acre estate in Oxfordshire, a London town-house, and a number of
private business interests.
Mr Montague comes from an affluent family, and news of his troubles shocked
Thursday's Annual General Meeting, which had focused on the large
remuneration paid to him.
Commerzbank and Barclays, which have the largest exposure to Mr Montague's
debts, have both remained silent about their intentions.
However, RBS, which has indicated that the move was a last ditch attempt to
resolve an 'an unacceptable situation', has yet to present the petition to
Mr Montague, and sources at Tiphook remain confident that he will remain
solvent.
Regardless of the outcome, the crisis will put greater strains on Tiphook's
struggle to survive with around Pounds 520m debt, and two loss-making
businesses.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UAP in deal for Colonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris yesterday announced it was mounting a DM1.2bn
(Pounds 493m) deal to pay Oppenheim, the private German group, for its
minority stake in a holding company in order to give the French insurance
group 100 per cent control of Colonia, its German insurance subsidiary.
In a complex deal, UAP has been able to reduce the amount of cash paid to
Oppenheim by exploiting Westdeutsche Landesbank's desire to raise its stake
in the French insurance company.
Last October UAP and Suez, the French financial group, swapped their
insurance holdings. Suez gained Victoire's French insurance subsidiaries,
and UAP took Victoire's 78.8 per cent stake in Vinci, a specialist holding
company controlling Colonia, the third largest German insurer. The remaining
stake in Vinci was held by the Oppenheim family.
'With the Oppenheims having a 'put' or option to sell their stake, it was
always clear that if they exercised it we would try to buy the stake,' said
UAP.
UAP's opportunity arose when it was privatised earlier this year.
Westdeutsche Landesbank joined the 'noyau dur', or core of institutional
investors organised by the French government. Like other core investors its
stake was scaled back to 2.2 per cent by the government, but the regional
German bank wanted a higher stake.
By putting up FFr482m (Pounds 58m) to buy bonds convertible into UAP shares
 -thereby providing the French group with cash - the German bank will raise
its stake in UAP to 3 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Hochtief plans to increase stake in rival Holzmann
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hochtief, the German construction company, yesterday said it intended to
increase its stake in its rival Philipp Holzmann, fuelling speculation about
a possible takeover.
The purchase of a further 10 per cent would make Hochtief the biggest
shareholder in Holzmann lifting its stake to 28.7 per cent.
Hochtief, Germany's second biggest building group, said the purchase was
designed to increase co-operation between the companies on the international
market.
Holzmann said it would co-operate with Hochtief, especially on foreign
contracts, but warned it would do everything it could to remain independent.
Hochtief's bid must be approved by the monopolies authorities who warned
that the companies could have a dominant position in several niche markets
like bridge building. The Berlin cartel office said it would need 'a few
months' to evaluate the purchase.
Deutsche Bank is the second biggest Holzmann shareholder with 25.9 per cent
and there was speculation yesterday that Hochtief may buy some of the bank's
holding to further increase its stake.
Deutsche and other leading banks are coming under increasing pressure to
reduce their intricate web of cross-shareholdings in German companies
because they create a closed market.
The bank did not to participate in a Holzmann rights issue last year,
hinting that it was not interested in a long-term investment. Earlier this
year Deutsche said it wanted to run down shareholdings in some industrial
companies but yesterday denied immediate intentions to sell Holzmann shares.
Hochtief has held about 20 per cent of Philipp Holzmann since 1981. It plans
to buy the further 10 per cent from BfG Bank, a subsidiary of Credit
Lyonnais.
Hochtief and Holzmann would have a combined turnover of around DM20bn
(Pounds 8.2bn) but Hochtief is considerably more profitable, reporting a
1993 profit of DM122m on a turnover of DM8bn. Holzmann earned DM106m on a
turnover of DM12.4bn.
If German banks reduced their industrial shareholdings this would ensure
greater transparency on the stock markets. However, a source at Holzmann
warned that reforms would not be served if Hochtief, which is owned by RWE,
Germany's largest utility, was allowed to increase its stake.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Ronson could manage salvaged Heron: Investment group offers
creditors cash or minority equity stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of Pounds 378m of debt in Mr Gerald Ronson's property group Heron
International were yesterday offered Pounds 142m in cash, or the chance of
taking a stake in the group which could continue to be run by Mr Ronson.
HNV Acquisition, which is controlled by US entrepreneur Steven Green and has
Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Michael Milken's family trusts as backers,
yesterday released details of an offer, which will give it at least 51 per
cent of the group.
This follows the collapse of the Pounds 1.4bn bank restructuring finalised
last September.
Mr Green has proposed that the day-to-day management continues under Mr
Ronson's guidance and that he remains an executive director, but no
employment terms have been agreed. The board of Heron said it was 'highly
probable that failure to implement the proposed offers will result in
receivership and/or the instigation of bankruptcy proceedings in some or all
group companies'.
Both the board and the company's bankers, have concluded from separate
studies that the rewards of receivership would be substantially lower.
Mr Basil Vasiliou, chairman of Vasiliou &amp; Company, which speaks for a large
number of non-bank bondholders, welcomed the offer as 'extremely positive'.
It follows what has effectively been a two-year receivership that has cost
Heron about Pounds 50m.
HNV is offering Pounds 450 or 300 HNVA shares for every Pounds 1,000 of
senior debt, Pounds 60 cash or 40 shares for every Pounds 1,000 of junior
debt, and Pounds 7.50 or five new shares per old Heron share.
HNVA is committed to achieving a listing in the future, but the banks are
likely to take cash, and Mr Green is expected to be left with at least 70
per cent of the company.
The offer is conditional upon the approval of bondholders and all bank which
provide facilities to any head office division of Heron, and also on waivers
from the bankers to Heron Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which
control around Pounds 200m of debt tied to Heron's more valuable assets. The
majority of the HCP banks are similarly exposed to the parent company debt.
Mr Green emerged from a small group of bidders to become the 'preferred
buyer' last June, but the complexity of dealing with more than 80 banks has
delayed progress.
As one merchant banker involved said: 'It has been the devil's own job
persuading all the sets of bankers that there was no leeway, that it was
choice between this or liquidation.'
HNVA will end up with a company with properties valued at Pounds 312.5m and
a manageable debt structure, compared with its negative net value of Pounds
172m, in March 1994. Heron's only remaining operating business, Heron Motor
Group, is up for sale. HNVA plans to subscribe for a Pounds 17m convertible
debt issue, to provide further working capital, and has the right to
increase this to Pounds 30m.
The announcement was accompanied by Heron's profit figures for the year to
March, in which the group made an operating loss of Pounds 6.8m, against a
profit of Pounds 30.2m in 1992-93. The loss after exceptional items and
taxation fell from Pounds 218.8m to Pounds 92.3m.
The full offer document is expected to be released next month. The Heron
board has agreed not to consider any other offer until November 30.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Groupe Bull employees accused in arson case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Agents of Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer manufacturer, sought
huge increases in insurance cover for a warehouse in the two months before a
fire devasted it in 1991, according to evidence in an arson case which began
in Chicago yesterday.
A suit filed by Allendale Mutual Insurance of the US claims that the June
1991 fire, which destroyed stock worth about FFr584m (Pounds 70m) at the
warehouse in northern France, was caused by employees or associates of the
French company.
In pre-trial documents, the insurers allege that employees of the computer
company started the fire at the warehouse - a central inventory collection
point for most of Europe - to hide depreciating obsolete machinery stored
there, and to obtain insurance money and fresh capital from Bull's
creditors.
In Paris yesterday, Bull vigorously denied allegations of arson and said it
was counter-suing its former insurer for making the accusation. Bull claims
Allendale wants to avoid paying a Dollars 100m insurance claim.
The French company said it firmly rejected the allegations and that an
investigation by French authorities, completed at the beginning of this
year, found no evidence of arson.
According to Bull, the warehouse was owned and operated by a company that
was not an affiliate. The fire destroyed mainly excess inventory of Zenith
Data Systems, the personal computer manufacturer acquired by Bull in 1989.
The opening of the case follows a protracted dispute between Bull and
Allendale Mutual. With some 1,800 exhibits and 40 scheduled witnesses, the
case has already tested the patience of the presiding judge, who says he
will give both sides only seven days in court to air their dispute.
Judge George Marovich will submit his written decision some time after
October 1. The suit is being heard in federal court in Chicago because
Illinois is the US base for Bull Data Systems, the legal name for Bull's US
operations.
The suit comes as the French group is preparing for privatisation. Last
week, Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, said he hoped to reduce
the government's stake in Bull to below 50 per cent before next spring's
presidential elections.
The privatisation is due to take place through the sale of stakes to
industry partners, with a separate share offer to employees. A large public
offer of shares was deemed difficult because of the financial situation of
the group.
Bull has lost more than FFr15bn since 1990, although a restructuring package
being implemented by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the chairman, has sharply
cut losses this year.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Workers at Swan Hunter face cut in pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, could lose up to 40 per
cent of their pensions because of the expected closure of the company.
Actuaries for the pension scheme, which has roughly Pounds 60m in assets,
explained that although the scheme is technically solvent, it does not have
enough money to guarantee that all members receive their full pensions.
While the 500 or so scheme members who currently receive full pensions will
continue to do so, about 1,600 former workers with deferred pensions could
receive up to 40 per cent less than their promised benefits. This is because
the cost of buying annuities from insurance companies to guarantee the
benefits is higher than the amount which actuaries calculate will be needed
to cover the costs of full benefits to all workers.
While shortfalls in technically fully-funded schemes are not uncommon when
companies are wound up, the size of the Swan Hunter scheme makes it unusual.
Union officials yesterday expressed bitterness at the shortfall in pension
assets, saying that new government standards on minimum solvency for pension
schemes are proving worthless.
They also blame the shortfall on a 'contributions holiday' during which Swan
Hunter paid no pensions contributions for six years. This practice is common
among companies which find their pension schemes are overfunded.
One of the four union trustees of the fund, Mr Eddie Darke, said that
members were upset at the prospect of losing significant pensions money
because of the company's likely closure.
'It's a major blow. There should be some protection for pensions schemes
when they get in this position,' he said.
About half the surplus which existed when the scheme was created in 1987 was
eroded during the contributions holiday, while the remainder went on
improved pensions benefits. Workers contributed 6 per cent of their salaries
to the scheme, above the national average.
At the time the scheme was set up, actuaries calculated it had more assets
than needed to pay liabilities.
The prospects for Swan Hunter pensioners to receive their full benefits are
receding. The receiver, Price Waterhouse, now describes prospects for the
sale of the company as a 'going concern' as 'remote'.
Trustees of the Swan Hunter pension fund met yesterday at the Wallsend
shipyard and agreed to shift the remaining 50 per cent of assets still in
equities into fixed interest securities to guard against possible further
erosion of benefits.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Swedish Social Democrats look to form coalition government

<TEXT>
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister-elect, last night held out the
possibility of forming a broad-based coalition government following his
Social Democratic party's general election victory on Sunday.
The speaker of the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag, called on Mr Carlsson to
form a government with the 'widest possible base'. A spokeswoman for Mr
Carlsson said he would discuss forming a coalition with other party leaders,
including Mr Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal leader and member of the outgoing
right-centre coalition, before reporting back to the speaker today.
A Social Democrat-Liberal government would be widely welcomed by the
financial markets and Swedish industry as being likely to produce tough
action to curb Sweden's big budget deficit and fast-growing public debt.
However, both Mr Carlsson and Mr Westerberg played down the chances of such
an alliance because of the Liberals' weak performance on Sunday, when their
share of the vote fell to 7.2 per cent from 9.1 per cent in the last
election.
Mr Carlsson indicated he could instead form a minority government which
would seek co-operation on individual issues with other parties. 'My aim is
to build an effective government of co-operation,' he said.
The Social Democrats emerged winners over the four-party coalition led by Mr
Carl Bildt's conservative Moderate party but fell 13 seats short of a
parliamentary majority. The former communist Left party and the Environment
party made significant gains.
Fears that the Social Democrats might rely on the left prompted a sharp rise
in long-term interest rates and a fall in the Swedish krona on the Stockholm
stock exchange when markets opened yesterday.
Markets steadied later after Mr Carlsson said his priorities were strong
government, correcting the crisis in public finances and winning the
referendum on November 13 on Sweden's entry to the European Union.
Social Democratic officials said Mr Carlsson, who is expected to take office
in two weeks' time, intended to unveil a budget strengthening package in the
autumn, before the annual budget due in January.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British system for investigating and prosecuting fraud has once again
been found wanting. Powers that compel suspects to answer questions are
blatantly unfair - as the European Commission of Human Rights has ruled in
its assessment of the Guinness affair. But it is not as though these powers
are particularly effective anyway. Britain's record of convicting fraudsters
is notoriously poor.
A rethink is needed. A promising approach would be to abandon criminal
punishments for many classes of financial skulduggery and instead focus on
civil penalties. Those convicted could be fined, ordered to restitute funds
to those who had been damaged, and/or be disqualified from being directors.
When individuals have not personally enriched themselves, a prison sentence
often looks unnecessarily harsh. And since they would not go to jail, it
might also be acceptable to lower the standards of proof to those in civil
cases.
The main argument deployed against such an approach is that it would create
one law for the rich and one law for the poor: petty thiefs would end up in
prison, but big fraudsters would not. But this need not be so. It would
still be possible to retain criminal sanctions for cases such as
embezzlement. Moreover, if the evidence was not strong enough for a criminal
trial in such cases, surely it would be better to inflict stiff civil
penalties than no punishment at all.

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Hochtief/Holzmann
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hochtief's proposed acquisition of an additional 10 per cent stake in Philip
Holzmann signals the beginning of antagonistic relations between Germany's
two biggest construction companies. The move will take Hochtief's holding in
the larger Holzmann to 30 per cent, a platform from which Hochtief, itself a
subsidiary of the RWE energy conglomerate, is likely to agitate for
management control.
Despite Holzmann's desire to remain independent, the case for merger is
strong. The companies operate in compatible areas, with an especially good
fit outside Germany where Holzmann's DM4bn of turnover makes it twice as big
as its rival. The smaller Hochtief is the more profitable with a return of
nearly 5 per cent on turnover at the last earnings peak, five times as high
as at Holzmann. Hochtief could extract operational efficiencies at Holzmann,
whose shares have underperformed the market by 50 per cent over the past
five years.
However compelling the argument for fusion, changes of corporate control in
Germany - especially those promoted against the will of incumbent management
 -are long-drawn out affairs in which the interests of the big shareholding
banks invariably take precedence over those of minority shareholders. The
traditional, back-door way for Hochtief to win control would be to acquire
Deutsche Bank's 30 per cent stake in Holzmann (though at present the bank
says it is not selling). Better, for the evolution of Germany's financial
markets, would be for Hochtief to make a full-scale takeover offer.

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: MAI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent news about MAI has been dominated by its media side - in
particular Lord Archer's controversial share orders in the run-up to the
group's bid for Anglia Television. But that was not what was worrying the
stock market yesterday. MAI's media division, which includes Anglia,
exceeded expectations. The cost-cutting phase is over and MAI is now moving
ahead with plans to build up Anglia's TV production operations. Originally,
MAI predicted the Pounds 292m acquisition would be earnings neutral in its
first year. Now it says the deal will enhance earnings.
What sent MAI's shares tumbling 8 per cent were concerns that its money
broking operations - which still dwarf the media side - were running out of
steam. There are two things to be said about this. First, it is hardly
surprising that MAI is not enjoying the bumper conditions which prevailed
before the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in February. Second, the
group is responding to the slimmer pickings in the market by emphasising
cost-control. Not only are its wage costs variable, as bonus makes up a
large proportion of brokers' remuneration, MAI has also benefited from lower
international telecoms charges, its other main cost centre. That said, money
broking is not a fast-growing business. MAI can be expected to grasp the
opportunities to expand its media side whenever they occur.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those inclined to look back will find plenty to grumble at in yesterday's
restructuring announcement from Grand Metropolitan. The company seems unable
to shake off an inclination to pile up provisions. The Pounds 280m charge
announced yesterday, primarily for reorganisation of the drinks and European
food business, follows a Pounds 175m charge a year ago for the US food and
eye care businesses. If GrandMet really is trying clean up its accounts, why
is it still resorting so heavily to exceptional charges? If the drinks
business really is in need of surgery, why were its problems not addressed
earlier? Cynics would say the new top team is simply setting itself up for a
run of good operating profits.
Yet those prepared to look forward must admit that the new approach is both
reasonable and a reflection of GrandMet's growing internal strength.
Disposals and cash generation have strengthened its balance sheet, so it can
more easily cope with the outlay involved in restructuring. The latest
programme will enable GrandMet to spend more on marketing its spirits
brands, some of which have suffered slightly from neglect.
Two big questions remain. GrandMet clearly needs to do something about its
European food business, which lacks critical mass. The choice, left open in
yesterday's announcement, is between expansion and winding down which might
prove less risky. The other concern is whether the weakness of the spirits
business reflects fundamental pricing troubles. GrandMet's recovery will be
slower if today's austere climate has left consumers reluctant to pay up for
premium brands. That environment would hit other producers too, though. In
such a world the prizes accrue to those with the most efficient production
and distribution networks.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Legal process on trial: The Strasbourg Commission's view
that Ernest Saunders was denied a fair hearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission on Human Rights may have blown a large hole in the
British government's campaign against white-collar crime.
It has decided that Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman jailed
for theft and false accounting after the company's 1986 takeover of
Distillers, was denied a fair trial. In particular it concluded that the use
by the prosecution at his trial in 1989 of answers given by Mr Saunders
under compulsion to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors breached the
European Convention on Human Rights.
The ruling appears to be a serious blow to the Serious Fraud Office, for
which the Guinness trial was a rare high-profile success. It may have a
crucial bearing on the ability of the UK authorities to prosecute fraudsters
and other financial miscreants, which depends to a significant extent on
being able to compel suspects to answer questions.
More tentatively, it may also have implications for the government's current
strategy for combating other forms of crime by curbing the suspect's right
to silence.
The ruling is not binding and the issue will have to be decided by the full
European Court of Human Rights. That could take two years.
But if the Court upholds the Commissioners' findings, criminal law experts
believe the result would have grave implications for the fight against
fraud.
This is because the authorities might no longer be able to use the
transcripts of interviews with suspects carried out by Department of Trade
and Industry inspectors as direct evidence in court. In the view of many
experts, such interviews often play a crucial part in the prosecution case;
without them, white-collar crimes can be extraordinarily difficult to prove.
Mr John Clitheroe, a fraud lawyer and senior partner of London solicitors
Kingsley Napley, says: 'DTI transcripts were used almost as the sole basis
of the prosecution case in the Barlow Clowes trial. In many instances it's
going to be the main plank of their case.'
Mr Clitheroe believes that if the court upholds the commission's verdict the
government would have to think again about the use of evidence provided by
witnesses who have been compelled to answer questions by DTI inspectors.
The same may go for such evidence when it is obtained by company liquidators
under sections 235 and 236 of the Insolvency Act.
Until recently it was thought evidence gathered by liquidators using their
Insolvency Act powers could not be used directly in evidence at trial. But
in July the House of Lords ruled in the case of Mr Muhammed Naviede, former
chairman of Arrows trading company, that section 235 and 236 information can
be used by the prosecution at trial. A Strasbourg court decision to uphold
the commission may call this in question, too.
The SFO is making no comment about the commission's ruling. But sources
close to the office believe victory for Mr Saunders would not seriously
damage the fight against fraud. They say the SFO is no longer so reliant on
DTI inspectors' transcripts as it was at the time of the Guinness case.
Nowadays it prefers to mount its own investigation using its powers under
section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act to compel witnesses to answer its
own questions.
The SFO also believes that these draconian powers would not be affected by
the commission's ruling. The commission's complaint with Mr Saunders's
treatment is that he was compelled to answer questions and that his answers
were then used in evidence against him.
Information gathered by the SFO using its section 2 powers cannot be used as
evidence in court unless the defendant deviates from the account he gave to
the SFO. At worst, the SFO believes it might now have to consider carefully
what reliance it wanted to place on DTI transcripts in future cases.
What of the government's current attempt to curb the wider right to silence
in ordinary criminal cases? Could that, too, be impaired? Mr David Kirk, a
partner of solicitors Simons Muirhead Burton, believes the Strasbourg court
would need to go much further than the commission for the government's new
policy to be threatened.
'The new curb only goes as far as saying you can still say nothing, but if
you do say nothing the judge can comment on your silence. That's not the
same as compelling someone to answer and then using their answers against
them in court.'
But Mr Anthony Scrivener, QC, former chairman of the Bar Council, says that
irrespective of what happens to Mr Saunders's case in Strasbourg, the
government's curb on the right to silence cannot stand up:
'The first time someone is convicted without the benefit of the right to
silence, the European Court of Human Rights will recommend the conviction is
overturned.
'Most European countries uphold the right to silence. Mr Howard is trying to
take us back to the dark ages. He should treat the Commission's decision as
a shock warning of what's to come, and think again.'
If Mr Scrivener is right, and the Strasbourg court does eventually strike
down curbs on the wider right to silence, the government will be facing a
rethink not just on its campaign to clean up the City.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Chips down for PC partners: The computer industry's response
to the Compaq-Intel spat is fascinated dread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, is spending Dollars
80m - the most it has committed to an advertising campaign - to persuade
consumers and businesses to buy personal computers based on its latest
microprocessor, the Pentium.
The first newspaper, radio and TV advertisements are appearing in Europe and
the US. But behind the message that 'It's amazing what you can do with a
Pentium processor' looms a power struggle between Intel and Compaq Computer,
its biggest customer.
Intel and Compaq have for years collaborated in bringing to the market PCs
based on Intel's microprocessor chips, which have helped Compaq become the
world's leading manufacturer of powerful PCs.
However, Intel's efforts to boost sales of all Pentium-based PCs could now
harm Compaq's interests, and affect the rest of the industry, by shifting
consumer preferences ahead of a Christmas boom in home computer sales.
Signs of friction between Intel and Compaq emerged this month when the
usually imperturbable Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief
executive, lashed out at Intel at an industry forum in Barcelona. He accused
Intel of undermining Compaq's marketing efforts and of not giving his
company due consideration as the biggest seller of PCs in the US and Europe.
The issues cited by Mr Pfeiffer - clashes over Intel's promotion of its own
brand name, chip prices, and direct competition from Intel's growing PC and
circuit board manufacturing operations - are the symptoms of a souring
relationship, according to industry observers.
'In private, the executives have barely been able to contain their anger for
months,' says Mr Michael Slater, an industry consultant and newsletter
publisher. 'The only thing that is surprising is that this has come out in
public.'
Behind Mr Pfeiffer's outburst lies Compaq's growing frustration over Intel's
efforts to orchestrate an acceleration in the pace at which technology
advances in the PC industry. Intel appears to be treating the industry
merely as its distribution arm, seeing the PC user as its ultimate customer.
Hence the worldwide advertising campaign.
Intel is pushing Pentium not only to maximise its already strong profit
margins, but to outpace mounting competition threatening to eat into its
roughly 90 per cent share of world microprocessor sales.
Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's Silicon Valley neighbour and bitter rival
after almost a decade of legal disputes, is biting at the market leader's
heels with its versions of Intel's previous-generation 486 microprocessors.
It will launch a Pentium look-alike, or clone, chip at the end of the year.
Compaq's latest machines, for the consumer market, use AMD microprocessors.
Last week, Nexgen, a privately held chip developer in which Compaq has a
minority stake, launched a family of 'Pentium class' chips - microprocessors
claimed to be as powerful and flexible as Intel's. Nexgen and Cyrix, another
smaller chip company, have also contracted with International Business
Machines to manufacture microprocessor clones, making them credible Intel
challengers.
Collectively, these companies could achieve a 20 per cent or higher share of
the PC microprocessor market over time, Mr Slater predicts. 'In a worst case
scenario, Intel faces a gradually declining market and possibly rapidly
declining profit margins as competitors force down prices,' he says.
Rather than give ground, Mr Andrew Grove, Intel's combative chief executive,
has declared the chip maker will 'eat its own children' or deliberately
cannibalise the market for its established products with new, more powerful
chips.
For Compaq, however, Intel's determination to maintain market leadership
presents serious problems. In its own drive to increase market share, Compaq
built up huge inventories of PCs, worth Dollars 2.2bn at the end of the
second quarter, double that of a year earlier. The PC maker says the stocks
will enable it to meet expanding demand and increase market share.
But much of Compaq's inventory comprises lower performance PCs, rather than
the Pentium models Intel is promoting. Last week, Compaq launched its own
'aggressive new worldwide consumer marketing blitz' for new consumer PC
models based on older microprocessors.
Compaq's new consumer models have multimedia capabilities and can double as
a television set or telephone answering system. They will sell in the US for
about Dollars 2,100 including a large colour monitor. For a similar price, a
buyer could get a Pentium-based PC, with fewer bells and whistles, from a
less well known manufacturer. Pentium multimedia PCs usually cost about
Dollars 400-Dollars 500 more.
Intel's efforts to point consumers towards more powerful Pentium machines
include in-store demonstrations showing a Pentium PC racing through tasks
while older 486SX-based machines lag behind.
'The 486-based PC is not the machine you should be buying,' says Hans Geyer,
head of Intel's European operations. 'Any company that has a huge inventory
of one kind of product when the market prefers another is in a dangerous
position.'
Compaq is not amused. From the company's perspective Intel seems to have
forgotten the rule that the customer is always right. In fact, it seems,
Intel is saying loud and clear that its biggest customer is wrong.
'What upsets us generally is that a component supplier should try to
influence the end user. The end-user market is not their business. They are
interfering,' says Andreas Barth, one of Mr Pfeiffer's closest colleagues
and head of Compaq's European operations.
Compaq must also be galled that Intel, along with Microsoft, the PC software
leader, earns most of the profits made in the PC industry - its 1993 gross
margins of 63 per cent were significantly ahead of Compaq, the most
profitable PC manufacturer, which managed 23.6 per cent.
It is an illusion, argues Mr Barth, to suggest the whole PC market is
shifting to Pentium. Less than 12 per cent of PC sales in US consumer
electronics stores are Pentium PCs, says market researcher Consumer
Intelligence Infocorp.
However, Intel's argument that a powerful Pentium processor is necessary to
take full advantage of multimedia PC applications is increasingly credible.
The latest PC games, incorporating sophisticated video and graphics, run at
a snail's pace on older microprocessors.
Moreover, what Compaq sees as interference, smaller PC makers regard as free
advertising likely to boost demand for their products. Several plan to ride
on the coattails of Intel's campaign with their own product campaigns.
Yet Compaq is not alone in rueing Intel's power to shift the PC market
rapidly from one generation of microprocessors to the next. The dizzying
pace of change is also upsetting some buyers concerned about the rapid
obsolescence of the products they purchase. 'Customers are telling us to
slow down the pace of technology,' Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, said earlier
this year. 'How powerful a computer do you really need on your desk?'
For now, however, Intel is in the driving seat. While it is promoting the
Pentium chip for this Christmas, it plans to launch a yet more powerful
microprocessor, codenamed P6, next year and is already working on later
generations of chips. 'Intel has made a conscious decision that it is more
important to try to make the overall PC market grow as quickly as possible
than to protect the interests of its big customers,' says Mr Slater.
The computer industry is following the dispute with fascinated dread.
Alliances and co-operative ventures have become the order of the day as
electronic technology becomes too complex for any one company. If giants
like Intel and Compaq cannot co-ordinate strategies to their mutual
advantage, can others do better?

FT  20 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Sweden's road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After victory comes the battle. The Swedish Social Democrats' return to
power in Sunday's election leaves their leader, Ingvar Carlsson, with three
campaigns still to fight. On past experience, he is well-equipped to wage
the two, more immediate, battles. But he has yet to show that he can take on
the country's deepest challenge: reform of the Swedish welfare state.
Mr Carlsson's first task will be convincing the world's financial markets
that he will reverse the country's spiral into debt. There are plenty of
reasons for scepticism. His party's electoral campaign was noticeably short
on talk of fiscal austerity. Clearly, there must be a larger package of
deficit cuts from the new government than the meagre SKr61bn (Pounds 5.1bn)
one announced in August.
A more credible fiscal plan would involve public spending cuts, not the tax
rises which the party finds it easier to suggest. But the Social Democrats'
close ties with the public sector might help them to persuade affected
groups that the cuts are inescapable. The outgoing centre-right government
could not play this difficult role, as the results of the campaign suggest.
Mr Carlsson may owe his victory to Mr Carl Bildt's willingness to push
through several unpopular, but necessary, reforms as prime minister. Mr
Bildt, however, frequently tried to sell these policies as the medicine
required by membership of the European Union. This may prove damaging to the
new government in battle number two: November's referendum to confirm
Sweden's membership of the EU.
Although the Social Democrats' have committed themselves to Europe, many of
their supporters have not. Thanks, in part, to Mr Bildt's sales tactics, the
latter view Europe only in a negative light. The new prime minister must
continue his efforts to show that Sweden has a better chance of tackling
problems like its 14 per cent unemployment rate within Europe than without
it.
Sweden must recognise its kinship with the other countries of Western
Europe, but its third and largest challenge is also to see the parallels
between its own predicament and those of countries further east. As Poland
and others have learnt, it is painful to reform a system which guarantees
security but fails to provide long-term economic growth. Sweden's pain is
bound to increase further, if its government and people continue to hope
that short-term expedients will be enough.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Feelgood factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why don't consumers feel happier about the economic recovery? Mr John Major
says they should, and so do most of the economic statistics; but Gallup
shows them clinging resolutely to gloom.
A clue to this conundrum came yesterday from a leading feelgood factory,
Grand Metropolitan's IDV drinks business. Instead of uncorking expansion,
IDV's announcement reads like recession's hangover: plant rationalisation,
office closures, regional restructuring.
Another clue is the way companies find it hard to raise prices, despite
economic recovery. Fiercer global competition lets consumers shop around.
Companies grown fat on regional dominance find themselves seventh in a
global market where only the big three thrive. To compete, ever-lower costs
are essential.
This remorseless logic has undermined the drinks industry's dash for margin,
the trend of the late 1980s. For a while, drinkers were happy to pay more
for sipping less; but as Guinness has found, that only works while the glow
of economic euphoria lasts.
This is the real message in IDV's bottle. Big companies, in English-speaking
countries at least, are in a Maoist state of permanent revolution. GrandMet
preceded the IDV restructuring with a similar effort in its US food
business. Few large companies are not wielding the axe somewhere in their
divisions. So, even though employment is rising, people who already have
jobs feel threatened by uncertainty.
That is a deeply unsettling sentiment. Much of economic history reflects the
desire to defeat, avoid or pass on to someone else the inevitable
uncertainty of human existence. The craving is a visceral one; its
consequences range from trivial to profound, from the folding umbrella to
the Common Agricultural Policy. It is frustrating when this sentiment
hampers manifest improvements in human welfare, such as wider free trade.
But politicians and business people ignore it at their peril.
The lesson, for politicians, is that people really feel good only when they
possess greater economic certainty - something to be earned the hard way, by
long-term policies which promote stability. Business people have little
choice but to live with uncertainty; but they might minimise its impact on
stakeholders by speedy decisions, frankly communicated. After all, the truth
works in good times as well as bad: a bit less feelgood factor wouldn't have
done any harm in the late 1980s.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Agenda for Euro-reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Across a wide range of fields, the European Union is failing to win support
from its citizens for measures carried out in their name and, ostensibly,
for their benefit. Its decision-making bodies appear unwieldy, undemocratic
and ineffective. Steps to correct this should be high on the agenda of the
inter-governmental conference (IGC) which is to meet in 1996 to consider
revision of the Maastricht treaty.
That conference will also have to adjust the Union's institutions in the
light of two years' experience with an enlarged membership (including
Austria and up to three Nordic states) and in the perspective of further
enlargement to central and eastern Europe. It will, in addition, have to
take some account of Germany's desire for further advances towards political
union as a condition for economic and monetary union.
In considering reform, governments will need to separate areas where
agreement is possible, and indeed indispensable, in 1996 from those where
disagreement will remain for far longer. Some of the federalist proposals in
the German Christian Democrats' recent discussion paper fall in the latter
category. For instance, it is hard, if not impossible, to see how the
proposal that the Commission should 'take on features of a European
government' can be reconciled with the desire of several national
governments (not only the British) to exercise more control over the
Commission, through the Council of Ministers.
One area where it is vital to agree on change is the size and composition of
the Commission. Under present arrangements it will increase next year to 21
members, including at least one from every member state. There will not be
enough portfolios to go round, plenary meetings will be hard to manage, and
not all Commissioners will be of the calibre needed. The IGC will have to
come up with a more meritocratic system, in which larger states forgo their
automatic right to have two Commissioners each, and smaller ones agree to be
represented in groups, or by rotation.
If the Council, for the foreseeable future, is to remain the main locus of
EU legislative power, changes in decision-making mechanisms will be vital to
allow more majority voting, with a lower threshold for the so-called
'qualified majority', and voting weights that more accurately reflect the
differing size of member states. The Council's legislative sessions must
also be made fully public, and its work made more accountable, notably by
better scrutiny in national parliaments.
As for the European parliament, 1996 will probably not be the time to decide
a further expansion in powers already considerably extended under
Maastricht. The parliament must first demonstrate that, in spite of its
disparate composition since last June's elections, it can sensibly deploy
the 'co-decision' muscle it now shares with the Council.
MEPs can help the electorate understand how the EU works, and what purpose
they themselves serve, if they take a constructive rather than utopian or
self-aggrandising lead in the debate on institutional reform. They could
draft a European Basic Law - simpler and more modest than their
predecessors' efforts at constitution-writing - which would relegate to
essentially technical annexes much of the impenetrable language of the
Maastricht treaty, and provide in its main text a clear account of the
Union's structure, the competences of the various organs, and, perhaps most
important, the division between the powers of individual member states and
those of the EU.
This draft could then be used as the basis for public debate throughout the
Union, in which national governments would have to take a position. That way
the citizens of the EU would be less likely to feel in 1996, as so many did
at the time of Maastricht, that everything was being done behind their
backs.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Observer: Cuba novella
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another sign that the Havana-Washington hurricane is metamorphosing into
something a little less threatening - Cuba is posthumously rehabilitating
Ernest Hemingway.
The Nobel laureate was thrown out in the early, heady days of the 1959
revolution, an act which some think contributed to his later suicide.
Not that he was ever utterly persona non grata. His love of fishing has been
locally commemorated by the use of his name for an annual international game
fishing tournament.
Many weighty blue marlin have been hooked, hung and photographed in honour
of Papa Hemingway.
But now his old home, 11 miles south of Havana, is being transformed into a
small museum, where visitors will be able to see such oddities as an aged,
well-preserved typewriter on a stand - Hemingway often wrote standing up.
Another, smaller museum is being created out of the writer's room at the
Ambos Mundo Hotel.
Maybe Fidel Castro has even discovered the pertinence of one of Hemingway's
tales: The Old Man and the Sea.

How the mighty have become confusing. Bill Rodgers shouldn't really be
astonished that he's emerged as the bete noire of Liberal Democrat activists
currently putting the world to rights at Brighton. After all, he's been as
outspoken as any among the old SDP Gang of Four in singing the praises of
the new Labour leader Tony Blair.
But surely the conference bookshop has gone too far. The newly ennobled Lord
Rodgers' political autobiography, Politics of Change, is placed on a shelf
clearly marked for his party's political opponents.

So Ramon Pajares has finally succumbed to the blandishments of Rocco Forte

As much the preferred candidate of both the Savoy and Forte, he was no doubt
under considerable pressure to accept - perhaps even from his nearest and
dearest. For his daughter, Maria, as PR manager of Claridge's, must surely
have been a trifle parti pris.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Kwasniewski, who last year led Poland's reformed communists back
to power in coalition with the Peasants' party, is not normally backwards in
coming forward. But, mention his possible candidacy for next year's
presidential election, and he comes over all shy.
Lech Walesa, the current incumbent, is deeply unpopular, while Kwasniewski
tops the opinion polls. The latter's main worry, however, seems to be that,
if he stands, Walesa could wage the sort of bare-knuckle anti-communist
campaign that secured him victory in 1990.
In London yesterday, Kwasniewski thus confined himself to saying that Poland
needs a president who spends more time on pushing Poland's entry into the
European Union and Nato, and less on domestic political infighting.
No-one's fooled. That's code for 'I'm your man'. Being president has to be
better than trying to control a fractious coalition, or forging a new
constitution out of the seven competing drafts now on the table - two of the
wearisome tasks on Kwasniewski's plate.

Has Grand Metropolitan sold itself short in off-loading Alpo to Nestle for a
mere Dollars 510m? The Swiss company should appreciate, after all, that it
has acquired something far more prestigious than simply America's seventh
largest pet food business.
Why, the Alpo name is a veritable institution across the country after those
long-running dog food ads of yesteryear featuring Johnny Carson side-kick Ed
McMahon. Indeed, considering the number of people popularly supposed to have
been conceived during the commercial breaks of the Tonight Show, Nestle
could be considered to be buying directly into the country's gene pool.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Observer: Pea-soup pop art
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stick around long enough and you'll become part of the furniture. Back in
1962 Campbell Soup, the US food group, reacted nervously to the late Andy
Warhol's screen prints featuring the company's red-and-white soup cans. 'We
didn't know what to make of it. We thought someone was making fun of us,'
says Kevin Lowery, Campbell's public affairs chief.
That was probably exactly what was happening, but, boy, did it do wonders
for brand recognition. So 30-plus years on, Campbell is searching out the
next Andy Warhol. Hence an 'Art of Soup' contest in which artists are
invited to re-interpret the Campbell soup can.
Budding Warhols may work in any medium, including sculpture, video and
'wearables'. Professionals, amateurs and children of 12 and under will be
judged separately, and there will be prizes of up to Dollars 10,000 for
some.
So is this art or just an artful PR stunt? Who cares, so long as it's
(internationally) famous for 15 minutes.

FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong drugs sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drug shares rebounded yesterday and recovered much of the loss being caused
by the big hit the sector took in Friday's volatile market.
Bid speculation stocks Zeneca and Wellcome made up the most ground and,
following the pattern of recent trading, again moved in line with each
other. Wellcome jumped 28 to 685p with some market watchers noting a
shortage of the stock. Volume was moderate at 1.8m. Zeneca pushed ahead 23
to 833p. Speculative buying along with corrective action after Friday's fall
was said to have been behind the moves as bid anticipation rumbled on.
Glaxo, which went ex-dividend yesterday, fell back 12 to 572p although after
a dividend of 18p its share price effectively improved by 6p. SmithKline
Beecham continued to enjoy steady support and its price firmed 4 to 430p.
According to one analyst sentiment in the pharmaceuticals sector was further
buoyed by an upbeat KPMG Peat Marwick report into acquisitions and mergers
in the healthcare industry.
James Capel, one of the City's leading agency brokers, was cited as the
driving force behind the good showing of Cable &amp; Wireless, which moved up 4
1/2 to 405 1/2 p on high turnover of 5.3m shares.
Vodafone, on the other hand, continued to disappoint, the shares sliding 3
more to 183 1/2 p with 5.1m traded. Vodafone shares have fallen over 12 per
cent since the end of August, compared with a 5 per cent decline in the
FT-SE 100 and a 7.3 per cent decline in the FT-SE Actuaries telecoms index.
Hints in the market that Arjo Wiggins, the paper group, may be considering a
Pounds 500m-plus rights issue to finance a Dollars 1.5 bn US acquisition was
put forward by traders as the reason behind the marked weakness of Arjo
shares which retreated around 8 to 258p after turnover of 2m shares.
There were plenty of good performers in the utilities sectors, notably the
Recs where East Midlands came in for strong support, closing 16 higher at
737p and London Electricity 12 higher at 700p, the latter after talk of
heavy demand from Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank.
A NatWest Securities buy recommendation triggered good support for Southern
Water, which moved up 10 to 583p.
MAI, the financial services and media group, came under fire in the
stockmarket after releasing mildly disappointing preliminary results. The
shares dropped 13 to 255 1/2 p.
The banks were in the forefront of the market's mid-session rally but
turnover in the sector was well down on recent levels. 'The market got
itself short of these things, and that was it; there was no weight of
buying, simply a mark-up,' said one dealer.
Royal Bank of Scotland was the sector's outstanding performer, the shares
climbing 9 to 417p after talk that Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Royal
Bank's hugely successful Direct Line insurance company had met with banking
analysts at Credit Lyonnais Laing, Royal Bank's broker.
ICI had a buoyant day and pushed up 9 to 842p.
Activity was strong in Coats Viyella with 3.4m shares changing hands. The
price improved 6 to 208p as one analyst said that buyers were returning to
the stock after its relatively weak performance recently.
Peel Holdings was the one noticeable mover among property shares, rising 4
to 261p on hopes that its plans for a big shopping development in Manchester
may finally get the go-ahead next year.
Further consideration of the trans-Atlantic fare wars sparked last weement k
by Continental Airlines of the US, led to a 2 1/2 decline (for 9 in two
sessions) to 380p at British Airways.
Eurotunnel gained 5 to 279p on the announcement that its overture Shuttle
service would finally start on or around November 15.
After a bounce last week Carlton Communications slipped back 4 to 850p after
a very mixed trading day in the media sector. A combination of profit-taking
and reaction to recent presentations by the company to analysts was put
behind the fall.
Recouping half of Friday's losses, British Aerospace rose 6 to 479p ahead of
tomorrow's announcement of interim results. Traders are looking for a strong
profits recovery, possibly to Pounds 75m pre-tax after Pounds 20m last time.
British Steel was again in demand, moving up 3 1/2 to 156 1/2 p on the back
of autumn price rises ranging from 3 to 7 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco attracts buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JEFFREY BROWN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supermarkets group Tesco was among the FT-SE 100's best individual
performers and the heaviest traded stock in the index as the market became
increasingly optimistic about sales and a stabilisation of profit margins
ahead of interim figures which are expected this morning. Tesco's numbers
mark the opening of the food retailing sector's results season.
Analysts' forecasts of Tesco's half-year profits range from around Pounds
240m to Pounds 252m with the interim expected to rise by 10 per cent to
2.7p.
Sentiment in Tesco, and the food retailing sector as a whole was helped by a
positive research circular published by NatWest Securities who upgraded
their profits estimates for Tesco, Argyll, Morrison and Sainsbury. The
broker upgraded its stance on the sector to neutral after increasing its
1995 earnings growth forecasts from 4 per cent to 10 per cent, matched by
dividend growth, citing gross margin recovery at mainstream superstores and
a transfer of margin pressures to discount stores.
NatWest restored its 'add' recommendation to Tesco, whose shares touched
256p, their highest level since March 1993 before slipping back to close a
net 2 1/2 higher at 251p. Turnover reached 10m shares.
Argyll put on 6 to 290p and Sainsbury settled a penny off at 439p.
Kwik-Save, the discount retailer, dipped 3 to 604p after Dairy Farm
International, which holds a 29.4 per cent stake, said it had no present
intention of bidding for the group. A standstill agreement, preventing Dairy
Farm from increasing its 29.9 per cent stake, has been allowed to lapse.
Asda holds its agm tomorrow, while William Morrison reports interims on
Thursday. Sainsbury's interims are scheduled for November 2, Kwik-Save's on
november 3 and Argyll's on November 30. Asda reports interims on December
16.

FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Little strength behind nervous rally
in shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securities markets in London rallied yesterday but trading volume was
subdued and concern over the outlook for interest rates in the US and
Germany remained high. Gains were trimmed towards the close when UK bonds
reacted to sterling weakness in the face of a strong US currency.
The FT-SE 100 Index continued to move between two important trading
benchmarks, dipping to 3,048.3 in early dealings and then rising to 3,085.3
at the day's best. The final reading of 3,079.1 showed a net gain on the day
of 14 points. The December contract on the Footsie, now the lead player in
stock index futures, regained a premium against the underlying cash market.
Analysts saw little change in market sentiment yesterday. The focus remained
very much on the US interest rate outlook, with investors showing
nervousness ahead of a speech from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve and of the possibility of a move on rates at the meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee next week. The next rise in US interest
rates was seen as a matter of timing.
Although shares opened lower, it was clear that Friday afternoon's selling
bout had blown itself out, at least for the present. The long end of the
gilt-edged market, which reflects inflation worries, improved, but falls in
the short dates, more closely linked to base rate prospects, indicated
underlying fears.
With turnover relatively poor, it was the blue chip, dollar-orientated,
stocks which saw most of the recovery. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a
wide range of shares, slipped 8.1 to 3,608.
Seaq volume totalled only 469.1m shares, down more than 17 per cent from
Friday when, despite the shakeout in share prices, retail, or genuine
investment activity in equities was worth only Pounds 1.2bn, a modest total
by recent daily averages.
London was keeping a wary eye on the trading screens for the announcement of
the latest M3 money supply data due this week from Germany. 'A further
tightening in Federal Reserve policy has probably been priced into the
market; but any sign of tightening by the Bundesbank will send markets
plunging,' said one leading analyst.
This week also brings hurdles for the stock market in the shape of the UK M4
lending figures and non-EU trade statistics. At the end of the week, markets
will be poised for the US August durable goods orders, which fell sharply in
the previous month but are expected to show a renewed surge and thus fuel
fears that the Federal Reserve may feel obliged to tighten policy more
quickly than markets anticipate. On Friday, the latest estimates of UK gross
domestic product will also throw light on the progress of economic recovery
in the UK.
The London stock market paid little heed yesterday to comments from Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that he would continue
to adjust interest rates so as to sustain recovery. A rise in mortgage rates
by the Halifax building society, while no surprise in view of last week's
rise in base rates and similar moves by other building societies, kept the
market focus on the near term outlook for domestic interest rates.
Gains in leading oil and pharmaceutical stocks gave a good lead to the
Footsie index, but owed some of their strength to the dollar rather than to
investment activity in the London stock market. Retail and consumer issues
had a more uncertain session, with some struggling to recoup a little of
Friday's losses while others gave further ground.
Construction issues, also closely linked to interest rate perceptions,
traded narrowly with losses among those with interests in the German
economy. But traders stressed that much of yesterday's activity reflected
little more than a tidying-up operation in the wake of Friday's widespread
shakeout.

FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a volatile day in thin trading volume, occasionally
making attempts to drive the cash markets but in the main showing little
initiative.
The day's trading range on the FT-SE December contract was close to 50 ticks
with the market touching a low of 3,054 late in the morning and hitting a
best of 3,101 about an hour before the 4.10pm close.
At the finish the index stood at 3,081 with the premium to the cash market a
bare 2 points and the fair value premium - bolstered by the long run of the
new contract - extending to 19 points.
Business was noticeably weak and described by one trader as 'well below
average'. There were 10,848 lots compared to an average of 21,000 for the
final three days of last week. Institutional players stayed on the sidelines
with activity almost exclusively accounted for by independent traders.
Activity in traded options was was also well down on the preceeding session
with 22,605 contracts, against more than 51,000 on Friday.
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE options accounts for more than half of overall
activity. Kingfisher (1,434 lots) and BTR (1,076 lots) were the most
actively traded individual stock options.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges ahead in mixed
trading
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices finished at mixed levels yesterday after solid gains struck
earlier in the session eroded in uncertain trading, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.37 ahead at 3,936.72,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.34 at 470.85.
Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 272m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 1.27 at 461.13,
but the Nasdaq composite was down 1.19 at 776.72.
A dearth of fresh economic news allowed equity investors to put aside its
concerns over the pace of economic growth and concentrate on a few
favourable developments for key individual stocks.
The bond market was marginally supportive in that it managed to steady
itself after Friday's rout. Prices on the inflation-sensitive long end edged
higher but the advance lacked conviction. The market's overall tone remained
negative in view of last week's stronger-than-expected readings on
industrial production and capacity utilisation.
In equity trading, many stocks were showing surprising buoyancy during a
morning when only slim gains had been expected. But the lack of clear
direction eventually caught up with most stocks. By the end, declining
issues on the NYSE were leading advances by a four-to-three margin.
Coca-Cola was one of the companies fuelling the blue chip index's advance.
The stocks climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 on the company's
announcement that its third-quarter sales volume would exceed analysts'
projections, though its net income was expected to approximate earlier
forecasts.
Exxon gained Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 after a jury ordered the energy
group to pay Dollars 5bn as punishment for its responsibility for the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill. The award, which had been announced late on Friday,
was not large enough to damage the company's long-term performance, analysts
said.
The court decision prompted Bear Stearns to lift its rating on Exxon. But
the securities house downgraded Atlantic Richfield, and its share price
back-tracked Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 101 1/2 as a result. Elsewhere,
Time-Warner was marked up Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 38 on a published report
which raised the possibility of the media group's merger with General
Electric. GE, which later denied such a move was under consideration,
slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 .
The NYSE's most active list was led by Digital Equipment. The stock jumped
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 26 1/8 after Cowen&amp;Company issued a 'strong buy'
recommendation, citing confidence that the computer company would soon
return to profitability.
Canada
Gains by gold stocks on the Toronto mGg Gg arket - as well as
utilities,paper and forestry shares - helped push the TSE-300 index higher
in moderate trading.
It rose 32.11 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 4,435.96, with gaining issues
outnumbering losing issues 397 to 361. Volume of 60.77m and value of
CDollars 919m from Friday's 70.91m shares and CDollars 1.1bn. The gold index
was up 3.3 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.2% as
Hong Kong finishes lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last minute selling by companies looking to boost profits depressed the
Nikkei index, which fell 1.2 per cent, its third consecutive decline, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index lost 242.15 to 19,554.11, having opened at a high of
19,794.36 and falling to a low of 19,543.41 just before the close. Arbitrage
selling also weighed on prices while broad based corporate selling increased
the bearishness.
Fears of over-supply lingered in spite of weekend reports that Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries was likely to postpone its large-lot convertible bond issue
scheduled for next month.
Worries over the yen's further appreciation also prevailed and many
investors fear that a breakdown of the bilateral trade talks between the US
and Japan could create renewed turmoil on the currency markets.
Volume remained almost flat at 258m shares against 250m. The Topix index of
all first section stocks declined 14.53 to 1,561.68 and the Nikkei 300 lost
2.68 to 285.27. Declines led advances by 787 to 194, with 181 issues
remaining unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index index rose 1.05 to 1,275.44.
Toyota Motor, the day's most active issue, fell Y50 to Y1,960 on
profit-taking by corporate investors and foreigners. Some electronics stocks
were also sold on profit taking by companies - Oki Electric lost Y15 to Y750
while Toshiba declined Y7 to Y737.
Seiyu, the supermarket chain, fell Y40 to Y1,350. Investors were discouraged
by reports that the retailer's pre-tax profits were likely to decline by 59
per cent to Y3.1bn for the first six months to September.
All sectors declined except for pharmaceutical companies. Takeda Chemical
added Y20 to Y1,220 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical rose Y10 to Y1,930.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y6 to Y749 on reports of its likely delay
in its convertible bond flotation. However, traders said that Matsushita
Electric Industrial was still likely to issue some Y20bn in CBs next month.
Speculators bought Hanwa, the steel trader, which gained Y16 to Y450.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 185.04 to 21,815.53 in volume of 66m shares.
Nintendo, the video game company, fell Y310 to Y5,910.
Roundup
The region's markets saw a mostly depressed performance. Seoul and Taipei
were closed for public holidays.
HONG KONG finished 1.7 per cent lower on a round of late selling but trading
was very quiet ahead of tomorrow's mid-autumn holiday. The Hang Seng Index
fell 167.09 to 9,801.43 after hovering near 9,850 for most of the day, amid
worries of further falls on Wall Street. Turnover was HKDollars 3.0bn
against HKDollars 4.1bn on Friday.
HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 89 and Hongkong Telecom eased
35 cents to HKDollars 15.65.
Jardine Matheson closed HKDollars 2.50 lower at HKDollars 72 before
announcing a 24.2 per cent jump on its interim profit, shortly after the
market closed.
Other shares of the Jardine group also fell, mainly on news of an imminent
delisting from the Hong Kong market. Hongkong Land slipped 90 cents to
HKDollars 19.85, Dairy Farm eased 35 to HKDollars 11.30 and Mandarin
Oriental fell 50 to HKDollars 10.70.
The H share index of mainland China stocks eased 43.34 or 2.9 per cent to
1,444.94.
MANILA was weighed by profit-taking that left the composite index 6.17 lower
at 2,936.21. Volume dropped to 2.4bn shares from 3.24bn.
Megaworld Properties and Holdings was the top gainer, climbing 11 per cent
to 12.75 pesos ahead of the announcement of a huge low-cost housing project
that is expected to further strengthen earnings.
The newly-listed Mondragon International Philippines fell 4.4 per cent to
6.50 pesos on profit-taking.
SINGAPORE was worried about inflation and the future direction of US
interest rates and the Straits Times Industrials index fell 25.33 or 1.1 per
cent to 2,271.85.
SHANGHAI's A share index fell 5.4 per cent at the close, mainly on news that
the stock exchange authorities will crack down on brokerages which fail to
settle their transactions, three times a month.
The A index fell 55.22 points to 959.24, dropping below the key support
level of 1,000 points on shrinking turnover of Yn3.8bn.
Brokerages on the exchange are said to have run up Yn500m in deficits since
August 1 when the market began surging.
Shanghai's B share index edged up on a technical rebound after losses in the
past three trading days. The index gained 0.61 to 82.94.
KUALA LUMPUR saw foreign selling of blue chip stocks which dragged the
composite index 4.61 lower to 1,180.66, ending a four-day rising streak.
North Borneo Timber surged MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 14.40 before its
suspension at mid-morning amid speculation that a Sabah state timber
concession will be injected into it.
SYDNEY was lower in listless trading, following on from Friday's fall on
Wall Street, but buying support for some industrial and oil and gas stocks
restricted the decline.
The All Ordinaries Index closed 9.9 lower at 2,049.1.
WELLINGTON staged a comeback though the day to wipe out most of its early
losses and the NZSE-40 capital index closed 6.20 lower at 2,105.67, after an
intraday low of 2,083.66.
The leaders were mixed, with most interest in Fletcher, which finished up 1
cent at NZDollars 4.42.
BOMBAY dipped in response to hectic profit booking, in both specified and
cash group shares, by financial institutions. The BSE 30 share index fell
63.82 or 1.4 per cent to 4,553.79. KARACHI was clouded by uncertainty about
a general strike called by the opposition for today and the KSE 100-share
index fell 12.01 to 2,204.61.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Sharp losses in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Johannesburg closed with heavier than expected losses as the
firmer financial rand, consolidating gold price and nervousness over world
markets discouraged buyers, Reuter reports.
Dealers said disillusionment over the gold price was creeping in and,
although the undertone was bullish, gold and mining related share prices
would continue to drift downwards on profit-taking.
The overall index lost 67 to 5,764, the industrial index shed 66 to 6,454
and the gold index was 49 down at 2,356. De Beers was off R3.25 at R105.25
while Anglos shed R5 to R238.
Elsewhere Gold Fields fell R3 to R125 and Minorco shed R1.70 to R11.55.
Lonrho went against the trend to add 10 cents to R9.30.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Markets in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a further spate of turbulence among the European markets on Friday
as Wall Street reversed the strong gains seen the day before. But even in a
week of generally negative news one or two of the world's equity markets
managed a climb into positive territory. Italy's near 4 per cent rise, for
instance, assisted by expectations of good news from the forthcoming half
year results season, restricted the European component of the FT-Actuaries
World indices to a 1.7 per cent fall on the week, still 2 per cent up in
dollar terms since the start of the year.
Tomorrow sees the release of the French budget, while Denmark goes to the
polls on the same day, two events which are likely to affect the financial
markets. According to Bikuben Securities the parliamentary elections in both
Sweden and Finland are likely to have only limited, short-term effects on
the markets. Of greater importance will be the EU referendums, they say,
while on the longer outlook they expect a more positive tone to prevail.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hochtief, Holzmann draw
interest in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The continental bourses went their own diverse ways yesterday for no
apparent reason.
FRANKFURT retreated a further 1 per cent but turnover was low. The Dax index
fell 21.97 during the official session to 2,096.76, recovering slightly in
the post-bourse to 2,100.55.
Turnover was DM5.5bn.
Some brokers have become cautious on Germany as the shadow of the federal
election on October 16 has begun to be cast over the country's financial
markets. Merck Finck remarked that since December 1993 the Dax had moved in
a range between 2,000 and 2,270, while during that same period volatility
had risen. It expected this sideways trend to continue ahead of next month's
polling.
BNP analysts were more positive on a six month view, having upgraded
weightings in cyclical and financial shares, underweighting
domestically-orientated companies, and observing that the market remained
attractive on an earnings yield basis. BNP had a target of 2,660 for the Dax
by the end of next year.
The main news was an announcement in the contruction sector that Hochtief
intended to raise its 20 per cent stake in Holzmann to 30 per cent. The
former's shares put on DM4 to DM1,030, while the latter rose DM19 to DM882.
Hochtief said that it would purchase the stake from BfG Bank. Holzmann, the
country's largest construction group, later said that it was willing to
co-operate with Hochtief, but would maintain its independence.
PARIS edged down a notch as investors awaited tomorrow's budget, even though
most of the proposals have already been factored into prices. The CAC-40
index lost 1.72 to 1,922.87.
JP Morgan commented that given the expected neutral stance of the budget
there was unlikely to be a significant effect on sectors. Investors were
instead keeping an eye on the presidential elections, scheduled for May
1995, after which key decisions on reducing the deficit would be made.
ZURICH turned higher with Roche and Nestle leading the way and Wall Street's
morning performance also providing a late fillip. The SMI index rose 11.4 to
2,614.7. Nestle registered rose SFr13 to SFr1,213 in response to Friday's
first half figures and as Goldman Sachs raised its rating to moderate
outperformer from market performer and also increased its earnings estimates
for this year and 1995. Nestle said yesterday that its purchase of Alpo
Petfoods in the US from Grand Metropolitan of the UK was aimed at
complementing its existing product line in pet care in the US.
Roche certificates, SFr110 higher at SFr6,070, found fresh favour with
foreign buyers after their lower trend in recent sessions. Ciba bearers
climbed SFr4 to SFr774 while Sandoz bearers ended SFr6 weaker at SFr678.
Swissair declined SFr5 to SFr850 ahead of the release today of consolidated
first half results, with estimates ranging from a loss of SFr25m to a profit
of SFr30-35m.
AMSTERDAM moderated slightly, the AEX index drifting down 0.49 to 407.09,
after testing the 405 support level. Heineken went against the trend,
improving Fl 2.90 to Fl 241.00. on news that its was to build a new brewery
in China at an initial cost of Dollars 67m.
MILAN picked up in the wake of a strong performance from Fiat as
expectations grew of favourable first half figures. The Comit index dipped
3.96 to 674.53, but the real-time Mibtel index finished 42 higher at 10,826
as Fiat picked up L100 to L6,600. Among other industrial stocks following
Fiat's lead, Montedison edged L7 higher to L1,427 after Friday's 3.2 per
cent advance in the wake of half year figures. Snia added L45 to L2,190
while Pirelli added L65 to L2,565. Olivetti, launching a new company,
Olivetti Telemedia, to focus on activities in telecommunications and
multimedia, dipped L10 lower to L2,035.
STOCKHOLM closed the session lower, but recovered from opening lows on news
that the Social Democrats had not secured a parliamentary majority.
The Affarsvarlden general index closed the day 6.2 lower at 1,443.1, having
earlier fallen by 1 per cent.
Brokers remarked that comments Mr Ingvar Carlsson, prime minister designate,
that he intended an early implementation of proposals to tighten the
budget-making process, helped to calm nerves.
Turnover was SKr2.4bn from Friday's SKr3.7bn.
COPENHAGEN was becalmed ahead of tomorrow's general elections, with dealers
seeing no revival until after the vote is over.
The top-20 KFX index closed just 0.06 higher at 97.16 but turnover fell to a
meagre SKr320m.
ISTANBUL fell 3.8 per cent as political uncertainty was triggered by the
prospects of a parliamentary by-election which could lead to the collapse of
the three year old coalition government. The composite index fell 900.72 to
22,785.09.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Swedish krona up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish krona rebounded from early drops yesterday to consolidate an
overall gain after a general election returned the Social Democratic party
to power on Sunday, writes Motoko Rich.
Against the D-Mark, the Swedish krona finished at SKr4.805, up from
SKr4.828. During the day the Nordic currency dipped as low as Skr4.88 as
markets were disappointed in the SDP's failure to achieve a majority of
parliamentary seats.
The dollar remained range bound but recovered some of its Friday losses on
the back of a spate of short covering in the European afternoon. In London,
it ended up against the D-Mark at DM1.5528 from DM1.5376 though down against
the yen at Y98.7650 from Y98.8550.
Sterling had lost some of its lustre in the aftermath of last week's
interest rate rise, as it lost ground against the dollar and the German
currency. The pound closed in London at DM2.4347 from DM2.4356 and Dollars
1.568 from Dollars 1.584.
The week opened on a quiet note as market-moving economic data were in short
supply and currency traders turned their attention to political and
technical factors. Ballot results from Sweden's general election on Sunday
catapulted the krona into the limelight.
In early trading the krona dipped against the D-Mark as markets were left
uncertain about the prospects for a centre-left coalition, which investors
would prefer.
The markets were cheered after a speech by Mr Ingvar Carlsson,
prime-minister designate and leader of the SDP, in which he said he wanted
to introduce new parliamentary procedures to allow parliament to fix a total
budget ceiling.
Analysts said the markets will be keen to see if Mr Carlsson's government
can control Sweden's budget deficit.
'If the new leadership fails to turn around the deficit, there will be a
sell off of the Swedish krona,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank. 'Right now the currency is in a honeymoon period.'
The markets appeared to continue the Scandinavian
theme as they drove the Finnish markka to its highest level against the
D-Mark this year, at FM3.1775.
This regional focus is likely to continue this week as traders look to the
general election in Denmark tomorrow. Mr MacKinnon said he anticipated the
Danish krone reaching as high as DKr3.85 against the D-Mark. Yesterday in
London it finished at DKr3.938.
Technically driven trade urged the dollar back up against the D-Mark. After
testing the US currency's downside on Friday, the markets took the absence
of any dramatic follow-through as a sign that it was safe to consolidate
positions and raise the dollar on short-covering.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said he expected the
dollar to remain within a five-pfennig range against the D-Mark, between
DM1.5250 and DM1.5750. 'That range should hold until a fundamental catalyst
from outside arrives.'
He said that a catalyst would most likely come from the trade talks between
the US and Japan in advance of the September 30 deadline for sanctions. If
the talks go well, the dollar should benefit.
US officials were optimistic that a Japanese fiscal reform package, expected
this morning, could help to correct the trade imbalance.
Sterling continued to show some independence from the dollar, though to its
detriment. While the US currency enjoyed a rebound, the UK currency trickled
down against the D-Mark and lost its sixteen month high against the dollar.
But Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank, did not think
the pound would remain detached from the dollar for long. 'There may have
been a bit of de-coupling of sterling from the dollar, but I would be
sceptical of saying that it will continue,' he said.
The German currency was looking vulnerable as it wavered on the crosses. It
gave up its gains against the Italian lira and finished at L1010 from L1011.
Against the French franc, it closed at FFr3.416 from FFr3.418.
Mr Cunningham said the markets were retreating from the D-Mark because of a
growing belief that the Bundesbank will soon raise the discount rate by 25
basis points.
A report from the Bundesbank stating that Germany is on course for economic
growth free of inflation spurred further speculation that a spate of
monetary loosening could be in the offing.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecasted a Pounds 500m
shortage and initially provided Pounds 200m assistance at established rates.
Later it provided liquidity of Pounds 300m at established rates. Overnight
money traded betwee 2 1/2 and 5 per cent.
The September short sterling contract, which expires tomorrow, traded 5,800
lots to finish at 94.15 from 94.16. The December Euromark contract traded
40,660 lots and settled at 94.66 from 94.67.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Britain sees catches in EU fish
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain said yesterday that it smelled 'a stinking fish' in European
Commission plans for opening up European Union waters around Ireland to the
Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets in 1996.
Mr Michael Jack, UK fisheries minister, said Britain would call on the
commission at next week's fisheries council in Brussels to rethink proposals
that were 'a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare'.
The government has come under strong pressure from the fishing industry to
oppose the plans, which are designed to share out access among member states
to waters lying west of the UK, France and north-west Spain.
Mr Jack said British fishermen feared the new rules were so complex that the
huge Spanish fleet would be able to flout them with impunity. 'There's a
very real worry that in some way an increase in Spanish fishing effort will
be unleashed on these sensitive waters and there will be no means of
controlling it,' he said.
When they joined the community, Spain and Portugal were barred access to the
so-called Irish Box, which covers the waters immediately surrounding
Ireland. That exclusion ends on December 31 next year, although they will
still not be allowed to fish in the Irish Sea for species subject to quotas.
They will also remain barred from the North Sea.
The commission has tabled two draft regulations covering access to the EU's
'western waters' for all member states and monitoring compliance by
individual vessels with the new rules. It agreed the rules would not cause
member states to lose quota and would entail no increase in fishing.
However, its proposal to allocate countries with a fixed number of fishing
days has run foul of the British government, which says its position is
backed by Ireland and France.
In a letter to 48 members of parliament from fishing constituencies released
yesterday, Mr Jack questioned the way the allocation of days - known as
Standard Vessel Days - had been calculated.
'It is not clear that the allocations of SVDs set out in the proposal would
represent equitable allocations among member states or respect relative
stability (existing quotas),' he said. Britain feared it had not been
allocated enough days to fulfil its quotas, whereas Ireland might have been
granted too many.
He added that the proposals for monitoring compliance were complex and would
impose 'excessive burdens on our fishermen'.
Britain is particularly unhappy that the commission has left it up to member
states to allocate days to individual vessels in their own fleets - a highly
sensitive task - without prescribing how this should be decided.
The council on September 28 is unlikely to decide this issue, which could
drag on into next year. Mr Jack said Britain would present a 'practical and
simple' alternative, but he was unable to give details beforehand.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: St Lucia hit hardest as
tropical storm devastates Windwards' banana crops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The banana industry in the Windward Islands, the main source of British
imports, was devastated by the tropical storm that passed through the
eastern Caribbean ten days ago. Shipping schedules will be disrupted,
according to government and industry officials.
The islands - Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent - will lose
millions of dollars in exports earnings and could also lose some share of
the market because of the damage, the industry officials said. St Lucia, the
largest producer in the group, has been the hit hardest.
'All of our banana, coconut and cattle production has been lost, small
gardens are destroyed and the roads are flooded,' said Mr John Compton, St
Lucia's prime minister. Banana exports provide the island with income of
about USDollars 60m a year, representing just under a half of all its
foreign earnings.
The Windward Islands Crop Insurance Scheme (Wincrop), an agency which
insures the region's agriculture, says it is receiving hundreds of claims
following the storm.
'We are receiving claims now mainly from Dominica, St Lucia and St Vincent,'
said Mr Kerwin Ferreira, Wincrop's manager.
'St Vincent's loss is of a fair level, Dominica's significant, and I would
say St Lucia is very, very, very bad.'
The losses in the Windward Islands will disrupt suppliers to the UK,
according to a St Lucian government official. The loss for the four islands
will not only be in export earnings but also in market share, he said.
There is concern in the Windward Islands that any reduction in shipments
from the region will benefit Latin American exporters, who will fill the
shortfall. Latin American producers had earlier attacked the new European
Union import regime, which allows duty free entry to Caribbean fruit.
'The has come at a very bad time for the Windwards' industry,' said the
official. 'We might not be able to recapture our markets after this. The
only consolation is that if we start replanting now we will have export
fruit ready in a few months.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Settlement eases Canadian wood
strike fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IWA-Canada, representing 15,000 British Columbian coastal area woodworkers,
has reached a settlement with employers that should also set a pattern for
woodworkers in the interior and the pulp and paper mill workers.
The pact, to be ratified by IWA members over the next two weeks, provides
pay increases of 3 per cent, 3 per cent and 2 per cent over three years,
plus signing bonuses of CDollars 1,000 in the first year, CDollars 500 in
the second and up to CDollars 500 in the third. Union members get priority
in hiring for the province's forest renewal programme.
Originally the IWA sought 18 per cent over three years.
Forest Industrial Relations, negotiating for the companies, said the deal
would be costly but the industry was ready to share the benefit of strong
timber markets.
Talks with the interior woodworkers and two different unions representing
the pulp and paper mill workers resume this week and hopes are high that a
strike can be averted.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures touch fresh 8
1/2 -year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures in London briefly burst through their recent 8 1/2 -year high
yesterday morning as continued drought in Brazil and signs of falling
consumer stocks raised fresh concern about supply shortages.
The November contract rose to Dollars 4,089 a tonne, just above the peak of
Dollars 4,085 reached during the trading day following the second severe
frost in Brazil in early July. These levels are the highest the market has
seen since January 1986.
The position held comfortably above Dollars 4,000 for the rest of the day,
closing up Dollars 107 at Dollars 4,039 a tonne.
Mr Robert MacArthur, head of the Tropical Trader Group at Merrill Lynch in
London, said the dry weather had now lasted as long as the serious drought
in the mid-1980s. Coming on top of the two frosts, the persistent dry spell
was adding to fears about the likely shortfall in next year's crop from
Brazil, the world's largest producer.
In addition, Colombia had suffered a smaller harvest this year and would
have to draw down its internal stocks to meet domestic demand, while US
stocks were dwindling.
'The market's done very well in fair volume,' he said. 'It looks as if the
trend is still for higher prices as we move into the winter period.'
London was buoyed by a strong performance by arabica futures in New York to
match that of Friday. In early trading, New York was up nearly 9 cents. By
the afternoon, the December contract was 4.95 cents higher at 226.75 cents a
pound.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders sceptical about cocoa
output curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans by the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) to cut cocoa output by
375,000 tonnes over the next five years look good on paper but will have
little immediate impact on the market, London traders said yesterday,
reports Reuters.
Members of the organisation agreed on Saturday to implement a five-year plan
aimed at cutting 75,000 tonnes a year, beginning in the 1994-95 season, in
an attempt to bolster prices.
'They are good intentions but Indonesia is not part of the agreement. . .
and as a cocoa producer it has the major growth record,' one pointed out.
However, Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, Ivory Coast's commodities minister, told
reporters after the ICCO talks ended in London on Saturday that 'Indonesia
has said it will not take any decision against producers'.
Indonesian observers at the talks said they were monitoring the progress of
the production management plan and, based on that, would eventually decide
whether or not to join the pact.
Indonesia, which is forecast to produce about 250,000 tonnes cocoa during
the 1993-94 season, has registered an average growth rate of 20 per cent a
year over the past five years.
Apart from the question mark over Indonesia, traders said the volume of
stocks available to the market would also offset any attempt to cut supply.
'There are many stocks to get rid of,' said one. 'There has been a lot of
cocoa surplus in the world and producers get impatient for higher prices,'
one said.
If the plan does materialise, 'it will be interesting to see how they
implement it and finance it', commented a London-based analyst.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: More aluminium gains forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium market 'appears determined to move higher', according to
Billiton-Enthoven Metals. And it says in its latest Metals Report that it
'is likely to continue to do so in the final quarter of (this) year and
beyond, providing the drawdown in LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks
continues apace'.
Billiton notes that the aluminium market has been in deficit for several
months, taking stocks held in LME registered warehouses 278,475 tonnes, or
10.5 per cent, below the record level reached in mid-June. A less marked
reduction in producer stocks in member countries of the International
Primary Aluminium Institute has been attributed to seasonal factors, the
report says, 'and further declines are envisaged'.
It points out, however, that the production slow-down following the
multilateral agreement reached earlier this year to curb output has been
'rather disappointing'. In June the operating rate, as reported by the IPAI,
was down only 100 tonnes a day and in July it was unchanged. 'It will be
interesting,' says Billiton, 'to see whether the downtrend is resumed in
August's figures, which are to be announced this week.'
However, the aluminium market is not relying only on lower production for
its present strength, the report notes, 'but also on strengthening demand'.
Although there are signs that the US economic recovery is slowing down the
country's aluminium demand is expected to post a 'very respectable increase'
for 1994. And a continued slowing in US demand next year is expected to be
more than compensated by continued improvements in the European market 'and
even in Japan'.
'Russia has remained a theoretical 'fly in the ointment' in terms of the
tardiness in implementing its pledged production cutbacks (under the
multilateral agreement), amounting to 500,000 tonnes (a year) which were
originally to be completed by the end of July,' says Billiton.
'However, the market appears to be taking this in its stride.'
Aluminium prices edged back at the London Metal Exchange yesterday following
the strong gains of the past few weeks.
Having burst through the Dollars 1,600-a-tonne barrier on Friday the three
months delivery position ran into overhead resistance and what traders
described as 'producer-type selling' after moving up to Dollars 1,615 a
tonne in early trading. It dipped below the Dollars 1,600 mark a couple of
times before closing Dollars 6 down on the day at Dollars 1,602.50 a tonne.
Traders said they were looking for further big falls in LME stocks to
confirm aluminium's 'upside credentials'.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries regain balance after rout on
Friday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY, MARTIN BRICE and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury market regained its balance yesterday after plunging the
previous session on unfavourable economic data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 higher
at 97 1/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.746 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/4 , to yield 6.369 per cent.
There was no fresh economic news to guide sentiment as the trading week
opened. The lull afforded traders the opportunity to regroup after Friday's
rout, which pushed the price of the long bond down by nearly two points and
lifted the yield to its highest level of the year. In yesterday's vacuum,
the 30-year issue appreciated a little in light activity.
The only occasion with the potential to move the market yesterday was an
afternoon speech by Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
He addressed an economic conference at Boston College, but in the event
restricted his comments to the issue of banking reform.
In part, Friday's sell-off reflected an emerging consensus that the central
bank could bring forward its next move to tighter credit conditions. Before
the release of last week's data, most traders were reasonably confident that
Mr Greenspan and his colleagues would wait until after the November
elections before lifting interest rates again.
That calculation was undercut by Friday's news of a 0.7 per cent jump in
industrial production last month, a figure which suggested economic growth
was still robust. Even more unsettling to the inflation-sensitive Treasury
market, capacity utilisation in August had risen to 84.7 per cent, its
highest level in five years. The production bottlenecks which are likely to
arise with factories working at such a pace suggest that prices are on the
rise.
Against this backdrop, traders were eyeing this week's impending Treasury
auctions of two-year and five-year securities as opportunities to unload
more of their holdings. In a small blessing, only a smattering of
second-tier economic releases are due this week, limiting the potential for
another severe downturn.
After Friday's sell-off, most European bond markets clawed back some ground
yesterday as dealers covered their short positions, but prices drifted lower
in the afternoon.
Investors remained mostly sidelined, ceding the stage to the futures
traders.
'Many end-investors are still shell-shocked,' said a bond dealer, adding
'there's very little going on in the cash, but there's quite a lot of fast
trading in the futures market'.
UK gilts opened on a slightly firmer note as prices ticked up from the lows
seen on Friday, when some yields reached 9 per cent. There was no weight
behind the move, however, and the market gave up much of its advance in the
afternoon.
Trading remained thin, with one dealer describing the market as very
illiquid. He said longer-dated stock was tracking overseas markets, while
concern over sterling weakness and the possibility of further UK base rate
rises after last week's 50 basis point increase affected short-dated gilts.
The 9 per cent yields of Friday had prompted some buying interest said
another dealer. However, according to Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS: 'There is
little chance of capital flows into the market while there is this general
pessimism at the short end over interest rates.'
Details of next Wednesday's gilt auction are due today. Some analysts
anticipate that the Bank of England will create a new 10-year benchmark
gilt, with Pounds 2bn of 8 1/2 per cent stock due 2005.
On Liffe, the December long gilt future reached a high of 98 27/32 in the
afternoon before falling to 98 11/32 , a rise of  3/32 on the day. The yield
spread over bunds was around 152 in late trading.
German government bonds ended a listless session slightly firmer. Dealers
were focusing on data releases due later this week. They include August M3
money supply, expected as early as today; August producer price data;
September inflation numbers; and the Bundesbank's announcement of the next
Bund issue, as well as the issuance calendar for the final quarter. Also
looming large are Sunday's state elections in Bavaria, which are seen as an
indicator for the October 16 federal elections.
Swedish bond yields ended about 15 basis points higher following Sunday's
election but off their early highs.
The Social Democrats did not win a parliamentary majority and the poor
performance of the Liberal party dashed hopes for a centre-left coalition.
However, Prime Minister in-waiting Mr Ingvar Carlsson indicated that he
plans to form a minority government relying on centre parties for support on
key economic policies. His stated intention of forming 'an effective
government of co-operation' and the strength of the currency helped lift
bond prices off early lows.
Italian bonds rose about a point on hopes that the government is close to
finalising its 1995 budget package. It met yesterday with trade union
representatives to discuss planned pension reforms and dealers said prices
were boosted by hopes for a near-term agreement.
In Portugal, bond prices rose by more than  1/2 point following the central
bank's 50-basis point cut in its emergency lending rate to 11.50 per cent
and its rate for draining excess liquidity to 8.75 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Indian Airlines uses lease to
finance four aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A desire among Japanese entities to reduce their tax bills by offsetting
capital allowances has allowed Indian Airlines to make a significant saving
on the financing of its fleet.
Rather than the airline taking out a loan to buy four A320-200 aircraft, the
aircraft were bought by a Japanese company which then leased them on to
Indian Airlines. The period of the lease is 10 years, at the end of which
the airline has the option to purchase the aircraft.
An official at ANZ International Merchant Banking, which arranged the
Dollars 170m transaction, said that during the first 10 years it was cheaper
for Indian Airlines to lease the aircraft rather than repay a loan.
Meanwhile, the Japanese entity will be able to take advantage of the
depreciation which goes with the ownership of the aircraft.
The official said the transaction also reflected the renewed confidence
which Japanese companies have in the Indian sub-continent.
The aircraft are due to be delivered in September, October, November and
December and are the final four deliveries of a six A320-200 aircraft
mandate to ANZ in a financing totalling Dollars 206m.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Attention turns to World Bank global
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only two new issues were launched in the eurobond market yesterday following
the sharp falls in government bond prices last week.
The market's attention turned instead to the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn
global offering of five-year fixed rate bonds which is expected to be
launched in the next few days.
'After a terrible week, people are taking time out to consolidate and wait
for the next set of (economic) figures in Europe and the US,' said one
syndicate manager.
General Motors Acceptance Corporation made a rare foray into the eurobond
market, tapping the dollar sector for the first time since June 1993 with a
Dollars 200m offering of three-year eurobonds.
The bonds were priced to yield 47 basis points over US government bonds.
Syndicate managers said pricing was aggressive given the current weakness of
the US bond market, although the spread was maintained when the bonds had
broken syndicate.
The deal was supported by yesterday's better tone in government bond
markets, lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said. Demand came mainly from
retail investors in Switzerland, the Benelux countries, the UK and Germany.
In the Swiss franc sector, Dresdner Finance launched SFr150m of four-year
bonds with a coupon of 5.5 per cent. The deal saw some interest from retail
investors, joint lead manager Dresdner Bank said.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Pension schemes in UK 'set to
cut equities holdings'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pension schemes are likely to reduce their very significant holdings in
equities in coming years, while European pension schemes, typically large
bond investors, are likely to increase theirs, panelists at a pension fund
investment seminar concluded.
The debate about equity investment by UK pension schemes has been heightened
by proposed new minimum solvency rules which actuaries warn will force them
to shift some of their assets into fixed-interest. Also, many large schemes
now have more current and deferred pensioners than they do contributing
members, a condition which actuaries say requires them to switch into bonds
in order to ensure they have sufficient cash flow to meet payments as they
fall due.
Meanwhile, pension investment experts are warning Continental pension
schemes that unless they increase equity investment, corporations will have
to increase pension scheme contributions in order to pay promised benefits.
Speaking at a National Association of Pension Funds conference in London
last Friday, Mr Jean Frijns, board director responsible for investment at
Dutch pension scheme ABP, said that the national peculiarities which have
led European pension schemes to favour bonds heavily are likely to disappear
as markets become internationalised.
'The internationalisation and integration of capital markets challenges
national common wisdom and enables pension funds to operate on larger and
more liquid markets,' he said. The factor of peer group behaviour, which
often discourages European fund managers from increasing their equity
weightings, should become less important as trustees begin to measure each
manager's performance against a wider group.
Meanwhile, Mr Tim Gardener, partner at consulting actuaries William M.
Mercer, predicted that due to new pension scheme rules and an ageing
membership roster, 'UK pension scheme equity rations will converge towards
the European average'. In three years time, he said, the current 85 per cent
average weighting in equities will be 75 per cent and falling. 'I see
perhaps Pounds 40bn going into bonds. Hopefully, the Europeans will be
converging towards us and be buying those equities,' he said.
ABP, the Netherlands' largest pension scheme and a big institutional
investor in the Dutch market, has been fighting to ease government
restrictions on its asset allocation for years. From January 1996 no
restrictions will apply and Mr Frijns said the scheme will seek to increase
its holdings of equities.
In explaining the propensity of European fund managers to invest in bonds,
Mr Frijns cites different attitudes towards risk, differences in the
institutional environment and differences in 'the collective learning
curve'.
The habit of UK actuaries to use a so-called actuarial valuation for
equities, which smoothes fluctuations in market value, added to the comfort
level afforded fund managers investing in them. By contrast, the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany all use market value as the valuation
basis.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Singapore cashes in on
ringgit turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore's money market dealers are reaping the benefits of continuing
fluctuations in exchange rates of neighbouring countries' currencies,
particularly that of the Malaysian dollar, or ringgit.
Dealers say that the daily ringgit trading volume in Singapore, both on the
spot and forward markets, is now regularly more than USDollars 3bn - five
times the level of a year ago.
There has also been a great deal of activity in other south-east Asian
currencies, particularly in the Thai baht and the Indonesian rupiah, mainly
because of interest rate differentials between the two currencies and the US
dollar.
'We estimate that trading in south-east Asian currencies - the so-called
exotics - now accounts for between 15 and 20 per cent of daily money trading
here,' says the head of one foreign bank's dealing operations in Singapore.
'Increasingly, the banks are looking to make good forex profits on the
exotic currencies. Ringgit trading in Singapore has gone through the roof -
on many days it's well ahead of London or Hong Kong.'
The main cause of Singapore's sudden popularity as a ringgit trading centre
was the introduction earlier this year of a series of measures by Bank
Negara, the Malaysian central bank, aimed at curbing the inflow of
speculative funds.
At the end of 1993 Bank Negara bought in large quantities of US dollars to
revalue its reserves and reduce year-end book losses caused by the bank's
own multi-billion dollar speculation on the foreign exchange markets. In
1992 Bank Negara lost MDollars 9bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in foreign exchange
dealings. Forex losses in 1993 were officially put at MDollars 5.7bn.
The consequence of the move was that the ringgit fell sharply - from around
MDollars 2.54 against the US dollar for most of 1993 to nearly MDollars 2.80
at one stage earlier this year. With such wild fluctuations, the world's
speculators saw an opportunity and rushed in to buy the ringgit.
Bank Negara, alarmed at the inflationary impact of large amounts of
speculative funds washing into the country, then introduced its
restrictions, which included imposing a negative interest rate on
foreign-held ringgit accounts and banning sales of short-term money market
paper to foreigners.
Traders and investors wanting to hedge their ringgit investments had to move
operations elsewhere. Singapore, due to its status as a financial centre and
its location adjacent to Malaysia, was the natural choice.
Bank Negara has recently lifted most of its restrictions on the inflow of
funds and after a highly volatile period, the ringgit's value has returned
to around the MDollars 2.55 mark against the US dollar.
But ringgit trading in Singapore has continued to grow. 'It's a kind of
inertia,' says one Singapore money dealer. 'Bank Negara's moves and the big
fluctuations in ringgit values acted as a catalyst for interest in currency
trading in this region - not just in the ringgit, but in the other
currencies as well. Now the traders are here and enjoying it. They are not
going to go away.'
Singapore's growing importance as a ringgit trading centre has not pleased
Malaysia. Forex dealers in Kuala Lumpur say ringgit trading volumes in
Malaysia now average between USDollars 500 and USDollars 1bn per day - well
below levels in Singapore.
The Malaysian monetary authorities have always refused to entertain the idea
of internationalising the country's currency. But Malaysia's own actions
have resulted in the ringgit becoming one of the hottest items in the forex
markets - and enhanced Singapore's position as a money trading centre.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: China urged to develop funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China was urged yesterday to speed the development of mutual funds with
foreign involvement to stabilise its fledgling stock markets, which have
been subject to wild fluctuations in the past year.
Mr Robin Fox, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, told an investment seminar
in Beijing organised by the China-Britain Trade Group that one way to
bolster China's markets was to 'promote properly authorised savings
vehicles'.
Adding to the volatility of China's equities markets has been the fact that
inexperienced individuals seeking short-term speculative gains make up the
bulk of investors.
China announced recently that it was considering allowing foreign securities
houses to form joint ventures with Chinese institutions to invest in the
A-share market, presently closed to foreigners.
Mr Fox said there was a wealth of experience available among foreign
securities companies in joint venture arrangements with local firms.
Kleinwort Benson, for example, was engaged in such ventures in India, Korea,
Taiwan and Japan.
'The foreign joint-venture partner would be more able to overcome conflicts
of interest as well as resisting local pressure to invest in particular
industries or companies,' Mr Fox said.
'The main investment goal of the funds I am recommending would be to invest
in quoted Chinese companies to help in the development of domestic stock
markets, but I would expect them also to participate in the bond market,
possibly by investing a stated percentage of each fund in government bonds.'
Mr Fox said merchant banks and foreign securities companies were also well
placed to assist China in its present phase of rapid economic development
requiring large amounts of capital, especially for infrastructure projects.
British investment banks were 'ideal partners' for projects which required
creative approaches in evaluating the financial viability of a project, and
seeking ways in which risk could be minimised.
There was also a substantial exercise, Mr Fox said, in looking at
alternative sources of equity and debt finance, negotiating the construction
and other contracts to maximise the risk taken on by the contractors, and
also maximise the project finance that does not appear as a direct liability
of the promoters of the projects.
Other speakers included Lord Alexander, chairman of the National Westminster
Bank, who urged his Chinese audience to take advantage of the 'skill base'
offered by London's commercial banking system.
These skills, he said, include assistance in the development of the Chinese
securities industry, corporate finance, direct investment channels and
fundraising for privately financed infrastructure projects, such as power
stations and toll roads.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Ruling casts doubt on
eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers fear London's reputation as a leading international financial centre
could be severely dented unless an inadvertent restriction on UK insurance
companies' holdings of corporate eurobonds is reversed swiftly.
UK insurers are not allowed to have more than 10 per cent of their assets in
unlisted securities, the definition of which was revised earlier this year
when UK insurance industry legislation was amended to include the European
Union's third life directive.
The Department of Trade and Industry now classifies listed assets as those
regularly traded or traded on a regulated market. Since the International
Securities Market Association (Isma), the eurobond market's association, has
chosen not to be a regulated market but a designated investment exchange,
corporate eurobonds are unlisted securities in the eyes of the DTI.
Eurobonds issued by sovereign or supranational borrowers are not affected by
the ruling because they have been classified by the EU as approved assets
for insurers.
Mr Richard Regan, head of investment affairs at the Association of British
Insurers, said the new ruling was not a major problem since he was not aware
of any insurers being close to this limit. The DTI had also indicated it
would grant dispensations if individual insurance companies applied.
A DTI official confirmed that it had received representations and that it
was considering whether to relax the restrictions on traded corporate debt
instruments.
However, Mr Simon Ellen, chairman of Isma's committee of reporting dealers,
said a change in the legislation was required to prevent a serious impact on
the eurobond market where UK insurers have become big investors in recent
years.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Discretionary forex group
formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The foundation of a new treasury management company has provided the latest
indication of a shift away from the use of automated trading programmes in
the foreign exchange market.
Mr Richard Hill, former head of proprietary foreign exchange trading at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has joined with two senior dealers from other firms
to form Tigon Treasury Management.
TTM is responding to what it sees as the growing demand for 'discretionary'
foreign exchange management, whereby managers rely on their experience and
judgment, and take views on changing markets.
'We have definitely noticed an increase in the appetite for
discretionary-based traders,' said Ms Nicola Meaden, managing director of
Tass Management, a company which tracks the performance of fund managers.
The growing fashion in both forex and bond markets for an approach based
more on human judgment comes in response to the mixed performance of the
'black boxes'. These programmes and models lie at the heart of what is
generally known as systematic trading.
They performed well for much of 1993 but have slipped back badly this year.
While the average currency fund fell just 1.38 per cent in the first six
months of 1994, systematic traders dropped 24.2 per cent, according to Tass
Management.
TTM expects to raise its initial allocation of between Dollars 40m and
Dollars 50m from smaller companies and banks which do not have the resources
to attract foreign exchange professionals and establish professional
in-house teams.
Mr Hill estimated there were only three or four competitors in discretionary
forex management.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson lifts
first-half net earnings 24%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Jardine Matheson, the trading conglomerate which is to de-list from the Hong
Kong stock exchange at the end of the year, lifted first-half net earnings
to USDollars 215.8m from USDollars 173.8m in the same period last year.
The rise was partially fuelled by a 44 per cent profits jump at Jardine
Fleming, the brokerage jointly owned with UK merchant bank Robert Fleming.
Its after-tax profit was USDollars 111m, half of which accrues to Jardine
Matheson, against USDollars 77m in 1993.
However, directors warned that Jardine Fleming will be hard pressed to match
last year's second half which triggered a 166 per cent rise in net earnings
to USDollars 202m.
Earnings per share, taken on a fully-diluted basis, rose 23 per cent to
36.69 US cents from 29.79 US cents, and directors are recommending an
interim dividend of 7.80 US cents a share, an improvement of 15 per cent on
last year's 6.80 US cent payout.
The results were in line with expectations. Henry Keswick, chairman, said
the outlook for the full year is for satisfactory earnings growth.
Among affiliates and operating divisions, Jardine Pacific's earnings rose 7
per cent to USDollars 86m with the trading and distribution arm helped by a
pick up in Hong Kong and slight recovery in the wines and spirits business
in Japan.
Trading profit in the engineering and construction division declined despite
strong showings by Jardine Airconditioning, Jardine Schindler and Gammon,
due mainly to the reduction in the group's interest in Jardine Schindler and
lower Pacific Machinery sales.
Jardine Strategic, in which Jardine Matheson has a 55 per cent attributable
interest, contributed USDollars 64.3m, an increase of 53 per cent. That was
lifted by swollen interests in the group and two affiliates, Dairy Farm and
Mandarin Oriental.
Last week Jardine companies announced they will follow Jardine Matheson and
Jardine Strategic and de-list from the Hong Kong stock exchange, essentially
over post-1997 concerns. The news coincided with an attack by China on the
group calling for its removal from the proposed Container Terminal 9
project, which Beijing has yet to approve.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Japan Tobacco attracts strong
demand for shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual investors showed strong interest in buying Japan Tobacco shares
when they are listed on Japan's eight stock exchanges on October 27, though
foreigners appeared less keen.
The ministry of finance, which will announce winners in the lottery for
shares on October 4, said yesterday that Japan Tobacco attracted buy
applications for 21.15m shares against 436,666 shares available, with
individuals accounting for 21.05m.
Foreign investors applied for only 4,764 shares, and institutional investors
for 85,835, the ministry said. A Japan Tobacco employees' shareholding group
sought 7,000.
In spite of the large number of subscriptions, however, many analysts are
bearish over the demand for Japan Tobacco. Some imply that intensive sales
by brokers could have pushed the number of subscriptions higher than genuine
demand since a single investor was allowed to place orders for up to 9,999
shares, but is not obligated to buy them even if they win the lottery.
'Given what happened with Japan Telecom, there's a lot of anxiety with
foreign investors towards new issues,' said Ms Patricia Horvath of UBS
Securities.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Feud stalls Gillette's Indian
ambitions - The US group's plans for its largest untapped market are
faltering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after Gillette was given permission by the Indian government to
acquire a stake in Harbanslal Malhotra and Sons (HMSL), India's biggest
razor blades manufacturer, the US-based multinational's ambitious plans for
the sub-continent have been stalled by a family feud and protracted legal
battle.
At the heart of the dispute is a growing fear and resentment among Indian
industrialists that the government's reform programme, introduced three
years ago, has made it too easy for multinationals to establish themselves
in the Indian market by buying up the most successful local businesses.
Last year, Coca-Cola bought Parle Exports, India's largest soft drinks
manufacturer, and Procter and Gamble acquired a stake in Godrej Soaps to
consolidate its presence in the Indian detergents market.
More recently, Whirlpool, the US white goods giant, has bought Kelvinator
India, one of the country's most established refrigerator manufacturers.
Gillette has identified India as one of three chief markets (with China and
Russia), in which it will expand all its businesses - Gillette shaving
systems, the Oral-B dental care range, Braun home appliances, and Parker
writing equipment - during the next decades. The company will invest Dollars
50m to Dollars 60m in 1994-95, and is carrying out extensive market research
in the country.
Gillette has had a presence in India's Rs2.5bn Indian razor blades market
since 1986. India's reforms programme only encouraged the company to expand
in what it considers the world's largest market, with a vast untapped
potential.
Last year, the company increased its 40 per cent stake in Indian Shaving
Products, a joint venture with the Calcutta-based Poddar group, to 51 per
cent.
Although the Indian company enjoyed an 18 per cent market share, its success
was confined to the upper end of the shaving systems market, which accounts
for a mere 3 per cent of the total market of 47.2bn units a year. To enter
the fast-expanding lower end of the Indian blades market, Gillette decided
to link up with its main Indian competitors, the Malhotras, who control more
than 55 per cent of the blades market.
'Out of 20bn blades sold in the world, 7.8bn are in the lower segment of the
market,' says Mr Gurbrinder Singh Gill, director for strategic projects at
Gillette International and head of Gillette's India operations. 'We cannot
produce cheap blades because of our high R&amp;D costs. An alliance with the
Malhotras will help us establish ourselves in all the segments, and then we
will be in a position to considerably widen the market.'
Gillette estimates that more than 700m Indians use cut-throat razors instead
of blades, and could be persuaded to use more modern shaving systems in
time.
Last October, the government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board cleared
Gillette's proposal to pay Dollars 20m for a 26 per cent stake in NVI
Engineering, a Malhotra group company which manufactures blade-making
machinery.
But Mr Rajinder Malhotra, who with his sons owns 33 per cent of HMSL, the
Rs600m flagship company, contested the deal, saying his two elder brothers
Ved Prakash (who has retired due to ill health) and Surinder Nath (who runs
the business), were selling their stake to Gillette without his knowledge.
He claims that his brothers have valued HMSL at Rs600m while he believes it
to be worth at least Rs15bn.
Mr Rajinder, who with his sons owns Vidyut Metallics, a local blades maker
withabout 27 per cent of the market, fears that apart from the dilution of
the stake in HMSL he inherited from his father, his Rs1bn-a-year turnover
company would find it hard to compete with Gillette once it collaborated
with his two brothers.
If Gillette acquired a 49 per cent stake in HMSL, it could gain an annual
production capacity of 1.5bn blades, the capacity of two HMSL plants in
Calcutta.
If the capacities of other HMSL subsidiaries, Malhotra Shaving Products and
Centron Industrial Alliances, were added, Gillette could increase its
capacity to 2.4bn blades. Since Gillette already has a controlling stake in
Indian Shaving Products, it could control 75 per cent of the Indian blades
market.
In August last year, before the government granted permission for Gillette
to acquire the Malhotra stake, Mr Rajinder asked the Company Law Board to
intervene over the negotiations between Gillette and his brothers. The Law
Board ordered HMSL not to proceed with the collaboration without the
approval of all the shareholders of the company, but this was subsequently
set aside when the elder brothers appealed to the Calcutta High Court.
Mr Rajinder also moved to the Delhi High Court, challenging the Foreign
Investment Promotion Board's right to grant permission to Gillette to expand
its business in India. he alleged that the government had not evolved clear
criteria and principles for processing such applications. He claimed
Gillette had suppressed important facts about the tie-up, and that the
company was importing obsolete machinery which it already possessed.
Gillette, he said, was not ready to bring in sophisticated sensor-blade
technology, but the price of razor blades would increase sharply once
Gillette established a market monopoly.
The Supreme Court was moved to set aside a stay the elder Malhotras acquired
from the Calcutta High Court, and the final hearing in the Delhi High Court
is posted for October 4. Mr Rajinder was also keen to get HMSL's shares
evaluated the Indian company's shares, saying his brothers had grossly
undervalued the company at Rs600m, while he estimated the company to be
worth Rs15bn.
Meanwhile, Gillette is scouting for partners to enter the writing
instruments market, and the home appliances and the dental care market.
These markets will be easier to develop than the shaving products market.

BB Biotech, a start-up investment company specialising in biotechnology
securities, has raised its net asset value 16 per cent to SFr2,493 (Dollars
1,953), in the four months from the end of April to the end of August.
The company already has one of the largest biotech funds in the world with
an investment volume of SFr487m.
It has concentrated on the securities of only five US companies since its
start-up last November, and has outperformed the CBOE Biotechnology Index by
25 per cent.
BB Biotech raised SFr325m in its initial public offering of shares in Zurich
and a further SFr150m in February through a free warrants rights issue. It
is managed by Bellevue Asset Management.
Almost two thirds of its funds are in Biogen and Genentech, with the
remainder in Amgen and a small new stake in Affymax, a California-based
leader in combinatorial chemistry. Its position in Alza, the drug delivery
system specialist, has been sold.

buy-back plan

<TEXT>
Shareholders in Coles Myer, one of Australia's largest retailers, yesterday
approved the company's plans to buy back 21.45 per cent of its equity, for
ADollars 1.26bn (Dollars 920m). The shares are currently held by Kmart, the
US discount and specialty store operator.
Coles had run into criticism because the price at which the buy-back is due
to take place had been pitched at ADollars 4.55 a share - a significant
premium to the recent market price, which closed 1 cent higher at ADollars
4.02 yesterday. Some shareholders were also concerned about the ADollars 28m
fee Coles was obliged to pay Kmart in the event that the deal did not go
ahead.
At the meeting, in Melbourne, Mr Lawrence Gruzman, a shareholder and
well-known dissident at Coles, spoke out against the plan. But two motions
for the deal were approved.
The first, concerning Coles's plan to buy back 129m shares, or just under 10
per cent, directly and to cancel these was passed with 93 per cent of voting
shareholders in favour. The second motion, which permits Coles to acquire a
Kmart unit that holds the remaining shares, passed on a show of hands.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: McDonnell faces tough decision
on missiles side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace company, faces a difficult decision
about the future of its missile business following its failure to get the
'winner takes all' contract for up to Dollars 2bn of Tomahawk cruise
missiles from the US Navy.
The hard realities of consolidation in the US defence business were
underlined by Hughes, the winner of the competition, which put its success
down to the cost savings it has generated since buying General Dynamics'
missile business two years ago. Hughes has rationalised the two companies'
operations and moved them all to a single site in Tucson, Arizona.
McDonnell Douglas had put its missile operations up for sale 18 months ago
but pulled it off the market because it considered offers inadequate. Now it
is waiting for a debriefing at the Pentagon which will explain why it lost
the Tomahawk competition before deciding what to do next.
The company has work on the Tomahawk from previous competitions which will
last until mid-1995. McDonnell could also bid for a small contract to supply
the UK with 100 Tomahawks, but there is no other potential work pending.
As a result, the future of the factory at Titusville, Florida, which employs
1,300 people on Cruise, must now be in doubt. Another 400 are employed on
the programme at the company's headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, but they
produce ship-based control systems which were unaffected by the missile
competition.
Elsewhere, McDonnell's ship-launched Harpoon and the stand-off SLAM missile
are relatively small contracts and its main development work is on the JDAM
smart bomb. That may not be sufficient to maintain a viable missiles
business in the rapidly shrinking US defence market.
In theory, McDonnell Douglas could add to its missile operations, but it is
much more likely that the company will decide to sell to another missile
maker. Hughes, which bid for the business last year, may be less interested
now that it has become the sole supplier of Tomahawks. Other potential
buyers may still be interested.

First Financial Management, a data processing company, has won the bidding
for Western Union, the world's biggest non-bank money transfer company, with
a Dollars 1.153bn offer, a US bankruptcy court judge said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Newark.
Western Union, which was put up for auction by the bankruptcy judge in June,
though not itself in bankruptcy, is owned by New Valley, which has been
operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since March.
Atlanta-based First Financial Management's winning bid beat that of its
rival Forstmann Little, a leveraged buy-out firm, which dropped out of the
bidding at Dollars 1.143bn.
The third bidder, First Data, a credit card processing company spun off by
American Express two years ago, also dropped out of the bidding.
Bankruptcy Judge Novalyn Winfield said: 'Well, this long process is over and
the marketplace seems to have won. This seems to be the highest and best
offer for the company.'
Mr Carl Icahn, who owns about Dollars 80m worth of New Valley bonds, said:
'This open bidding is terrific. I think it should be adopted in other
bankruptcy cases.'
He said he bought the bonds at 20 cents to 30 cents on the dollar and would
be repaid in full.

copyrights lawsuit

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On the heels of Apple Computer's decision to license its proprietary
Macintosh personal computer operating system software to other PC companies,
a California appeals court has thrown out Apple's charges that Microsoft's
competing Windows PC operating system, and related software from
Hewlett-Packard, infringe Apple copyrights.
The copyright infringement suit, filed six years ago, was part of Apple's
efforts in the past to protect the 'look and feel' of the Macintosh software
which - until the introduction of Microsoft's Windows in 1987 - gave Apple a
competitive advantage over IBM and other PC makers.
That advantage has long since been lost, with Microsoft's Windows now the
standard operating system for all IBM-compatible PCs. However, by licensing
its software to other PC manufacturers, Apple hopes to regain lost ground.
Initially, Apple will license its core Mac OS and elements of its PowerPC
hardware design which until now have been unique to its own products, to
companies that are not direct competitors in markets where Apple has limited
distribution and in specialised market segments. The company said 'over
time' it aims to license its technology more broadly.
Already 'about six companies' have signed licensing agreements, Apple said,
but refused to identify the licensees other than to say that they are
equally divided among the US, Europe and Asia. The first Macintosh-style
products from third parties are expected to be introduced by late 1995.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola sales exceed estimates
for third quarter

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, yesterday announced its third-quarter
volume estimates ahead of third-quarter results because it said the figures
'significantly exceeded' stock market analysts' projections.
The volume of soft drinks sold in international markets was expected to be
14 per cent ahead of last year, the company said, and in the US domestic
market, 5 to 6 per cent ahead. Worldwide volume was expected to rise by
about 12 per cent.
For the first nine months of the year, volumes were expected to be 10 per
cent higher internationally and 6 per cent higher in the US, making a total
of 8 per cent worldwide.
Analysts had been predicting a jump of 25 per cent in earnings per share, to
55 cents in the third quarter, reflecting a favourable comparison with last
year's weak figures, and Coca-Cola said it was 'comfortable' with this. The
shares were up Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 48 7/8 .
Coca-Cola's large increase in volumes comes at a time when the company is
facing competition from private label colas in some markets, particularly
Canada and the UK. But the company said inroads by private label
manufacturers had been more than outweighed by volume increases elsewhere.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kemira aims to raise FM1.5bn in
share offer

Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, said yesterday it hoped to
raise between FM1.5bn (Dollars 305m) and FM2bn through an international
share issue to be launched next month.
The offer, as part of Finland's biggest ever initial public offering, will
cut state ownership in the group from 100 per cent to as little as 71 per
cent in line with the government's privatisation programme. It will be
accompanied by a listing of Kemira's shares on the Helsinki stock exchange.
Kemira said proceeds would be used to cut its FM8bn net debt and strengthen
its equity-to-assets ratio from a weak 15 per cent to about 25 per cent.
The group will offer a total of 30m ordinary shares at a nominal FM10 each,
with an option to increase the size of the issue by 5m shares if demand is
strong. The bulk of the shares will be offered to international
institutions, with the balance being subscribed by Finnish institutions and
retail investors.
Many of Kemira's businesses are starting to benefit from cyclical economic
recovery and it returned to the black last year after two years of losses
following an extensive cost-cutting programme. The group's biggest division
includes fertilisers and it has important niche positions in pulp and paper
chemicals, water treatment chemicals and titanium dioxide pigments.
Mr Heimo Karinen, Kemira's chief executive, said: 'Kemira's profitability
and competitiveness have substantially improved following the restructuring
of its operations in the last few years. The equity issue will further
strengthen the group's financial position and enable us to take full
advantage of the recovery that is seen in the chemical industry.'
The offer will be launched after publication of eight-month figures on
October 10 with final pricing being fixed in the week of October 31.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: HungarHotels contenders line up

<TEXT>
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US company, and
Intercontinental Hotels, the Japanese-owned hotel group, last night emerged
as the top contenders for a 51 per cent stake in HungarHotels, Hungary's
last state-owned hotel chain to come up for privatisation.
The State Property Agency, the privatisation body, said three of the five
companies invited to participate in yesterday's tender had put in valid
bids.
Analysts said American General, which operates 91 hotels in the US, and
Intercontinental, which has wide experience in the former Soviet bloc, were
the favourites to win.
HungarHotels has registered share capital of Ft9bn (USDollars 83.3m) but the
sale of the 51 per cent stake is expected to net around USDollars 60m.
HungarHotels owns 15 hotels in Hungary, including eight in Budapest and two
on Lake Balaton, the country's most popular summer tourist destination. It
owns 45 per cent of four star hotel capacity in Budapest, including the
Hotel Forum situated on the River Danube in the centre of the city which is
one of central Europe's most visited tourist and business locations.
The chain made net profit of Ft6.3bn last year and is projecting net profit
of Ft6.6bn for 1994. Room occupancy averaged 53.7 per cent last year and is
expected to increase to 57 per cent this year.
Dallas-based American General, which was founded in 1981, has a track record
in turning around loss-making or under performing hotels. The company, which
had turnover of USDollars 300m last year, does not operate hotels under its
own name but appoints franchise partners for its hotels. In the US, it works
with chains such as Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton and Holiday Inn.
The company said it believed its management could add 'a lot of value' to
HungarHotels and that it was keen to establish a presence in the European
market. Presently, the company only operates in the US.
Intercontinental has worked in the region since the 1960s. It runs the Hotel
Forum through a local franchiser and until last year had a similar agreement
with the Duna Intercontinental, now the Marriott.
Intercontinental said, if successful, it would manage directly just four
hotels in the chain. It would leave the remainder with their existing
management which it would train. A condition of the tender is that the
successful bidder would not be able to sell off any of the 15 hotels for
three years.
The SPA is due to launch a public offering for the remaining 49 per cent
once the majority stake has been sold.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: IBM pins PC hopes on new
home-use products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines (IBM) is pinning its hopes of regaining
leadership of the personal computers market on its new products aimed at
home users.
The Aptiva multimedia PC is the first of three new product lines that IBM is
preparing for market. Two more are expected next month.
The products will be backed by the company's biggest ever advertising
campaign, a spend of Dollars 100m over the next three months, with Dollars
20m dedicated specifically to Aptiva.
The marketing blitz is designed not only to boost sales but also to help IBM
to rebuild its image as an industry leader. Over the past six months IBM has
slipped to fourth place in US PC sales from first place last year, overtaken
by Compaq Computer, Apple Computer and Packard Bell.
Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, this year hired Mr Rick Thoman, a colleague
at RJR Nabisco and American Express, to reinvigorate its PC operations. The
product lines will be the first test of his new approach to PC marketing.
The Aptiva PCs are aimed at the growing consumer market, and follow last
week's launch by Compaq Computer of a new line of consumer PCs. IBM is
offering a wider price range than Compaq, from about Dollars 1,200 to
Dollars 2,600, including two models based on Intel's highest performance
Pentium microprocessors. Intel last week began its own Dollars 80m
consumer-oriented advertising campaign for Pentium-based PCs.
The Aptiva range includes multimedia capabilities, such as a CD-ROM player
and speakers, as standard. It can also take telephone messages or receive a
fax, 'waking up' when the telephone rings, whether or not the machine is
turned on.
A 'scheduler' also allows the home PC user to program the Aptiva PC to turn
itself on and perform pre-selected functions, such as playing a music CD or
sending fax messages overnight.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Macintosh licensing scheme from
Apple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer plans an expansion through the phased licensing of its
Macintosh personal computer software to other PC companies.
Initially, Apple will license its core 'Mac OS' and elements of its PowerPC
hardware design which until now has been unique to its own PC products, to
companies that are not direct competitors. These will include companies
where Apple has limited distribution; and those whose technical expertise
can add value, such as making computers for specific applications.
Already 'about six companies' have signed licensing agreements, Apple said,
but refused to identify the licensees other than to say that they are
equally divided between the US, Europe and Asia.
Industry analysts have speculated that some of Apple's direct competitors,
including IBM, might be interested in licensing the Macintosh software if
the terms were favourable.
Apple's failure to license the Macintosh software in the late 1980s is seen
by critics as a serious strategic blunder because it allowed Microsoft, the
world's largest software company, to establish its Windows PC operating
system as the industry standard, and industry analysts said Apple's move now
is 'too little, too late'. Apple's share of the PC market has slipped to
about 10 per cent in the face of intense competition from companies such as
Compaq Computer offering PCs with Windows software.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK Vision, the investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group, has won a landmark court challenge against a Swiss company's attempt
to reduce shareholder rights in issues of new equity capital.
Union Bank of Switzerland, in which BK Vision is the largest single
shareholder, last year won approval from its AGM to create pools of equity
capital that could be used at the board's discretion for acquisitions or
equity linked bond issues without seeking further authorisation from
shareholders or respecting their pre-emptive rights.
BK Vision claimed that a new Swiss companies act, which came into force in
1992 and authorised the creation of these pools of capital, required that
companies specify to the AGM the purposes for which they would be used.
The panel of five commercial court judges agreed that neither the capital
nor the voting rights of shareholders could be withdrawn, even by a majority
AGM vote, unless it was for a specified purpose.
The court made clear that it understood that the purpose could not always be
disclosed in detail, as, for example, in the case of a large acquisition.
After the new act came into force, several quoted Swiss companies drew up
resolutions creating pools of authorised and conditional capital which were
approved by their AGMs.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: General Mills cereals setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Mills, one of America's biggest producers of breakfast cereals,
suffered a 21 per cent slump in cereal sales volume in its first quarter to
August 28. The company blamed supply disruptions during the summer, when it
discovered it had been using in its cereals oats treated with an
unauthorised pesticide.
General Mills said the costs, which obliged it to throw away some 50m boxes
of cereal, had been included in last year's results. However, cereal
production, suspended in June, had not been fully resumed until the second
half of July. That had affected both first-quarter sales and profits.
The company said that shortage of product had caused its share of the
Dollars 9bn US cereal market to fall from 29 per cent to 24 per cent in the
quarter. However, trade inventories were now normal and full marketing
support had resumed. Sales were ahead of budget, the company said, and a
'resumption of earnings momentum' is expected.
General Mills' pesticide problems have compounded its difficulties in the
highly competitive US cereal market. In April, the company announced it was
slashing the prices of some of its brands, which include Cheerios and
Wheaties, by 11 per cent. The decision, reminiscent of Philip Morris's
earlier cut in the price of its Marlboro cigarettes, surprised the rest of
the market.
Net income for the quarter fell 9 per cent from Dollars 1.04 per share to
Dollars 0.95, on sales down 5 per cent at Dollars 1.98bn. Excluding the
cereals operations, the company said, earnings were up 8 per cent on the
year before. Volume of its Betty Crocker products, excluding snacks, had
risen 8 per cent. Snack volume was lower due to 'promotional timing', the
company said.
Restaurant sales were up 6 per cent in the quarter, but operating profit was
virtually flat. General Mills' shares rose Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars
55 3/4.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pechiney trims half-time deficit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium and packaging group, yesterday
announced a slight improvement in first-half results, narrowing net losses
to FFr321m (Dollars 59.88m) compared with a deficit of FFr397m in the first
six months of 1993.
The company, which is slated for privatisation, forecast a marked
improvement in second-half results on the back of a recovery in aluminium
prices and increased contributions from other of its industrial activities.
The results for the period included a fall in profits at Pechiney
International, the packaging arm of the French group. Net profits fell to
FFr314m from FFr439m in the first half of 1993. The company said its US
drinks can operations, which have been hit by weak prices, was being
restructured at a cost of FFr369m.
According to Pechiney, the first half of the year had seen a clear
improvement in the economic environment which had helped its industrial and
aluminium operations. These were severely affected by recession last year,
when the group suffered a loss of FFr980m.
Group sales amounted to FFr33.96bn in the first half, compared with
FFr31.27bn in the 1993 period. Operating profits across principal sectors
saw varying fortunes, falling to FFr890m from FFr905m in the packaging
division, and rising to FFr214m from FFr195m in the turbine components
activities. The aluminium businesses improved from a loss of FFr138m to a
deficit of FFr45m,
At Pechiney International, sales were largely stable at FFr17.7bn. Operating
results were also in line with the first half of last year, recording a
profit of FFr1.08bn in the first six months of 1994.

Russia's MTS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
France Telecom, the French state-owned telecoms operator, yesterday took a
further step in its international expansion, announcing it would take an 11
per cent stake in MTS, a Russian mobile telephones joint venture.
The stake in the Russian venture also represents a strengthening of France
Telecom's alliance with Deutsche Telekom, the German operator from which it
will buy the stake. After the sale, Deutsche Telekom will have a 28 per cent
stake in MTS.
MTS, which holds a 10-year exclusive operating licence for mobile
communications in the Moscow area, is 51 per cent owned by Russian
interests. These include MGTS, Moscow's public telecoms operator.
The joint venture, to invest about Dollars 90m in the Moscow mobile
communications network, launched operations in July. It has about 2,000
subscribers for its GSM systems, a digital radio telephone system used by
about 60 countries.
France Telecom is present in Russia in fixed telephone communications. Since
1992 it has jointly operated a network in Kaliningrad. Last year, it signed
an agreement to help modernise the Russian telephone network.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Political uncertainty holds sway
in Italy - Budget discussions may cloud the forthcoming results season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian stock market, like Italian newspaper headlines, sometimes seems
to be just a noisy approximation of what is really happening. Milan's
principal equity indices are no higher now than they were on the eve of the
country's mould-breaking general election in March, in spite of the fact
that Italy's quoted companies are about to publish evidence of real economic
recovery in their half-year results.
The main reason is that this year's Italian results season - although it
will be the first for two or three years to bring predominantly good news -
coincides with nervousness about the economic plans of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's government. Investors are preferring to focus on cabinet
discussions of the country's budget for 1995, which must be completed by the
end of the month.
As one analyst puts it: 'The political uncertainty will prevail over the
markets. It looks like any investment in Italian financial assets - lira,
bonds or equities - has a precondition, and the precondition is: a good 1995
budget.'
Privately, Italian entrepreneurs are frustrated by investors' emphasis on
the fragile political situation. Whatever happens to the government, the
news coming in from subsidiaries looks good, they say.
Italian companies' half-year figures are difficult to forecast, and tricky
to interpret. They are unaudited and usually published before tax, a
notoriously unpredictable element in full-year results. There is room for
some companies - financial and banking groups in particular - to exercise a
certain amount of discretion about what they declare at the halfway stage.
But there is a consensus among analysts that the big industrial companies
will show in the next fortnight how they are reaping the rewards of
restructuring, and, at last, making the most of a weak currency. 'Exporters
are doing extremely well, and the recent weakness of the lira is helping
this,' says Ms Sophie Blanpain, equity strategist with Credit Suisse First
Boston in London.
Four of Italy's biggest quoted industrial groups - Montedison, Fiat, Pirelli
and Olivetti, for example - all recorded large net losses in 1993. But their
interim results should demonstrate a marked improvement in trading, which is
likely to be reflected also in the performance of smaller manufacturers,
often dependent on the giants for their livelihood.
Montedison, the chemicals, energy and agro-industrial group, has already
announced a return to interim pre-tax profits for the first time since 1991.
On Friday, the group, which came close to collapse last year, reported a
pre-tax profit of L289bn (Dollars 185m) in the first half against a loss of
L369bn in the equivalent period. The shares rose by 5 per cent immediately
after the news was announced, although they slipped back later in the day.
Fiat, the automotive and industrial group which last year recorded the
biggest loss of its history, is expected to demonstrate towards the end of
this month that it is on its way to making a profit in the full year, as
forecast by Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman, at the group's annual meeting in
June. The domestic market is still sluggish, in spite of the impact of the
new Punto, now Italy's best-selling car, but the company has still managed
to increase its market share in Italy and boost exports because of the weak
currency.
Recession has forced both Fiat and Pirelli, the cable and tyre manufacturer,
to restructure. Pirelli, which should produce its results at the beginning
of next week, reduced debt from L4,000bn in January 1992, to L2,000bn by
June this year, closed 22 of the 102 factories in its core business and cut
its workforce by 20 per cent to 40,000. Again, the half-year results should
demonstrate that the group is on the way to its target of a return to net
profit in 1994.
The recovery at Olivetti, the computer group, is more fragile. Its half-year
results, which will be published on Thursday, are likely to be marred by
large trading losses on the group's investment portfolio. But although there
is still some doubt about whether the company will take restructuring
charges for 1994 in the first or second half, many analysts expect Olivetti
to break even at the operating level in the first six months.
The news is likely to be less good in the banking sector - hit by trading
losses, particularly on the bond market - and for those construction and
cement companies which are still suffering from stagnation in the building
sector. But even here, analysts point out that companies such as Unicem -
the cement manufacturer which is part of the Agnelli family's empire - have
reduced their costs substantially during the two to three-year downturn.
So far, the Italian business community has been notably cautious in its
judgment on Mr Berlusconi, perhaps partly out of respect for an
entrepreneur-turned-prime minister, partly out of residual optimism about
what is, in effect, Italy's first pro-business government since the war.
What they now want to see is a strong effort by the government to match
their hard work in cutting costs and restructuring for a recovery, for
example by keeping taxes down and pursuing its initial proposals on labour
market flexibility and investment incentives.
When the 1995 budget is tabled at the end of this month, it will not deliver
Italy 'into paradise or hell,' as one analyst puts it, but it should provide
the first indications of whether Mr Berlusconi is going to fulfil his part
of the bargain with business.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rhino runs deeper into red at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rhino Group, the USM-quoted specialist video and computer games
retailer, fell 5p to 27p yesterday, after the group reported a sharp
increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 263,000 to Pounds 1.37m for the first
half of 1994.
Mr Bev Ripley, chairman, blamed the setback on the strong seasonality of
Rhino's subsidiaries, Future Zone Stores and Downpace. However, he expected
the second half to again benefit significantly from Christmas trading - 1993
profits totalled Pounds 2m.
First-half turnover jumped to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 3.6m) reflecting Rhino's
growing number of stores. Future Zone now operates from 90 retail outlets,
against 28 a year ago, and the group expects to have at least 110 stores
trading during Christmas.
Because of the seasonality of the business, no interim dividend has been
declared. Losses per share were 1.21p (0.45p).
Mr Ripley estimated that so far this year the UK computer and video games
market had declined by about 14 per cent, although this trend had not been
consistent across the various product ranges. He added that Rhino's share of
the UK software market had now risen to about 12 per cent.
The company intends to apply for a full listing, following publication of
its 1994 annual report.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Ready for take-off: The share issue by Germany's Lufthansa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crane, emblem of Germany's flag-carrying Lufthansa airline, was passed
over by the nature protection league as 'Bird of the Year, 1994'. Instead,
it chose the threatened white stork, harbinger of luck, health and
prosperity.
Investment analysts, on the other hand, are virtually unanimous this year in
hailing Lufthansa as a success story. They pay tribute to its rapid
restoration to viability in the three years since Mr Jurgen Weber was
installed as chairman.
Today the airline will set the seal on this change in its fortunes when
subscriptions open for a rights issue and government share sale to raise an
urgently-needed DM1.7bn to restore the group's eroded capital base.
Lufthansa's return to favour is a recent phenomenon. Scepticism still
abounded as recently as 12 months ago, even though the government had just
negotiated renewal of the restrictive post-war US-German air traffic
agreement.
This opened up swathes of previously inaccessible air space to be exploited
by a new co-operative venture between Lufthansa and United Airlines. But
with no sign of any substantial easing in competition on transatlantic
routes, and the lack of binding ties such as cross-shareholdings between the
two lines, the deals were welcomed only coolly.
The mood changed in May when the last hurdle to privatisation was dismantled
by an agreement disentangling Lufthansa's pensions from the civil service
scheme.
The deal, in which the DM4bn cost of bolstering the airline's pension fund
was split between government and airline, opened the way for the current
rights issue. The issue was launched in Frankfurt last week at a ceremonial
preview, to the accompaniment of management forecasts that annual profits
would improve by up to DM700m within three years.
By virtue of Bonn's decision not to exercise its rights and to sell some of
its stock, the issue will dilute its majority stake to around 35 per cent.
More disposals will follow, although Bonn has yet to make clear how far it
is prepared to reduce its stake.
In fact Lufthansa has been run as a de facto private enterprise since Mr
Weber took over as chairman in September 1991. In that time he has done much
to cut costs and inject flexibility into the airline.
Like other top German companies, Lufthansa entered the 1990s laden down with
an over-sized fleet and workforce, and hobbled by a gridlocked bureaucracy
which stretched from the boardroom to the check-in desk.
Misplaced optimism over the prospects offered by the purported completion of
the single European market on January 1 1992 had tempted the board into an
unprecedented spending spree.
In the three years to the end of 1991, it added 120 aircraft to its fleet,
spending some DM8bn on the way, and building net debt up to DM6bn. As was to
emerge shortly after Mr Weber took over in September of that year, the
airline had made its first net loss - of DM426m - in 20 years. As Mr Weber
was to admit for the first time publicly last week, Lufthansa's existence
was threatened.
As a first step, he announced a 10 per cent cut in the workforce for 1992
and 1993. Since the programme started biting in mid-1992, the payroll has
been slimmed by 17 per cent, unit costs have been cut 25 per cent, and
productivity has soared 31 per cent.
Even though average Lufthansa salaries were last year still more than 20 per
cent higher than those at arch-rival, British Airways, analysts have been
impressed by the scale and speed of the turnround, and compare recent
developments with the 37 per cent rise in payroll costs between 1989 and
1992 when productivity increased by a mere 7 per cent.
Reviewing the new management's performance so far, observers have concluded
that restructuring and the concurrent building up of Lufthansa's inherent
strengths in freight and Far East traffic leave it well placed to benefit
from the revival in the industry's fortunes.
The group's cargo business, reinforced by a 25 per cent stake in DHL, for
example, has been an early beneficiary of the international economic
recovery. Cargo haulage is estimated to have risen around 20 per cent so far
this year, when measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs), and yields have
risen an estimated 4 per cent.
Lufthansa's newly introduced twice-weekly service to Shanghai, supplementing
its Beijing flights, and its stake in the Beijing-based aircraft maintenance
joint venture, Amerco, give it a strong position in one of the fastest
growing markets in the world.
Even the north Atlantic routes, where the group's business has shrunk from
22 per cent of total revenue from route operations in 1989 to 15 per cent in
1993, were already showing improvement last year when the passenger load
factor rose from 72 per cent to more than 76 per cent.
In its home base, Europe, which still accounts for 50 per cent of
operational turnover (19 per cent in Germany) low cost-base operations such
as Lufthansa Express and the regional Cityline are winning it market share.
Passenger load factor was 58 per cent last year, compared with around 51 per
cent in 1992.
At the same time, the economic recovery is helping bolster bookings of
premium-priced seats. Although no regional breakdown is available,
Lufthansa's first- and business-class bookings in the six months to June
rose to 40.2 per cent of the total compared with 38.7 per cent in 1993.
While passengers may be prepared to spend more on their comfort in transit,
the story within Lufthansa has been one of continued economies. But the
greatest luxury to be sacrificed was the illusion that the group could sit
tight in its high-cost German base and do everything as in the past - by
itself.
Deal after deal has been struck to widen and deepen Lufthansa's reach in the
international market. Holdings have been built in Austria's Lauda Air and
Luxembourg's Luxair. Co-operative links were forged with Varig of Brazil.
A 25 per cent holding in Sky Chef of the US fattened the catering division.
Collaboration in a freight hub at Sharjah in the Gulf has been followed by
negotiations for a similar distribution base in Indonesia, further to extend
the group's reach in the fast growing far eastern market. Now, together with
information and systems, Lufthansa's maintenance and cargo operations are to
be spun off as free-standing businesses.
Functioning as profit centres in their own right, along with the Condor
tourism line and catering, they will provide services at market-competitive
prices both to the parent and outside customers. In a global air traffic
market forecast to grow by an average 4-5 per cent a year for the
foreseeable future, Lufthansa has a chance to test its entrepreneurial
wings.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sovereignty at issue, not fisheries
conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARIO CAMPORA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Falklands rivalry tests quick tempers' (August 30)
accurately states that the south west Atlantic is one of the few regions in
the world rich in fishing resources. However, its author does not present a
complete picture of the issues involved in the area. Allow me to address
those of greater relevance.
Argentina rejected the UK's extension of its alleged jurisdiction over
undisputed waters north of the Malvinas Islands on grounds of their
appurtenance to land territories subject to controversy, and because it had
always exerted exclusive rights of sovereignty over those waters. The issue
at stake has nothing to do with fisheries conservation but with sovereignty.
The Argentine government has developed an effective conservation and
fisheries administration policy. The Argentine Navy has substantially
increased its patrols in the Argentine economic exclusion zone, and
provisions are being made to increase them further. At the same time, the
National Institute of Fisheries Research enjoys greater financial and
technological resources and produces state-of-the-art research in the
subject.
In the case of Illex squid, it is worth recalling that between 1987 and 1992
Argentina captured less than a third of the totals fished in waters close to
the Malvinas Islands.
The reference to the Argentine-EU agreement seems to be misleading since it
only came into force on May 24 1994, and it has not yet been implemented.
Surely, the article in question would have benefited from further research
on Argentine fisheries policy and from consultation with Argentine official
sources.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The right political correctness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms VERONICA STEBBING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stuart Bentley ('From sexual simile to sexual crime', September 7),
should take pause for thought. For women, the whole problem of 'defining the
limits of acceptable behaviour' is that society is dominated by men - who
have, until quite recently, always been politically correct in their own
eyes simply by virtue of being male.
Mr Bentley should try putting himself in our place for a change - for
instance at any lecture in any subject traditionally dominated by men - and
he might then find that political correctness (from a female point of view)
could consist of nothing more alarming than consideration for other people's
feelings and point of view before opening his mouth - not always something
that is a male strong point]

FT  20 SEP 94 / Political chaos theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chaos theory is fundamental to an understanding of science, and chic among
economists and investment managers, but to learned students of politics like
you and me it is old hat. We have always understood that a surprise may hit
us in the face at any moment, that nobody knows what is going to happen, and
that each event bounces off the other with a cumulative effect that on one
equation is constructive, on another destructive. So be warned. We cannot be
certain of the outcome of tomorrow's election in Denmark - although, if we
are British, we may be envious of the choice of parties.
Those of us who have mastered the finer intricacies of chaos theory know
that when applied to politics, positive feedback does not always occur.
Perhaps the most unexpected Danish politician of the post-1945 era was Mr
Mogens Glistrup, who established his Progress Party in 1972 on the principle
of cutting income tax. It briefly became the second largest party in the
Folketing, their parliament. Unfortunately, it appeared that Mr Glistrup did
not rely on the democratic process to reduce his bill. In 1983 he was sent
to jail for three years for tax fraud. This was more than the beating of a
butterfly's wing in Tokyo. It was world fame. A fat lot of good it did.
Today Danes pay the highest share of national income in taxation of any
country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Chaos moves in mysterious ways. For example, Italy may have been hit by
negative feedback. In April 1993, on a high turnout, four-fifths of the
electorate signified approval of a change to the law on voting. The old,
corrupt, party list system was cast aside. In future three-quarters of
senators and deputies would be chosen by first-past-the-post and the rest
elected on new, simon-pure party lists. Excitement ran high. Strong
government would surely follow reform. A year later the first ballot held
under the new rules produced a shaky coalition. Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
hastily-established party, Forza Italia, promised change, but it has not yet
delivered much. Italy's proponents of national renewal are understandably
disappointed. Mr Berlusconi may be an admirer of Lady Thatcher, but he does
not command the overwhelming, and stable, majority in Italy's parliament
that the former prime minister enjoyed in Britain.
Many other examples lie in the database, including the intervention of Mr
Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election in the US and the unscripted
victory of Mr John Major in the British contest of the same year. You will,
however, have taken my point. So, I assume, will Mr Paddy Ashdown. The
leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats can only keep his countenance as
cheerful as he does by telling himself that one day something unexpected and
positive will turn up. Then his party, created by him almost single-handedly
out of the ashes of the Liberal and Social Democratic alliance, will have an
assured role to play in national politics.
To appreciate his predicament you need to step back a bit. The ancient and
venerable Liberal party was virtually obliterated in the 1945 election that
swept Labour to power in a landslide. In subsequent years, first under the
then Mr Jo Grimond and later under the now written-out Mr Jeremy Thorpe, the
lynchpin of Liberal strategy was the notion of the long march. Slowly,
steadily, election by election, the party of Gladstone would regain its
former glory. It may take a generation, or perhaps two, but that was the
goal. A generation passed by. Little distance was gained. The footsloggers
became dispirited. Under Mr David Steel's leadership a new strategy was
adopted. Liberals were to be the pluralist party, willing to co-operate with
others. If one of the two large parties would only be kind enough to
introduce proportional representation, deals could be cut. This formula
looked likely to become a winner when the alliance was high in the opinion
polls in the mid-1980s. Alas, something, possibly a butterfly-wing,
intervened. The alliance crashed.
Mr Ashdown's initial task, when he surveyed the ruins in 1989, was clear. He
had to rebuild. He has done so: the Lib-Dems are a long march ahead in local
politics. As to national representation, they have half-a-dozen taxifuls of
MPs and a position of strength in Scotland and the West Country.
Unfortunately for them chaos has hit them on the head once more. The Labour
party, which the Liberals, the Alliance and the Lib-Dems were supposed to
overtake and replace, is remaking itself. Mr Ashdown knows he would not be
credible if he preached a return to the long march. He must be aware that
while pluralism works in hung local councils, a hung parliament is no more
likely to follow the next general election than it did the last.
That is why the current talk of whether the Lib-Dems will give their favours
to Labour or the Tories, in return for no higher a payment than the
rewriting of the British constitution, is a mere fancy. The expected outcome
in 1996 or 1997 is a strong Labour victory; the second most likely is a
repeat of the present parliament. Yet the statistically unexpected could
happen. Labour, or its new leader, might turn out to be unmodernisable. The
Lib-Dems would then gain a renewed meaning. Alternatively, Labour might win
the most seats but not an overall majority. The people's party would then so
depend on Lib-Dems support that it would be obliged to keep its promise to
hold a referendum on proportional representation for the House of Commons.
That could lead to an interesting twist up the chaos spiral. The
Conservatives would oppose PR; Labour would be split, and Mr Ashdown might
find himself fighting the referendum on his own.
The outcome would be up to Chaos's sister, Fate. In two referendums in 1992
and 1993 New Zealand's voters rejected the advice of the main national
parties and introduced the German combination of single-member and
proportional elections. The strongest influence on voters was their dislike
of mainstream national politicians. Whatever the latter asked for, they did
not get. It makes you think. The presently available evidence suggests that
Mr Ashdown's only secure future is to lie on the Labour leader's lap and wag
his tail. But you never know. A thunderbolt may strike . . .

FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Excessive barriers in Euro car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K E LUDVIGSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his report about the battle over the EU block exemption which
governs car distribution in Europe ('The battle for the forecourt' ,
September 16), Kevin Done makes much of the car price differences that are
reported in Europe. In interpreting these findings we place special emphasis
on consumer group Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs' point that
institutional barriers impeding cross-border purchases and registrations of
cars are excessive in what should be a single market for cars. These must be
removed, in combination with greater economic coherence between EU member
states, before any form of price harmonisation can be contemplated.
Certainly this is one area where new regulation must tread with care.
Done suggests that the current debate is determining 'what rules will apply
on the forecourt for the next 10 years'. Our conclusion from a major study
of the block exemption is that the car industry's distribution system in
Europe has been under the most intense and detailed scrutiny for the last 9
1/2 years. This should be long enough to evaluate a system of this kind. The
industry and its many dealers and employees throughout Europe should not be
subjected to similar uncertainties 10 1/2 years from now. We recommend that
the new regulation be put in place for a term as long as any block exemption
the Commission has granted, namely for 14 1/2 years.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Repudiate milk quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current expensive fiasco over milk prices was highlighted by
Deborah Hargreaves ('Milk prices sour the cheesemakers', September 19), but
the chaos can be placed firmly at the door of former minister of
agriculture, Michael Jopling - aided and abetted by the short-sighted
empire-building attitudes of both the Dairy Trade Federation and the Milk
Marketing Board.
At the end of March 1986 Jopling, at half-past-three one morning, after a
long tiring session with his European colleagues, agreed that milk quotas
would be imposed throughout the European Union only 48 hours later.
For reasons never revealed Jopling agreed that the Dutch should be allowed a
milk quota equivalent to 757 litres per head of their population, the Irish
1,508, while the British were to be cut back to only 258 litres per head -
one third of the Dutch and one-sixth of the Irish. And the Italians? They
have never imposed quotas upon their farmers and are now producing 12 per
cent more than they did in 1984. We produce 15 per cent less.
Out of that basic mistake by Jopling has grown the current position whereby
Britain's milk producers are only allowed to produce 80 per cent of the UK's
milk requirements - the Irish produce 300 per cent of theirs.
The sooner Britain repudiates this grossly unfair quota restriction the
better.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The cold war will end only when
Russia joins Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BORIS G FEDOROV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, After reading Judy Dempsey's report, 'Moscow 'cannot join Nato''
(September 10/11), I could not help being worried by the remarks of Mr
Volker Ruhe, Germany's minister of defence. If his opinion reflects general
feelings in the west then the cold war is not finished. If he speaks like
this in Moscow, most of our democrats and liberals will vote to increase
military spending and the armed forces (beyond the current 2.1m soldiers).
If Russia is 'different' and cannot be integrated then Nato (the EU is a
different issue) will be enlarged and reinforced against Russia, which will
then never feel secure - and naturally so. Why can we not be integrated? I
have heard such bizarre arguments as 'Russia is not European'. Sorry, but
look up the past 1,000 years of history and you will see we are more
European than the US or Turkey. Yes, we are a big country with lots of
problems but if we are incompatible please make clear by what criteria this
is so - probably it will help us domestically. But don't let there be
arrogance and short-sightedness - particularly from Berlin, which has been
forced to host Russian armies three times in not so many centuries.
I am absolutely sure that global security will be strengthened only if
Russia is integrated into Nato and our generals rub shoulders with their
western colleagues. Only then will the cold war come to a real end. Do not
forget that we have plenty of war hawks in Moscow and Mr Ruhe seems to be
intent on helping them. I think that Nato itself has to be reformed, with US
domination, which is no longer needed, scaled down and the widespread fears
of a stronger Germany dissipated. Russia's membership will help achieve just
that.
Finally, Russian democracy is still an ailing infant and sincere integration
of Russia into the European and international community can help avoid any
turning back - and disaster.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: 'The Big Picnic' in a battlefield - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Bryden's latest epic extravaganza, The Big Picnic, concerns a bunch of
Scotsmen fighting in the First World War. It has several visual wow effects,
of which the main one is that the audience moves (part of it is moved on a
vast galley lined with seats) from the 'Glasgow' end of the huge Harland &amp;
Wolff Engine Shed (in Govan, Glasgow), to the 'trench' area in the middle
(real trenches dug amid six or more feet of surrounding earth and mud), and
so into the final waste land of the battlefield itself, pitted and baked.
And it is accompanied by music of several kinds.
There are no great surprises for those of us who have heard even a little
about the Great War. We are taken through the horror of innocent young men
being killed or transformed by warfare; and we see famous events such as
Germans and British exchanging cigarettes and playing football on Christmas
Day, and also the Angel of Mons. Some of these incidents are presented
sharply enough to prompt me and other audience members to laughter or tears.
But elsewhere to yawns. For The Big Picnic keeps us in the Shed for almost
four hours. And it is woefully underscripted. (Bryden himself is author and
director.) It is astounding how often ordinary sentences or phrases are
repeated to no good purpose. 'That was the devil's work,' says Hughie
Frizell ponderously, 'the devil's work, 'cos it was murder, murder.' 'You
always know,' says Norrie Beaton lugubriously, 'you always know.' Pause.
'You always know.' Thin, thin. Thin. Also slow, slow. Slow. And heavily
amplified, so that voices usually emanate from nowhere near the actors and a
heavy echo follows every utterance.
The next problem is John Tams's music. I do not care to hear scenes of death
and battle in the Great War accompanied by sub-Elton John songs, and I think
blasts of electric guitar and drumming are a cheap way to suggest gunfire.
There is some visual excitement in the way this muzak is played, high above
the action, by a group of musicians and singers on a galley which also moves
from end to end of the action. The vocalists sing mainly slow folksy numbers
in folksy style (ie flat), but the worst element is the percussion, which
adds an appalling monotony to everything it joins.
Much better are the songs, dances and music played and performed by the
performers. In general, the performances are fine, and would be much better
if encouraged to move at twice the speed. Jimmy Logan is Colours, who turns
this bunch of volunteers into soldiers; Iain MacColl is the dour Gus Adams,
who becomes the toughest fighter of them all; Stuart Bowman plays the
half-reluctant young warrior Russell Enoch; Derek Riddell is the more
mercurial Norrie Beaton. Morag Hood and Juliet Cadzow lead the female
contingent in a variety of roles.
Oh, yes, the Angel of Mons. After Angels in America I have grown so used to
seeing angels that I feel like Joan of Arc. This one, however, is the worst
to date. With deep red hair, she hangs, usually upside down, from the
musicians' gallery - a cumbersome sensational effect trundled out for the
same symbolic effect time and time again. Her most spectacular effect is to
pick up a corpse and to bear him in her arms, as she hangs in the air, until
she passes out of sight. You just watch and pray she never drops the poor
blighter.
Show me a group of bright young Scotsmen going to their deaths, show me them
sharing cigarettes with the enemy on Christmas Day, and I blink back tears
as fast as the next person. Travel me from the Glasgow Docks to the uneven
terrain of the battlefields and trenches and I too am astounded. (William
Dudley's design is altogether the evening's highlight.) But there is an
awkward mix of sentimentality and sensationalism about all this. We watch
these young Scotsmen face the prospect of their possible deaths - and then,
ghoulishly, we zoom along to see, from ringside seats, whether they indeed
live or die. Meanwhile drums and cymbals thwack out a 4/4 beat in the air
above our heads.
At the Harland &amp; Wolff Engine Shed, Govan, Glasgow, until October 30.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: A cappella prowess and uninspired Mahler - Music in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St. John's, Smith Square was unusually well filled on Friday for music of
the past half century; for the BBC Singers were celebrating their 70th
anniversary. Not to be confused with the much larger BBC Symphony Chorus,
who are stalwart amateurs, the 24 Singers are professionals of great
technical prowess. This virtuoso anniversary programme, all a cappella,
showed them off brilliantly.
It included not only two treasures of the repertoire which they themselves
premiered, Britten's Hymn to St. Cecilia and Poulenc's war-time Figure
humaine, but a new commission from Iannis Xenakis. Sea Nymphs is a fractured
setting of Ariel's 'Full fathom five': these are plainly Cubist nymphs,
voices arranged in spiky tone-clusters, extraordinarily difficult to pitch.
(Each singer consulted his or her own tuning fork assiduously.) As a
collective feat, it was fascinating; at later performances it may even begin
to sound like fun.
Britten's twinkling Hymn could not have been feater nor more charming. The
splendid eight-section Figure humaine, a wartime plea for the Liberation,
needed only more fluent French in the quickest passages. Messiaen's Cinq
Rechants, an old BBC Singers favourite, was all colour and sexy vitality,
and in Ligeti's Three Fantasies the solo entries were as poised and telling
as the rich, aqueous choral textures (tone-clusters again, but succulent
ones). The conductor was Simon Joly, who seems able to inspire the Singers
to practically anything.
It would be hard to claim that Giuseppe Sinopoli has inspired the
Philharmonia much in the several years he has spent with them. The trouble
has not been with the orchestra. Even now Sinopoli's left hand has scarcely
any functional independence from his right, which is not very expressive
either; to weed out clotted textures, he needs recording engineers.
Sunday's Royal Festival Hall concert was fairly typical. Edita Gruberova was
originally billed to deliver several Strauss songs before the main work,
Mahler's Fourth Symphony; but her place was taken by Angela Maria Blasi, who
brought just three songs (stylishly turned, though 'Morgen' was over-slow
and 'Zueignung' over-quick). Thus we got Don Juan as a Sinopoli extra: loud
and puppy-eager, much of it an undifferentiated welter of sound through
which only the leading voices penetrated. For brief moments one heard the
Philharmonia's admirable first-desks doing their best.
The Mahler Fourth was friendly, well-meant, by turns under-pointed and too
heavily emphasis-ridden. The slow movement was at least heartfelt, though
the sudden radiant outburst near the end sounded ordinary. It took Miss
Blasi to bring the performance to real, musical life with the child's-vision
Finale, in which her knowing tact and her pleasing mezzo-ish timbre were
lovely to hear.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: A firm commitment to abstraction - William Packer
admires the work of Barbara Hepworth at the Liverpool Tate Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when the names of Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore were run
automatically together, as the joint-pioneers and life-long protagonists in
the modern phase of British sculpture. The claim was never entirely true,
the creature more of the art and critical politics of the 1930s, with
Herbert Read and Adrian Stokes the great revisionists, than the more complex
realities of the 1920s. But it served well enough in its time, and it
especially suited Henry Moore's own driven and temperamental need to be
recognised as pre-eminent in the field.
I once had the evidence direct from the great man himself, having gone to
see him late in 1976 to talk about sculpture in Britain in the 1930s and
'40s. The conversation turned inevitably to Barbara Hepworth and the nature
of whatever contribution she had made. 'Ah: Barbara', he said. 'You know, I
taught her everything she knew.'
Whether or not he really did believe so, we can never know. I rather think
he did, though as to why we can only speculate. There he was, enjoying in
his late 70s the final spectacular confirmation and celebration of his
life's achievement: and there was she, dead only the year before, and her
reputation qualified by the uncertain work of her last years, when her
health was failing and spirits low. And this was the pretty slip of a girl,
some five years his junior, whom he found a year ahead of him at Leeds
College of Art when he came back from the war, and who went on before him to
the Sculpture School of the Royal College and won the travelling scholarship
to Italy before he did.
But whatever his reasonings or feelings might have been, it most certainly
was not true. What is true is that for a few crucial years around 1930, a
time critical for each of them as they sought to establish themselves in
their careers, the ambiguous and perhaps competitive relationship they had
enjoyed as students was transformed into one of close and mutual
professional stimulation and support. There they were in neighbouring
studios in Belsize Park. The Moores were newly-married, and she then was
with John Skeaping, another sculptor whom she had married in Italy; but they
separated in 1931, after which her second husband, the painter Ben
Nicholson, moved in.
And again with Nicholson, the easy assumption is that it was he too, in that
creative menage a trois, who led her to her own commitment to abstraction.
But Nicholson, some decorative abstract exercises in 1924 apart, would not
turn to formal abstraction as such until 1933. As for Moore, he was making
some severely abstracted and surreal carvings by 1931, but they retained
nevertheless a figurative connotation, and it was not until 1933 and even
later that he made any sustained commitment to purely formal abstraction.
Even then, as he openly declared, the complete abandonment of an organic or
figurative reference was not for him.
With Barbara Hepworth, the transition from figuration into abstraction was
more or less in step with Moore's, neither leading nor following. Both, in
the 1920s, had drawn upon primitive and ancient examples, he from Mexican,
she from Egyptian carving especially, and both were now looking closely at
contemporary surrealism and constructivism, and of course at each other. But
with Barbara the commitment to abstraction, when it came, was characterised
by none of the other's equivocation and self-doubt. And though she would
return from time to time to a figurative reference, that essential
commitment to a pure and formal abstraction would sustain her all her life.
Ironically, it was her first husband, Skeaping, who in his own work withdrew
from the avant-gardism of the 1920s into a safer academicism, who had had
the most direct influence upon her, from their years together at the British
School at Rome. That influence was technical, for he was a consummately
skilful carver. It is upon her own extraordinary refinement and originality
as a carver that her reputation finally rests.
This exhibition has been beautifully chosen and installed, rightly laying
the emphasis upon her work on that human and domestic scale, at which the
artist's hand is most directly engaged with image and material together. She
was capable of working successfully at a monumental scale - her 'Family of
Man' is currently splendidly set out on the hillside at the Yorkshire
Sculpture Park - but in this, in her later years especially, and in her
modelling rather than her carving, she often seemed to lose her way.
Now the record is put straight and it is as a carver of unique sensibility
and true originality, breaking open the form and reaching into the spaces
within, that we properly celebrate her. Most of all we celebrate the radical
achievement of that first transition to abstraction, that is set out so
clearly in the first few rooms of this important exhibition.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: The Royal Philharmonic woos a youthful audience to the
Albert Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has formed a partnership with the Royal
Albert Hall which makes the RPO the 'house' orchestra of the hall,
performing there ten times in the 1995-96 season with the expectation of 40
appearances during 1997-98.
Next season's concerts are certain to go ahead but the greater commitment,
with the RPO playing roughly once a week between October and May, depends
upon raising Pounds 500,000, which will mainly be spent on marketing the
link and building up an audience.
The RPO hopes that the Arts Council and Westminster City Council will
contribute towards the investment needed. The plan is that the seats in the
Arena, where the Promenaders stand during the BBC's summer Proms, will be
priced at just Pounds 4 to attract a similarly youthful audience. If public
money is not forthcoming the RPO and the RAH will look for a corporate
sponsor.
A 'home' at the Royal Albert Hall will mark a remarkable resurgence for the
RPO, which was threatened with the loss of all its subsidy a year ago when
the Arts Council, unsuccessfully, attempted to stop funding two leading
orchestras. In the event the RPO received a grant of only Pounds 300,000
from the Council for 1994-95, less than 5 per cent of its turnover.
The RPO has since signed a sponsorship deal with Classic fm; embarked on a
major recording contract with Tring Records; and forged a residency in
Nottingham. The RPO would bring classical music to the RAH on a regular
basis outside the summer Prom season, nicely fulfilling the ambition of
Patrick Deuchar, chief executive of the Hall, to present a more structured
programme.
The orchestra would provide a range of music but concentrate on choral and
the great romantic classics, which suit the size of a hall with 5,000 seats,
of which 3,500 are available to the public.
The RPO link with the RAH fits neatly into Arts Council policy of marrying
orchestras to halls. The LSO resides at the Barbican and the LPO and the
Philharmonia are house orchestras at the South Bank.

BBC2 presents an 'Education Special' called Simple Minds based on recent
Harvard University research which shows that much science teaching is
hopelessly misconceived. Children, as we should all know, having been
children, do not have empty 'simple minds' into which logical concepts can
be poured; they have their own ideas about the world around them and how it
works, ideas that are often at odds with scientific explanations (7.20
BBC2). Cookery programmes are old hat. Now you have to do 'lifestyle' or
'culture' series, which means lots of travel and folksy wisdom, and precious
few recipes. In the first of Raymond's Blanc Mange we are told that Martin
Jarvis plays Brillat-Savarin. Oh dear (8.30 BBC2). In Trial And Error David
Jessel suggests that Sheila Bowler is serving a life sentence for the murder
ofher aunt because her unemotional manner convinced police of her guilt. He
maintains that her alleged motive would have been rejected by any crime
fiction writer as being on the thin side (9.00 C4). C4 begins 704 Hauser
Street, a latterday 'All In The Family' (11.50).

FT  20 SEP 94 / Technology: Putting people before machines - A new report
looks at why 'good' IT systems fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many 'good' information technology systems fail because technical issues are
put first and human and organisational issues second.
This is one of the findings of a report* to be published this month by
London consultants Pagoda. Other common causes of failure, according to the
report, include projects where:
The hoped-for benefits are too narrow and insufficiently tied to business
strategy;
The benefits are not communicated to staff so they try to adapt new systems
to old ways of working;
The benefits are too broad, insufficiently prioritised and may even
conflict.
Pagoda's conclusions are based on reviewing the experience of 100
organisations and on 30 in-depth interviews with big users of IT. Judith
Wainwright, a director of Pagoda, argues that the critical success factor in
implementing systems is the way the human and organisational issues are
planned; the technology is secondary.
She gives several reasons. First, IT systems are now so central to an
organisation's function that their effect is felt by most employees and,
increasingly, by customers. Second, there are fewer technical constraints
than there used to be. Third, more managers are using computers than before.
They cannot be coerced into using them, so unless they are convinced of the
benefits of a system they will not use it.
However, linking human and technical goals is not easy. The report suggests
that companies introducing new systems should at the same time consider all
other aspects of the business that are likely to be affected by the change.
This could include technology, business processes, organisational
structures, job design, staff attitudes and skills.
All should be treated within a single project plan because decisions taken
in one area will inevitably affect other areas.
Wainwright believes large projects involving change should be run by a line
manager with a senior member of staff, such as a director, backing them up.
Commitment and input to the project among the staff can be gained by
involving them in the choice and definition of the system.
Users should also work closely with prototype systems - partly-built
versions that staff can experiment on - helping to shape them. This approach
works better than basing systems on early, detailed specifications because
non-technical staff are often not good at visualising what the promised
system will look like. Then, when it arrives, they find it is not what they
wanted.
Getting users to participate in systems design takes longer but is more
likely to yield benefits in the long term. But 'even when planning and
design have been good, poor implementation can still make a system fail',
warns Wainwright. 'Implementation budgets and timescales are usually the
first to be cut. Operational and systems managers often give in to political
pressure to bring forward implementation because they feel that by then the
real work has been done,' she says.
'This reflects the common view that with IT change projects, you plug in the
system and the benefits flow - whereas wider changes are usually involved.'
The study advises companies introducing IT to keep their staff involved and
to communicate with them at all stages. Training afterwards is also
important.
According to the report, users like to discuss projects with their managers
and any staff who have experienced similar change.
Wainwright believes that a participative approach reduces the risk of
start-up problems and of project failure because human and organisational
factors are the greatest source of risk. Participative approaches to systems
change are most commonly found in factory automation projects, according to
the study, where IT makes a small but important contribution.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Technology: A new field of exploration - The oil industry
could be revolutionised by a software standards project in Houston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The half-a-dozen Texas oil men and computer industry executives sitting
round a boardroom table in Houston last week bore little resemblance to
die-hard revolutionaries.
Sipping soft drinks, their demeanour was more that of correct corporate
citizens. But their rhetoric revealed a true believer's commitment to
nothing less than the wholesale destruction of the current structure of the
world oil industry.
Their chosen weapon is a new set of software operating standards being
developed by the Houston-based Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation
(Posc), a non-profit organisation set up in 1990 by British Petroleum,
Chevron, Mobil and Texaco of the US and Elf Aquitaine of France, five of the
world's biggest international oil companies.
If implemented, the standards should ease the growing problem of data
management and incompatible computer communication systems within one of the
world's most technologically-intensive industries. And that could lead to
early cost reductions in the 'upstream' exploration and production end of
the oil and gas business.
But the real power of the new standards is that they would enable companies
to break down the barriers that have been built up over decades between the
various technical and scientific disciplines involved in oil and gas
exploration.
Posc technology can be 'a destroyer of current organisations', according to
Larry Gehagen, a BP executive seconded to the corporation. He believes that
adoption of an industry-wide computing standard will be as important to oil
companies as the adoption of a common gauge for track was to US railways in
the last century.
The result, he predicts, will be a radical restructuring of oil companies,
with whole layers of bureaucracy being abolished. It could also usher in the
era of the 'virtual oil company', in which small teams of specialists
located around the world exchange complex geological and scientific data in
near real time via information superhighways.
That prospect, according to a Posc executive, caused one Alaskan oil man to
note recently that: 'If this thing really works, one man and his dog could
develop an oil field. And you might not even need the dog.'
Several of the large computer groups and software suppliers such as IBM,
Digital and Hewlett-Packard, are co-operating with the Posc project, along
with government agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry in the
UK and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.
The need for a unified data and computer communication model for the
exploration and production industry has long been recognised, according to
Posc supporters. But attempts by companies, even the largest ones such as
Exxon, to integrate the various technical functions failed because of the
high costs involved.
The scale of the problem has been exacerbated in recent years as exploration
and production companies experienced an explosion of data from new seismic
and other scientific techniques which have been developed.
The current structure of most oil companies has also proved to be a problem.
At present, most are divided into functional departments, such as geology,
petrophysics and reservoir engineering, a structure which industry
executives say tends to reinforce existing cultural differences between the
groups. Traditionally, these departments have operated in relative
isolation, and over the years they have tended to acquire unique solutions
to their technical problems, both in terms of computer hardware and
software.
The result, according to Posc executives, is that information held by one
department is often inaccessible by, or unknown to, another. In addition,
the inability of the departments to share information without reformatting
it to different standards has reinforced a linear corporate structure. And
that has made it difficult to put in place the inter-disciplinary teams that
many industry executives believe are the most effective way to organise the
industry.
Gehagen notes that the poor standard of data management within the industry
can have expensive consequences. One company recently mobilised its
resources for an urgent seismic survey in a portion of the Gulf of Mexico in
advance of a US government auction of oil leases. At the last minute one
member of staff remembered that some years before the company had not only
conducted a seismic survey of the area, but had also drilled some
inconclusive wells before handing it back to the government.
'Eighty per cent of data held by oil companies is historical and static,'
according to Gehagen. Only 20 per cent is generally in current use, with an
even smaller amount considered as secret, commercially strategic
information.
Even so, many companies jealously guard it, although a large number 'don't
know what they have or can't find it' when they need it. All too often the
result is that geologists and other professionals can spend up to 60-70 per
cent of their time searching for information rather than using their skills
to analyse it.
One of Posc's main aims is to create standards that make consistent the way
in which the industry stores information so that it can can be used more
effectively.
Handing over the management of such technical data to an outside company
which could put it in a Posc-compatible format would save millions of
dollars a year for most oil companies, says Gehagen.
The development of such large-scale databases open to the industry would
also free the various experts within the oil companies to spend the bulk of
their time doing their job rather than tracking down data.
The opportunity to transfer data easily between disciplines could also
result in large cost savings. A recent pilot project in the US estimated
that the time taken to drill a new well in an existing oil field could be
halved if all disciplines were working to a common data model.
'Exploration and production companies continuously adopt new computing
technology,' says Bill Bartz, Posc's president. 'If they proceed without the
benefit of standards, they risk incurring unnecessary costs and experiencing
critical delays in implementation.'
It is that element of Posc technology that could propel oil companies into a
radically different future. Most have launched extensive restructuring
programmes to save costs in an era of relatively low oil prices. But they
'have slashed and burned without fundamental changes in their business
structures,' says Gehagen.
He believes that adoption of Posc standards would enable executives to make
the best use of the team structure now being promoted by many companies.
'People around the world could be much more productive if they were working
with the same underlying system.'
The adoption of Posc would also have a big impact on information technology
companies, which advise companies on how to implement such far-reaching
changes, and on the software houses that supply the industry.
The first software products designed to the new standards will begin
appearing next year, although industry experts expect it could take three to
five years to fully change over.

Lord Prior, the former Cabinet minister, is retiring as chairman of Allders,
the department store and duty free retailer that was floated last year, to
be replaced by John Pattisson.
Pattisson, 63, is a non-executive director of Wassall and Blenheim Group, as
well as chairman of Hanson Pension Trustees and Imperial Group Pension
Trust. He became a non-executive director of Allders last September, shortly
before the flotation, when Lord Prior indicated his desire to retire this
year.
Pattisson spent much of his career in corporate finance with Dawnay Day &amp;
Co, the merchant banking group, which in 1964 floated Wiles Group, the
company that is now Hanson. He served as director of many companies
associated with Dawnay Day, and became an executive director of Hanson from
1981 to 1989.
He takes the helm at Allders as it enjoys strong growth after its flotation.
Pro-forma pre-tax profits for the half-year to March 31 increased from
Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11m.

FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Pajares accepts Savoy offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Savoy group yesterday announced that Ramon Pajares, general manager of
London's Four Seasons hotel, is to become its managing director on November
7.
Pajares' appointment, while expected, will be greeted with relief by the
Savoy and its newly-constituted chairman's committee of Sir Ewen Fergusson,
Rocco Forte and John Sinclair.
The committee was set up last week after the departure of Giles Shepard as
managing director and represents a truce between the Savoy and Forte
factions on the Savoy board. Forte holds a majority of Savoy shares but a
minority of votes.
Pajares was the favoured choice of both Forte and the veteran Savoy board
members who remain after Shepard's departure. Pajares kept Savoy waiting for
a week while he consulted senior executives of the Four Seasons group, which
is based in Toronto.
While excited by the Savoy offer, Pajares found it difficult to leave Four
Seasons. He had been at the London Four Seasons (formerly Inn on the Park)
since it opened in 1970. He was then executive assistant manager and food
and beverage manager. After a spell in the Canary Islands and Canada, he
became general manager in 1975.
Born in Spain, Pajares is now well settled in London and is one of the
city's most respected hoteliers. He has received official honours in Spain;
in his adopted country he was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1988.

FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Peter Ridsdale quits QVC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Ridsdale, chief executive of QVC, the loss-making home shopping
channel, has left the company abruptly and has been replaced by Mark Suckle
who, as managing director of Perennis, his own UK-based product development
consultancy, has been associated with QVC for the past six years.
The 24-hours-a-day shopping channel went on air on October 1 as part of the
British Sky Broadcasting's multi-channel subscription package, following the
success of the concept in the US.
At the recent Edinburgh International Television Festival, QVC's chairman
Barry Diller said QVC in the UK was losing money 'like a sieve' - Dollars
15m a year. He said the channel was reaching only between 2m and 3m homes
and the cost of satellite charges was high. He added, however, that he
thought the channel would be in profit 'in a couple of years'.
According to William Schereck, president of QVC International, the decision
to change the chief executive was not a negative comment on Ridsdale. 'We
felt we had to take an opportunity to strengthen the management,' said
Schereck. Suckle, a native of Philadelphia who has lived in London since
1971 , has almost 30 years' experience in direct marketing and is a former
vice president for product development for Franklin Mint Worldwide.

Charlie Woods, a senior official with Scottish Enterprise, the development
body for Scotland, is to be chief executive of Scotland Europa, which
supports Scottish organisations in Brussels.
He succeeds Grant Baird, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief economist
who opened Scotland Europa in 1992. Yesterday Baird became chief executive
of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body which promotes the Scottish
financial services industry.
Scotland Europa, an offshoot of Scottish Enterprise, assists Scottish
organisations and companies in their dealings with the European Commission.
It can advise and represent them, give them early warning of developments
that may affect them, and also provide them with office space in Brussels.
It has had more success signing up public sector organisations than
companies.
Woods held senior posts with the Scottish Development Agency before it
became Scottish Enterprise and put together Scottish Enterprise's network of
local enterprise companies. His most recent job at Scottish Enterprise's
headquarters was director of Scottish and international operations. He is
currently in California, investigating US electronics companies, a big
source of investment in Scotland.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Business and the Law: Shrinkage at the top table - Why law
firms feel the need to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEMPORAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a shark that has to keep moving or die, there is a strong instinct and
compulsion in professional law firms to grow. Why is this? Is it simply the
egos of partners, or are there more fundamental strategic issues at stake?
'I'm not here to mark time or just collect my salary at the end of the month
and leave it at that. I want to be a part of something that will be larger
than it is now and more successful. I want to contribute to that success and
to be rewarded for it. If I can't get those things here then I will go to a
firm which can offer them to me.'
This statement, by a young lawyer in a London-based law firm, points to a
key management issue before many firms: the link between growth of the firm
and retention of highly talented, ambitious and motivated people.
To be successful, professional firms need to have people motivated to push
just that bit harder and go that bit further in meeting clients' needs.
Retaining people with these qualities and characteristics requires firms to
have the potential and willingness to grow.
There are two key reasons behind this 'growth imperative' in professional
firms: the first is the cocktail of motivational drives in professional
people; and the second is the need to sustain the profitability of the
business.
The motivation and psychological drives of professional people tend to
differ from those who follow alternative careers in quite fundamental ways.
Professional people have a greater need than the average person in an
organisation for:
influence over their own future; constantly meeting and overcoming new
challenges;
professional growth and development, to be able to handle better quality
work and clients;
recognition;
and for a feeling of value.
For many young lawyers the ultimate career prize is to become a partner. At
a stroke many of their needs are met. As partners they have a say in the
direction and thinking of their firm, and so satisfy their need to influence
their own future. It can provide new challenges, and is certainly a mark of
recognition by colleagues.
Motivating high-quality people to remain with the firm and to perform highly
therefore involves ensuring the goal of partnership is realistic and
achievable.
Maintaining this motivation requires firms to grow at a rate that results in
a steady flow of new partners, in order to convey a sense to people that
their ambitions can be satisfied.
This does not mean everyone can become a partner but it does mean the
prospect for talented people to achieve partnership must be evident. People
understand the economic reality of life in a professional firm and that new
partners can be appointed only if the business is growing. Hence if people
do not see growth, they will seek alternative routes to meet their needs.
The second explanation for the growth imperative is economic. The
profitability of most medium to large law firms depends upon having an
appropriate economic relationship between equity partners and other
fee-earners, namely its leverage. If the leverage falls below a certain
level then, assuming other economic variables remain constant, profitability
will fall.
Maintaining a steady flow of new partners requires a firm to increase the
volume of work to sustain more partners without diluting earnings of the
existing partners. For example, a firm with a leverage of 4 to 1 has to
ensure that for each new partner it brings into the equity there is enough
work to sustain another person at a partner rate and four other fee-earners.
Each new partner must generate sufficient work to maintain the firm's
leverage.
Hence one way to reconcile the need to ensure people are motivated (by
seeing that the 'ultimate prize' can be realised) with the need to sustain
the economics of the business is to maintain a reasonable growth rate.
This is not, however, an option available to every firm, and many will find
growth very difficult to achieve in the latter 1990s. An analysis of growth
rates of the medium to large firms across the country highlights quite stark
differences between the top nine City-based firms and the rest, and also
between the firms in the top nine. Growth rates among these nine firms over
the last three years vary between 5 and 32 per cent.
What are the implications for firms that cannot sustain growth comparable to
the competition's? Are they to accept that holding on to good people is
almost impossible and that they are likely lose their best people? This is
not an option for any firm wanting to remain competitive.
Even if the value of work is unlikely to grow much in the short term, the
principles governing the motivational needs of people still apply. One
short-term option for firms facing limited growth is to ensure there is a
real sense of momentum in the firm so people can see a realistic possibility
of advancement to partnership.
This requires a rigorous approach by the firm to the performance criteria
for both potential and existing partners. Firms need to engineer more room
in the partnership to allow people with the requisite qualities to become a
partner, to the extent of requiring existing partners to leave. Moreover,
the ability to expand the business through increased revenue from existing
clients or through attracting new clients must become a mandatory skill for
every partner.
Another option for non-growth firms is to enhance the effectiveness of the
organisation itself. It needs to provide people with an environment in which
they can satisfy their motivational drivers without achieving partnership.
Achieving this requires a further, mandatory ability among partners - to
provide high levels of leadership coupled with an ability to manage people
more effectively than is the case among most professionals today.
In a period of intense competition, when attracting and retaining
high-quality people is so important, it is essential that firms achieve
rates of growth equal to or above the average for those in their group. If
they cannot achieve the growth required then partners will need to change
their management style in a fundamental way. If they cannot do either, they
run the risk that their most talented people will be attracted elsewhere and
that this will trigger a steady decline in their fortunes.

Kenneth Inglis, the new broom at the top of Fleming Investment Management,
has chosen the marketing team for his first sweep. Patrick Johns, the
gentlemanly ex-Army director of marketing, has decided to consider other
career opportunities, Fleming said yesterday.
Fleming's core business, running UK 'balanced' pension assets, has been
struggling in recent years, mostly as a result of some unfortunate asset
allocation decisions in 1992 and in the late 1980s. Thus, marketing Fleming
in its core market would have been a hard sell for anyone. However. Inglis,
recruited away from Allied Dunbar where he racked up an impressive set of
investment returns over many years, has decided that a different approach to
marketing is needed.
Inglis, who has praised Johns' marketing skills highly, plans to visit
Fleming's top 40 or 50 clients himself, and personally explain the firm's
investment strategy. 'We need to have investment professionals talking
directly to clients,' he says.
Presumably, that requires having investment professionals running the
marketing team.

business - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a third of small business owners have long-term plans to sell up and
retire, according to a survey by Lloyds Bank and the Small Business Research
Trust.
Most people want to maintain their relationship with their businesses in
some form, usually working 'reduced hours' or 'visiting on an occasional
basis'.
The survey found striking differences between the responses of men and women
owner-managers. Only 20 per cent of women wanted to sell up, compared with
38 per cent of men. Some 15 per cent of women said they would 'never want to
withdraw' compared with 4 per cent of men.
The report was based on responses from 350 small businesses in the north,
the Midlands and south-east UK.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Bank charges take a
tumble - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing competition among large UK banks has driven down bank charges
over the past two years, reversing some of the rises imposed during the
recession, according to a price index published in the newsletter Small
Business Perspective.
Since June 1992, the big four banks - Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds and Midland
 -have reduced bank charges by more than 6 per cent after taking account of
inflation, it said.
The largest banks have been cutting their charges faster than the smaller
banks, although smaller banks generally remain cheaper.
'It does not mean that all bank charges are going down but it does mean  -
contrary to the general impression - that basic processing charges for small
firms, which rose during the recession, are now being driven down again by
competition,' said a spokesman for Small Business Perspective, which is
published by Graham Bannock and Partners, a London-based consultancy.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Bitten by the bug - Why
UK businesses are finding the BS 5750 quality standard increasingly catching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is something a biologist would recognise immediately: the highly
effective strategy of the virus and the chain letter. Both have an in-built
mechanism to make sure that whoever is at the receiving end of the 'message'
passes it on to at least another five or six unfortunate souls. That way it
spreads through the population at maximum speed.
Tucked away in the quality assurance standard BS 5750, or BS EN ISO 9000 to
give it its new official title, is a similar masterstroke: the requirement
that every company seeking quality accreditation must have a purchasing
procedure which examines the quality policies of its suppliers.
As a result, a July poll by the Small Business Research Trust (SBRT)
recorded a rapid rise in small business BS 5750 registrations. One in 10 had
already registered and a further 31 per cent were planning to. Most of the
companies registered because the business concerned felt under pressure to
do so.
As Reginald Shaughnessy, chairman of the committee responsible for ISO 9000
at the International Organisation for Standardisation, admits: 'Eighty-five
per cent of the use of the standard is primarily for third-party supplier
registration rather than a self-imposed internal system for quality
effectiveness and continuous improvement.'
That, complains David Martin, head of the trade and industry committee of
the UK Federation of Small Businesses, means 'BS 5750 has almost become a
licence to trade'.
Viruses breed resistance, and this one is no exception. Criticisms among
small businesses of BS 5750 are familiar. The charges include that it is too
costly in terms of consultants' fees, management time and bureaucracy; it is
unnecessary for smaller organisations where there are flatter lines of
communication; it is manufacturing-based and not relevant to services; it is
merely being used as a marketing tool; it is more of a consistency standard
than a quality standard; it encourages an obsession with processes instead
of customer focus.
'The whole approach of BS 5750 has a tendency to make you inward-looking.
Using it you can produce lousy products very efficiently,' says Martin. 'A
lot of our members say it is an absolute con-trick to force them to pay a
hell of a lot of money to consultants.'
These criticisms are by no means unanimous. According to the SBRT survey
only firms with up to four employees are strongly against BS 5750, while 56
per cent of businesses employing 20-43 staff feel it is appropriate. In
addition, a growing number of small to medium-sized service companies are
discovering benefits. Peter Brown, operations director at market research
company Harris, says BS 5750 helped the company cut rather than add to
paperwork, while Jerry Wright, managing director at recruitment consultancy
Michael Page, found that seeking accreditation forced him to improve the
structure of job interviews.
Likewise, Yorkshire-based advertising agency The Charles Walls Group
discovered it needed to tighten up its training procedures. John Oldfield,
group managing director, says: 'BS 5750 focuses the mind on processes that
everybody takes for granted - and interprets differently. Anybody who says
it is onerous is not running their business properly.'
Criticisms are at last being slowly addressed. Since April the British
Standards Institution has been applying a streamlined accreditation system
for smaller companies which it claims is 'proving very successful'.
More significantly, there are moves to change both the content and context
within which BS EN ISO 9000 operates. ISO has embarked on a review - due in
the next few years - which it says is far wider in scope. On its agenda is
what Shaughnessy calls the 'flaw in application' where the accreditation
badge is seen as more important than the commitment to total quality.
Meanwhile, a European Commission paper called 'Elements of Quality Policy'
is seeking to put ISO 9000 'back in perspective' as just a small part of
TQM. In addition, a small but fast-growing band of blue chip companies,
including parts of Exxon, Kodak, Unisys, Du Pont, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and
Southern Electric, have sought accreditation for an officially recognised
extension to BS 5750 covering marketing, sales and customer service - an
extension which its originator claims fills many of the gaps left by the
current standard.
At present, while BS 5750 has limited procedures for responding to customer
complaints and aspects of sales, it does not force the business to answer
fundamental marketing questions, says Ian Griffith, joint managing director
of Marketing Quality Assurance, the recognised BS 5750 accreditor which
developed the extension.
The questions include how the company identifies customer needs; how it
integrates these needs into a business plan; how that in turn is manifested
in a marketing strategy; the procedures used to implement that strategy and
the methods used to measure its success, including a measure of customer
satisfaction.
Griffith, who advised the DTI on its recent marketing initiative, says his
experience of accrediting companies' marketing, sales and customer service
functions reveals that small and large organisations share common failings,
such as a lack of rigour in the gathering of customer information and
feeding it into internal decision-making; a lack of agreed procedures for
segmenting markets and products, and poor internal communications between
marketers and other functions.
A few smaller companies such as Michael Page and Yorkshire-based window
fixings and fastenings firm WMS Group have already gained accreditation for
their marketing and sales. Griffith is now working on creating specific
guidelines for individual industry sectors, such as car dealers.
However, whether the combined effect of such initiatives will succeed in
winning the critics round remains a moot point, if only because experience
of implementing BS 5750 varies so widely. As David Kent, WMS group chief
executive and a self-proclaimed enthusiast of third-party accreditation
schemes, says: 'It's very difficult to put financial numbers on it. It's
like religion. You either believe in it, or you don't'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Expansion on the agenda -
Two surveys indicate recovery and growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British industry and commerce seem to be getting itchy feet. Many senior
executives are contemplating moving their headquarters to new cities as
their businesses recover and they feel constrained by their surroundings,
according to two separate surveys.
The most surprising feature of the surveys is that expansion is the biggest
reason given by companies expecting to relocate in the next five years. Over
the past few years cost cutting and staff reductions were the biggest
reasons for moving headquarters.
Neither the identity of the companies, nor the extent to which relocations
might include manufacturing operations, has been revealed. Some of the
businesses may be divisions of big groups, but many appear to be small and
medium-sized companies with an average annual turnover of Pounds 26m. The
survey by Black Horse Relocation, part of Lloyds Bank, and Management Today
magazine, shows that more than a fifth of senior executives who responded
expect to relocate in the next five years.
John Carolan, managing director of Black Horse Relocation, says: 'The
recession has not prevented new businesses from being formed or growing. A
number of these appear to have reached the size where they will need to
move. There may be some bunching with companies postponing decisions until
they feel more confident that the recovery will be sustained.'
The survey received replies from chairmen, chief executives and other senior
directors from 536 companies. More than a third cite expansion as the main
reason for moving, twice the proportion indicating restructuring or
reorganisation.
'It is the first time in the 21 years that I have been in industry that
companies have cited expansion as the main reason for moving. It is very
encouraging for the economy,' says Carolan.
A separate survey of 480 directors and senior managers by property
consultants Richard Ellis shows that 31 per cent expect to relocate their
office buildings in the next five years as a result of 'major structural
changes in their industries'. Among the most important features in choosing
a business location, according to the surveys, are quality of the local
workforce and road communications.
Property costs are regarded as much less important, says Richard Ellis. The
survey says that only half of those interviewed 'claimed they knew the
annual cost per person of occupying their present building and only 22 per
cent knew their moving costs per person'.
Quality of life appears to rate highly with executives who chose Bristol,
Edinburgh and Nottingham as the most favoured centres for locations in the
Black Horse survey. Provincial cities such as Norwich, Plymouth and Exeter
were highly regarded.
The most important personal factors in support of relocation cited by
executives include: overall quality of life (57 per cent), cost of living
(30 per cent), crime rate (29 per cent), access to countryside (27 per cent)
and the quality of schools (26 per cent).
On business grounds the main reasons cited by executives are quality of the
local workforce (57 per cent), cost of overheads such as local authority
rates (36 per cent) and availability of local customers (23 per cent).
Property costs and competitive wage rates score 21 per cent and 20 per cent
respectively.
Black Horse, which expects to move about 4,500 families this year on behalf
of companies and public-sector organisations, says: 'We are still evaluating
the results of the survey but there appears to be a new dimension to
relocations compared with the 1970s and 1980s, which mainly were concerned
with reducing overheads rather than improving the quality of the business.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Roche switches work from Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the Swiss drugs group, has switched an important chemical project
from its plant at Dalry in Ayrshire to one in France, James Buxton writes.
The switch was made even though construction at Dalry was well advanced and
output was due to start next year.
The project, to produce carotenoids - naturally occurring colourants - was a
significant part of Pounds 93m five-year investment programme by Roche at
the plant, one of the world's biggest manufacturing units for vitamin C.
Construction of the building will continue. Up to 70 of the plant's 740
employees may lose their jobs next year - when the project was intended to
start output - because of the change.
Roche decided last week to switch the carotenoid project to a newly
completed plant at Village Neuf in Alsace, across the French border from
Roche's headquarters in Basle, Switzerland.
Because there is no longer a market for the intended output of the Village
Neuf plant, it was decided to fill the gap with the project originally
intended for Dalry.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Adams attacks Major's pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's pledge to submit the outcome of political talks on Northern
Ireland's future to a referendum in the province was attacked last night as
premature and presumptuous by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president.
His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party, started the first of a series of visits to the US by senior
Ulster politicians.
Mr Hume, who is likely to meet Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, tomorrow, will
be followed by a group of senior Ulster Unionist politicians and almost
certainly by Mr Adams.
US, Irish and UK officials are understood to have been working behind the
scenes to ensure that the visits by Mr Hume and the UUP representatives
precede and have a higher profile at official level than that of Mr Adams.
The Sinn Fein leader is expected to start his US visit on the west coast
next weekend.
Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia Mr Major said the IRA was 'very close' to
providing acceptable assurances that its open-ended ceasefire was permanent.
The prime minister's remarks came three days after he challenged republican
leaders to use last week's lifting of the government's broadcasting ban on
Sinn Fein to provide the assurances he was looking for.
But Sir Patrick Mayhew, speaking in Londonderry, appeared to adopt a sterner
note when asked if he was satisfied that IRA violence was over for good.
The Northern Ireland secretary said: 'No. I do not think that we have been
given that assertion. I can only go upon the words and the deeds of those
who have used violence here in Northern Ireland for the last 25 years and
killed something like 3,000 people.' Anti-terrorist security at Belfast's
largest stores was scaled down yesterday. Staff will no longer frisk
customers and search handbags for incendiary bombs.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Full Channel rail link for cars to start in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A full Channel tunnel passenger service for drivers and their cars will be
phased in from mid-November, Eurotunnel, the tunnel operating company, said
yesterday.
Eurotunnel expects to obtain safety clearance from the intergovernmental
commission in the next few weeks, clearing the way for the long-delayed
start of its passenger shuttle service. This will carry cars and their
drivers between Folkestone and Calais.
Shortly after shuttle ser-vices start inter-city Eurostar trains will also
begin running between London and Paris and Brussels. It will be next spring,
however, before both services are operating a full capacity.
The launch of Channel tunnel passenger services has been dogged by technical
and safety problems in recent months. It had been hoped to start services
about the time of the official inauguration on May 6. Freight services have
been running since the end of May.
In the approach to the launch of the full turn-up-and-go shuttle operations
on November 15 Eurotunnel will run an 'overture' service from October 3.
This will be open to all shareholders, people in the travel trade and other
'opinion formers', although they will have to make a reservation and pay
Pounds 30 to cover administration costs. This service will operate five days
a week between 8am and 8pm.
In addition, shareholders eligible for the free or cut-price journeys under
travel privileges attached to the 1987 share offering and the 1990 rights
issue will be able use their privileges from November 15.
Eurotunnel said it had carried 10,000 cars through the tunnel in the past
two weeks as part of its testing programme.
It will be next spring at the earliest before Eurotunnel is running its full
proposed service of four shuttle departures an hour.
European Passenger Services, operator of the Eurostar trains, said that it
would wait to obtain safety clearance before announcing its fares and the
date when services would start.
It has been running four trains a day through the tunnel, carrying up to 400
members of staff for training sessions. Safety clearance would allow it to
run fully loaded trains carrying up to 800 people and to complete its
training programme.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Lecturers quit pay talks with colleges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between lecturers at further education colleges and their employers
over new contracts broke down again yesterday, with unions accusing college
principals of 'contemptuous' gestures.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education said it
had abandoned national discussions, and wanted lecturers to 'go on the
offensive locally'. Its dispute started with the attempted introduction of
new contracts last June. National talks restarted only last week after a gap
of six months.
The union said that the only offer made by the Colleges' Employers' Forum,
which has represented most colleges since they were removed from local
authority control in April last year, was to put a limit of 1,000 hours on
teaching time each year. The current maximum is 756 hours.
Mr John Akker, the union's general secretary, said: 'An enormous opportunity
has been lost and I am bitterly disappointed. The Colleges' Employers' Forum
does not appear to understand either the job of lecturers or the concept of
negotiation.'
Mr Roger Ward, forum chief executive, said lecturers offering higher
education or A-level courses would not be required to work more than 800
hours.
He added: 'Since the beginning of this dispute, regrettably, the lay
leadership of Natfhe has never produced one sensible proposal. If the
full-time officers cared to put forward a proposal I would willingly examine
it.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Health company to spend Pounds 41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare company, is to spend Pounds 41.3m on
redeveloping its medical division's Hull site.
The project, the largest single capital investment in the company's 138-year
history, is intended to increase the division's capacity substantially and
upgrade manufacturing facilities to keep pace with increasingly stringent
international healthcare regulations.
Although Smith &amp; Nephew originated in Hull and has two of its world centres
of excellence there, the company considered focusing the investment
overseas, which would have led to the gradual rundown of the Hull site where
1,200 are employed.
Mr Nick Hildyard, medical division managing director, said the Department of
Trade and Industry's offer of a Pounds 2.65m regional selective assistance
grant helped 'tip the balance' in Hull's favour. The city has Intermediate
Area status, the lower of the two grades on the DTI's regional aid map.
Mr Hildyard said Britain, while fighting hard for inward investment, had
sometimes not put enough effort into retaining investment by home-grown
companies. 'What people have perhaps missed in the hype is the leakage to
overseas locations of UK businesses,' he said.
The Hull site makes advanced wound-care products, using film, foam and gel
technology, and casting and support products for broken and damaged limbs.
Mr Hildyard said Smith &amp; Nephew was the world leader - based on market share
 -in casting and support and in the top three in wound care.
The Hull site's target is 10 per cent a year growth in volume over the next
five years through the development of new markets and new products. The
company hopes increased sales stemming from the new investment will boost
employment at Hull to 1,300 by the year 2000. Construction starts in
January.
Medical division sales have doubled in the past five years to nearly Pounds
200m. Two-thirds of products made in Hull are exported to more than 120
countries worldwide.
Mrs Maureen Foers, president of Hull Chamber of Commerce and Shipping,
welcomed the news. She said: 'If Smith &amp; Nephew have the confidence in Hull
to make this sort of investment other organisations should look very
closely.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Lloyd's is given an improved rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has been given a more positive report than a year ago by
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit-rating agency, Richard Lapper writes. S&amp;P's
annual survey of the financial stability of Lloyd's syndicates indicates
that the overall health of the market has improved in the past 12 months.
Mr Tony Evans, marketing director of S&amp;P in London, said: 'Many of the weak
syndicates have been culled, so the market overall is a lot stronger.'
S&amp;P warned, however, that it considered that 'the absolute level of Lloyd's
security is, as yet, unclear'.
S&amp;P, which first published analysis of the financial health of Lloyd's
syndicates in 1992, has made its annual survey more sophisticated this year,
increasing the number of rankings from three to five.
Mr Adrian Richards, an analyst at S&amp;P, said: 'Although a direct comparison
cannot be made between this year's and last year's rankings, generally there
is a movement from average to above-average financial stability.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Labour backed over stance
on Post Office sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal Democrats pledged yesterday to join Labour in fighting the
government's plans for Post Office privatisation.
Delegates forecast a decisive role for the party's 23 MPs as Mr Nick Harvey,
MP for North Devon, said a growing number of Tory backbenchers representing
rural constituencies were in favour of keeping the Post Office in the public
sector.
He said: 'They realise that the government risks not only destroying the
Post Office but also any hopes they may have of holding their seats at the
next general election.'
A motion condemning the proposed privatisation and calling for the Post
Office to be given access to private-sector capital to fund new development
was approved unanimously. It advocated a more 'arm's length' relationship
between Royal Mail and the government, with the Treasury entitled to a
dividend on its shareholding.
Demands that the privatised water industry should be restored to public
control were defeated after a warning that the cost of compensating
shareholders could amount to Pounds 10bn.
Mr Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro and the party's environment spokesman, said
if such a large sum were available it ought to be spent on education, the
health service, housing the homeless or creating jobs for the unemployed.
The debate was dominated by protests about the substantial increases in
water charges since privatisation and the excessive salaries and share
options obtained by executives of the water companies.
Delegates approved a motion calling for a stricter regulatory regime to
reduce 'excessive profits', and for dividend restraint.

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Party's tax strategy
thrown into confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats' attempts to formulate a distinctive tax policy were
thrown into confusion yesterday as the newly-appointed Treasury spokesman
appeared to overturn key planks in the party's latest tax and benefit
proposals.
In a conference presentation designed to cast the Liberal Democrats as a
party of low rather than high taxation, Mr Malcolm Bruce rejected a plan
from its policymaking committee to back an increase in the top rate of
income tax to 60 per cent. Instead he proposed that no one should pay a
marginal rate of above 50 per cent.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, favours a 50 per cent rate, but senior
party figures are not sure whether the conference will insist on the higher
level in a debate today.
Mr Bruce produced an eye-catching proposal to introduce a 10 per cent
income-tax band for the lower paid, compensated for in part by the
introduction of a range of environmental taxes. He said the party would seek
to take many people out of taxation by raising thresholds.
He cast doubt on a range of specific commitments in last month's policy
document - Opportunity and Independence for All - to raise child benefit by
up to Pounds 5 per week, increase in-work benefits, and provide higher
payments to the the young unemployed. Mr Bruce said all spending pledges
would be subject to a rigorous costing programme before the next general
election.
But amid confusion among delegates and some MPs about the party's tax
strategy, Mr Bruce backed plans to raise the earnings ceiling on National
Insurance contributions, a move which would raise by 10 per cent the
marginal tax rate of those on middle incomes.
Mr Bruce first suggested that those affected would be compensated by cuts in
income tax as the two systems were integrated. But he then raised the
possibility that the NIC ceiling might be kept in place. Admitting that the
party's present stance might lack 'clarity', he said that by the time of the
next general election it would produce a fully costed, itemised tax and
spending programme.
Among the new environmental taxes proposed by the party are a carbon tax
along the lines of that proposed by the European Commission, the
introduction of road pricing, a greenfield development tax, a levy on
agricultural fertilisers and pesticides and on packaging.
Mr Bruce said the money raised would be used to cut taxes elsewhere, but the
party committed itself earlier this month to using some of the income to
increase public spending.

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Campbell snubs calls for
nuclear arms ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's new foreign affairs and defence spokesman,
yesterday called for Britain to maintain its level of military spending, in
spite of traditional calls from some delegates for unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the
Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on
nuclear weapons. There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and
progressive cuts in defence spending given the end of the cold war.
But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference as they
did in the mid-1980s.
The party endorsed each proposal to maintain defence spending put forward by
Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet possible new
threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another raid' on the
defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in Northern Ireland
led to a reduction in troops there.
He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in the
former Yugoslavia. Mr Campbell said any attempt by the UN to lift the arms
embargo on the Bosnian Moslems and other factions would destroy the efforts
of UK peace-keeping troops.

<TEXT>
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday branded the Liberal
Democrats the 'scavengers of British politics', as spokesmen from both main
parties voiced scepticism about doing deals with Mr Ashdown's party, David
Owen writes.
He said the party followed 'an extreme rightwing, pretty nasty agenda' in
some parts of the country while Dame Angela Rumbold, Tory deputy chairman,
said the Liberal Democrats represented 'the left wing of the country's
voting population.'
Later, the Conservatives were quick to attack the pledge by Mr Malcolm
Bruce, Liberal Democrat tax spokesman, in effect to ditch proposals for a
top tax rate of 60 per cent on incomes of more than Pounds 100,000. Mr David
Heathcoat-Amory, paymaster general, accused Mr Bruce of a U-turn 'rapid even
by Liberal Democrat standards'.

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Activists reject idea of
pacts with Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal Democrat activists yesterday warned the leadership they would not
tolerate pre-election deals with Labour.
Amid growing controversy over the decision by senior party figures to
abandon the policy of 'equidistance' from Labour and the Tories, delegates
made clear that their implacable opposition to the present government could
not be the precursor to an electoral pact with Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour
leader.
In spite of Mr Paddy Ashdown's refusal to join the debate, four members of
his Westminster team yesterday joined those who ruled out sustaining the
Conservatives in office after a general election.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Mr Alan Beith, Sir Russell Johnston and Mr Alex Carlile
said it was inconceivable that the party could prop up a minority Tory
government.
But senior party figures bowed to grassroots pressure to dismiss any idea of
a pre-election deal with Labour.
At a fringe meeting yesterday several delegates were warmly applauded after
voicing animosity to Labour politicians on local councils.
There was little support for senior party figures - including Baroness
Williams and Lord Jenkins - who have openly supported Mr Blair's election as
leader.
The overwhelming majority of voters think the Liberal Democrats' policies
are closer to Labour's than the Tories', says an opinion poll for BBC's
Newsnight and The Independent.
The poll of more than 1,100 voters throughout Britain found people no longer
see the Liberal Democrats as 'equidistant' from Labour and the
Conservatives. But a majority of supporters of both opposition parties
oppose a pre-election pact against the Tories.

legalise cannabis
</HEADLINE>

The Liberal Democrat conference last night caused deep embarrassment to the
party leadership by calling for the use and possession of cannabis to be
decriminalised.
Members of the student wing of the party yelled delighted approval when it
was announced that their three-year campaign to get the issue debated had
ended in triumph. Decriminalisation was approved by a majority of 51 after
Mr Paddy Ashdown and other leading figures in the party had voted against.
But Mr Ashdown insisted that the party's next election manifesto would
include no commitment to the decriminalisation of cannabis.
Delegates also called for a royal commission to investigate and consider
strategies for combating drug misuse.
This was emphasised by the leadership in its frantic attempts to limit the
damage it fears the vote is likely to cause. It insisted that a royal
commission would reject decriminalisation of cannabis and other soft drugs.
Mr Ashdown said: 'The conference voted today for a royal commission on drugs
 -no more and no less.
'A royal commission is the proper and only place for serious consideration
of a number of issues relating to drugs, including the decriminalisation of
cannabis.'
Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, had pleaded in vain to the
conference 'to be responsible and vote against the soft option'. He said a
vote for decriminalisation would 'do ourselves and the country a
disservice'.
Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader, said decriminalisation would not stop dealers.
He feared that organised crime would move into an opened-up cannabis market,
or exploit the increased demand for other drugs likely to result from such a
change.

FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Campbell shrugs off
nuclear disarmament calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's new foreign affairs and defence spokesman,
yesterday called for Britain to maintain its level of military spending, in
spite of traditional calls from some delegates for unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the
Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on
nuclear weapons.
There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and for defence spending
to be reduced progressively following the end of the cold war.
But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference in the
way they did in the mid-1980s.
The party endorsed each of the proposals to maintain defence spending put
forward by Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet
possible new threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another
raid' on the defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in
Northern Ireland led to a reduction in troops there.
He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in
Bosnia, vetoing any attempt by the UN to lift the arms embargo in the former
Yugoslavia.
Mr Campbell said lifting the embargo on the Bosnian Moslems and other
factions would destroy the efforts of UK peace-keeping troops in the region.
'If it is lifted, the position of UN forces, particularly our own, will
become intolerable. Their withdrawal will be perilous in the extreme,' he
said.
Ms Liz Mayer, a delegate from Islington, north London, said Britain had to
reduce defence spending if it was to regenerate its industrial base. 'We
cannot afford not to adopt such policies,' she said.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Tawdry Trocadero rescued yet again: The troubles of a 'very
1970s' shopping complex in central London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Located just off London's Piccadilly Circus, one of the world's busiest
tourist thoroughfares, the Trocadero leisure and shopping centre attracts
16m visitors a year.
About half of them, however, spend no money there. The vast majority of
visitors stay for less than 30 minutes.
On a rainy afternoon it is not hard to see why. The Trocadero, off
Piccadilly Circus, is a tawdry and gloomy place.
In its shabby food hall yesterday the toilets were closed and staff at a
sushi bar were arguing with a customer about whether he had paid for his
food.
Today the Trocadero acquires its fourth owner in 10 years. Burford, the
property group, has acquired the centre from receivers KPMG Peat Marwick for
Pounds 94m.
Mr Nick Leslau, Burford's chief executive, plans to turn the Trocadero into
an 'urban theme park'. It will, he says, become Europe's leading
high-technology leisure centre.
Burford is negotiating with companies interested in renting the 120,000 sq
ft of vacant space at the Trocadero - about a quarter of total space.
Companies involved in the negotiations are believed to include Sega
Enterprises, the Japanese maker of electronic games, which could build an
electronic theme park in the centre.
Mr Leslau agrees that in its current state the Trocadero is 'tired'. He
adds: 'It feels very 1970s. It lacks direction.'
He insists, however, that the Trocadero should be successful. It stands on
one of the world's busiest streets, between Piccadilly Circus and Leicester
Square. About 75 per cent of the 20m foreign tourists who come to the UK
each year visit the area. Half the Trocadero's visitors are tourists.
By the time Burford has finished its Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m refurbishment
of the centre it will feel like something out of the 21st century, he says.
'It's going to have this buzz of people walking along aerial walkways and
elevators.'
Burford is respected in the City as a conservatively-managed property group.
With the Trocadero, however, it is attempting to succeed where others have
failed.
In the 1920s two restaurants opened on the site, the Trocadero and a Lyons
Corner House. Lyons, which operated both, sold the buildings in the 1950s,
after which the area steadily deteriorated.
In 1984 the Trocadero reopened as a shopping and entertainment centre, under
the ownership of Electricity Supply Nominees, the pension fund of the
electricity supply industry. The project was plagued by cost overruns.
In 1987 Brent Walker, the leisure group, teamed up with Power Corporation,
the Irish property group, to buy the Trocadero. Both companies suffered
financial damage as a result of the purchase. At the beginning of last year
the centre went into receivership. The receivers have won several new
tenants including the Planet Hollywood restaurant.
Staff at the existing attractions, such as the Guinness World of Records
exhibition and Emaginator, a simulated train ride, appear cheerful and
well-trained. Mr Leslau accepts that service throughout the centre will have
to improve.
He says Burford has the advantage of having paid a realistic price. At the
height of the property boom the Trocadero was valued at Pounds 250m.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Pension fund to sell 17 paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Rail Pension Fund is to sell 17 of the old master paintings it
bought in the 1970s when it invested Pounds 40m in works of art, Antony
Thorncroft writes.
They will be auctioned at Sotheby's on December 7 and are expected to bring
in at least Pounds 5m.
The pension fund built up a collection of more than 2,000 antiques, most of
the which were sold during the fine-art boom of the late 1980s. Once the old
masters have been dispersed there will be little left.
Against the expectations of many, art proved a good investment for the fund,
producing an annual rate of return of just under 6 per cent.
Among the paintings offered are a landscape by the Dutch artist Hobbema,
expected to make up to Pounds 3m, and a rare work by the Venetian artist
Caprioli with a forecast of up to Pounds 600,000. The fund bought it at
Sotheby's in 1979 for Pounds 55,396.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Accountants warned on skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers increasingly want qualified accountants to have computing,
leadership and communication skills rather than the traditional abilities of
a 'number-cruncher', says a survey published yesterday.
Reed Accountancy, the specialist recruitment agency, asked nearly 100
employers in the industrial and commercial sectors what they were looking
for in job applicants.
They concluded that there was a growing demand for 'thinking accountants'.
Asked to rank the importance of various qualities, nearly a quarter of
respondents said 'number-crunching' was less valued.
In contrast 55 per cent were looking more often than in the past for
industry-specific experience, 80 per cent for computing skills and 68 per
cent for leadership skills. Some 44 per cent of those asked said their
criteria had changed in the past five years.
Mr Richard Close, chairman of the Board for Chartered Accountants in
Business, and managing director finance for the Post Office, said that pure
'number-crunching' was a 'less and less valued trait' and that 'analytical
skills and objectivity' were being more highly prized.
Mr John Feear, head of the career service at the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, said accountants had to contribute more broadly to a business.
'It is not just a case of numbers for numbers' sake. There is a lot more
emphasis on commercial skills.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Consumer confidence slips back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence has fallen this month, suggesting that the recent spate
of good economic data has still not translated into any overall 'feelgood'
factor.
A survey issued by Gallup yesterday and conducted at the start of the month,
before the recent interest-rate rise, shows that 31 per cent of people
questioned expected their household's finances to deteriorate in the year
ahead.
This compares with 19 per cent who expected their household's finances to
improve. The resulting proportion of those who expected an improvement
rather than a decline is a negative balance of 12 per cent.
In August the survey recorded a negative balance of 8. Gallup said
yesterday, however, that the August figure was more optimistic than any
earlier this year.
Between February and May the survey indicated a negative balance of between
20 and 30. The last time the balance was positive was in May 1993.
The latest survey is likely to fuel expectations that consumer spending,
which provided the main trigger for the recovery last year, will slow in
coming months - not least because the impact of April's tax increases is
gradually eating into household budgets.
Most analysts say that this should lead to a 'rebalancing' of the recovery
as investment and exports start to play a more important role in it. A
report by Oxford Economic Forecasting at the weekend forecast a surge in
manufacturing and exports this year, particularly among capital goods
producers.
Nevertheless the survey suggests that the government faces a difficult task
in persuading the public that the recovery is gathering pace.
The proportion of the population who expect the economy to improve in the
next year, compared with those who expect it to deteriorate, is a negative
balance of 3 per cent this month. In August there was a negative balance of
1.
The survey shows that almost a third of respondents expect unemployment to
rise in the next 12 months - even though official unemployment figures have
been falling.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Timber groups attack grant scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A grant scheme for tree planting was criticised by timber groups yesterday
for failing to provide enough incentives for new land or money to be put
into forestry.
The Forestry Commission scheme is part of government efforts to boost
production of conifers for timber and improve woodland management.
The scheme involves an increase of at least 10 per cent in funding, although
the total has not yet been agreed with the Treasury.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the scheme particularly aimed to
ensure a steady supply of softwood for UK timber processing in the next
century. New conifer planting has fallen from 25,000 hectares a year to
about 10,500 hectares since the abolition of controversial tax incentives in
1988. Britain produces only about 14 per cent of its timber needs.
Under the scheme the grant for new conifer plantations increases to Pounds
700 a hectare, up from Pounds 615 for plantings of 10 hectares or more.
Farmers will be encouraged to turn surplus arable or grassland over to
conifers with a Pounds 200 a hectare increase in special grants for this
purpose to Pounds 600.
To improve existing woodland, the commission is offering discretionary
payments for work that leads to 'significant environmental benefits'. There
is also a new annual grant of Pounds 80 a hectare for farmers who promote
regeneration of woodland by preventing grazing.
The Timber Growers' Association, which represents woodland owners and
forestry businesses, said the package amounted to 'tinkering' rather than a
successful forestry strategy.
The association also expressed disappointment at the absence of moves to
widen forestry ownership by making it possible to buy shares in a forestry
investment scheme rather than having to buy a whole forest.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Euro-court says trial of Saunders was 'oppressive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alleged fraudsters should be treated in the same way as other suspected
criminals and not be deprived of their right to silence, the European
Commission of Human Rights ruled yesterday.
Its judgment said that the trial of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former chairman
of the Guinness drinks company, was unfair and 'oppressive'.
As expected, the commission ruled that the trial breached article 6 of the
European Convention of Human Rights because the jury heard evidence Mr
Saunders had given to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors when his
right to silence had been removed.
The judgment appears to support the interpretation of many UK lawyers that
the unique powers given to the Serious Fraud Office under section 2 of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988, which also allow the removal of the right to
silence, might breach the convention too. The commission did not mention
section 2 specifically but ruled: 'It cannot be compatible with the spirit
of the convention that varying degrees of fairness apply to different
categories of accused in criminal trials.
'The right to silence, to the extent that it may be contained in the
guarantees of article 6, must apply as equally to alleged company fraudsters
as to those accused of other types of fraud, rape, murder or terrorist
offences. There can be no legitimate aim in depriving someone of the
guarantees necessary in securing a fair trial.'
The commission restricts its criticisms of Mr Saunders' trial to the use of
the DTI evidence in a criminal court. It accepted that the 'right to
silence' was not guaranteed by article 6 and that this right might not be
unqualified.
However, the judgment says: 'The very basis of a fair trial presupposes that
the accused is afforded the opportunity of defending himself against the
charges brought against him. The position of the defence is undermined if
the accused is under compulsion, or has been compelled, to incriminate
himself.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Threat of strike at BT recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The executive of the National Communications Union is today expected to
retreat from industrial conflict with British Telecommunications over new
working patterns.
BT and the union have been in negotiation for several months about new
working patterns designed to ensure that more staff are available to
customers at weekends and in the evenings.
It appeared that negotiations had broken down after nearly three-quarters of
the 27,000 affected workers rejected the changes in a ballot.
However it now appears that sufficient common ground has been found for a
deal. A joint statement issued yesterday said: 'Both BT and the NCU believe
that they have identified the basis for a joint agreement on CSIP (Customer
Service Improvement Programme) attendance patterns.
'BT is prepared to defer commencement of phase 2 until 26 September in order
to establish whether we are jointly able to confirm that there are no
differences between the company and the NCU executive.'
The reason for the change of heart on both sides may be found in the number
of employees who had signed up voluntarily for one of the four new
attendance patterns in spite of a recommendation from the union not to do
so.
It is thought that about 40 per cent of the 27,000 workers have signed up.
That is more than the union would have liked and would have made industrial
action difficult to sustain.
But equally, a clear majority of staff have followed the union instruction -
in spite of strong pressure from managers to accept the deal - which might
have made life difficult for BT.
Under the most radical work pattern options, staff can work regular weekends
in return for a four or even three-day week and a Pounds 1,000 one-off
payment. BT also says that the options are voluntary and staff can opt to
remain on their existing hours. The voluntary status of the agreement has,
however, been questioned by some staff and union officials.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Walker regrets trusting directors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the former head of the Brent Walker leisure group,
yesterday said at his trial that he had trusted the main directors of
Goldcrest, the company's film division, to run it properly.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Walker organised the profit-boosting fraud
carried out through Goldcrest. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former
Brent Walker finance director, both deny charges of theft, false accounting
and conspiring to falsify accounts.
Mr Walker said at the Old Bailey that he placed great faith in Mr John
Quested, a former Goldcrest managing director, and Mr Donald Anderson, the
subsidiary's former finance director.
He trusted them so much that he signed documents authorising money transfers
without reading them. With hindsight, he regretted this. The trial continues
today.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Rise forecast for construction jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Employment in the construction industry will rise by 7,000 next year, ending
four years of steep decline, says a forecast by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors.
However, RICS estimates that employment in the industry is likely to fall by
a further 37,000 to 1.37m this year, a figure which includes self-employed
builders but not professionals such as architects and surveyors. About
500,000 construction jobs have been shed since 1989.
RICS also forecast that 1996 would see net job creation of only 3,000 even
though the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line will alone create
8,000 jobs in 1995 and 7,000 in 1996.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Number of new students may fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of students enrolling at UK universities this year is likely to
fall slightly compared with last year - after more than a decade of
continuous expansion - according to the Universities Central Admissions
System, John Authers writes.
Today is the deadline for new applicants to the clearing system. About
265,000 people have accepted places compared with the target of 270,000,
achieved last year. But the number of 18-year-olds has fallen by 4 per cent
so acceptances have risen as a proportion of the age group.
So far 33,600 have been accepted through the clearing system for those who
did not satisfy offers conditional on gaining specific grades in A-level
exams, compared with 35,600 at the same point last year. Admissions officers
report a dramatic slackening of interest, particularly in science and modern
languages.
Mr Tony Higgins, Ucas chief executive, said these figures might overstate
the shortfall, as they took no account of people who 'literally come in off
the street and apply direct to one university'. This practice is
particularly common at London's former polytechnics.
He attributed the slight fall in demand to the economic recovery, which had
cut the number of mature students.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Business customers given priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is telling its staff not to use the fact that
business customers are being given priority over residential customers as an
excuse to explain poor service.
A memo to regional managers from a customer complaints manager - Mr Brian
Hughes in London - says engineers should not tell customers about the
priority given to business.
It says: 'I have had several customer complaints flagged to me whereby
customers are complaining that they have been told by engineers that
business is being given priority over residential customers.
'Although I am aware that this is the case, to offer this as the excuse for
delayed or failed appointments is not helping the situation. I am requesting
your assistance to put a stop to this practice as it is only compounding an
already difficult situation.'
BT said there were certain clearly-defined areas where business customers
were favoured but added that there was very rarely a direct clash of
interests between the two types of customer.
Telecommunications analysts say the rebalancing of tariffs over recent years
has clearly favoured business customers although business does pay a higher
rental for individual lines.
One analyst pointed out that the favouring of business was not surprising.
He said: 'It is perfectly logical and proper for BT to behave like this.
They may continue to have a general obligation to all customers but business
customers are both more profitable and also much more likely to defect to a
competitor organisation.'
BT does explicitly favour business in certain areas. The BT service
commitment sets stiffer standards for business customers than for
residential. If those standards are not met it gives higher compensation to
business customers.
BT commits itself to clear up all faults within one working day for
residential customers but within five hours for business customers.
If that goal is not met then a residential customer can claim one month's
free telephone rental. A business customer can claim Pounds 25 a day.
Further compensation can be claimed if either a residential or business
customer can show actual loss incurred. But in the case of a residential
customer that compensation is usually capped at Pounds 1,000 compared with
Pounds 5,000 for a business customer.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Halifax raises interest rates to borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, yesterday raised
the standard variable interest rate it charges borrowers by 0.46 percentage
points, taking it to 8.1 per cent.
Interest-rate movements have often given financial institutions an
opportunity to widen their interest margins, but the competitive pressure on
organisations to pass on higher interest rates to investors was underlined
yesterday as National Savings announced a new issue of higher returns on its
fixed-rate products. Its variable rate products remain unchanged.
National Savings' response to the 0.5 percentage points increase in base
interest rates last Monday includes the pensioners' guaranteed income bond,
which was launched in last year's Budget. The bond was seen by societies as
partly responsible for the net outflows of retail deposits suffered early
this year.
Halifax has not yet announced the new rates it plans to offer on its savings
accounts but said it would 'pass on whatever we can to our savers'. The
society's results for the six months to the end of July showed that, like
others in the sector, its margins had narrowed since last year.
The increase in the rate paid by most of Halifax's 1.8m borrowers is the
biggest yet by a lender in response to last week's increase in base rates,
and is set to trigger rises from other lenders in the coming days.
The society withdrew its range of fixed-rate mortgages last week and is not
currently offering fixed-rate home loans.
Barclays Bank also announced an increase yesterday - of 0.36 percentage
points, taking its standard variable rate to 8.1 per cent. Last week it
announced a rise of 0.5 percentage points in some of its savings rates.
Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, and Nationwide Building
Society, the UK's second biggest society, raised their mortgage rates last
Monday - by smaller percentages than Halifax, but from the higher base of
7.74 per cent.
At 7.64 per cent the standard variable rate offered by Halifax was among the
most competitive on offer. It acknowledged that the next move in interest
rates would be upwards but said there was no need for sharp increases and
suggestions of steep rises were damaging for confidence.
It said: 'To see speculation about rates in double figures does nobody any
good.' So far, however, last week's rise had had only a 'minimal impact' on
the housing market.
Other lenders have, however, expressed greater concern about the adverse
effect of the rise, particularly given its timing at the start of the
important autumn sales period.
Monthly mortgage lending figures have given a picture of a fragile and
uncertain recovery in the housing market over the summer.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Rail negotiators look for common ground again: Long hours
and intensive debate are still needed if the dispute is to be resolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intensive round-the-clock negotiations lie ahead before any deal can be
achieved to end the railway signal workers' dispute.
It will take all the experience of the conciliation service Acas to ensure
that the RMT transport union and Railtrack find common ground.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said last night: 'A lot of
tough negotiating remains to be done.' The union negotiators want parallel
but interdependent negotiations for the signal workers - both on their 11
per cent interim claim for past efficiency gains and on the company's
proposed restructuring package for the future.
This twin-track strategy will be hard to sustain once the bargaining starts,
especially as Railtrack insists past efficiencies do not justify any extra
pay rise. Much depends on whether they can reach agreement on restructuring.
The union favours change in general but the details may prove harder to
swallow.
RMT negotiators want to ensure that the signal workers receive substantial
pay rises from the savings achieved by Railtrack through modernising working
practices that are vital to its commercial success. Each item of change
could carry a price tag.
The company says its current package would bring take-home pay increases of
between Pounds 12.65 and Pounds 16.75 a week. There would be a 6 per cent
basic pay rise, a Pounds 250 one-off supplement for accepting payment
through bank transfer and further money from restructuring to be negotiated.
Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack's chairman, has insisted that the three-month
conflict has never simply been about signal workers' pay but the abolition
of working practices, some dating back to just after the first world war.
He says: 'It is an outdated structure which is inefficient, costly and
denies our signalling employees the opportunities of a varied and rewarding
career.' RMT negotiators accept this but are not going to sit back and let
the company dictate the reforms.
Mr Horton and his colleagues intend to shake up the industry by introducing
a more professional and efficient approach to pay and productivity which
matches individual performance with reward.
They say that these changes will bring earnings rises of about 10 per cent
to three-quarters of signal workers, with basic pay increases of between 13
per cent and 26 per cent. But a quarter - mainly relief signal workers
working long hours - face pay cuts. The amount of promised cash compensation
for this group could prove a hard issue to settle.
The new deal Railtrack has in mind is already prepared for negotiation with
the RMT. The total package will be self-financing and cost at least Pounds
4.3m, although that figure is flexible and looks insufficient to settle the
dispute.
There remains room for manoeuvre in negotiations over the precise pay rises
and fringe benefit improvements signal workers can expect in return for
accepting new working practices. As they will be balloted on the final
package, this will have to be reasonably generous to satisfy those who have
suffered earnings losses of more than Pounds 700 because of the strikes.
The main areas for negotiated reform that Railtrack is pressing for involve:
Replacing a mixture of supplements and bonuses with higher basic pay, which
at present accounts for only half of take-home earnings.
A cut in the number of grades from 14 to seven, with flexibility of movement
between different types of jobs.
Job evaluation and an annual individual development review.
A maximum shift of 12 hours and inclusion of Sunday in the normal working
week. The basic working week would be cut from 39 hours to 37 hours.
Role flexibility, with signal workers performing other duties such as
clerical work, cleaning signal boxes, training, driving motor vehicles and
using a range of new equipment.
The abandonment of payment in cash, and the introduction of salaried status,
which will bring improved holiday entitlements.
Removal of restrictions on career opportunities. Posts to be filled on the
basis of suitability through aptitude testing, personality tests and
interviews.
Changes in relief arrangements. Where possible, relief staff will be
allocated to boxes, enabling each box to have its own cover arrangements.
The coming meetings cannot be leisurely. Mr Horton has talked about five
days of intensive negotiations to clinch a deal.
The signal workers stand to lose pension entitlements if an interim
agreement has not been reached by September 30, as the railway industry's
pension fund is reallocated among its employees. That prospect should be
enough to add a sense of urgency to proceedings.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Fewer foreign ships held after tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixteen foreign ships were detained in British ports in August after failing
safety inspections, the Marine Safety Agency said in its third monthly
report yesterday. In July 21 ships were held.
Many of the detained vessels revealed serious defects. The most common
problems were with lifesaving or firefighting equipment, but many ships had
faults in their radio installations or carried inadequately qualified crews.
The Nesrin A, a Turkish-owned general cargo ship, was held for 17 days
because its emergency fire pump did not work, the bridge fire alarm was out
of order, charts were out of date and a large number of its hatches were
seized up or missing.
The Cyprus-owned Concert Trader had badly corroded plating on its bow
section, sea-water contamination in its fresh-water tank and a chief
engineer who was only certified for journeys between the islands of
Indonesia.
Three of the ships held were registered under the Cyprus flag, two were
registered in Bulgaria, and the same number in Russia.
The government started publishing details of unsafe ships after an inquiry
into marine pollution incidents, headed by Lord Donaldson. Details of ships
detained are passed to 14 other European nations, allowing ships with a poor
record to be selected for future inspection.
The failure of the 'flag states' adequately to monitor the quality of the
vessels they register has led to increased action by the port states, at
whose ports the vessels call.
Four of the ships detained in August had been inspected and approved by
Germanischer Lloyd of Germany, three by Bureau Veritas of France and two
each by the Bulgarian Register of Shipping, the Russian Register and Lloyd's
Register of London. One Israeli vessel had not been approved by any
classification society.
The societies have been criticised for failing to impose strict standards
but the International Association of Classification Societies, which groups
the 11 biggest, said that under the tough conditions at sea defects could
emerge after a survey has been carried out.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Labour calls for shake-up of City regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday called for an overhaul of the UK's financial regulatory
system following the decision by the European Commission of Human Rights to
refer the case of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, to the
Human Rights Court.
Mr Saunders was jailed for his role in the Guinness takeover of Distillers.
The European Commission has supported his claim that the government's
handling of the inquiry was a breach of his human rights.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said: 'The European ruling on
the Saunders' case gives rise to general concern that this is just the
latest of a long line of problems which has called into question the ability
of the UK to police City crime.'
He also said the revelations in the Financial Times concerning Lord Archer's
dealing in Anglia Television shares - which have been the subject of a
Department of Trade and Industry investigation - 'undermines the system for
dealing with insider dealing'.
Directors of Anglia were warned in writing almost two years ago that neither
they nor their spouses should deal in the company's shares in January or
February, which is when Lord Archer subsequently placed the share orders.
Labour is calling on the government to introduce new legislation in this
parliamentary session. Mr Darling has outlined four demands:
A reformed and strengthened Securities and Investments Board along the lines
of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing regulators to
investigate allegations of insider dealing and prevent wrongdoers from
trading.
An examination of the way City fraud cases are prosecuted, including the
role of the Serious Fraud Office.
The publication of DTI investigations into politicians and the establishment
of an impartial body to decide whether to proceed with prosecution.
An end to self-regulation to restore confidence in direct regulation under
the SIB.
Mr Darling said: 'At the moment there is little chance of City crime being
detected, even less chance of prosecution, and those convicted have a good
chance of walking free from court.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Japan's profit trends boost recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of a gradual strengthening of Japan's economic recovery
emerged yesterday with figures showing better corporate profitability and a
slight improvement in monetary conditions.
A Ministry of Finance survey revealed that aggregate pre-tax profits at
Japanese companies fell by just 0.2 per cent in the three months to the end
of June compared with the same period last year.
Earnings fell for four straight years from 1990 but the survey confirmed
recent anecdotal evidence from companies that profits have hit bottom.
Manufacturers re-ported sales higher by 0.3 per cent, and profits up by 7.6
per cent, the first increase for 13 quarters. Non-manufacturers' sales were
up by 0.9 per cent, but profits fell by 3.9 per cent.
The senior bureaucrat at the Finance Ministry, Mr Jiro Saito, said the
survey was in line with recent official reports that suggested the economy
was recovering from the long recession. 'The upturn in manufacturers'
earnings is an especially bright factor,' said Mr Saito.
However, the report also pointed to continuing declines in corporate
investment. Capital spending during the quarter shrank by 16.8 per cent,
with both manufacturers and non-manufacturers reporting substantial drops.
The Bank of Japan announced yesterday that the basic measure of money supply
grew in August for the third month in succession. M2 plus certificates of
deposits expanded by 2.0 per cent in August compared with a year ago. But
officials cautioned against over-optimism; the figure is still consistent
with weak growth in overall liquidity.
Changing patterns of consumer demand were reflected in figures published by
a retailers' group. The Japan Department Stores' Association reported that
sales at stores in the Tokyo area declined by 5.3 per cent in August from a
year earlier, the 30th consecutive monthly drop. During the recession, more
price-conscious consumers turned increasingly towards discounters, away from
their traditional penchant for department stores. That trend appears to be
continuing despite a recovery in personal disposable income in the last
year.

Japan, the world's largest aid donor, yesterday said it was ready in
principle to offer 'appropriate co-ordination' to help democracy emerge in
Haiti.
The assistance Japan has in mind was unspecified. But the speed at which the
offer came, from Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, contrasts starkly with
Tokyo's once slow response to fast moving events on the international stage.
Only last weekend, it dispatched, with a minimum of hand-wringing, 470
soldiers to help Rwandan refugees in Zaire and neighbouring countries.
The Rwandan mission won praise yesterday from a visiting Mr Douglas Hurd,
British foreign secretary, who welcomed Japan's approach for permanent
membership of the United Nations Security Council.
Mr Kono greeted the last-minute peace accord between the US team and Haiti's
military regime as important progress towards restoring legitimate
government and a democratic system there.
The form of Japanese aid will depend on what the United Nations asks it to
do, added Mr Kunihiko Saito, the vice foreign minister, and Japan's most
senior diplomat.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has told western
environmentalists and activists to 'mind their own business' and not
interfere in Malaysia's development programmes.
Dr Mahathir was speaking at a ground breaking ceremony for the Bakun dam
project in a remote jungle area of the state of Sarawak on the island of
Borneo. The Bakun project, described by its developers as the world's
biggest private power scheme, involves construction of a dam nearly twice
the size of the Aswan dam in Egypt and the flooding of an area larger than
Singapore.
Plans are to transmit the bulk of Bakun's 2,400MW power output to peninsular
Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak and then through
650km of cables under the South China Sea. An area of more than 80,000
hectares, much of it tropical rain forest, will be cleared to accommodate
the dam and more than 8,000 tribes people will be resettled.
Opponents of the project say that the dam will be 'an ecological time bomb
sitting right in the centre of Borneo'. Earlier this year Dr Mahathir's
government signed a memorandum of understanding giving management of the
MDollars 15bn (Pounds 3.7bn) Bakun project to the Sarawak-based Ekran
company.
Ekran says 70 per cent of the financing for Bakun will be raised from
domestic resources and insists the project can be completed in six years,
without federal or state funds. Critics point out that Ekran has had no
previous experience in the power business.
Dr Mahathir said his government had done extensive research into the Bakun
project: 'Bakun will be a catalyst for industrial growth in the country and
in Sarawak itself.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Pro-democracy and pro-Beijing candidates do well in Hong
Kong poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong support for pro-democracy candidates and a good showing for Hong
Kong's main pro-Beijing political party were the highlights of the colony's
first fully democratic elections.
Hong Kong went to the polls on Sunday to elect 346 local government
officials in what was the first of three colony-wide polls to be held over
the coming year. After failing to agree terms with Britain, during talks
last year, Beijing has said it will annul the result of these elections when
it resumes sovereignty in 1997.
By the close of counting yesterday afternoon candidates representing
pro-democracy groups had taken nearly a third of the seats. The
Beijing-funded Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) won
just over 10 per cent of the seats.
The loser on the day was the pro-business Liberal party, which managed to
win only 19 of the 99 seats it contested. More than 150 of the successful
candidates ran as independents, underlying the essentially local nature of
the elections.
Hong Kong's Chinese language press welcomed the poll. Almost all of the
colony's leading newspapers commented favourably on the elections, with many
saying they boded well for municipal council elections next spring and
Legislative Council polls next autumn.
In all, 693,223 people voted - 64 per cent up on the vote in 1991, when
424,032 people voted. Sunday's turnout, however, represented only 33.1 per
cent of Hong Kong's registered voters and was not much ahead of the 1991
poll, when 32.5 per cent of voters cast a ballot.
The high voter turnout was attributed by some to the growing civic
consciousness among voters. Many commented on the maturity and
responsibility of voters and said they hoped China would take note of the
result when it came to establishing a fresh political order after 1997.
The pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao said the large turnout did not imply public
support for Mr Patten's reforms. Instead it concentrated on the turnout
rate. Wen Wei Po, its stablemate, had encouraged its readers to participate
in Sunday's poll by voting for candidates who 'loved Hong Kong and the
motherland'.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Flux emerges in Malaysian politics: An intense debate in the

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Locals call it the good news show. Each evening television feeds Malaysians
a series of generally upbeat items about the state of their country. The
considerable achievements of the Malaysian economy are the main focus of
attention. The activities of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister,
feature prominently.
But lately the news has been a little more subdued. While the economic
outlook, in the short term at least, appears good, Malaysians have been
puzzled to hear about the government's tough actions against a Moslem group.
They have been intrigued that talk about a sex scandal involving a senior
government figure has been allowed to surface in the official media.
There have been a series of fires at Kuala Lumpur's international airport
and two 'near misses' between aircraft. Even the weather forecast looks
worrying. Some of the worst pollution in years has clouded the skies of much
of the Malay peninsula in recent weeks and has led to government health
warnings.
Dr Mahathir and other senior figures in government have made clear signals
that a general election will be called soon, possibly at the end of the
year. There seems very little chance that Dr Mahathir, in power since 1981,
will lose his tight grip on power. But a degree of flux is evident in
Malaysia's body politic.
In June the government launched its campaign against Al Arqam, a Moslem sect
that claims 100,000 followers in Malaysia and many more in the region. In
early August Malaysia's Islamic authorities banned Al Arqam's teachings,
describing them as deviationist. Since then the government has declared the
sect illegal, launched police raids on the group's communes and carried out
a number of mass arrests of followers.
Many, particularly in the majority Malay Moslem community, question the
government's heavy-handed tactics. Mr Ashaari Muhammad, Al Arqam's leader,
had his passport revoked by the Malaysian authorities while in Thailand. Mr
Ashaari, along with at least seven followers - including his wife and
six-month old daughter - are being held under Malaysia's Internal Security
Act (ISA), which allows for up to two years' detention without trial.
The Malaysian Bar Council has protested that the ISA, which usually involves
harsh isolation treatment and round the clock interrogations, is being used
for purposes for which it was never intended and says Mr Ashaari has been
denied the right to legal representation.
Critics say there are political motives behind the move against Al Arqam.
They say Dr Mahathir had become worried about the growing popularity of Al
Arqam within his own United Malays National Party (Umno), the dominant group
in the ruling national front. Al Arqam says it is being used as a scapegoat
to take attention away from scandals and corruption within Dr Mahathir's
government.
The government says it acted against Al Arqam because the sect had strayed
from proper Islamic teachings and could pose a threat to public order. Dr
Mahathir has made a number of allegations against Al Arqam, including that
through the practice of polygamy, the sect treated women as 'little better
than prostitutes'.
At the same time and to the deep embarrassment of the government, the case
of Mr Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik hit the headlines. Mr Rahim is chief minister
of the state of Malacca and head of Umno's youth wing. Mr Rahim is under
police investigation after allegations that he sexually abused a 15-year-old
girl. He has also been accused of accumulating a vast fortune through
dubious property deals.
Mr Rahim is a leading member of a new generation of Umno personalities who
came to prominence within the party along with Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy
prime minister and Dr Mahathir's heir apparent, in elections late last year.
Dr Mahathir has been forced to suspend Mr Rahim from his official posts. Mr
Rahim was allowed to go abroad on holiday. The girl he is said to have
abused has been kept under police custody.
What intrigues Umno watchers is that the allegations against Mr Rahim have
been allowed a public airing in the heavily government-influenced media.
There are suspicions that senior figures in the party might be out to rock
Dr Mahathir's political powerboat.
Dr Mahathir faces few problems from Malaysia's weak and divided opposition
parties. But within Umno there is intense debate about the future direction
of the party. Many of the Umno rank and file say the party has lost touch
with its rural roots and is now dominated by urban-based politicians with
close links to the country's corporate elite.
Some sections of Umno have voiced concern about corruption within the party
and a nationwide cult of vote-buying called 'money politics'. Dr Mahathir
has pledged to put a stop to abuses within his own party.
Economic success has brought a large degree of political complacency to
Malaysia. But politics has been give a shot in the arm by recent events. The
evening news could be more interesting in future.

FT  20 SEP 94 / FIS boycotts Algeria's crisis talks - but not the talking:
The outlawed fundamentalists' continued contacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks aimed at finding a solution to Algeria's political crisis will open in
Algiers today but one of the country's key political forces, the Islamic
Salvation Front, will not be there.
The FIS, which was outlawed two and a half years ago after the suspension of
elections it looked certain to win, decided to boycott the talks in spite of
the decision last week by Gen Liamine Zeroual, head of state, to transfer
the party's two paramount leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, from
prison to house arrest.
Nonetheless, contacts and discussions between the fundamentalist leaders and
senior generals have never been so numerous. Most take place behind closed
doors, indeed behind prison gates, in and outside of Algeria.
FIS leaders are insisting on a number of conditions before their party joins
the talks, which will be attended by five smaller political parties.
However, Mr Rabah Kebir, the spokesman for the exiled leadership, based in
Germany, has suggested Mr Madani might be prepared to call a ceasefire
before all conditions are met.
FIS leaders first want a meeting of the party's ruling council, the Majlis
Es Shura, and to consult leaders of the Islamic Liberation Army (AIL) which
owes allegiance to the party.
'We do not wish to create difficulties for President Zeroual,' Mr Kebir said
at the weekend, 'but each party to the negotiation must be able to hold
meetings in order to represent their side.' It is 'not easy' to conduct
consultations, he added, when the telephone used by Mr Madani and Mr Benhadj
is 'controlled'.
The fundamentalists say a key precondition to such a meeting is the lifting
of the ban on the FIS. The state of emergency would have to be lifted and a
general amnesty proclaimed. The army would have to return to barracks. To
ensure such conditions are met, a 'neutral' government should be formed to
oversee a transition period necessary before new elections are held.
This is a tall order for the army's senior commanders and is unlikely to be
met in full. The past two weeks have, however, already profoundly modified
Algeria's political landscape. The two heavyweight players in the drama
which, since January 1992, has claimed at least 11,000 lives, have publicly
recognised the status of the other as a valid interlocutor.
Dialogue, if and when it accelerates, is unlikely to spell the end of
violence. The FIS will not have been surprised by the total opposition to
talks expressed by the hardline Islamic Armed Group (GIA), many of whose
leaders were trained in US-run camps in Peshawar, Pakistan, and went on to
fight Russian troops in Afghanistan.
Mr Cherif Gousmi, the GIA leader, is opposed to any 'truce or dialogue with
a renegade government, to the very idea of democracy and all those who argue
in its favour'.
Opposition to talks has also come from Mr Redha Malek, the former prime
minister, who said the release of the FIS leaders was a 'huge unilateral
concession which put the republic in danger of death'.
Mr Malek, who brokered an agreement with the International Monetary Fund,
was sacked soon after Gen Zeroual took office last winter. Mr Malek's views
are shared by groups within the country which have defended women's rights
and, what is more important, by a number of senior officers.
Some are bitterly opposed to the ideology of the FIS, others fear the loss
of the many privileges a state-controlled economy has afforded them since
independence in 1962.
Many have been forced to participate in human rights abuses that they are
deeply ashamed of, and feel betrayed by their elders. All parties to the
conflict have resorted to methods which in Algeria remind many of the
violent fight for independence from France between 1954 and 1962.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Indian industrial output rises: Jump of 8.75 per cent will
boost public support for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Indian industry, which saw production stagnate after the launch of the
country's economic reforms in 1991, is recovering sharply this year,
according to government estimates published yesterday.
The data will boost public support for the reforms among businessmen who
earlier complained at the extent of the slow-down in demand caused by
widespread economic restructuring. Executives will also take heart from
recent inflation figures which show a slowing in the rate of price
increases.
Industrial output rose 8.7 per cent in May, compared with the same month
last year, the largest monthly increase since before Mr P V Narasimha Rao,
the prime minister, launched the reforms. The jump in May followed a 7 per
cent increase in April.
The recovery is being led by a sharp rebound in the production of capital
goods, which suffered particularly badly in the early post-reform period
because the government, an important buyer of industrial equipment, cut
orders in an effort to trim public spending.
This year, private companies, intending to modernise and expand their
factories, are fuelling demand for capital goods. Capital goods output in
May was 19.6 per cent higher than in May 1993.
While the data is provisional and subject to adjustment, government
officials and business executives alike believe that the recovery is
broadly-based and expect it to continue for some time.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, earlier this month forecast
that industrial output for the year to the end of March 1995 would rise 7
per cent over 1993-94. Some industrialists foresee an increase of up to 10
per cent.
Meanwhile, government figures published at the weekend show the rate of
increase in wholesale prices, the most widely followed indicator of
inflation, fell in the week ending September 3 to 8.3 per cent, compared
with the same week in 1993 - the lowest rate recorded this year.
Inflation has slowed from a peak of more than 11 per cent in the spring,
when prices were affected by sharp increases in the cost of
government-controlled goods and services such as fuel and transport.

Iran has exported Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.01bn) worth of non-oil goods since
the start of the Iranian year in March, Iran's official news agency said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
'Iran's non-oil exports have risen by 23 per cent compared with the
corresponding period last year,' the agency said. It did not give a value
for exports in 1993 or a breakdown of different kinds of exported goods.
Mr Ali Saeedlou, head of the Export Promotion Centre of Iran, predicted that
non-oil exports by Iran, a leading oil producer and member of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would reach a total value of
Dollars 24bn in the 1994-98 period.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Israel holding secret talks over Golan
</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Israeli minister yesterday confirmed for the first time that Israel is
holding secret negotiations with Syria, with the aim of reaching a peace
accord involving an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who holds the housing and construction portfolio
and is a close aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, compared the contacts
with Syria with last year's secretive negotiations with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation in Oslo that led to the signing of the Israel-PLO
autonomy accords in Washington last September.
'Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer confirms there were secret contacts with
Syria, not at the ministerial level, but at the same echelons that led, in
his words, to the dizzying success in other peace agreements,' the radio
reported.
Over the last few weeks, the Israeli media has carried a stream of reports
of secret contacts, quoting anonymous government officials saying
negotiations are being personally overseen by Mr Rabin, assisted by the
army's chief of staff Gen Ehud Barak and intelligence chief Uri Saguy, with
Israel's ambassador to Washington, Mr Itamar Rabinovitch, and his Syrian
counterpart Mr Walid al-Muallam serving as intermediaries.
Israeli opposition leaders have charged that a deal is already close to
completion, and that Mr Rabin has agreed in principle to withdraw from the
entire Golan Heights strategic ridge in exchange for fully normalised
relations with Damascus.
Publicly, Mr Rabin has offered to sanction a 'significant' withdrawal from
the Golan, after a three-year test period of normalised relations with
Syria, but has neither confirmed nor denied that he is ready to approve a
complete pullout.
Members of Mr Rabin's Labour party yesterday held an ill-tempered debate on
the issue of the Golan, at which the prime minister and Mr Shimon Peres,
foreign minister, angrily criticised a small minority of Knesset members who
are vowing to fight a Golan pullback.
While confirming that contacts with the Syrians were taking place, Mr
Ben-Eliezer told Israel Radio yesterday that they were not at the
ministerial level.
The Israeli army has set up a unit to remove obdurate Jewish settlers from
the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights, according to the Ma'ariv
newspaper yesterday.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Fahd promises to turn to UK for 'all Saudi Arabia's needs'
</HEADLINE>

The UK will remain a key supplier of defence equipment to Saudi Arabia for
the foreseeable future, King Fahd told Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, yesterday.
In several hours of talks in Jeddah, the king and Mr Major also agreed an
outline deal for Britain to provide technical and financial advice on Saudi
Arabia's fledgling privatisation programme.
British officials and businessmen who joined the week-long trip to the Gulf
and South Africa, were buoyed by the warm reception given to Mr Major, and
by King Fahd's promise that Saudi Arabia 'will come to the UK for all our
needs'.
Mr Major is believed to have discussed a number of potential defence
contracts with the king, including a possible order for Westland's Merlin
anti-submarine warfare helicopter.
Saudi Arabia is believed to be deeply concerned about its vulnerability to a
potential threat from Iraq, which has acquired a number of conventional
submarines in the second-hand market in spite of an international arms
embargo.
The king is also said to have responded sympathetically to British
suggestions that the kingdom should buy Avro International jets for the
Royal Flight, and Rolls-Royce engines for the state-owned airline.
It is believed a bid by the Davy construction group to build a steel plant
at Hadeed was also discussed.
The Saudi government is expected to confirm shortly that it has accepted a
British offer to provide technical assistance in developing the kingdom's
plans to involve private capital in large parts of the state-owned sector.
Candidates for privatisation or partial involvement by the private sector
include the electricity industry, the state-owned telecommunications
company, petrochemicals, aviation and the road system.
Saudi Arabia has run a budget deficit for 12 years as a result of declining
real prices for oil exports and rising spending.
The kingdom is also believed to have spent most of its reserves on financing
the Gulf war.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Hurd sounds warning on protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday heard a robust attack on protectionism from Mr Douglas Hurd,
UK foreign secretary, on the final day of a four-country Asian tour. The
danger of blatant protectionism had receded thanks to the recent Gatt
agreement, but the worry now came from subtle pressures to curb the advance
of free trade, he warned.
'Now is not the time to sit back on trade liberalisation,' Mr Hurd said,
after a meeting with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, and other
senior cabinet members. New ground needed to be broken, in multilateral
liberalisation of telecommunications, shipping, financial services,
aerospace and steel.
Gatt members should ensure that the new World Trade Organisation enforced
multilateral rules, rather than sought to manage trade. Mr Hurd was critical
of pressures to use the WTO to tackle the impact of free trade on
environmental and social problems. Labour market rigidities were the main
cause of unemployment and free trade the only solution to it, he argued.
On UK-Japan trade, he welcomed recent Japanese government attempts to cut
economic regulation and open the market to foreign competition but said more
progress was needed. Mr Hurd hoped that Tokyo would broaden its military
procurement beyond the US, which accounts for almost all the foreign portion
of Japan's Y1,000bn (Dollars 10.1bn) annual defence equipment budget.
In official contacts, Mr Hurd made the case for British participation in
four large non-defence contracts, including a personal phone system to be
introduced by NTT next year. On long-standing trade disputes with Japan, Mr
Hurd said he was disappointed by remaining restrictions on foreign lawyers
and high taxes on Scotch whisky, which had kept market share at a small
fraction of lightly taxed shochu, a local spirit made of sweet potatoes.
He also called for greater foreign access to pension fund management and
insurance.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Report finds EU trade policy wanting -
'Union has exhausted capacity to expand regional trade in a significant way
for a long time'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trade policies of the European Union demonstrate blindness, according to
Patrick Messerlin, professor of economics at the Institut d'Etudes
Politiques de Paris, in a report published today by the Centre for Policy
Studies, a London-based think-tank*.
'Until recently,' argues Prof Messerlin, 'the US had no serious alternative
to a policy based on the Gatt disciplines. The strong protectionist mood
south of the River Grande. . . prevented any regional alternative. . . In
sharp contrast the EU member states could always count on freer trade among
themselves to provide additional growth opportunities.
'The situation will be reversed in years to come. The US. . . will enjoy the
relaxation that regional opportunities can offer. By contrast, the EU has
exhausted its capacity to expand regional trade in a significant way for a
long time to come. The EU - bordered on its southern and eastern flanks by
countries unconvinced of the gains from freer trade, or too small to bring
substantial benefits to the EU - will be in the same position as the US in
the 1950s and 1960s.'
An indication of the EU's failure to recognise this necessity is its
addiction to contingent protection, notably anti-dumping. Prof Messerlin
notes that dumping is found in 95 per cent of the cases investigated by the
Commission - 'a conviction rate rarely matched in other judicial
procedures'. He also points out that almost 80 per cent of cases have been
terminated by measures and that these have erected high barriers, the
average EU duty being 20 per cent.
Recent cases have been no better: of the 21 cases for which decisions have
been published in 1994, measures were taken in 19 and almost all imposed
anti-dumping duties ranging from 35-97 per cent. The Uruguay Round outcome,
though deserving of 'two cheers' according to Mr Brian Hindley of the London
School of Economics, 'comes very close to authorising the biased procedures'
used to calculate dumping margins.
'If dumping and injury can be shown whenever it suits a government to do
so,' states Mr Hindley, 'that government can also increase protection for a
domestic industry whenever it suits it to do so.' In addition, anti-dumping
actions can be discharged by 'undertakings', which are similar to the
voluntary export restraints supposedly eliminated in the Round. So 'what
becomes of the Gatt pledge to 'eliminate discriminatory treatment in
international commerce'?'
Prof Messerlin, too, gives a mixed evaluation of the effects of the Round on
anti-dumping actions by the EU. He notes that, hitherto, approval of
definitive measures in anti-dumping and subsidy cases has required a
qualified majority. 'Under the new rules, however, decisions of the Council
. . . are taken by a simple majority. Hence the votes of six member states
are now needed to overturn a definitive measure suggested by the
Commission.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Lumber producers at loggerheads over Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US timber producers have threatened to undermine one of the most innovative
parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) by challenging the
legality of the pact's dispute settlement mechanism.
The lumber industry has brought an action in the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia seeking to reverse a string of setbacks in its long
campaign against tree-cutting fees levied by Canadian provinces. The US
producers allege that these 'stumpage' fees are so low that they constitute
an unfair subsidy on Canadian softwood lumber exports.
Several panels set up under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement, on
which Nafta's dispute-settlement provisions are based, have dismissed the US
complaints. The lumber producers appeared to have exhausted all avenues last
month when a three-judge 'extraordinary challenge committee' split along
national lines in Canada's favour.
Canadian exporters have now called on Washington to refund about USDollars
600m in interim countervailing duties which they have paid pending the
outcome of the dispute.
The dispute settlement mechanism has been widely regarded as one of Nafta's
most successful innovations. Binational panels have so far reviewed about 62
cases relating to findings by US and Canadian administrative tribunals on
subsidies, anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties.
The panels' decisions are usually binding. However, the Coalition for Fair
Lumber Imports, representing US forestry companies, maintains that the panel
system violates the US constitution by diminishing the authority of the
judiciary in favour of other branches of government.
The coalition also contends that the panels are unconstitutional because
while they administer US law, the Canadian members have not been elected or
appointed by the US. It alleges that some Canadian panellists who have heard
the lumber cases failed to disclose conflicts of interest.
Mr John Ragosta, a lawyer for the coalition, said the constitutionality of
the dispute-settlement provisions were not challenged earlier as 'we didn't
have standing until we lost. You have to show you're an aggrieved party.'
However, Canadian lumber exporters have accused the Americans of being bad
losers. The Canadian Forest Industries Council said: 'The coalition filed
this lawsuit only because it lost the countervailing duty case on its merits
and, rather than admit defeat, it decided to take on the entire free trade
process.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Ship identification plan delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A British government proposal to fit automatic identification devices, or
transponders, on the world's merchant shipping fleet has been put back for a
year after international maritime experts called for further studies, writes
Charles Batchelor, Transport Correspondent.
The Department of Transport put its plans to the United Nations'
International Maritime Organisation (IMO) earlier this month; the department
wants them to be mandatory from 1999. The transponders would allow
coastguard and port authorities to identify vessels and would mean that
ships causing pollution or involved in an accident could be immediately
traced. The IMO's safety of navigation sub-committee called for further
studies of the legal and technical implications of the plans and will look
again at the proposal in a year.
'We will have to see how this initiative fits in with other conventions such
as the UN Law of the Sea which guarantees vessels unrestricted free
passage,' an IMO spokesman said.

Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications conglomerate, has won orders worth
more than Dollars 550m in Malaysia, one of the world's fastest growing
telecommunications markets, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. The group
announced two contracts over the weekend: the biggest, worth MDollars 1.3bn
(USDollars 507m), is for the design, supply and installation of a public
switched wireless network to be delivered to Syarikat Telefon Wireless, a
privately owned Malaysian company; the second contract, worth MDollars 112m,
involves the supply of digital telephone equipment to Celcom Cellular
Communications, Malaysia's biggest cellular operator with more than 350,000
subscribers nationwide.
Nr Vijay Kumar, Syarikat's executive director, said the first phase of the
Ericsson system would be installed on the resort island of Langkawi, off the
west coast of the Malaysian peninsula. Celcom Cellular said it wanted to
start offering subscribers a digital service through its existing network by
next year. Malaysia is one of the company's top 10 markets and over the past
five years Ericsson has been the main supplier for Celcom's existing
analogue network.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Greenspan calls for freer banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve board, yesterday renewed
his call for Congress to do away with the remaining barriers that cut US
banks off from the rest of the financial services industry.
He said that banks should be given broader authority to sell insurance
products, and urged the abolition of the Glass-Steagall act, which stops
commercial banks selling or underwriting securities.
'Insurance sales are virtually riskless, and our experience over several
years with Section 20 affiliates (banks' securities subsidiaries), and the
increased dealing activities in derivatives, securities and foreign exchange
suggest that the risks resulting from repeal of Glass-Steagall are largely
manageable,' Mr Greenspan told a financial services conference run by Boston
College.
He said that there should be only two tests of whether to let banks enter
new businesses: whether the activity improves the deployment of assets,
capital and human resources to meet the public's need for financial
services, and whether the risk is acceptable.
Although banks have taken advantage of new technologies to serve their
customers, Mr Greenspan said he was concerned that they 'may be reaching the
limits' in their efforts to do so.
Mr Greenspan's call was seen yesterday by some in the banking industry as an
attempt to set the agenda for the next stage of US banking reform, after the
passage through Congress this month of the inter-state banking bill.
This measure, when it has been signed into law by President Bill Clinton,
will let banks open or buy branches more freely outside their home states.

FT  20 SEP 94 / FBI and UK police combine: Task force will try to tackle
offshore financial crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US and officers from the UK
police's New Scotland Yard have joined forces to create a task force aimed
at tackling white-collar crime emanating from British offshore territories.
The White Collar Criminal Investigations Team was set up in January to
investigate fraud and money laundering which affects the British dependent
territories in the Caribbean. Two UK officers have been assigned to the
FBI's base at Miami, Florida.
The move comes as the UK government seeks to encourage its territories to
change laws allowing company owners to hide behind nominee names. Such rules
make the work of criminal investigators almost impossible.
Mr Tony Baldry, a UK Foreign Office minister, is to bring a series of
propsoals for discussion with the heads of government of the territories
when he visits the Caribbean next month.
International business companies, as these shells are called, have been used
by money launderers as part of a complex finanical network through which
funds cannot be traced.
According to one estimate by British intelligence, some Dollars 500bn
(Pounds 322bn) may have been 'laundered' worldwide last year.
The territories and the UK government have been working together to crack
down on criminal activity for some time. However, the territories are
particularly sensitive about the rules regarding IBCs, which are substantial
revenue earners for such entities as the British Virgin Islands.
The creation of the task force is disclosed in a documentary, Dirty Money -
Islands of Secrecy, to be screened tonight in Britain on BBC-1 television,
describing the role played by offshore centres in financial fraud. More than
60 per cent of the world's money is believed to be held offshore.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Chretien launches drive on separatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, is launching an offensive to
defuse Quebec's drive towards independence.
In a speech delivered in Quebec City yesterday, he outlined several federal
government initiatives and said he intended to campaign vigorously for
national unity ahead of the independence referendum which the francophone
province's newly-elected separatist government has promised to hold next
year.
The Parti Quebecois won 77 out of 125 seats in last week's provincial
elections in Quebec. PQ leaders indicated during the campaign that they will
seek to persuade Quebeckers of the advantages of independence by
relentlessly pointing out the inefficiencies of the present federal system.
The first front in the referendum campaign opened yesterday with the recall
of Parliament in Ottawa. The Bloc Quebecois, the PQ's federal counterpart
which holds 54 seats in the House of Commons, is expected to use its
position as the official opposition to press the separatists' case on the
national stage.
Mr Chretien said that the federal government would release long-awaited
proposals in the first week of October to overhaul Canada's costly
social-security system. He also promised an 'economic update' later this
autumn, which is expected to outline a range of measures to bring down
public spending. According to Mr Chretien, sweeping changes will be unveiled
to eliminate and scale back some government programmes, and transfer others
to provinces, municipalities and the private sector.
Despite reports that the government is far off-target in meeting its
deficit-reduction goals, Mr Chretien reaffirmed that it would do 'whatever
is necessary' to bring the federal deficit down to 3 per cent of gross
domestic product in the year to March 31 1997.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Progress among the plagues: The new administration in
Honduras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Guillermo Molina, the Honduran planning minister, says: 'It's something
like the seven plagues of Egypt.'
The country is undergoing a crippling energy crisis, water shortages, a
drought that has devastated grain production, and a spreading cholera
epidemic.
Energy is rationed between six and 14 hours a day, and the blackouts have
set off a crime wave. Industrial production has contracted, investment is
stagnant, foreign reserves have dried up, and economists are predicting
negative growth this year.
If all that is not bad enough, the government wants to raise taxes to cut a
growing budget deficit, and to release finance from the International
Monetary Fund and the other international financial institutions. Its
proposal will be put to Congress, which will be returning to work today
after the independence day break.
The proposed measures are aimed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 11.6 per
cent to 7.5 per cent of GDP. They include a 1 per cent capital tax, a
widening of the scope of value-added tax, a tax on luxury goods, and a 10
per cent tax on interest from bank deposits.
The tax increases are required before Honduras can sign a letter of intent
with the IMF. That will open the possibility of Dollars 700m (Pounds 451m)
in debt relief from Paris Club sovereign creditors, and allow the
disbursement of up to Dollars 300m this year in loans from Washington-based
financial institutions, which have been held up.
The measures have elicited widespread initial opposition from unions and
professional organisations, which say these will further harm the 80 per
cent of Hondurans in poverty.
Also, the measures lack the support of a majority in congress, although
business has made a late rally in the government's favour.
Success in congress may depend on the government's ability to make clear
that prospects for the country are far more dismal if the package is not
passed.
Officials say the government will be unable to meet its foreign debt
commitments and would be declared ineligible for loans from the institutions
on which it is heavily dependent.
'The central government does not have the necessary resources to meet its
obligations,' said President Carlos Roberto Reina in a televised address
last week, when he attacked his predecessor, Mr Rafael Callejas, for
mortgaging the country's future.
Officials of the ruling Liberal party have complained that the economic
crisis is a legacy from the previous government, which abandoned fiscal
discipline in an attempt to get re-elected, ran up the deficit and
artificially held down prices in the months before the election last
November.
Sharp price increases this year will push up inflation to about 36 per cent,
from 12 per cent in 1993, say economists.
Mr Reina has found it difficult to sell what is effectively another
structural adjustment plan when Hondurans have fresh memory of a harsh
economic programme introduced by the last government. He not only lacks the
support of the opposition National party in congress, which sees the package
as a vote-loser, but must persuade a sector of his own party which has
little appetite for a widely unpopular measure.
If the economy slides further and social tensions rise, Mr Reina risks a
reversal of the successes of his government so far, say observers.
'The story on civil-military relations and human rights is exceptionally
good,' said a senior western diplomat. 'It would be a tragedy for Honduras
if support from the international community were to fall away.'
Mr Reina has delivered on his promise to abolish forced military recruitment
by pushing through a bill in May, despite ferocious opposition from the
powerful military who have acted with almost total autonomy. It awaits
ratification in the next session of congress, from January.
He went over the heads of the armed forces to appoint his own candidate to
head Hondutel, the national telephone company, which is run by the military,
and has said he wishes to privatise it.
His government has also overseen the establishment of a new investigative
arm of the police which will be under the control of a new civilian public
prosecutor, after the disbandment of the DNI, a notorious, military-run
police force accused of numerous violations by human rights groups.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Washington opposes suit over Brazil debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US government has stepped in to oppose a lawsuit filed by a big US
family investor seeking repayment of Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 900m) of bank
loans to Brazil, bought in the secondary market.
The investor - the Dart family whose fortune derives from the invention of
the polystyrene cup - refused to join a Dollars 52bn bank debt restructuring
accord completed in April.
The Dart suit, filed in US federal court in Manhattan, among other things,
seeks payment of interest arrears.
Washington's statement of interest argues: 'The US has a strong interest in
encouraging voluntary restructuring of sovereign debt' and that a successful
claim by the Darts 'would serve to undermine that interest'.
It said that the US had in the past sought to discourage the use of the
courts by debtor governments, so as to encourage negotiation over voluntary
debt restructurings. It said, now that a secondary market in such debt had
developed (its turnover last year was Dollars 1,978bn), it did not want to
encourage creditors to use the courts.
However, lawyers for the Darts are likely to argue that the statement refers
to only one of the eight counts cited by the Darts - that of accelerated
repayment. They may also argue that the US government position undermines
the rights of investors who bought their loans in the secondary market, and
that a judgment in its favour would hurt secondary market prices for bank
loans.
Last week, the presiding judge dismissed a request from the Darts' lawyers
for summary judgement in the case and said she would consider a motion to
dismiss on the grounds that the eight counts have legal defects. If she
fails to dismiss the case, the Darts' lawyers will elaborate their claim on
October 7, and the Brazilian government will respond by October 28.
Under the 1988 agreement covering the bank loans held by the Darts, holders
of more than 50 per cent of the loans could demand immediate repayment from
the Brazilian government. To prevent the Darts from using this clause -
after all other creditors had converted their loans in the 1994 agreement,
the Darts would have been the biggest holders - Braslia made sure that the
state-owned Banco do Brasil kept a larger holding of the 1988 loans. The
Darts argue this is improper.
Angus Foster reports from Sao Paulo: In a move that marks a setback for the
government, Brazil's car workers went back to work yesterday after
manufacturers and unions had agreed at the weekend to a one-off payment to
solve the week-long dispute.
Workers will receive a special bonus equivalent to about 25 per cent of this
month's salary. Manufacturers also agreed to bring forward the annual pay
round for many workers, now to take place in November instead of April.
The government, worried that pay rises will fuel inflation in its new
currency, the Real, had sought to delay wage increases as along as possible.
Government officials have said they will try to stop companies raising
prices so soon after the Real's launch. But manufacturers have promised the
government that the one-off payment will be paid for by productivity gains
and will not be passed on through higher prices.

FT  20 SEP 94 / US warned of health reform need
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior US budget official warned yesterday that, although no healthcare
reform bill was likely to pass through Congress this year, the need for
reform had not gone away.
'It obviously does not look like we are going to be successful this year,'
said Mr Robert Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office, an
independent agency which has been charged with checking the arithmetic of
all the competing US healthcare reform plans.
But Mr Reischauer, speaking at a conference at Boston College, warned that
effective reform of the healthcare system remained essential in order to
keep the cost of healthcare from continuing to erode US disposable incomes.
The chances of completing such a large and controversial piece of
legislation in the three weeks before the end of the present congressional
session seem - to most observers - to be virtually non-existent.
However, Senator George Mitchell, Democratic majority leader in the Senate,
and some centrist senators from both parties have continued to work on a
possible compromise bill.
Although Mr Reischauer has made clear, over the past year, his own
commitment to reform of healthcare in the US, his agency's assessments of
the competing reform plans have contributed to congressional unwillingness
to act on health reform this year.
The CBO's assessment, for example, of the comprehensive reform, presented a
year ago by President Bill Clinton, concluded that the plan could achieve
its aims by guaranteeing universal health coverage, but would cost much more
in the near term than the administration had calculated.
Instead of cutting the federal budget deficit by Dollars 60bn (Pounds 39m)
over the next six years, as the administration estimated, the plan would
increase the deficit by Dollars 70bn, the CBO said.
Republican right-wingers such as Senator Phil Gramm, who have been fighting
against healthcare reform all year, declared the issue dead some weeks ago.
Also, some left-wing advocates of reform, such as Congressman Jim McDermott,
worried that anything now likely to pass both chambers of Congress might do
more harm than good, have given up the idea of acting this year.
Even so, some Democrats want a bill of some kind to come to a vote, if only
so that they can pin the blame for failure on their Republican opponents.
'They've killed reform. Now we want to make sure their fingerprints are
found at the scene of the crime,' one Democratic staffer said.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Haiti: US troops land in full strength

The first US troops landed in Haiti yesterday in an operation that closely
resembled the invasion they had planned to carry out just hours earlier.
'The most important differences are that we are not having to make a forced
entry, we will not have to do it in the middle of the night, and we will not
have to use our paratrooping forces to do it,' said Mr William Perry, the US
defence secretary, in a briefing just after the invasion was called off.
The original plan called for six paratroop battalions from the 82nd Airborne
division to attack the Port-au-Prince airport, while Army and special forces
landed by helicopter to secure the southern half of the capital.
At the same time, a force of more than 1,500 Marines planned an amphibious
landing on Haiti's north coast, taking over Cap Haitien and other towns.
Instead of a parachute landing, troops from the 10th Mountain division
landed by helicopter at Port-au-Prince airport.
Around 3,000 US troops were expected to be in Haiti by the end of yesterday,
with the number rising to around 15,000 by the end of the week.
'We have, of course, the assurance of the Haitian government, but we do not
believe we should have our troops depend just on that assurance, and so
therefore they're going to go in in strength and fully armed,' Mr Perry
said.
In all, the US has had around 15,000 troops stationed off the coast of Haiti
in a fourteen ship fleet, including the aircraft carriers Eisenhower and
America and the amphibious command ship Mount Whitney. Vessels from
Argentina and Canada have also been in position off Haiti.
Around 2,000 troops and personnel from as many as 24 other countries are due
to join the US-led task force. Countries contributing to the force include
Caribbean nations such as the Bahamas, Barbados and Jamaica, Latin American
and European detachments and large contingents from India and Bangladesh.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Haiti: Haitians wonder, What next? - James Harding joins a
bewildered crowd watching the Americans fly in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charlie said his friends, standing bewildered on the quayside across from a
US aircraft-carrier in Port-au-Prince harbour, did not like him speaking
English. 'They want me to speak Creole or French, but I like to speak
English because Americans is raining down in on the city,' the former
tourism operator said.
Most people, unsure whether the last-minute deal by the US and Haiti would
stick, contained their enthusiasm. As the US troops arrived - not in a
shower of paras, as the delighted Charlie described, but in a swarm of
helicopters flying low over the bay to the civilian airport north of the
city - Haitian heads lifted from their daily business. Neither in
celebration nor defeat, most appeared to be wondering: 'What next?'
The mood on the streets changed throughout the day. At dawn, before the US
troops landed, the marketplaces bustled. The men carried baskets of disweet
(flat-square bread), the women sold papaya and avocados, and the stores
offered soft drinks and plastic trinkets that had squeaked through the
two-year-old economic blockade.
By midday, however, the spirit of business as usual gave way to nervous
confusion and the streets were almost empty. Confidence returned with the
evening as thousands of Haitians lined the shore to watch the US naval
flotilla and wave upon wave of helicopters.
Because of the economic embargo, which has increased the price of staple
foodstuffs threefold and petrol 15-fold, the arrival of the Americans has
come as a relief to many.
'When I saw President Clinton, I said 'God bless you' to America. This has
gone on too long,' said Moise Herbert, a driver in the Haitian capital.
'This is the last chance for Haiti to be born again. We can't take more than
we already have.'
His friend, Pierre Joseph, a supporter of the ousted president Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, was sceptical. 'Cedras said he would leave before in October and
now he is saying again he would leave in October. We don't believe him.' He
was referring to the last US-brokered agreement with the army chief, Lt-Gen
Raoul Cedras, in 1993 which provided for the military to step down and
Father Aristide to return.
If the future of Gen Cedras, the police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois, and
General Phillippe Biamby was unclear yesterday as more and more US military
personnel arrived, the threat they posed to the Haitian people seemed to be
receding.
Some people, who complained of the junta's reign of terror, now saw no need
for a witch-hunt. One man said: 'Cedras could stay if he wants because he is
in his country, but he doesn't matter now.'
One thing all agreed on was relief that there had been no hostile
intervention. Zachary, a relief worker, said: 'You've got to think it's good
 -there's no blood.'
But, warned Zachary, there were still dangers. He did not believe the
Haitian military would disobey Gen Cedras if he had accepted the agreement,
but said there could still be casualties.
For example, 'if one of them (the Haitian soldiers) does not know how to
carry a gun and a bullet just takes off', he said, waving his arms in all
directions. The possibility of guerrilla warfare is another unknown. US
officials do not rule it out.
Testing the temperature of popular sentiment is difficult. The walls of the
capital are covered with anti-Aristide and anti-intervention graffiti, such
as 'no to Aristide - Aristide is Castro', and '1915 (the first year of a
two-decade US occupation) - never again'. Whether these, like the small
groups of anti-US protestors outside the palace over the last few days, are
an outpouring of public feeling or commissioned by the military is not
clear.
Honest comment has been further skewed by the arrival of thousands of
journalists to whom Haitians, for a fee, are happy to give a big smile and a
pro-American soundbite.
With so many questions unanswered - not least how many US servicemen will
stay and for how long - the Clinton administration may find Charlie's
expectations worrying. Asked what the US-led forces should do in Haiti, he
said he wanted them to run the country.
'The city is too dirty, there are no roads - the Americans could do
everything. I like the Americans to stay for all time - forever.'

FT  20 SEP 94 / Haiti: Stubborn Carter saves Clinton's bacon - With 15,000
troops in Haiti the US has the means to enforce the compact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would take a great stretch of the political imagination even to suggest
that former President Jimmy Carter and his team of US negotiators in Haiti
have saved the current presidency. But they certainly seem to have helped to
give Mr Bill Clinton as optimal an outcome as he could reasonably have
expected well into an agonising Sunday afternoon.
Mr Clinton could certainly claim yesterday his order to begin the invasion
was the last straw that broke the back of the resistance of Lt Gen Raoul
Cedras and General Phillippe Biamby to agree to step down from power.
But it was Mr Carter's stubborn insistence to continue talking in
Port-au-Prince long after he was due to leave and even after the White House
advised him to get out that made possible the denouement.
Equally, it was Mr Carter's determination to obtain a Haitian political
imprimatur from acting president Emile Jonaissaint, a man whose legitimacy
the US government has not even recognised, that was in the final hour vital
to the accord. It was Mr Jonaissaint's emotional declaration 'we must have
peace not war' that helped persuade the military men not to disobey their
civilian leaders, according to Mr Carter.
In effect what the US team, which also included retired General Colin
Powell, previous head of the joint chiefs of staff, and Senator Sam Nunn,
chairman of the armed services committee, brought about was Governor's
Island Revisited - a close replica of the July, 1993 agreement under which
the military junta agreed to relinquish power.
The difference - and it is huge - is that the presence in Haiti of an
occupying force of 15,000 US troops means that the US has the means to
enforce Sunday's compact.
The agreement itself leaves some hostages to fortune. It does not require Lt
Gen Cedras or Gen Biamby to leave Haiti, as demanded by President Clinton.
Its promise of amnesty may leave members of the local military and
commercial elite free to make mischief on President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's
return.
Even Mr Carter conceded the agreement was not binding on junior officers or
'attaches', the freelance thugs with close ties to the military who have
replaced the dreaded Tonton Macoutes of the Duvalier regimes.
The agreement contained no reference to Fr Aristide, though perhaps it did
not need to. Initial reaction from his advisers - and on the streets in
Miami - was not favourable, mostly because of the prospect of the junta
getting off scot-free and, possibly, remaining in Haiti.
In a fascinating CNN interview yesterday morning, Mr Carter offered many
insights into his extraordinary two days in Port-au-Prince, demonstrating
yet again the strength of his independent streak and the remarkable rapport
he seems able to establish with the most improbable negotiating partners
(among them over the last year the late Kim Il-Sung, the North Korean
dictator, and Muhammed Farah Aideed, Somali warlord).
The US, the UN and countries beyond number have condemned the military junta
for their appalling violations of human rights in Haiti. But Mr Carter
countered that 'it's a serious violation of inherent human rights for a
citizen to be forced into exile'. General Powell reported, more practically,
that at no stage had Gen Cedras asked about the terms, financial and
otherwise, of exile.
Mr Carter was even dismissive of US government officials, including Mr
Warren Christopher, now secretary of state and the departmental number two
in his own administration, who have said there was no alternative but exile.
The Governor's Island agreement, he pointed out, was also signed by Fr
Aristide and would not have forced the junta physically to leave the island.
The US official attitude, Mr Carter said, failed to understand the mindset
of the junta as military men and self-perceived patriots. The former
president paid particular tribute to the arguments deployed by General
Powell in this respect. He also said that the wife of Gen Cedras ('one of
the strongest and most powerful women I've ever met') had played an
influential role after he had spoken to her at length on Sunday morning.
Throughout the interview, Mr Carter displayed considerable understanding of
the complexities of Haitian society and its fledgling political system. He
could not even guarantee parliament would pass the amnesty law, since 40
pro-Aristide members are themselves in exile in Miami. But the October 15
deadline could not be avoided by the junta.
The agreement - and yesterday's apparently trouble-free US military landing
 -should bring political relief to Mr Clinton at home, where the prospective
fully-fledged invasion remained unpopular.
The presence of General Powell in the delegation - another suggestion from
Mr Carter eagerly taken up by Mr Clinton - provides a degree of political
cover for the president against Republican criticism. The general's
political neutrality is legendary but Republicans increasingly claim him as
one of their own, largely because of his service under presidents Reagan and
Bush.
In the short term, the agreement and the US occupation also removes all
threat of a congressional vote of disapproval against US policies in Haiti.
The Democratic leadership immediately began moves to get both Houses to
approve the Sunday agreement and to express support for the US military
mission. This will pass.
It will not, however, subdue for long persistent reservations about Mr
Clinton's foreign policy decision-making processes, which, even over Haiti,
are widely seen more as crisis-driven than the product of a strategic plan.
There appear to have been some sharp divisions in the administration,
investigations of which are certain to feature in the media. The position of
Mr Anthony Lake as national security adviser seems most vulnerable.
Nor can Mr Clinton expect much lift from public relief at November's midterm
elections. In 1962, predicted steep Democratic losses were much reduced by
the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis but that happened only a week
before voting. A better comparison may be 1978 when Mr Carter's Middle East
peace accords produced instant political benefit that mostly faded by
polling day.
But, for the moment at least, Mr Clinton's agonies are less. He did take the
fateful step of ordering US servicemen into a combat mission for the first
time in his presidency but then was able to recall them before they landed.
That outcome seemed inconceivable four days ago; it was even in doubt on
Sunday evening.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Haiti: 300 years of violence, and misbegotten intervention -
Haiti's troubled history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just 700 miles from the coast of Florida, Haiti is the poorest country in
the western hemisphere.
The average Haitian has just 75 US cents a day to live on. According to the
World Bank's yardstick, anyone living on less than a dollar a day is
suffering dire poverty.
Haiti is an enclave of African-style poverty in Washington's backyard. The
UN Development Programme calculates that, in terms of the quality of life of
its citizens, Haiti ranks 131st out of 173 countries, just ahead of Zambia.
Yet Haiti was once France's richest colony, furnishing two-thirds of its
overseas trade. Rich with plantations of coffee, cotton, indigo and sugar
cane, it supplied Europe with half its tropical produce.
The intervening 300 years tell a tale of appalling government, misbegotten
foreign intervention and violence.
An almost unbroken line of blood connects the arrival of Christopher
Columbus 502 years ago to the present day. Within 50 years of the
navigator's arrival on the island of Hispaniola, which today French-speaking
Haiti shares with the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic, the estimated
half million Arawak indians had perished, and the pre-Columbian culture had
all but vanished.
It was in Haiti that Columbus is thought to have established the first
European settlement in the New World, 500 years ago this year. When he
returned 11 months later, the settlement had been razed and his men killed.
Haiti provided the world's single example of a successful slave revolt.
After 12 years of struggle, Haiti became independent from Napoleonic France
in 1804, so becoming the first 'third-world' country.
France finally recognised Haiti in 1825, extracting in return a huge
indemnity which remained a burden on the economy for decades, and left
French financiers in positions of influence for almost a century.
Washington put in place a trade embargo in 1806 and the country was not
recognised by the US for almost 60 years, with Washington fearful of the
impact a successful revolt would have on its own slave population.
Recognition was not achieved until the middle of the US civil war in 1862.
Between 1849-1913, US Navy ships entered Haitian waters 24 times with the
stated objective of protecting American lives and property. In 1915, fearing
German rivalry in the Caribbean, and amid a Haitian political crisis, the US
invaded. Its forces stayed for 19 years.
The Americans built 1,600 km of roads, telephone exchanges and medical
facilities, but few of these lasted much beyond an ignominious withdrawal.
There were longer-lasting legacies. The racism of US occupying forces is
widely seen at the root of the development of noirisme, nationalist
black-oriented political thought, of which a leading exponent was a black
medical doctor named Francois Duvalier.
Duvalier, a minister in the late 1940s, was elected president in what was by
Haitian standards a reasonably free and fair election in 1957. Duvalier -
'Papa Doc' - sought to limit the influence of the army, the Roman Catholic
church and the US, and to reduce the political and economic power wielded by
the minority mulatto community.
Haiti's white plantocracy - the French aristocratic slave owners - were
expelled by the revolution. But its spiritual descendants remained in a
mulatto oligarchy, that even now - in co-operation with the black-dominated
army - continues to dominate the economy and politics.
Duvalier subdued the army with the creation of a black militia, the National
Security Volunteers, which became known as the Tontons Macoutes. He put to
shrewd use voodoo, a synthesis of African belief and Catholic ritual that
attributes the events shaping people's lives to myriad spirits. As a belief
system, it is held to limit the responsibility believers feel for their own
actions, and partly explains the lack of cohesiveness of Haitian society.
According to Elizabeth Abbott, the author of a 1988 book on Haiti, Duvalier
studied 'voodoo with as much devotion as an houngan (voodoo priest), and
then twisted it and used it to keep an entire population at his pitiless
mercy'.
Life under Papa Doc quickly degenerated into violence and murder. By 1963,
the US ambassador had been expelled, and one year later Papa Doc made
himself president for life. The dynasty lasted until 1986, when his son
Jean-Claude flew to exile in France. Baby Doc had taken over on his father's
death in 1970. The Duvalier fortune was by that time estimated at Dollars
500m - although now Jean-Claude is reported to be penniless.
Baby Doc's exit was followed by several months of violence as people rid the
country of signs of the dictatorship. The army took over but was eventually
forced by popular pressure to concede elections, held on December 16, 1990.
The victor, a radical priest, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, won 67.5 per cent of
the vote against 14 per cent for his nearest rival. He presided for only
seven months before a military overthrow on September 30, 1991.
Evidence emerging since the mid-1980s suggests a strong link between the
Haitian military and the trafficking of cocaine from Colombia into the US
through Port-au-Prince. This may be one explanation for the tenacity with
which the army has held on to power in the face of US threats. 'President
Aristide is right when he says that one of the reasons the Haitian military
will not let go is that their lifestyle depends on the drugs trade,' US
Senator John Kerry said last year.

Franco Moschino, one of Italy's leading fashion designers, died on Sunday,
aged 44, after a long illness, his fashion house said yesterday. He had
surgery for an abdominal tumour two years ago and had battled against
illness since then. News of the designer's death was withheld until
yesterday to allow his funeral to take place in strict privacy. Moschino
studied at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. He began his career as a
freelance illustrator for designer Gianni Versace's fashion house in 1974.
He launched his first collection in 1983. He was an 'enfant terrible' of
Italian fashion, poking fun at the fashion world and becoming renowned for
outrageous ensembles. He once designed a ball gown of garbage bags.

Unions at Skoda Automobilova, the Czech car maker which is part of the
Volkswagen group, have threatened strike action after the company said
yesterday it intended to lay off 800 workers by the end of the year in an
effort to increase competitiveness. Skoda said the redundancies were
necessary to help it 'slim a little' and become more competitive on the
world car market. But the Czech-Moravian council of trade unions said it
would support the unions at Skoda if workers at the company's main Mlada
Boleslav plant north of Prague voted for strike action. Mr Jiri Hrabovsky, a
Skoda spokesman, said unions and management would meet tomorrow to try to
resolve the dispute, which threatens to delay the introduction of Skoda's
new compact car, the Felicia, due to begin production next month.

Hungary is to privatise 25 per cent of each of its five regional gas
distribution companies this autumn, the state holding company AV Rt said
yesterday. It said it would hold an international tender for the companies -
which serve domestic gas users outside Budapest - in October or November
with a view to selling the 25 per cent stakes this year. Registered share
capital of the five companies is Ft44.5bn (Pounds 264m). Mr Peter Mihalyi,
deputy privatisation commissioner, said gas privatisation would be followed
up with the sale of a stake in the country's electricity company next year.
He added that the government planned to present a new privatisation law to
parliament next month to merge the SPA and the State Holding Company,
Hungary's two privatisation bodies, into a single body. Another aim of the
law would be to make sale procedures more transparent to counter popular
suspicion of corruption and influence-trafficking in privatisation.

<TEXT>
Ukraine's non-convertible and volatile currency, the karbovanets, lost 16
per cent of its value on the open market over the weekend.
The fall has been blamed on parliament's release of credits to the
agriculture sector last month. Farm credits will push inflation up from 2.6
per cent in August to above 18 per cent this month, said Mr Viktor
Youshchenko, central bank governor. Ukraine is set to initial an IMF letter
of intent within two days and a final agreement should be finalised at next
month's IMF summit, if certain reform conditions are met, western diplomats
and aid officials said yesterday. The IMF policy prescriptions will increase
inflation in the short run but the Dollars 700m loan will ease pressure by
backing up national bank reserves and help cover Ukraine's widening balance
of payments and budget deficits. An agreement also would open the doors to
Dollars 4bn in western aid - including Dollars 400m from the World Bank for
critical goods such as pharmaceuticals.

Portugal's central bank yesterday cut two important money market rates by
half a point in a reversal of the European trend towards higher interest
rates. The Bank of Portugal lowered the emergency lending rate for overnight
funds from 12 to 11.5 per cent and the liquidity absorption rate from 9.25
to 8.75 per cent.
The variable repurchase rate for seven-day funds was cut by 0.25 points to
9.25 per cent. Falling inflation, a lower fiscal deficit and a stable
currency have enabled the central bank to cut money market rates gradually
since they were reintroduced in early July. They had been suspended two
months earlier to help fight speculation on the escudo. The central bank's
decision to cut the compulsory cash reserve requirement for banks from 17
per cent of deposits to 2 per cent from November 1 should lead to further
rate cuts.

The German economy is growing without inflationary problems, according to
separate reports published yesterday by the Bundesbank and the German
economics ministry. The reports agree that the 2.8 per cent growth in gross
domestic product in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, was
unexpectedly strong. They added that favourable orders, industrial
production and housing construction point to a continuing upward trend.
Citing favourable implications of Germany's moderate wage increases, the
Bundesbank foresees an export-led recovery, but calls for continued
vigilance on wages to keep inflation down, currently 3 per cent in western
Germany and 3.4 per cent in the east. An August survey of 400 companies by
the Ifo economic research institute was also upbeat. Companies surveyed
expected a 2.75 per cent increase in production this year and 3.5 per cent
in 1995, as well as strong growth in the investment goods sector.
Although these assessments will help Chancellor Helmut Kohl's campaign for
the October 16 elections, neither of the official reports had good news on
the jobs front. Unemployment rose sharply after the west German economy fell
into recession last year and despite recent growth and moderate wage claims,
jobless totals have so far failed to drop.

Russian inflation will 'inevitably' rise sharply in the last months of this
year, according to Mr Andrei Illarionov, a former economic adviser to the
prime minister and head of the Institute for Economic Analysis. Mr
Illarionov said it would rise from under 4 per cent in August to 7-8 per
cent in September and move higher in the last three months of the year,
reflecting the steep growth of credits in the summer. Mr Illarionov said
that the government has so far this year issued credits totalling
Rbs25,000bn (Pounds 6.8bn). He said inflation had been kept low because the
velocity of money had fallen - but this could be expected to be temporary.
However, figures produced by the Centre for Economic Performance, headed by
Prof Richard Layard, of the London School of Economics, shows that real
consumption has risen by 10 per cent during the year to July and that the
real income of households has risen by 18 per cent in the same period. Prof
Layard said the recorded fall of 24 per cent of industrial production
compared with a year ago was 'difficult to reconcile with the consumption
data'.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Danish consumer prices rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Danish consumer prices increased by 0.4 per cent from July to August and by
2.2 per cent over the 12 months to August, according to the Official
Statistical Office. The 12-month rate of increase was the highest since
early 1992. Half the increase from July to August was caused by a
normalisation of clothing and footwear prices following sales in July. A 10
per cent increase in the price of coffee and other food prices explained
most of the rest of the increase. In July 1993 the Danish inflation rate was
the lowest since the 1950s at 1.2 per cent. This year, under the impact of a
fast growing economy and a boom in consumer demand, the rate of inflation
has begun to move up.
Austrian consumer prices rose in August by 0.6 per cent and by 3.2 per cent
year on year.
Spain's industrial production index rose 8.4 per cent in June 1994 from June
1993.
The Dutch producer price index for manufactured goods rose a provisional 0.1
per cent in July from June, giving a 0.2 per cent rise year on year.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UN threat wins pledge from Bosnian Moslems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations said yesterday it had won a promise of restraint from
Bosnia's Moslem leadership after making an unprecedented threat to call down
air strikes on government forces in Sarajevo if they continued to fire on
the Serbs.
The promise was made by Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, and his
military commander, General Rasim Delic, at a meeting with General Sir
Michael Rose, the British commander of UN forces in Bosnia.
Earlier, Gen Rose said he held government forces responsible for provoking
an upsurge in fighting on Sunday, when the Bosnian capital saw its most
serious shelling for the past seven months.
The general told a Reuter correspondent in Sarajevo that he had warned the
government forces they would face Nato air power unless they desisted from
their attacks immediately.
While Nato made limited air raids on Bosnian Serb positions in April and
August, this was the first time it has been suggested that the air power of
the alliance could be used against Bosnian government forces.
Gen Rose, who has used an adept mixture of brinkmanship and bluster to face
down all parties in the conflict, would be straining his personal authority
to the limit if he invoked air strikes against the government, which enjoys
widespread sympathy among politicians in the west and the Middle East.
However, officials at Nato headquarters - who in the past have deplored the
UN's caution in using air power against the Serbs - said there was no reason
in principle while the air power of the alliance should be directed at one
side only.
The surge in fighting takes places against a background of increasing
friction between the five countries - the US, Russia, Britain, France and
Germany - which are supposed to be co-operating to establish a peace
settlement in Bosnia.
Tension between the US on one hand and the all European powers on the other
has been mounting ahead of October 15, when the US administration will start
the process of lifting the ban on supplying arms to the Bosnian government.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Lies, statistics and Spanish phone tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If Spain's struggle to contain rising prices was not difficult enough, a
public row between two cabinet ministers about how the national statistics
institute does its inflation sums is proving equally embarrasing to the
government.
Financial markets were shocked last week when the statistics institute, the
INE, reported that prices in August had jumped 0.6 per cent to give a
year-on-year headline inflation rise of 4.8 per cent and an accumulated one
of 4.3 per cent.
But the jitters among bond traders paled against the raw nerves that
surfaced in government circles.
The economy and finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, is embarrassed because
his 3.5 per cent inflation target for the end of this year is now well
beyond reach and the transport and communications minister, Mr Jose Borrell,
is furious because a change in telephone charges, which he had ordered
before the summer, was blamed for the rise.
Mr Borrell, a mathematician who takes pride in his numeracy, claims that the
inflation effect of a July telephone tariff revision that cheapened the
price of long distance calls and made local ones more expensive was
'neutral' and contributed a mere 0.02 per cent to August's inflation.
The statistics institute, however, appears convinced that most Spaniards use
the phone to chat to their next door neighbours.
The institute insists that the overall cost to consumers of the tariff
revision was 14 per cent and that the new charges pushed the consumer price
index up by 0.2 per cent.
'If we wanted to look like a banana republic, we couldn't be going about it
better,' said a senior economist at one of the major domestic banks. 'Here
nobody knows what to believe because we have lies, statistics and telephone
tariffs.'
Vowing that 'heads will roll' over the row and that he will change the
telephone charges again if they turn out to be so inflationary, Mr Borrell
wants the INE, which is controlled by the economy and finance ministry, to
reveal how it assessed the impact of the tariff revision.
The transport minister was nevertheless rebuffed yesterday when the
institute said it had used the revised tariffs supplied by the national
telecommunications company and that its use of the data was 'a statistical
secret'.
Mr Solbes, who is both worried about the credibility of Spain's
macro-economics figures and highly concerned that high inflation will derail
his attempts to cut government spending, is understood to be torn between
upholding the professionalism of his statisticians and wishing that their
computations gave him a rosier bottom line.

Fears that Sweden's new Social Democratic government would not be strong
enough to push through tough spending cuts yesterday alarmed financial
markets.
The weak electoral showing by the Liberal party also disappointed the
markets, where it had been hoped its influence would strengthen the
government's resolve to push through strong measures to tackle Sweden's
yawning budget deficit.
'This is the worst possible scenario,' said Mr Christian Diebitsch, analyst
with Kleinwort Benson in London. 'We have a weak left-wing government which
isn't strong enough to implement spending cuts on its own and a Liberal
party which isn't strong enough to support them.'
He said the market was looking for a budget strengthening package of between
SKr100bn (Pounds 8.3bn) and SKr150bn, compared with the SKr61bn package
outlined by the Social Democrats before the election.
In early market reaction, long-term interest rates rose, share prices
tumbled and the krona weakened, before rallying.
The general stock exchange index closed 0.38 percentage points lower at
1424.9.

FT  20 SEP 94 / New Swedish model halted by the old: The shift from
welfarism to liberalism appears to have been stopped in its tracks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fundamental shift from state welfarism to market liberalism that Mr Carl
Bildt, the outgoing prime minister, so fervently believed he had wrought in
Sweden over the past three years appeared yesterday to have been stopped in
its tracks.
Instead, the Social Democrats - 'the barons of the old order', as Mr Bildt
likes to call them - were back holding the reins of power as they have done
for 51 of the past 62 years.
The general election on Sunday produced an unmistakable swing to the left in
Sweden which suggested the electorate had rejected the reforms of the
welfare state Mr Bildt's right-centre coalition had pushed through in the
face of the country's deepest recession since the 1930s.
The Social Democrats, led by former prime minister Ingvar Carlsson, returned
to government, thanks to an eight-point swing in their favour, with 45.6 per
cent of the votes. Behind them the former communists of the Left party won
their best result since 1948. Together, the two traditional allies jumped
from 153 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag to 184.
At the same time, the Environment party, which supports Mr Carlsson as prime
minister, returned to parliament with 5 per cent of the vote, which gives
them 18 seats.
The non-Socialists slumped dramatically. Only Mr Bildt's conservative
Moderate party, with 22.3 per cent of the votes, won more than it did in
1991.
The leftward tide goes further: the Social Democratic party today is in some
respects more left-leaning than it was during its last spell in government
from 1988 to 1991.
A key figure on the right of the party, Mr Kjell-Olof Feldt, who as finance
minister presided over important reforms such as big cuts in income taxes
and deregulation of financial markets, has left the scene, along with a
number of influential advisers. Today, the parliamentary party, half its
members women, is more dominated than ever by public sector workers and
professionals who are likely to resist cuts in the welfare state needed to
tackle the country's big budget deficit.
But senior Social Democrats insist the picture of a resurgent left is
misleading. Mr Jan Karlsson, a member of the party's economic policy team,
said the election result was more of a protest vote against Mr Bildt than a
positive vote for the left. 'The picture is very middle of the road,' he
said.
Party officials point out that the three top figures steering the party  -
Mr Carlsson, Mr Goran Persson, the finance spokesman, and Ms Mona Sahlin,
the party secretary - are from the right and fully appreciate the need for
stringent fiscal policies to tackle the crisis in the public finances.
Mr Carlsson, who will be 60 in November, succeeded the late Mr Olof Palme in
1986, and has held the Social Democrats to a pragmatic path, presiding over
such changes in policy as the party's swing to supporting Swedish membership
of the European Union. Mr Persson is set to be the key figure in economic
policy. It was he who outlined the Social Democrats' SKr61bn (Pounds 5.2bn)
election pledge to stop the growth in the public debt by 1998 through a mix
of tax increases and spending cuts. He says he will take tougher action if
required.
Mr Carlsson has set his face clearly against depending on the Left party -
or the Environment party - for support on economic policies. Instead, he
indicated yesterday he would seek co-operation with parties of the former
government on the economy.
This is based as much on realism as sentiment. With Sweden committed to
joining the EU and depending to a large degree on foreign investors to
finance its debt, the government has little choice but to meet the loud
demands coming from the financial markets for a tough fiscal policy.
The lingering question, however, is the extent to which the Social Democrats
are prepared to go to restructure the heavy imbalance between the public and
private sectors in Sweden, where public spending accounts for 70 per cent of
gross domestic product, easily the highest in the leading industrial
countries.
Reforms undertaken by Mr Bildt, such as privatisation, deregulation of the
telecommunications and broadcasting markets and the introduction of
competition in schools, childcare and the healthcare systems, are unlikely
to be reversed. The Social Democrats accept that the battle against
unemployment - at a record 14 per cent - must be fought through private
sector job creation.
But the party retains a deep philosophical attachment to the 'old order' of
universal public welfare that underpins, in Mr Carlsson's words, 'a society
where there are no great differences between the working class and the upper
class.
'We want social security guaranteed for all.'

The Swedish Social Democratic party's general election victory may prove to
be a turning point in the successive referendums for Finland, Sweden and
then Norway to join the European Union.
The Social Democrats are believed to hold the key to a Yes vote in Sweden
because to date more than half their supporters have been shown by opinion
polls to be against membership. Now in government, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the
party's leader, will seek to persuade his voters that EU membership is a way
to advance social democratic policies, particularly the fight against
unemployment. The electorates in each country are closely following opinion
in the other two, reflecting a widespread desire that that the three should
stay in step.
Therefore, the election of a Social Democratic government in Stockholm has
long been seen as a virtual pre-condition for a Yes vote in Sweden and could
help stiffen the Yes side ahead of the vote in Finland and, if Finland and
Sweden vote to join, in turn influence Norway's sceptical electorate.
Finland will vote first, on October 16, followed by Sweden on November 13
and Norway on November 28 on whether to accept agreements already negotiated
with the EU on terms for membership. A Yes vote would mean the three will
join Austria as new members from January 1 next year, expanding the EU from
12 to 16 members.
But the outlook for the three referendums is still far from clear. In
Finland, considered the likeliest of the three countries to vote in favour
of membership, opinion polls have recently shown strong gains for the No
campaign, with the lead held by the Yes camp narrowing to as little as two
percentage points.
In Sweden, the signals are mixed. After two years in which the No side has
held a steady lead, two recent polls, including one held among voters on
election day, have shown a majority in favour.
The election-day poll suggested that 51.8 per cent of voters were in favour
of joining the EU and 45.5 per cent against. But another poll published
yesterday showed the No campaign widening its lead slightly over the past
month to 52 per cent, against 48 per cent in favour.
The Social Democratic party deliberately avoided making EU membership an
election issue for fear of alienating voters who identify the EU with Mr
Carl Bildt, the strongly pro-Europe leader of the outgoing right-centre
coalition.
The election delivered the No side an important boost through increased
representation of the former communist Left Party and the return to
parliament of the Environment party - both are strongly anti-EU.
All the polls in Norway suggest that the Yes campaign has almost no chance
of succeeding unless Finland and Sweden vote to join first in their
referendums. If they do, the indications are that Norway may also follow its
neighbours into the Union.

FT  20 SEP 94 / European banks issue Emu warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European banks warned yesterday that European monetary union (Emu) would be
impossible before the next century because the banks would require at least
five years to plan for a single currency after the Emu starting date was
announced.
The warning came as EU finance ministers admitted that all but two EU
members were in breach of the Maastricht treaty's rules on excessive
deficits and government debt, two of the most exacting criteria for
achieving Emu.
Members of the European Banking Federation said that they had warned the
European Commission that the switch from fixed exchange rates to sole use of
the European currency unit (Ecu) would require longer than officials
anticipated. The federation is currently surveying banks in EU member
countries in order to provide evidence to the commission that Emu will take
several years to implement. The results of the survey should be presented by
the end of the year.
The Emu timetable calls for 'rapid introduction' of the Ecu as the single
currency following the start of the third stage of Emu, when exchange rates
are locked. This is due to take place between the start of 1997 and the
start of 1999.
Mr Alan Kettley, chairman of the federation's committee on Emu, said that
commission officials appeared 'still wedded to their timetable' but banks
were trying to persuade them that the technical changes required were too
large.
Mr Kettley said that banks would prefer a 'big bang' approach, under which
participating countries switched from their domestic currencies to the Ecu
rather than having a dual currency system for a period to smooth the way.
He said that large retail banks would require the most time to make
technical changes such as altering cash machines and computer software.
It would be bound to take much longer than switches such as British currency
decimalisation. Leaders of the British Bankers' Association said that they
would prefer the UK to participate in monetary union because it would help
banks.
EU ministers yesterday accepted a commission recommendation that only
Ireland and Luxembourg fulfil the criteria which call for annual deficits to
be less than 3 per cent of GDP and accumulated debt to be less than 60 per
cent of GDP.
The commission will offer recommendations for corrective action to the 10
other EU members at a meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg on October
10. But ministers may split over whether to publish the recommendations.
Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said he favoured
publication as a means of stepping up public pressure on government; but Mr
Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said it was a matter for the Council.
Mr Waigel, who chaired the meeting in Brussels, said the fact that states
were willing to submit to the 'excessive deficit' procedure underlined a
consensus for reducing public borrowing and managing national finances
responsibly.
The agreement to remove Ireland from the excessive debt procedures came amid
recognition that it has made considerable progress in reducing its stock of
debt, from around 116 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 89 per cent of GDP this
year.
Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said the Dublin government was
determined to be in a position to join the first group of countries trying
to create a single currency before the end of the century.

FT  20 SEP 94 / US troops fly in to control Haiti: Signs of co-operation by
junta raise hopes for success of occupation mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US troops yesterday spread out unopposed around Port-au-Prince, the Haitian
capital, after completing the first stage of a mission President Bill
Clinton defined as 'limited in time and scope'.
By last night 3,000 troops were expected to have arrived. Signs that Lt Gen
Raoul Cedras, the republic's military ruler, was co-operating with US
military commanders in ensuring an uncontested US landing fuelled hopes in
Washington for the success of the operation to restore democracy.
Retired general Colin Powell, previous head of the US joint chiefs of staff
and a key figure in the negotiating mission led by former US president Jimmy
Carter, said this was early evidence that the military junta was prepared to
live up to the letter of the agreement.
The deal between the US delegation and the Haitian military rulers was
reached at the last minute on Sunday night local time, as the first US
airborne invasion troops were on their way to Haiti from their bases. It
stipulated that the members of the junta would quit no later than October 15
and paved the way for what it is hoped will be a peaceful intervention in
Haiti by US forces.
The first US troops from the Tenth Mountain Division landed by helicopter
from the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower. US officials said 15,000 troops,
the maximum deployment envisaged, were expected to be in position by the end
of the week.
A succession of helicopters, followed by fixed-wing aircraft, swung low over
Port-au-Prince bay and skimmed over the tree tops into the civilian airport
north of the city.
Gen Hugh Shelton, commander of the US armed forces in Haiti, landed to
discuss with Gen Cedras the details of co-operation between the occupation
force and the Haitian military. He emerged from the meeting saying that 'the
Haitians are our friends'.
The general's emphasis on co-operation was echoed by US helicopters which
circled over the city with loudspeakers blaring in Creole, 'This is not an
invasion, we are here to work with the Haitian army. This is not an
invasion'.
In Port-au-Prince, the streets emptied during the day as people retreated to
their homes amid widespread anxiety about the US operation. However, by
early evening thousands of local people gathered at the port, lured by the
military spectacle and emboldened by the US presence. The crowd chanted
calls for the return of Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted as president in
the 1991 coup. They were chased away by Haitian police armed with clubs and
semi-automatic weapons.
In Washington, Mr Clinton stressed that the force's immediate mission was
'to make sure the leaders keep their word'. The president and members of the
US delegation acknowledged that the agreement placed the junta under no
obligation to leave the island.
This has caused open concern among advisers to Mr Aristide. Mr Randall
Robinson, the Washington human rights activist whose hunger strike this year
influenced US policies, said the agreement was 'terribly flawed'.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, questioned why General Cedras
was 'allowed to stick around until October 15, maybe stay in the country and
maybe run for president next year'.
But Mr Clinton and Mr Carter pointed out at a joint press conference that
the Governor's Island agreement of July last year, also designed to ensure
the restoration of democratically elected government but never honoured by
the junta, would not have forced them into exile.
'I think they probably will leave - and should leave,' Mr Clinton said, 'but
this still has to be worked out by all the actors in the Haitian problem.'
The agreement was greeted with huge relief in Washington, where a fully
fledged invasion was widely opposed.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Britain's outlook 'best for 50 years' says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, GILLIAN TETT and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JEDDAH, LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The economic outlook in Britain is the best for nearly 50 years, Mr John
Major, the prime minister, claimed yesterday.
In a clear attempt to reap a political dividend from the recent steady
improvement in most indicators of economic performance, Mr Major used a
speech to British businessmen in Saudi Arabia to set out his most optimistic
assessment of the economy since the end of the recession.
But as an indication of the difficulty the government faces in persuading
the electorate that the recovery is under way, an opinion poll yesterday
showed that consumer confidence fell back earlier this month.
The survey, conducted by Gallup before the base rate rise last week, showed
that the proportion of people who believed the economy was improving fell
slightly this month compared with August. Less than a fifth of households
expect their household budgets to improve this year, the poll also found,
suggesting that there is little likelihood of an inflationary consumer boom
later this year.
Mr Major, however, yesterday insisted that the UK was at 'a historic turning
point' in its economic performance. 'We are now standing at the threshold of
an economic recovery unlike any that we have seen since the second world
war. We are determined that this is going to be a recovery without
inflation, a recovery that will last, a recovery for the long term,' he
said.
UK officials said the prime minister's bullish tone was partly intended to
reinforce his upbeat economic message to King Fahd, delivered during several
hours of 'very friendly' talks. The Saudi government is an important
purchaser of UK government debt, and its willingness to remain in the market
is regarded as an important indicator of the overseas credibility of British
economic policy.
However, Mr Major's positive message was also an attempt to reverse the
trend of many opinion polls which suggest that the economic recovery is not
being translated into an increase in support for the government. He brushed
off last week's half point rise in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent as a
necessary measure to hold down inflation.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday described the rate rise as a
pre-emptive strike aimed at protecting a non-inflationary recovery. He ruled
out early tax cuts and pledged to stick to his policy of reducing public
borrowing.

FT  20 SEP 94 / Rail union backs talks but calls new strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three-month rail dispute edged closer to a settlement last night when
the RMT transport union executive endorsed the call for negotiations made at
the weekend by the union's signal workers' conference. But it also announced
further days for disruption.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said he was contacting the
conciliation service Acas to prepare for talks with Railtrack on a
restructuring package and on the union's claim for past efficiency gains.
'These will be conducted in parallel,' he added. 'We shall be talking to
Acas about the most practical way of making progress'.
The move followed the unanimous weekend decision by signal workers to call
for talks on future restructuring for the first time in the dispute, while
continuing to press their pay claim for past efficiency.
Railtrack, the state-owned company which runs the rail infrastructure, said
it was 'keen to resume talks on restructuring to resolve this damaging
dispute as soon as possible'. The negotiations are likely to start
immediately.
Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, which operates rail services,
welcomed the RMT executive's decision last night.
'It is a very hopeful sign,' he said. 'This is obviously a delicate stage
and it is important each side enters this with a desire to reach agreement.'
He added: 'The strikes have gone on too long and have caused a lot of
damage. Many jobs are involved and many customers have been seriously
inconvenienced.'
However, the RMT executive also announced that Friday's planned one-day
strike by signal workers would go ahead, and called for a further stoppage
by signalmen from midnight on Wednesday September 28 to midnight on Friday
September 30.
'At this stage it would be premature to consider lifting industrial action,'
said Mr Knapp. Railtrack said it was 'extremely disappointed' that the union
had 'chosen to further threaten the public with two further days of
unnecessary action'.
The RMT executive committee plans to step up the industrial conflict if no
progress is made in the parallel negotiations. The final package will be
presented to the signal workers for their approval in a postal ballot.
In a related development last night the union executive announced a 24-hour
stoppage on the London Underground for September 30 after a postal ballot of
union members rejected a 2.5 per cent pay offer and voted for strike action
by 2,072 with 809 against.

FT  20 SEP 94 / GrandMet acts to cut costs and sells US group for Dollars
510m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, sold its US petfood
business to Nestle yesterday for Dollars 510m (Pounds 323m) and launched a
restructuring programme for its world drinks and European food businesses.
The restructuring, which will carry a Pounds 280m charge, will involve the
loss of up to 4,000 jobs, City analysts estimate. Lord Sheppard, chairman,
said the moves would enable the group to concentrate on 'our winning brands
and businesses. We remain confident about GrandMet's long-term approach and
cash generation potential'.
Shares in the group closed at 409p, down 3 1/2 p, after recovering from an
earlier fall to 405p.
Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said its purchase of Alpo Petfoods
could make it market leader in the US canned dogfood market.
Nestle is already believed to be among the top three in the US with its
Mighty Dog and Come'N Get It brands which compete against brands produced by
rival foods giants Mars, HJ Heinz and Quaker Oats. The deal is subject to
approval by US antitrust regulators.
According to a recent study of Nestle by Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, the group had a 39 per cent share of the US canned catfood market and
10 per cent in the European Union. In canned dogfood, its share was 14 per
cent in the US and 4 per cent in the EU.
Mr George Bull, GrandMet's chief executive, said the group was selling Alpo
because it was only the seventh biggest supplier in a highly competitive
market. GrandMet's other north American brands occupied top slots in their
sectors.
GrandMet will report an exceptional profit of just over Pounds 200m on the
sale in its 1994-95 accounts. The Pounds 280m restructuring charge will be
taken as an exceptional operating cost in the results for the year to the
end of this month, to be announced on December 1.
About half the money will be spent at International Distillers and Vintners,
the group's worldwide drinks business whose brands include J&amp;B Scotch whisky
and Smirnoff vodka. The group plans plant closures and rationalisations.
Of the remaining Pounds 140m, Pounds 55m will go towards similar measures in
the European foods division.
Last year the group took a charge of Pounds 175m for restructuring
Pillsbury, the food manufacturer, and Pearle, the US eyewear chain, in north
America. That restructuring involved the loss of 3,000 jobs, some of them
part-time. The rationalisation measures enabled the group to lift by Pounds
50m its marketing and advertising outlay.
The latest restructuring programme is expected to yield savings of Pounds
90m a year over the next two years.

FT  20 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Lib Dem cannabis vote upsets Ashdown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat conference embarrassed the party leadership by calling
for the use and possession of cannabis to be decriminalised. Leader Paddy
Ashdown said the party's election manifesto would include no such
commitment. Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce (left) said he planned a 10 per
cent income tax band and rejected an increase in the top rate of income tax
to 60 per cent. He proposed that no one should pay tax above 50 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bemrose rises to Pounds 2.7m and makes
Pounds 2.3m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bemrose, the security and promotional printer, announ-ced a 6 per cent rise
in interim profits as well as the acquisition for an initial Pounds 2.3m of
a company which sources, imprints and supplies promotional products.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 2 rose from Pounds 2.55m to
Pounds 2.7m on turnover up 56 per cent at Pounds 48.1m (Pounds 30.8m). More
than 50 per cent of sales are generated in the US where Bemrose is now the
largest supplier to the US advertising speciality market following a series
of acquisitions.
'We have made a positive start, with substantially increased sales from our
enlarged group,' Mr Roger Booth, chairman, said. Order books were strong and
second half trading would be substantially greater than that seen in the
first half, he said.
A seasonal bias to Bemrose's results, which saw 75 per cent of the company's
earnings generated in the second half of last year, has been further
exaggerated by acquisitions, including McCleery-Cumming, the second largest
US publisher of advertising calendars.
Acquisitions over the last two years have increased the proportion of sales
represented by promotional products, such as calenders and diaries, from
under 50 per cent to more than 70 per cent.
Mr Booth said the acquisition of Incentives Two, a Manchester-based company,
would strengthen the management of Bemrose' promotional products division.
The company had substantial experience in sourcing low-cost products from
the Far East.
The purchase will be satisfied by Pounds 715,000 cash, Pounds 1.1m of
cumulative redeemable unsecured loan stock and the allotment of 117,733 new
shares. Incentives Two made pre-tax profits of Pounds 459,000 on Pounds
5.26m sales in the year to January 31.
Bemrose saw improved performances in all its divisions. The growth in sales
of security print products was the result of new initiatives, Mr Booth said,
while margins were being preserved by investment in more efficient
production equipment, including a Pounds 2m web press which would reduce the
cost of high volume catalogues and directories.
Promotional product sales in the UK were also ahead and contracts to print
calendars had been won from National Westminster Bank and Midland Bank.
US operations saw profit margins and cash generation higher than the group
as a whole. He said the Renaissance Group had enjoyed 'an excellent year'
following the acquisition of McCLeery-Cumming. By combining the two
businesses, substantial savings had been made in the costs of paper,
printing, packaging, materials and distribution.
Gearing has gone up from 46 per cent at the last year-end to an expected
average of 50 per cent for 1994.
Earnings per share stood at 5.67p against 7.48p restated following a rights
issue in December. An interim dividend of 4.7p (4.3p) has been declared.

FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Veba plans to step up investment
in telecoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, aims to build its fledgling
telecommunications subsidiary into an international operation with sales of
DM8bn (Dollars 5bn) a year by 2003, according to Mr Ulrich Hartmann, group
chairman. Further steps announced yesterday included the purchase of a 10
per cent stake in the Iridium satellite communications group and agreement
on a joint venture with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway.
The group is also close to concluding an agreement on selling a stake in its
Vebacom telecoms subsidiary, set up in March this year, to an international
partner, Mr Hartmann said in Dusseldorf last night.
The group aimed to invest DM6bn by 2003, building up telecommunications into
a business with a 10 per cent share of the German market, and creating
10,000 new jobs.
In a flurry of developments, Veba announced it was to invest Dollars 140m in
a 10 per cent stake in Iridium, and signed an agreement in principle with
Deutsche Bahn, which will give it access to the signalling and track
network.
Iridium, whose other key shareholders include Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint
of the US, plans to launch a network of 66 low-orbit satellites in 1996
which will provide global wireless communications services. Veba's stake
will give it exclusive rights to run the service in northern and western
Europe.
Mr Hartmann said the aim was to offer new-generation mobile telephone
services from 1998, allowing users to call worldwide using the same handset
and number. The service to the remainder of the continent will be run by
Stet, the Italian group.
According to Mr Hartmann, Vebacom had applied for a licence from the post
ministry to run a ground-based network in co-operation with Deutsche Bahn,
based in Leipzig, to supply a limited customer base with high-performance
services.

FT  19 SEP 94 / US and Britain propose boost to reserves of poorer IMF
members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and the US have launched an initiative to allow the International
Monetary Fund to boost the official reserves of former communist states and
other less prosperous member countries.
The treasuries of the two nations are working on a compromise package that
would break many years of deadlock and enable the IMF to issue up to Dollars
23.44bn worth of its own reserve asset, known as the special drawing right
(SDR). The main purpose of the issue would be to strengthen the finances of
those IMF members which have joined the fund since the last SDR issue was
made in 1981.
It is understood that the two countries have suggested the issue of between
SDR12bn (Dollars 17.6bn) and SDR16bn should be aimed primarily at overcoming
the unfair treatment of 37 'late entrants' into the IMF, including Russia
and most of the other members of the former eastern block.
The details of the Anglo-US initiative are unclear. But it would have to
satisfy those countries which have backed Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF
managing director, in his campaign for a general SDR36bn allocation among
all the fund's members, and a minority of IMF member states, led by Germany,
which have been reluctant to countenance any SDR issue.
Germany will play a pivotal role in any agreement. The Bundesbank, which
holds Germany's reserves, has long opposed a general SDR issue on the
grounds that it could be inflationary and that there is no reason for such a
boost to global liquidity. More recently, however, the Bundesbank has
indicated that it might support a 'one-off' issue of SDRs, provided it was
directed at solving the problem of the unfair treatment of recently joined
IMF members.
For the Bundesbank, one attraction of such a selective 'equity' issue of
SDRs is that it would have to be agreed by 85 per cent of the IMF membership
and be the subject of legislative change and ratification by member
governments. This difficult procedure would prevent setting a precedent for
global money creation by the IMF without legislative hurdles.
A general SDR increase, such as that proposed by Mr Camdessus, would have a
less daunting approval procedure. It would require the backing of the IMF
executive board of countries representing 85 per cent of the voting rights.
An SDR issue has been debated at the meetings of the IMF's decision making
Interim Committee for many years. Mr Camdessus says it is necessary to help
meet an estimated need for SDR400bn of extra liquidity over the next five
years to finance growth of world trade. It would be a particular boon to the
poor two-thirds of IMF members whose currency reserves cover less than 12
weeks' worth of imports.
The IMF managing director is also anxious to rebuild the share of SDRs in
world reserves to maintain the idea of it playing a significant role in
world monetary affairs. In truth the SDR, which was conceived as a possible
replacement for the dollar at the centre of the world monetary system, has
declined in importance over the past 22 years and accounts for little more
than 2 per cent of global reserves against 8.4 per cent in 1972.
The last meeting of the Interim Committee in April agreed that the question
should be settled at the annual meeting of the IMF in Madrid next month.

FT  19 SEP 94 / US official to visit Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, is to visit Pakistan this week in
an initiative to promote US investments in Pakistan.
Ms O'Leary will head a delegation of more than 70 leading businessmen with
interests mainly in the energy sector. Mr John Monjo, the US ambassador to
Islamabad, described the visit as 'a forward-looking event' in encouraging
private American investments.
The two officials played down concerns that prospects for new investments
were limited until Pakistan and the US resolve their dispute over
Islamabad's controversial nuclear programme. Washington cut off aid to
Islamabad three years ago amid concerns that Pakistan was producing nuclear
weapons - a charge denied by Pakistan.
Although Ms O'Leary is not expected to sign any fresh aid agreements, her
visit will help encourage US businesses to consider investing in Pakistan,
officials from both sides said. Mr Monjo said prospective investors were
encouraged by Pakistan's economic liberalisation programme, which had
remained intact despite five changes of government last year. He also said a
new energy policy, announced by the government this year, was attracting new
investors.
Pakistani officials expect the two countries to sign fresh joint venture
investments worth up to Dollars 2bn by next summer. If those forecasts prove
accurate the extent of US investments in Pakistan could rise substantially.
In the past 46 years, US businesses have invested up to Dollars 450m in
Pakistan.
According to Pakistani energy officials, new commitments to support
investments of up to Dollars 5bn have been received by the Ministry of Water
and Power in Islamabad since the energy policy was announced.
If those projects are executed, they will add almost 5,000 megawatts to
Pakistan's existing power generation capacity of approximately 9,500MW.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Hong Kong election draws strong turnout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 700,000 people turned out to vote yesterday in Hong Kong's first
fully democratic elections under British rule, undeterred by threats from
Beijing to overturn the result of the poll when China resumes sovereignty in
1997.
An exit poll conducted by TVB, a local television station, found that 70 per
cent of those who voted said they were not concerned by China's stated
intention to overturn the election.
Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, said the turnout underlined that
local people wanted a say in how their community was run. The vote was the
mark of an 'open, self-confident and plural society', he said.
The strong voter turnout - numbers were more than 50 per cent up on a
similar poll in 1991 - was seen by analysts as indicative of strong support
for Mr Patten's political reforms. Mr Stephen Tang, a political analyst,
said China should reconsider its plan to dissolve Hong Kong's political
structure.
China legislated this month to hold fresh elections for all three tiers of
representation in Hong Kong after it takes over in 1997. Last year talks
between London and Beijing broke down when the two were unable to agree on
the terms of the last elections to be conducted under British rule. Mr
Patten proceeded with measures to establish an election infrastructure which
he claimed was fair, open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
China for its part set about appointing advisers to inform Beijing about the
concerns of ordinary people.
As part of the Patten plan, two further sets of elections will be held in
Hong Kong next year, culminating next September in polls for the Legislative
Council, the colony's lawmaking body.
In yesterday's poll 756 candidates contested 346 seats which comprise 18
district boards. None of Hong Kong's political parties fielded enough
candidates to win a simple majority.
The number of voters was about 250,000 more than the turnout in a similar
poll in 1991. Then voters were electing two-thirds of the colony's district
boards, or local councils, with the remainder appointed by the government.
However, as a percentage of Hong Kong's registered voters, yesterday's vote,
at 33.1 per cent of the electorate, was only ahead marginally of that
achieved in 1991. Hong Kong electoral rolls are not kept up to date.
Candidates estimated that up to 20 per cent of the roll was inaccurate.

MONDAY
Biological weapons treaty
Government representatives meet in Geneva (to Sep 30) to discuss ways of
checking compliance with the United Nations' treaty outlawing biological
weapons. The 131-member treaty currently has no system to guard against
cheating.
The Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi meets union leaders to discuss
pension reform. Mr Berlusconi last week postponed a showdown with the
powerful trades union movement over proposed cuts in the generous state
scheme.
Cutting pension benefits is an essential element in the right-wing
coalition's plans to reduce public spending in the 1995 budget.
Angry trades unionists have carried out several protest stoppages, including
one at Fiat's Mirafiori plant in Turin.
European Union economics and finance ministers meet in Brussels after the
summer recess to resume discussions on excessive deficits in member states,
convergence programmes, and the white paper on growth, competitiveness and
employment. A two-day agriculture council meeting also starts today.
Ministers will focus on reform of the wine sector, the future of union
policy on fruit and vegetables, and protection of animals transported live.
John Major, UK prime minister, leaves Jeddah for Abu Dhabi and then South
Africa after talks with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd on Middle East issues and
arms deals.
Mr Major arrives in South Africa on Tuesday for the first official visit by
a British prime minister since Harold Macmillan's 'wind of change' speech in
1960.
Mr Major (left) will see President Mandela and other political leaders, and
address an informal joint session of parliament. Behind the scenes, talks
will focus on trade, aid, and British participation in the republic's
fledgling privatisation programme.
Art market: The most important blue diamond ever offered at auction,
estimated to fetch Dollars 8m, goes on exhibition at The Regent, in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. Sotheby's, along with rivals Christie's, sees the greatest
potential for art market growth in South East Asia, and for the first time
is taking to Malaysia some of the jewels it is selling in New York on
October 17 and 18, in the hope of attracting bids.
Holidays: Chile (Armed Forces Day), Israel (Eve of Sukkot), South Korea, Sri
Lanka, Taiwan (Moon Festival).

TUESDAY
Japan announces tax cuts
Japan's ruling coalition is to publish a draft tax reform bill, including
one-off and permanent income tax cuts. The finance ministry wants a rise in
sales tax to fund the hand-outs. But the draft bill may be vague on that
controversial subject, because of strong objections by prime minister
Tomiichi Murayama's Social Democratic Party.
The United Nations begins its 49th General Assembly in New York.
Pollution: Budapest hosts an international conference on environmental
contamination in central and eastern Europe (to Sep 23). The 300 delegates
include representatives of Nato and the US Environmental Protection Agency.
They will assess the region and discuss how to measure and reduce air, soil
and water contamination.
Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds arrives in Canberra, and will brief
Paul Keating, his Australian counterpart, on the Northern Ireland peace
process. More than a third of Australians claim Irish ancestry - including
the prime minister himself - although the demographics are changing with
higher levels of Asian immigration.
UK economy: Market expectations for August growth of M4, the broad measure
of the money supply, are still subdued. Moderate M4 lending, expected to
come in at a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.2bn, would give a 0.4 per cent
rise on the previous month, leaving the annual growth rate at 4.8 per cent,
towards the bottom of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring
range.
Chess: The Professional Chess Association world championship semi-finals
holds its opening ceremony at Linares, Spain (to Oct 6).
Britons Nigel Short and Michael Adams play Gata Kamsky of the US, and the
speedy Indian, Vishy Anand, respectively. The incentive for success in the
10-game matches is another multi-million-pound challenge to Gary Kasparov.
Play starts on Wednesday.
Headmasters' conference:
Heads of the UK's most prestigious independent mixed and boys schools gather
in Bournemouth. In a departure from normal practice, no education minister
will address the meeting, but delegates intend to use the three-day
conference to finalise an ambitious plan for reforming A-level and GCSE
exams.
Holidays: Israel (Sukkot), South Korea, Taiwan (Moon Festival).

WEDNESDAY
Danish general election
Denmark holds a general election. The four-party centre-left coalition
headed by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic Party leader, will
almost certainly lose its one-seat majority. His main opponent, Liberal
Party leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, hopes for victory, but the odds are on a
minority government under Rasmussen.
France's budget for 1995, due to be announced today, is expected to be
austere. Edouard Balladur's centre-right government intends to cut the
deficit from FFr301bn (Dollars 56bn) this year to FFr275bn, largely by a
clampdown on public spending and higher taxes on petrol and local
businesses.
Indonesian trial: Muchtar Pakpahan, the chairman of the largest independent
trade union, SBSI, is due to stand trial in the north Sumatran town of Medan
for his involvement in the Medan workers' riots in April. He also faces
charges for trying to organise a nation-wide strike in February this year in
protest at Indonesian workers' conditions.
Portugal's parliament is due to debate constitutional revision, focusing on
electoral law and presidential powers, and on adapting the constitution to
the process of European integration. Any changes require a two-thirds
majority and thus consensus between the centre-right governing party and the
opposition Socialists.
Scottish Nationalist conference:
The party, which fights for Scotland's independence and is led by Alex
Salmond MP (left), begins its annual conference in Inverness (to Sep 24). It
took a record 32.6 per cent of the Scottish vote in June's European
elections and gained a second seat at Strasbourg.
UK economy: August's non-EU trade balance will be scrutinised for continuing
signs of improvement. Exporters' expectations are rising, while the slowdown
in consumer spending indicated by last week's retail sales figures should
pinch imports. If, as expected, the trade deficit is about Pounds 500m, the
average for the past three months will be lower than the Pounds 595m average
for the previous three.
Alzheimer's Disease: The 10th international conference on senile dementia
opens in Edinburgh on the first World Alzheimer's Day (to Sep 23).
FT Surveys: International Equities and Logistics.
Holidays: Hong Kong, Israel (Week of Sukkot), Malta (Independence Day),
South Korea.

Members of the preparatory committee for the World Trade Organisation,
meeting in Geneva, are expected to criticise the US, the European Union and
Japan for dragging their heels on ratifying the Uruguay Round trade accords.
These include establishment of the WTO itself, and are supposed to come into
force next January.
Telecommunications ministers from 50 countries meet in Kyoto, Japan, to
discuss creating a global information network using optical fibre and how it
could help reduce the technology gap between rich nations and the developing
world.
EU-Asean foreign ministers hold their two-yearly meeting in Karlsruhe (to
Sep 23). Once again, the EU will seek to prise open the markets of the
six-member Association of South East Asian Nations and to reduce their trade
surplus. On Saturday, the foreign ministers meet some 200 chief executives
from leading European and Asian companies to continue discussions.
The Bolshoi Theatre's postponed new season opens today, but is in jeopardy
after President Yeltsin ordered the introduction of western-style contracts
instead of lifelong tenure. Artists may strike in protest.
Party conference: One of the UK's most colourful political parties, the
fringe Monster Raving Loony Party, holds its annual conference at a hotel in
Ashburton, Devon.

FRIDAY
US-N Korea talks resume
The US and North Korea will resume high-level talks in Geneva on the terms
of a deal by which Pyongyang would accept full nuclear inspections in
exchange for improved relations with Washington.
North Korea would dismantle its current graphite reactors in return for the
supply of safer light-water models. One difficulty, however, is that
Pyongyang wants them to be Russian, while the US and South Korea want to
supply a US-designed model.
Questions also remain about the disposal of the North's stockpile of nuclear
fuel and about the means to determine whether Pyongyang has already built an
atomic bomb.
UK economy: The markets will be focusing attention on the September CBI
industrial trends survey.
The survey provides a snapshot of the mood of industry, because of its
potential importance in monetary policy decisions.
Previous surveys have shown factory gate prices rising to levels last seen
in late-1990.
Although output and prices balances are strong at the moment, a slowdown in
consumer demand should allow both to fall back.
FT Surveys: Venture and Development Capital and West End Property.
Holidays: Japan (Autumnal Equinox Day).

WEEKEND
Bavarians go to the polls
Bavarians vote on Sunday to elect a state parliament, the last state
election before the national elections on October 16.
The results are unlikely to give any further clues about the outcome of the
latter, however. While the opposition Social Democrats have fought a
spirited campaign, the Bavarians are likely to return the Christian Social
Union with an absolute majority - as they have since 1962.
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, together with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
foreign minister, meets UK prime minister John Major and foreign secretary
Douglas Hurd on what is forecast by Russian officials to be a 'relaxed'
visit - before heading the following week to the US for meetings with
President Bill Clinton in Washington.
The issues will include: the state of the ceasefire in Bosnia; the upcoming
summit of the International Monetary Fund; and Russia's plans for reform in
the year ahead.
Mr Yeltsin and Mr Kozyrev have an agenda of their own - including pressure
for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to take over many
of the functions of Nato. Mr Yeltsin, who has been holidaying on the Black
Sea, is expected to address the nation on Thursday before flying to London.

Monday: With the economic recovery in Japan still moving at a sluggish rate,
growth in Japan's M2 money supply is expected to have remained steady at 1.9
per cent for August.
Tuesday: US international trade figures will be watched by markets fearing a
widening of the monthly trade deficit following dollar weakness.
Wednesday: Analysts will take a primarily academic interest in the minutes
from the July 28 UK monetary meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of
the exchequer, and Eddie George, Bank of England governor, in view of last
Monday's base rate rise.
Friday: The UK second quarter balance of payments will be viewed in the
context of an excellent performance by invisibles in the first quarter,
which is unlikely to be repeated in the second. The markets are expecting a
Pounds 1.3bn deficit.
Also: The second quarter Japanese GDP figure is expected this week to
confirm the view that the economy is slowly on the mend.
German consumer prices will be watched for signs of inflation, while the
data on M3 money supply is expected to show slow growth.

Politics and the Jardine camp will be the key features in the market this
week, writes Louise Lucas.
However, last week's resilience in the face of a renewed outburst from China
 -this time directed at the Jardine group, which Beijing wishes to see
withdrawn from the port extension project - suggests the impact may be
limited.
Investors will be watching for further developments on the Container
Terminal 9 contract from the Joint Liaison Group meeting.
The market also took in its stride the delisting of Jardine subsidiaries,
which was announced last week along with the results of the three companies:
Hongkong Land, Mandarin Oriental and Dairy Farm.
Parent Jardine Matheson announces its results today and Jardine Strategic
follows tomorrow.
These are likely to yield few surprises as they come after their
subsidiaries. This broadly winds up the reporting season, leaving just the
property developers to announce their interims.

The half-year results season continues with figures on Wednesday from
Powerfin, and on Thursday from Kredietbank, Cockerill Sambre and Tractebel.
Ms Rachael Roache at Kleinwort Benson says that the market is in transition
from being driven by interest rates to earnings and rising bond yields are
encouraging investors to demand better interim results.
She notes that during September, interim figures generally dictate market
performance and believes this year's economic recovery should allow for some
pleasant surprises, with better earnings compensating for weak bonds.
Ms Roache sees a favourable outlook for the market in the short term. 'In
the longer term, the defensive nature of the market bodes well for a return
to favour as rising interest rates spark a move out of cyclicals.'
At Goldman Sachs, Mr Pierre Stiennon agrees that the market will be
increasingly earnings-driven, but says that this will depress the interest
rate-sensitive stocks like banks, insurers and utilities, as rate cuts come
to an end. 'However, the defensive features of these stocks can prove
attractive in an uncertain environment and this could again be the case if
the market turns more pessimistic.'

In a week bereft of statements from leading companies, the chemicals and
pharmaceuticals sector is likely to remain at the centre of attention after
last week's war of words between the analysts.
Roche, the market's flagship stock, was under pressure on Thursday after
Goldman Sachs removed it from its European 'recommended for purchase' list.
Goldman said growth in the pharmaceutical industry had slowed in the first
half of 1994 as market forces in the US and healthcare cost reforms in
Europe took effect.
Other factors included a reduction in the long-term growth rates for major
divisions, the impact of the Syntex acquisition, disappointing
second-quarter sales, the Swiss franc's strength, and a decrease in net
cash.
The Roche certificates derived little benefit on Friday when Barclays de
Zoete Wedd reiterated its 'strong buy' recommendation, citing the company's
strong growth. Elsewhere in the sector, UBS has downgraded Sandoz to a
'hold', saying that the 2 per cent growth in first-half net profits was
below market expectations.
Mercur, the retailer, reports first-half figures on Friday. Mr Frederick
Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim is forecasting a 5 per cent rise in
first-half turnover, the figure depressed by the strength of the Swiss
franc, and a 7 per cent increase in net profit.

Results will continue to drive the market, with first-half figures expected

indications this week of an attractive price for the partial privatisation
of Renault, but warns that international investors risk disappointment.
'Whether it will be to appease unions or to appeal to voters, the majority
of the Renault deal is likely to be distributed in France to employees,
French institutions and corporates (Elf, BNP, Lagardere) and private
investors,' the bank says.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Brief respite in store for investors - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street is entering a relatively quiet period, which should allow
investors to regain their balance after last week's roller-coaster ride. But
analysts expect any respite to be brief, given the uncertainty that is
gripping the Treasury market.
With no fresh first-tier economic news due during the next five sessions,
share prices are likely to continue a consolidation which began on Friday,
when troubling readings on industrial production and capacity utilisation
sent bonds reeling and stocks back-tracking.
However, it is reasonable to expect less volatility this morning. During the
'triple witching' session which closed last week, the monthly expiration of
stocks options and futures contracts introduced an extra element of
stomach-churning unpredictability to a market already suffering from
over-stimulation. The Dow Jones industrial index wobbled to the finish,
showing a 20-point decline.
If bonds are setting the direction, stocks have established their own pace.
Equity investors were more inclined than their fixed-rate counterparts to
turn the other cheek when confronted by the two indications of higher
inflation which book-ended the seven-day period ending on Friday.
During the middle of the week, when the data painted a rosier picture,
stocks reaped a more generous reward than bonds. On Thursday, the bellwether
blue-chip index jumped almost 60 points to close within striking distance of
its all-time best, set the week before the Federal Reserve began its shift
to a policy of tighter credit.
Alas, last week ended with evidence that the central bank still may not have
done enough to harness the engines of growth. Bond traders were particularly
upset to learn that America's factories and mines last month were using more
of their total capacity than at any time since April 1989. With the
likelihood of production bottlenecks developing, the threat of higher
producer prices loomed larger.
However, stocks again proved their relative resilience. When the dust
settled after the triple-witching reinvestment scurry, the Dow Jones index
had landed on its feet, ending the week with a 59 point net gain.
If the outlook for corporate earnings remains optimistic, stocks may hold
out a little longer against the tide which is pushing bond prices lower and
yields higher.
Nevertheless, Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in
Chicago, says that blue chips are unlikely to gain a firm foothold in
uncharted territory, even if the volatility which he is expecting allows the
index to cross the line.
'Hitting a new high is going to be very difficult to achieve if we get many
more episodes on bonds such as on Friday,' he says.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Flying start for Pakistan privatisation
programme - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The success of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation's ambitious
international offering of 5m vouchers, exchangeable into shares in the
future privatised utility, has shown that, despite more difficult market
conditions, investors can still get excited about the right sort of deal.
'The one type of deal still capable of surprising us is an emerging market
transaction in a promising sector,' said one investment banker.
The 5m vouchers were priced on Friday at Rs5,500, raising Dollars 900m for
the Pakistani government. The government originally aimed to raise just
Dollars 500m, at a price of Rs3,000. When joint lead manager Jardine Fleming
came to allocate the transaction on Friday, it was twice oversubscribed.
'We had done a domestic offering priced at Rs3,000, knowing that it was a
relatively small tranche (less than 2 per cent of the size of the company),'
said Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of Pakistan's privatisation commission. When
the government subsequently decided to sell almost 10 per cent of the
company through an international offering, its advisers said it would have
to be at the same price.
However, the strong performance of the initial offering soon made it clear
that the deal could be completed on tighter terms, and an initial mandate
awarded to UBS was withdrawn.
Jardine Fleming subsequently completed the deal at almost twice the price,
winning widespread praise for its handling of the transaction.
One reason for Jardine Fleming's success was the structure of the deal. By
making the vouchers available in the form of dollar-denominated global
depositary receipts, which can be cleared through Euroclear and Cedel, the
deal proved attractive to investors who might have been deterred by having
to deal with the local currency.
According to an official at Jardine Fleming, around 25 per cent of the deal
was placed in the US, 25 per cent in the UK, 25 per cent in the Far East and
the remainder with expatriate Pakistani investors, mostly based in the
Middle East.
The vouchers, which are traded on the Karachi Stock Exchange, rose to
Rs6,000 on Friday, on the news of the successful completion of the offering.
The government has made a commitment to buy back vouchers at Rs3,800, in the
event that they are not converted into shares as a result of privatisation
by 1996.
The deal has successfully kicked off the government's ambitious
privatisation programme. The transaction will be followed by a 26 per cent
strategic sale of PTC, and then by other deals, including thermal power
plants and financial institutions. Mr Qamar said that in almost all cases
the government will try to place paper with international investors, as they
are too large to be completed solely on the domestic market.
However, investment bankers cautioned against viewing the deal as marking a
return to favour of emerging markets, or any strong preference for Pakistan.
The deal benefited from the fact that the telecommunications business is
widely viewed as an attractive means of entrance into an emerging economy.
'Typically, it's a business where there is fat to cut, but at the same time
there is an enormous growth potential as the underlying economy grows,' said
one investment banker.
In the case of PTC, the network is expected to expand by 30 per cent
annually, having nearly doubled since 1992. In the past, investors have done
well by buying telecom stocks at an early stage in an emerging market's
development, for example in the case of Mexico's Telmex.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Prices depend on response to rising rates -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor of the exchequer has obliged UK analysts to face the question
they have been skating around all summer; will economic recovery, in the
shape of higher company earnings and dividends, triumph over higher base
rates to keep the market moving ahead?
The City's answer seems to be, on balance, positive, perhaps surprisingly
considering the range of views. It is not difficult to find two
diametrically conflicting quotations from leading securities houses.
'The increase in base rates was a necessary move,' or 'In our view, the
pre-emptive move on UK rates was unnecessary.' Just to add to the confusion,
the first writer then hedges his bets by adding that 'a further rise may not
be necessary', while the second says the chancellor may be 'jostled into
moving base rates up by another  1/2 per cent this year'.
Mr John Shepperd at Yamaichi also sees another  1/2 per cent rise this year
and base rates at 7 per cent by the end of 1995 - 'which should be about the
top of the interest rate cycle'.
Markets in Europe as well as London appear to have moved firmly to the view
that the interest rate cycle is now on the turn, and the outlook for share
prices this week will hinge on the response to this prospect.
The case for a further advance by equities before the year-end, and there
are still plenty of 1994 Footsie forecasts in the 3,300 to 3,500 range on
record, is rehearsed by Strauss Turnbull which has raised its end-1995
Footsie forecast range to 3,700 - 4,000.
Strauss repeats its view that equities can out-perform following base rate
rises, pointing out that rate troughs in 1977, 1984 and 1988 were followed
by gains in share prices which delivered returns on equities averaging 33
per cent. On the economic growth side, Strauss sees dividend growth at 10
and 12 per cent per annum over 1994 - 95.
NatWest Securities prefers 9 per cent for this year and 8 per cent in 1995
with a Footsie forecast of 3,500 by the year-end. But equity performance
this week is likely to hang on the more considered response from UK
government bonds to the rate rise. At mid-week, the auction of the new bond
is expected to be a difficult process for both the Bank and the market,
especially after the poor response to the RPI and latest PSBR data. Without
a more positive performance from gilts, the equity market is not going to
make any permanent recovery just yet.
Friday afternoon, although a shock for the market, could prove a decisive
moment for equities. Market strategists suggested that, while gilts had
reason to react to the US economic data, shares have every reason to benefit
from the further signs of recovery in one of the world's leading economies.

The bond market is no place for the nervous. Traders have been so uncertain
about interest rate trends in Germany that yields have had no place to go
but up.
The average yield on 10-year bunds exceeded 7.5 per cent last week; that on
all quoted government securities closed at a year's high of 7.38 per cent.
However, the Bundesbank has decided enough is enough. It made clear last
week that its key rates would be put on hold - Thursday's council meeting
left them untouched - and that the next move was as likely to be up as down.
Traders took remarks by Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank deputy
president, to mean that the discount and Lombard rates, last cut
by half a point to 4.5 and 6 per cent in May, would be maintained beyond the
German general election in October.
The same applies to the securities repurchase (repo) rates, now 4.85 per
cent.
Some economists expect no change until well into 1995, in view of the
economy's strength and the still high money supply growth - the August
figure is due to be published this week.
Inflation is also being closely watched; the Bundesbank will not be happy
until the rate falls nearer its goal of 2 per cent.

Fear of inflation continues to grip the US credit markets. At the end of a
jittery week, bond prices plummeted on Friday after the Federal Reserve
reported bigger than expected increases in August industrial production and
capacity utilisation. The benchmark 30-year long bond sank by 1 19/32 to 96
13/16 , lifting its yield by 12 basis points to nearly 7.8 per cent - the
highest this year.
Most analysts cling to the belief that the Fed will hold off until November
before contemplating another rise in short-term interest rates, but each
time another bout of bad news like Friday's hits the market, investors turn
their thoughts to the possibility that the Fed could move before then -
perhaps as early as its September 27 meeting.
Fortunately, perhaps, the next few days may be relatively quiet in this
respect, since the economic reports due to be published are less closely
watched for signs of incipient inflation than last week's.
On Tuesday, figures for July's trade deficit are expected to show little
change from June's Dollars 9.4bn; on Wednesday, figures for August housing
starts are expected to have slipped a little to an annual rate of 1.4m; and
on Thursday, the federal government is expected to report a budget deficit
of Dollars 24bn for August, putting it on track for a deficit of less than
Dollars 200bn for the year - the lowest since 1989.

FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: World Bank decides on 5-year global
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has opted for a five-year maturity on its long-awaited
Dollars 1.5bn offering of global fixed-rate bonds which it expects to launch
early this week.
The five-year maturity best reflects current investor interest, the Bank
said. Some syndicate managers had been expecting the Bank to tap the 10-year
area of the dollar sector.
'Five years is not the World Bank's preferred choice but is rather a
reflection of where investors told us they wanted to put their money to
work,' said Mr Peter Horvath, senior finance officer at the World Bank in
Washington.
The launch will go ahead despite Friday's sharp fall in US Treasury prices.
Volatile market conditions early last week had caused the Bank to delay the
launch.
Mr Horvath added: 'We think the prospects for the offering are good, but we
are in a bear market and not a bull market.'
'The five-year area is where it will receive the best reception,' said an
official at Lehman Brothers, which is lead-managing the deal with UBS.
'The market is in a fairly defensive mood at the moment and portfolio
managers are erring on the side of caution and looking for (bonds of) a more
neutral duration,' the Lehman Brothers official said.

Although profit-taking ahead of the September interim book closing by
investors looking to boost their midterm earnings will weigh on bond prices
this week, the effects are likely to be minimal since a sluggish stock
market, low short-term rates and a firm yen are expected to support
confidence.
A weak stock market has always been good news for bonds. Fears of
over-supply on the stock market, which hit prices last week, are expected to
linger over the next month. Investors are worried that a spate of
equity-linked financing issues will affect liquidity. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, which was planning to offer a large convertible bond issue next
month, is expected to postpone the deal.
To prevent a further fall in share prices, the Bank of Japan is likely to
maintain an easy stance on the short-term money markets. Traders expect the
overnight call rate to remain around 2.1 per cent.
Bond investors are also expected to focus on the US-Japan bilateral
framework talks on trade. Government comments about the talks are likely to
increase ahead of the agreement deadline at the end of the month, which will
affect currency movements. Any negative news on trade will support the yen,
which in turn will help bond prices.
Meanwhile, activity may increase, as trading for October settlement starts
tomorrow.

FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Clarke catches gilts market on the hop -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the UK chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, to
raise base rates on Monday by half a point to 5.75 per cent caught many on
the hop.
The short sterling futures market had already discounted an interest rate
rise but dealers were wrong-footed when it came the week after Mr Clarke's
meeting with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
The rise - the first for almost five years - has fuelled the concern about
the pace of future interest rate increases and their impact on gilts.
A central plank of the gilts market's performance is likely to be the
credibility of the government's anti-inflation policy, which took a dent
soon after the base rate increase. When base rates rose on Monday morning,
gilts responded positively, rising almost a point at the long end, causing
the yield spread against German bunds to tighten.
The market's enthusiasm was due to the belief - fuelled by Mr Clarke's
statements at the time - that he was moving ahead of events, rather than
simply responding to inflation already seen in the economy.
One analyst said on the day: 'It is the first time in more than 20 years
that I have seen the government acting ahead of a crisis - it has taken the
long view. I have never seen it before.'
However, the market was soon to change its mind. Two days later the long end
of the market fell by more than a point on the news that Mr Clarke already
had a rough idea of the Retail Price Index figures when he increased base
rates on Monday. The figures - not published until Wednesday morning -
showed a higher than expected rise of 2.4 per cent in the year to August.
Confidence in the government's pre-emptive anti-inflationary stance took a
knock: some traders felt Mr Clarke may have been continuing the long
tradition of UK chancellors of reacting to rising inflation too late. Gilts,
also wounded by the RPI data, fell more than a point on the day,
under-performing the bund market.
However, some analysts felt this was an over-reaction: Mr Nigel Richardson,
head of bond research at Yamaichi, said: 'Really there is no significant
inflation problem, so the increase is still pre-emptive.'
This debate over inflationary pressures has led economists to divide into
two broad camps: those who think that one-year interest rates of 7 per cent
accurately predict base rates in a year's time, and those who feel the
economy might become strong enough to force the chancellor to take rates
higher to squeeze inflation.
Publication of the minutes of the monthly meeting between Mr Clarke and
Eddie George makes the process more transparent, pointed out Mr Robert
Thomas at NatWest Markets.
He is among those who expect to see base rates at around 7 per cent by the
end of next year, and inflation at about 3 1/2 per cent.
He added: 'As long as the Bank of England is seen to be ahead of events, the
gilts market will be reassured, and base rates will not be a negative
influence.'
However, the December sterling futures contract is already discounting a
base rate of around 6.75 per cent - a full percentage point more than the
current rate. Mr Thomas dismissed this: 'Short sterling does get a bit
carried away.'
The forecast of 7 per cent base rates by the end of next year is shared by
Mr Richardson of Yamaichi. 'We believe we are entering a 1960s-style
inflation era, and we will have 1960s-style interest rates.'
He thinks the 10-year gilt yields will fall from around 9 per cent to less
than 8 per cent next year: 'We believe inflation has been licked as a
long-term problem.'
However, Mr Kevin Gardner at Morgan Stanley believes strength in the economy
may lead the chancellor to take base rates up to 10 per cent in 1996.
The view that gilts may suffer badly from rises in base rates is one held by
Mr Chris Dillow, at Nomura Research Institute. He said last week's base
rates rise will make no difference to demand in the short-term and 'this
means there will be a lot more interest rate rises in the pipeline'. He
said: 'The lesson of history is that interest rates rise more than you
expect.'
Mr Dillow declined to predict where bases rates are going, but simply
insisted: 'They will rise further and faster than expected. The idea that
you put up short rates and the bond market likes it is pretty mythical.
Gilts won't like base rates going up. My advice is to sell them now.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: FRNs provide safe haven as European
rates start to rise - International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the bloodbath in the world's bond markets this year, one area of the
eurobond market, the floating-rate note sector, has thrived. With the move
upwards in European short-term interest rates only just beginning, FRNs look
set to remain in vogue.
Since the turn of the year, investors have fled the fixed-rate markets at
the prospect of rising inflation and higher short-term rates. Many of those
brave enough to remain with bonds have turned to the relative safety of
FRNs.
These offer a variable rate of interest which moves to reflect changes in
money market interest rates. They therefore provide some protection for
investors when official interest rates begin to turn upwards.
'The bond markets are in a horrible state and in such times of uncertainty,
the FRN is a valuable defensive instrument,' said one eurobond dealer in
London.
'It's pretty grim out there. Investors are turning to FRNs because they
don't want to buy anything else,' said another trader.
The volume of new FRNs issued has risen dramatically, to Dollars 76.8bn so
far this year, compared with Dollars 72.1bn for all of 1993 and Dollars
48.2bn for 1992.
The first rise in US interest rates in February caused the initial surge in
FRN activity. 'People realised the bull market was over and ran for cover,'
said one dealer.
However, the increase in the supply of new issues caused spreads to widen -
the interest rate on an FRN is usually set at a 'spread' or margin over the
London interbank offered rate (Libor), the benchmark interest rate for the
market. That, and a slightly improved sentiment in government bond markets,
spurred a move back into fixed-interest bonds.
However, that move was only temporary. Further weakness in the fixed
interest sector has caused a new flood of investors looking to break into
the FRN market.
'Now people are beginning to realise that the bear market is here to stay,
which means the FRN market will get busier,' said one dealer.
Last week's sharp falls in European government bonds made it clear that any
confidence the markets may have had left that European bonds could
'decouple' from the US market - which is further advanced in the economic
cycle - is fast disappearing.
'Few people believe there will be any more interest rate cuts in Europe,'
said a syndicate manager at a US investment bank in London. 'Many think the
rest of Europe will now be pressurised into following the UK and raising
rates.
'This should be bullish for long-dated fixed interest bonds, as long-term
inflation prospects improve, and we should see a flattening of the yield
curve. In the meantime, if you are not sure when that improvement will come
and you do not want to stay in cash, the best bet is probably to get into a
short-dated floating rate instrument.'
Last week, Europe's interest rate cycle began to turn upwards for real when
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, launched his pre-emptive strike on UK
inflation. The half point rise in rates was undoubtedly the first of many
steps upwards. With that dismal prospect for fixed interest bonds, the
floating-rate sector will probably remain busy.

After a raft of UK economic data inspired a volatile ride for gilts last
week, the market will be relatively quiet this week as significant domestic
statistics are in short supply.
Attention will be focused instead on activities and sentiment abroad.
Germany's influence, which has been muted during the past week because of UK
data, will
return to the fore as markets look to the German M3 money supply data,
expected as early as today, and definitely this week.
Over the past three months, the headline growth rate of M3 has fallen and
the markets are now expecting a small month-on-month rise, which would
continue to bring down the annual rate to about 8.8 per cent, still above
the Bundesbank's 4.0 to 6.0 per cent target corridor.
Such news could lower European bond yields, which would have a knock-on
effect on the gilt market.
The markets will also be watching for details of the September 28 gilt
auction, which will emerge on Tuesday. The announcement on Friday suggested
a maturity between 2004 and 2006, and Mr Andrew Roberts, economist at UBS,
said he believed the auction will be the new 10-year benchmark. He
anticipates an 8.5 per cent coupon.
In the UK, markets are likely to focus on the CBI manufacturing trends
survey for signs of an upturn.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Foreign investors watch Seoul surge - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors wanting to enter the Seoul bourse could only watch in
frustration last week as the general share index reached its historical high
of 1023.61 on Saturday.
A 10 per cent ceiling on foreign stock investments in listed companies has
largely kept new overseas investors out of the market since the quota was
quickly filled for the most attractive shares after the market was opened to
foreigners in January 1992.
Ironically, the expectation that the government would soon raise the foreign
ownership limit to 12 per cent has caused the recent surge in share prices
as domestic investors bought blue-chip stocks in anticipation that they
would rise further once the ceiling is raised and more foreign capital flows
into the market.
There is little doubt that there is plenty of pent-up foreign capital
waiting to be released into the Korean market. The Seoul bourse 'has great
potential because it is undervalued. Korea didn't go ballistic as other
Asian markets did last year,' said Mr Gareth Evans, branch manager for
Barings Securities in Seoul.
The country's economic fundamentals are also strong, with GNP expected to
grow by at least 8 per cent this year because of an export boom aided by a
weak Korean currency. Companies reported their best first-half earnings in
seven years, with a 70.6 per cent rise in aggregate net profits for listed
companies. Analysts predict that the share index could reach 1,100 by the
end of the year.
But there are doubts over whether the government will adhere to its promise
to raise the limit to an expected 12 per cent by December and 15 per cent by
next June.
The government is worried that more foreign capital inflows will increase
inflationary pressure when inflation is already expected to rise above the
government's target of 6 per cent for this year. In addition, Korean
companies fear that a new influx of foreign capital will cause an
appreciation of the Korean won, which would dampen exports.
Raising the foreign ownership ceiling would also contradict the government's
current policy of preventing the stock market from overheating. Officials
have repeatedly tried to cool down the market this year because of concerns
that domestic investors would eventually cash in on their gains and then
spend the money, which would contribute to inflation.
During the past week, the government tried to intervene in the market and
depress prices by ordering the country's three investment trust companies to
sell shares. But this strategy is proving futile since these institutional
funds 'have less and less of the blue-chip stocks that are leading the
rally,' said Mr Bruno Leroy, head of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in
Seoul.
Another factor that has supported scepticism about the government's promise
about a foreign limit increase is that the pledge was made in June by Mr
Hong Hae-hyong, the finance minister, when the market was falling as foreign
investors pulled out because of the tensions over the North Korean nuclear
dispute.
The government has often floated proposals about a rise in the foreign
ceiling to bolster market confidence during weak periods, but then it has
fallen silent after share prices gained strength.
Most foreign brokers in Seoul, however, believe that the government this
time will stick to its commitment and proceed with a rise in the limit.
'Time is running short for South Korea if it wants to meet its deadline and
join the OECD by 1996,' explained Mr Leroy. 'Membership conditions are
likely to include increasing the foreign ownership ceiling to 25 per cent.'
However, it is not ruled out that the government may try to attach other
conditions to control foreign investment inflows if the ceiling is raised.
One possibility is to increase advanced deposit requirements for foreign
investors to 40 per cent of their buy orders from the current level of 20
per cent.
Foreign securities houses have complained about the measure, introduced in
January as part of the government's market cooling efforts, because it has
created legal problems for US investors, who are barred from making deposits
under SEC rules, and delayed carrying out buy orders for other foreign
investors.
Moreover, the government has suggested that it may set a monetary ceiling on
foreign capital inflow for stock investments that could prevent the ceiling
increase from being completely filled.
There are also doubts as to whether the government will accept the
recommendations of an advisory panel on financial liberalisation, which
suggested that the foreign ownership ceiling be abolished by 1999. Korea has
been extremely reluctant to allow the foreign takeover of its companies and
this attitude is unlikely to change.
Meanwhile, foreign investors eager to acquire Korean blue-chip stocks trade
on the informal over the counter market, where they must pay premiums
ranging from 10 per cent up to 75 per cent.
Another means of acquiring Korean securities is through the overseas
issuance of equity-linked convertible bonds. But the ministry of finance has
banned Korean corporations from issuing overseas bonds during the fourth
quarter because the Dollars 1.25bn limit set by the government for such
issues this year has already been reached.
An exception, to the ban, however, was the government's decision on Friday
to allow Pohang Iron and Steel and Korea Electric Power to become the first
Korean companies to be listed on New York Stock Exchange as of next month.
Nine other Korean companies believed to be qualified for the New York stock
exchange could be listed as early as next year.

Baring Securities has forecast that the remainder of 1994 and 1995 should
see an upturn in emerging markets with institutional funds being switched
from south-east Asia to Latin America, Reuter reports.
Barings remarked that the main propellant of emerging markets strategy was
the US economy. If US growth was slow bonds were likely to rally, providing
an incentive to invest in south-east Asia. 'But with a strong US economy
Latin America historically performs better, pushed along by pressure on
commodity prices,' said Barings. A mediocre performance from the US economy,
however, should drive funds to Japan and north-east Asia.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Concern over dollar surfaces again -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets will this week continue their long running dollar vigil, but this
time it will be politics as well as economics occupying their thoughts.
The latest round of the US-Japan trade talks, and the Haiti imbroglio, are
coming to a head at the same time. Both hold within them the potential to
cause a further sell-off in the dollar.
Some observers fear that Haiti, in particular, could do for president
Clinton what Iran did for Mr Jimmy Carter. Limited progress with Japan ahead
of the September 30 deadline for sanctions would also hurt the dollar.
There are few important statistics to focus on, though the July trade
figures on Tuesday could unsettle the dollar. Friday's strong capacity
utilisation figures, however, have only aggravated market fears about
inflation, and speculation is sure to rise about the possibility of a
further monetary tightening at the September 27 FOMC meeting.
One factor favouring the dollar is that the market has shown much less
inclination to sell it in recent weeks.
The dollar will also draw comfort from the relative weakness of the D-Mark
over the past week. Analysts expect investors to continue to lighten their
D-Mark holdings ahead of the October 16 national elections. This week the
focus will be on Sunday's election in Bavaria.
The key concern will be the performance of the Chancellor Kohl's alliance
partner, the FDP. If it looks like it might fail to hurdle the 5 per cent
barrier to Bundestag representation, further D-Mark sales can be expected.
The latest German M3 figure is also due this week. A good outcome could
allow for a further, probably final, cut in interest rates. This could cause
further D-Mark weakness.
Three of the principal beneficiaries of D-Mark weakness last week were
sterling, the Italian lira and the Swiss franc. The fortunes of the lira are
likely to turn largely on the budget proposals which are expected out soon.
So too the Spanish peseta; budget details are expected on Friday.
For sterling the outlook is brighter. Not only are the D-Mark and dollar
both under pressure, but there is a case that last week's pre-emptive rise
in interest rates has changed the pyschology of the market, dramatically
improving sterling's prospects.
Also in the spotlight will be the Swedish krona following the weekend poll.
Markets will be judging whether the new government has adequate resolve to
address the country's fiscal problems.

Investor

<TEXT>
Even as the US puts the finishing touches to its latest Caribbean adventure
this week, it will take another step nearer the brink with a rather more
powerful adversary.
No lives are at risk in the trade conflict between the US and Japan, but the
implications for world currency markets are far-reaching.
The two countries have until September 30 before the US has to decide
whether to impose sanctions against Japan. This week Mr Yohei Kono, the
Japanese Foreign Minister, will meet President Clinton and Mr Mickey Kantor,
US Trade Representative, to give new urgency to the framework talks.
The markets will watch the meetings with keen interest. Past trade showdowns
between the economic superpowers were fairly predictable affairs. The US
would fulminate about Japan's enormous bilateral trade surplus and threaten
retribution if serious action was not taken to redress it. At the last
minute, Japan would usually cave in to one or two fairly meaningless demands
and the crisis would be over. Meanwhile Japan's trade surplus would go on
rising.
But that changed in February this year. In an uncharacteristically
unsporting manner, Japan refused to play the game by the usual rules and
would not agree to the US demands for quantitative criteria by which to
judge progress in increasing market access in key areas - hence the renewed
brinkmanship this week.
Another stalemate this week would have obvious consequences for currencies.
The yen would stay punishingly high, or might even rise further as investors
sensed a real trade war. But what would happen if the talks achieved some
sort of compromise? Presumably the dollar would initially recover. But then
what?
That still depends on what happens to the trade imbalance between the two
countries. At first sight, that looks like a controversial remark. For the
last year, so-called economic fundamentals such as trade flows, seem to have
had little to do with currency movements. Japan's trade surplus has fallen
in yen terms in six of the eight months of 1994, bringing the total decline
for the year to more than 6 per cent. But in that same period, the yen has
appreciated by more than 10 per cent against the dollar and more than 5 per
cent on a trade-weighted basis.
Though this seems to confirm one's worst suspicions concerning the
capricious behaviour of financial markets, there is a rational explanation.
Most past experience suggests that currencies do follow trade, but after a
time lag. The last time the trade surplus peaked, in the middle of 1987, the
yen continued to rise until early 1989. Sentiment eventually moved against
the Japanese currency as the trade surplus declined by more than 30 per cent
over four years.
The reason for the delay is the very understandable one that investors
decide to wait before changing direction to see whether trade flows really
have shifted for the foreseeable future. Currently investors are far from
sure that the Japanese trade surplus is on a firmly downward trend, and with
good reason.
A popular argument, that has the same specious attraction for some
economists that historical materialism once had for others, is that there is
something inevitable about a falling Japanese trade surplus. The
restructuring of Japanese industry, deregulation and the 'hollowing out'
caused by the high yen are changing the underlying nature of the Japanese
economy and will eventually cut internal and external financial surpluses.
In such circumstances the yen should head back down towards the Y110-Y120 to
the dollar range, or even lower.
This sanguine outlook may be justified by a very long-term view, but in the
more immediate future (the next year or two being more meaningful for most
investors) the outcome is far from assured.
The strong recovery in the US and the continuing rapid growth in demand in
Asia are outweighing the effects of the stronger yen. Thanks to rapid demand
growth and higher inflation in those regions, Japanese companies are able to
offset the higher prices caused by the stronger currency by pushing up
sales.
The country's trade surplus with the US has risen for six straight months,
and with Asia for three consecutive months. Exports to the US were 13 per
cent higher in the first eight months of the year than in the same period of
last year.
The one principal market that has been weak is Europe - exports have fallen
for 22 consecutive months. But, as the European economies recover, that
decline is bottoming out.
Some of the extra demand abroad will, of course, be met by more overseas
production. But Japanese companies at home still have enormous overcapacity
and it is inconceivable that they will not continue to expand exports as
world demand strengthens further.
That leaves imports. If they rise at a much faster rate than exports then
the surplus will of course fall. In the first eight months of the year they
did indeed outstrip export growth. But that increase was the result, not so
much of the opening up of the Japanese markets to greater import penetration
as to the yen's sharp rise, which cut the cost of imports. In other words, a
Y100 to the dollar exchange rate only just began to cut the surplus. As
exporters continue to benefit from faster growth, the yen will need to rise
further, or at least stay at its current level to make serious inroads into
the trade surplus.
Put another way, if the slight decline in the trade surplus this year were
to lead investors to drop yen for dollars, pushing the yen towards the Y120
to the dollar level, the increase in imports would be halted abruptly, the
surplus would rise again and the yen would climb back up.
Until there is much clearer evidence of a decisive shift in trade imbalances
 -and that will not come about until there is a real change in the way
Japan's economy works - the dollar looks only marginally more attractive
than the Haitian goude.

Rumours have been emerging from Bangkok, where the Association of Tin
Producing Countries is holding a ministerial meeting today and tomorrow,
that the producers are ready to abandon the export quota system which they
had hoped would reduce global stocks and boost prices.
If this happens, there might be a short-term negative reaction on the London
Metal Exchange, according to Mr Fidelis Madavo, tin specialist at the CRU
International consultancy group, but the price can be expected to stabilise
quickly.
The tin market has been in turmoil since the sudden collapse in 1985 of a
price support scheme operated by the producers' International Tin Council,
which was backed by various governments. The huge stocks accumulated by the
ITC - more than 40,000 tonnes - have been a malign influence on prices ever
since.
Tin had already been struggling in the early 1980s because a big chunk of
its market - for beverage cans - was being won away by aluminium producers.
Nor have the metal's other main uses, such as in solders, been particularly
buoyant.
The quota scheme operated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries has
not worked well. Unexpected and unrestrained exports from Brazil - not a
member of the organisation - caused havoc in the early years. Then China,
the world's biggest producer, pumped large quantities of the metal into
export markets.
In April China finally agreed to join the ATPC. But it has flagrantly been
exceeding its 1994 export quota of 20,000 tonnes. The official China Daily
reported at the beginning of August that in the first half of 1994 alone
China exported 24,700 tonnes, up 33 per cent on the same months of 1993.
There have been suggestions that Brazil, the only big producer still outside
the ATPC might join next year. But some analysts suggest that, given China's
recent performance, rather than bringing Brazil into the fold, the ATPC
should be folded.

FT  19 SEP 94 / The Markets: Reassurance for borrowers - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise bank base rates
by half a percentage point last week has naturally prompted fears of further
interest rate increases.
Memories of the savage doubling of UK base rates to 15 per cent in the 18
months to October 1989 are still relatively fresh. In the US, the decision
of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to lift
short-term interest rates by a quarter point in February has been followed
by four other monetary tightenings.
But hopes are high in Whitehall and in the City that UK rates are not
heading back to the stratospheric levels of the late 1980s. Borrowers can
take comfort from the nature of Britain's recovery, now in its tenth
quarter.
The accompanying chart highlights one of the big differences between this
recovery and the previous cyclical upturns of the past 20 years. Past
recoveries were accompanied by house price inflation. House prices today,
according to the Nationwide Anglia index used in the chart, are still lower
than when the recovery began in the second quarter of 1992.
All recoveries are unique and the four featured in the chart are no
exception to this rule.
Inflation was high when the two earlier recoveries began: at about 26 per
cent in the third quarter of 1975 and at just under 13 per cent in the first
quarter of 1981. Higher prices overall sharply reduced, or, in the case of
the 1975 recovery, overwhelmed the wealth creating effects of higher house
prices.
That was not the case with the recovery that followed the 'growth pause' of
1985. Annual retail price inflation was comparatively low by UK standards,
at about 5.5 per cent. It declined to 2.4 per cent by the summer of 1986 and
was to stay below 5 per cent until mid-1988, just before the economy hit its
cylical peak.
However, house prices were motoring ahead and rose by an average 77 per cent
in the four years to their peak in late 1989. The strong real increase in
house prices generated a bubble economy. Mortgage lending surged. So did
equity withdrawal as people traded up the housing market and took some of
the proceeds as cash. Consumers felt more confident. Net savings slumped.
The result was the late 1980s consumer boom.
Headline retail inflation was in double digits by the late summer of 1990.
It proved especially difficult to root out because the house price boom had
developed its own momentum. Moreover, inflation was boosted by the very
interest rate increases that were intended to control it, because mortgage
interest payments are included in the retail prices index. Base rates, once
put at 15 per cent, stayed at that level for a year.
Housing has so far played no part in the current recovery. Not only have
house prices been little changed over the past year, but turnover is 7 per
cent below its peak. Although estate agents and building societies keep
reminding us that houses are currently very affordable, there are good
reasons not to expect a return to boom.
The bust in the early 1990s has created a generation of young potential
house buyers who have witnessed the miseries caused by mortgage rates
doubling, negative equity and homes being repossessed.
Government tax relief on mortgage interest payments has been much reduced
and is set to fall further.
The shift in patterns of employment to more part-time working and the
reduced security offered to many in middle management should also dampen
demand for houses. The upshot, Bank of England and Treasury officials
believe, could be a climate in which people buy houses to live in rather
than as an investment.
Britain's housing market is still very different from that in most other
European countries. The owner occupier ratio is high - about two thirds of
households own their own home. House purchase continues mainly to be
financed by mortgages linked to potentially volatile short-term interest
rates. This is partly because demand for fixed-rate mortgages, which were
increasingly popular last year, was halted by the rise of long-term interest
rates in the spring. There is also the sheer importance of housing as a
store of wealth: nearly 40 per cent of gross personal sector wealth was tied
up in residential property at the end of 1992.
But there are hopes that the UK economy may be becoming more akin to those
on the continent. If so, interest rates will not have to be raised so
savagely in this cycle to curb inflation, because house prices will be less
of an engine of inflation.
Nobody is ruling out the need for sudden interest rate increases to deal
with unexpected shocks. But it may be a hopeful sign that Mr Michael
Saunders of Salomon Brothers, one of the few City economists to forecast
last week's rate rise, does not expect base rates to rise much above 7 per
cent in the foreseeable future. That would leave them lower than at any time
in the 1980s.

FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Apple to allow Macintosh clones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer is today expected to unveil plans to license its Macintosh
software to other manufacturers, for the first time allowing them to produce
Macintosh 'clones'.
This follows an announcement on Friday by IBM that it is to delay release of
its long-awaited PowerPC computers until the first half of next year. The
company said the postponement of this new generation of personal computers,
based on its PowerPC microprocessor, would hopefully enable it to take
advantage of more software being available.
The delay is a further setback for IBM's PC business, which has been losing
market share to competitors for the past six months. The first PowerPC
personal computers had been scheduled for introduction next month, and were
seen as helping the company to regain its momentum.
IBM said that although desktop and mobile PowerPC models are already being
shipped to select customers and software developers, general availability
has been postponed.
Last month, Mr Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice-president in charge of all IBM's
personal computer related businesses, acknowledged that PowerPC currently
lacks the software base to make it attractive to most PC users, and last
week IBM confirmed that it has yet to complete development of a PowerPC
version of its OS/2 PC operating system software.
PowerPC microprocessor technology has been jointly developed by IBM with
Apple Computer and Motorola over the past three years. PowerPC chips were
initially seen as a challenge to the market leadership of Intel, which holds
about 90 per cent of the market for 'brain' chips used in PCs.
However, the prospects for PowerPC displacing Intel's technology as an
industry standard now appear to be increasingly remote. Other PC
manufacturers that have shown interest in the technology are generally
waiting for IBM to create demand before committing significant resources to
the new technology.
Apple Computer, meanwhile, has been selling Macintosh computers based on
PowerPC chips since March with moderate success. The early rush of orders
for 'Power Macintosh' models has , however, slowed, according to market
analysts.
Today, Apple is expected to announce a significant shift of strategy to
license its Power Macintosh software to other PC companies in a bid to boost
profits and expand its influence over software application developers.
Apple has long been criticised for refusing to license its Macintosh
software. Many observers believe that had Apple licensed the Macintosh
software, enabling other companies to 'clone' its computers, a few years
ago, the software might have created a more potent challenge to Microsoft's
'Windows', the dominant software standard in the PC arena.
Although Apple has yet to name any companies that have agreed to license its
software, there is widespread industry speculation that IBM might be a prime
candidate in view of its acknowledged lack of software for PowerPC.
Others reportedly interested in licensing the Macintosh software include
Olivetti of Italy and Fujitsu of Japan.

FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canada loosens telephone
regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cable-TV operators and other newcomers will be free to enter Canada's local
telephone market in competition with existing provincial monopolies, under a
landmark ruling by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission (CRTC).
The knife will cut both ways, however, as the CRTC has also cleared the way
for the powerful telephone companies, led by Bell Canada, to enter other
telecommunications markets, either as carriers or content providers.
Although the CRTC has yet to consider whether to award broadcast licences to
the phone companies, it will allow them to take part in projects using
fast-evolving, video-on-demand technology.
The CRTC said in a 165-page report, which was based on six weeks of public
hearings, that it intends to place greater reliance on market forces.
It concluded that in an era when telecommunications services are limited
'only by the rate of diffusion of new technology, access to capital and the
imagination of users . . . it is important . . . that regulation encourage,
rather than impede, the provision of efficient, innovative and affordable
services.'
To make local phone services more attractive to new entrants, the CRTC has
agreed to allow the established phone companies to raise their local rates
by CDollars 2 a month each year for the next three years.
However, revenues generated by these increases must be used to lower
long-distance prices, especially for small businesses and private users.
The companies at present use a large proportion of long-distance revenues to
subsidise local rates but their ability to continue doing so has been
limited by competition in the long-distance market, which was opened to new
entrants in 1992.
The CRTC will further ease regulatory barriers by replacing the existing
rate-of-return criteria for phone charges with a system of price caps.

FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Tenneco goes on prowl for
European acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified Houston-based industrial company, is on the prowl
for acquisitions in Europe, seeking to redeploy some of the Dollars 360m in
cash it raised when it spun off 29 per cent of the JI Case Corporation in
June. While the company is not naming any targets, 'we're shooting to get
something meaningful done by late Fall,' said Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's
chairman.
The company is widely believed to be looking for a deal worth Dollars 100m
to Dollars 200m to bolster its business in original equipment automotive
parts in Europe and supplement its significant European market for
after-market components.
It is in the midst of one of the biggest corporate restructurings in US
history and while this deal will not be the 'defining purchase' that Wall
Street analysts are clamouring for, it is important because it sets the tone
for later, more significant acquisitions.
'We're being very careful, very systematic in how we go about this,' says Mr
Mead, 'We want to be sure we do this one right, because what tends to happen
is if you demonstrate you can make one good deal, other good deals will
follow.'
Mr Mead, who assumed Tenneco's chairmanship following the death of Mr Mike
Walsh earlier this year, has become Tenneco's defining force. He directed
the turnround in Case's operations last year which allowed Tenneco to spin
off part of the farm and construction machinery subsidiary to the public
this summer.
Its 1985 investment in Case was an error that took Tenneco nearly a decade
to recover from. Now, with the Case chapter nearly behind it, Tenneco plans
to reinvest in its three remaining core businesses: automotive parts,
packaging, and natural gas.
Tenneco's second-quarter net income was Dollars 171m, or 93 cents per share,
and the company is projected to earn Dollars 850m, or Dollars 4.60 per
share, this year.
As it did with Case, Tenneco's new management has improved the performances
of its UK-based Albright and Wilson chemicals business and its Newport News
Shipbuilding company, but is not planning any significant reinvestment in
those divisions.
Mr John McGinty, a research analyst with CS First Boston, believes Tenneco
will sell both businesses within three years, which, combined with the sale
of the remaining portions of Case, would leave it with upwards of Dollars
3bn in cash to reinvest, probably in the automotive or packaging industries.
'The big issue right now is what are they going to become?' says Mr McGinty.
Mr Mead's answer is that Tenneco wants to become a world-class industrial
growth company. That includes pursuing acquisitions in international
markets, which often represent the highest growth potential.
Mr Mead says a major acquisition outside Tenneco's three main businesses
sometime in the future isn't out of the question. 'We've said all along that
we're opportunistic,' he notes, 'I don't want to preclude that, but I don't
think we'll do that right away.'

Ciments Francais, the French cement company, sharply reduced its losses in

18.1m) from FFr373m in the same period in 1993, writes John Ridding in
Paris.
The group, which is a subsidiary of Italcementi of Italy, said the improved
result, better economic conditions and its disposal of non-core assets
should allow a break-even or close full-year result.
First-half sales rose to FFr6.62bn from FFr6.58bn, while operating profits
jumped to FFr715m from FFr501m.

Shareholders in Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers, are today
being asked to approve plans for the company to buy back a 21.45 per cent
stake currently held by Kmart, of the US, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Coles is proposing to pay significantly more than the current market price,
but Mr Solomon Lew, chairman, said at the weekend that the parcel of shares
was not available at a lower price.
In Sydney on Friday, Mr Lew told a business lunch that the company lost
focus during the early-1990s and had been 'plagued by corruption'.
He also slammed previous management, saying it had become 'too distant from
the business', and had overlooked long-term strategic planning. 'Perhaps
flush with its own success, management became too inward looking . . . it
grew complacent, even smug.'

Malaysia Airlines the national carrier, is undergoing what is described as
the biggest revamp in the airline's its history as new shareholders take
control, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Tajudin Ramli, the Malaysian entrepreneur who recently took control of
MAS through a highly leveraged MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars 700m) deal,
announced a restructuring of management operations at the weekend, including
the creation of both a chairman's office and a managing director's office.
Mr Tajudin will be MAS chairman And Mr Wan Malek Ibrahim the new MAS
managing director.
Mr Wan Malek is also the executive director of Malaysian Helicopter
Services, the Tajudin controlled company which was behind the recent
purchase of a 33 per cent stake in MAS from Bank Negara, the Malaysian
central bank.
This is the second big reorganisation at MAS within the past two years. In
the year to March 31 1994, MAS had a pre tax of MDollars 16m, a 90 per cent
drop on the previous year.

terms

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault employees are likely to be offered a discount of up to 20 per cent
of the price of shares in the French state-owned automobile group as part of
its partial privatisation, Mr Alphandery, economy minister said yesterday.
Under terms of the sale, Renault employees are due to be offered 10 per cent
of January's shares when the government sells a stake of about 28 per cent
in the group. Pricing Details have yet to be announced for the sale,
expected to take place in November.
The offer of cheap shares to Renault employees will be accompanied by other
incentives, including a delay in payment and the possibility of free shares
if they hold their investment for at least three years, according to Mr
Alphandery.
The government and Renault's management see such incentives as a means of
strengthening worker support for the privatisation. Some unions,
particularly the communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail, are
opposed to the sale. The CGT has called for a day of action to protest the
operation tomorrow.
