FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Embassy Prop in talks with John I Jacobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Embassy Property, the development and investment group, has received an
approach from John I Jacobs, the transportation company.
Mr Michael Kingshott, non-executive deputy chairman of Embassy and managing
director of Jacobs, would take no part in reviewing the approach, Embassy
said.
Embassy had a pre-tax loss of Pounds 852,000 (Pounds 1.25m profits) for the
year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.12m).
During the period the company acquired Skillion, a light industrial property
specialist. Mr Kingshott, managing director of Skillion, joined the Embassy
board and acquired 35m shares from Mr Tai Yu Wong, Embassy chairman, and Mr
Tai Lu Wong, who previously owned 53.6m shares, a holding of 51.4 per cent.
Mr Kingshott was appointed managing director of Jacobs after a boardroom
shake-up earlier this year.

FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flotation for Ind Brit Healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent British Healthcare, which has 17 hospitals spread between
Stirling in the north and Tunbridge Wells in the south, is coming to the
market early next month.
The group, which is expected to have a market capitalisation of about Pounds
45m, will be raising approximately Pounds 20m of new money through a
placing. It will be used to reduce the net debt of about Pounds 37m, cutting
gearing from some 130 per cent to 45 per cent. Net assets are Pounds 28m.
The company, which makes 80 per cent of its income from private medical
insurance, opened its first hospital in 1983 - a converted country house in
Chorley, Lancashire, with 15 beds. Mr Keith Chadwick, chief executive, said
yesterday that local consultants had spoken of the need for a private
hospital in the area.
Both the consultants and local businessmen put money into the initial
venture, which lost Pounds 45,000 in the first year, but made Pounds 140,000
on turnover of Pounds 726,000 in the second year.
Mr Chadwick and his co-founder Mr John Lyons, a chartered surveyor,
continued to expand, setting up three companies under the Business Expansion
Scheme and two with institutional money. Earlier this year the five
companies were merged into one group.
There are now 2,400 shareholders, many of them doctors. The two founders
each own 11.5 per cent of the equity. Mr Chadwick is not selling any shares,
and expects to have about 6 per cent after flotation. Mr Lyons is selling
two-thirds of his stake.
Pre-tax profits for the year ending September are expected to be about
Pounds 2.2m after paying Pounds 3m of interest. The group will pay no tax
because of accrued capital allowances.
Beeson Gregory is both sponsor and broker to the issue.

FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 60m tag for Filtronic Comtek
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Filtronic Comtek, a manufacturer of components for the mobile
telecommunications industry, is coming to the stock market next month with
an expected market capitalisation of Pounds 60m.
The float will be made through a placing to US and UK institutions, which is
expected to raise Pounds 25m. Of this, Pounds 15m will be new money.
Formed in 1977, the company worked principally in the defence electronic
business, moving to work full-time on its telecoms developments with the
rapid expansion of the mobile market in the late 1980s.
As the number of telecoms systems and users has grown, base stations,
through which a mobile telephone connects to a telephone system, have had to
cope with an increasing number and variety of signals.
Filters used in the combining and separating of the signals are an integral
part of the base station. Filtronic also supplies subsystems which combine
filters and other electronic components to enhance a base station's
capabilities.
Sales have grown from Pounds 1.23m in 1992 to Pounds 10.22m in the year to
May 31 1994 during which pre-tax profits have increased 10-fold to Pounds
1.11m. Panmure Gordon, the company's broker, is forecasting profits for the
coming year of between Pounds 3.3m and Pounds 3.5m.
Professor David Rhodes, executive chairman, said: 'We are the first
equipment supplier in the telecoms industry to go public, giving investors
the opportunity to become directly involved in one of the fastest expanding
industries.'
He pointed to industry research forecasting the number of mobile subscribers
worldwide rising from 30.5m in 1994 to 125m in 2000.
The company's development has been funded through borrowings and venture
capital, most of which will be repaid following the flotation. Between
Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m has been earmarked to expand production facilities
in Yorkshire, Glasgow, Maryland and New Hampshire.
Prof Rhodes said the company wanted to increase its share of the
fast-growing south-east Asian market.
The company supplies most of the leading telecoms manufacturers in the
world, and has replaced AT&amp;T's in-house filter production facility.

<TEXT>
Enviromed, the biotechnology group, has bought F&amp;H Baxter (Holdings), a
dental equipment and supplies company, for Pounds 7.42m.
Enviromed also proposes to raise Pounds 2.7m by the placing and open offer
of 3.6m 8 per cent convertible redeemable preference shares at 100p. The
shares are being offered to existing shareholders on the basis of two for
every 13 ordinary shares.
The acquisition will be satisfied as to Pounds 2.1m by the issue of 1.7m
ordinary shares, Pounds 3.72m in variable rate guaranteed unsecured loan
notes, and Pounds 1.6m in cash. Of the cash consideration, Pounds 1.38m will
be deferred until the Inland Revenue agrees to offset Baxter's advance
corporation tax liability arising before September 1994 against mainstream
corporation tax.
Turnover for Baxter for the year ended August 31 1993 was Pounds 19.1m
(Pounds 18.2m) for pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.59m).

FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: NatPower goes to law over US deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the electricity company, has filed a law suit against
Transco Energy of Houston, a gas trading company, in a dispute arising from
a Dollars 150m (Pounds 97m) deal between the two companies last year.
It says Transco 'materially mis-stated' the value of Tren-Fuels, a fuel
services subsidiary of the Tevco power stations company bought by National
Power in the deal.
Tren-Fuels, was valued at Dollars 17m to Dollars 25m at the time of the
purchase in June last year, according to the law suit.
National Power said it invested another Dollars 6m in Tren-Fuels. But when
it hired an investment banking company to sell the subsidiary, the highest
offer was Pounds 1,000, according to the suit.
Under the agreement, Transco is obliged to refund a portion of the Tevco
purchase price if National Power sells Tren-Fuels for a loss within five
years.
National Power accuses Tren-Fuels of violating federal and state securities
laws.
It acknowledges in the suit that Transco has accused it of failing to expend
enough effort in trying to sell Tren-Fuels.
National Power said yesterday that it hoped to reach a settlement with
Transco. It did not feel the dispute was material in the context of its US
business.

FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd's trust seeks funds from HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Hong Kong are being targetted by the backers of a new corporate
capital scheme for the Lloyd's insurance market.
Venton Underwriting Agencies said on Friday that it was aiming to persuade
both wealthy individuals and institutions in Hong Kong, as well as investors
from Bermuda and the UK, to provide some Pounds 25m in capital for a new
Lloyd's investment company, originally announced last month.
Meanwhile, a planned venture involving JIB Group, an insurance broker in
which the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Jardine Mattheson owns a majority
stake, could also look to east Asia for support. JIB and Swiss Bank
Corporation, have jointly formed Jardine Lloyd's Advisers, which will advise
Lloyd's members.
Its founders are understood to be looking to raise between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 50m for the investment trust, which would support a range of
syndicates at Lloyd's. The market raised some Pounds 800m for a range of
corporate capital vehicles last year, with UK institutions providing the
bulk of the money.
This year interest in the UK has declined. Some agencies are looking further
afield.
Venton, which is working with Bermuda's Butterfield Securities on its deal,
is offering investors 100p shares in the new company for only 20p, the
balance of capital required being supplied in the form of a letter of credit
or other collateral.
'The capital structure . . . offers an exceptionally advantageous gearing
ratio on the actual cash amount subscribed whilst retaining the benefits of
limited liability,' said the group.
The venture, still subject to Lloyd's approval, aims to supply capital only
to Venton's three syndicates and is one of a number of so-called 'dedicated'
funds being developed at the market.
Most of the money raised last year supports a series of stock market listed
investment trusts, which support a range of agencies and syndicates.
Venton said it had no immediate plans to seek a stock market listing for
Venton Underwriting Group, and would raise the money through a private
placement. Prior to any listing Butterfield Securities, will provide a
matched bargain facility for the shares.
Mr Jeremy Venton, senior underwriter, said he saw corporate capital as a
more reliable long-term source of funds than the individual Names.
Venton plans to increase capacity - the amount of premiums its syndicates
can underwrite - from Pounds 127m in 1994 to Pounds 185m in 1995.

FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook 'unaffected' by bankruptcy moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the transport leasing group, yesterday continued to insist that it
was unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Robert Montague, its
founder and chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has issued a bankruptcy petition over a Pounds
2.3m loan to Mr Montague. Reports at the weekend suggested that he has debts
of about Pounds 30m.
Mr Montague has considerable assets, including a large estate in Oxfordshire
and a home in Knightsbridge. However, his shareholding in Tiphook, once
worth more than Pounds 18m, is now worth about Pounds 1m.
The Royal Bank of Scotland loan is understood to be linked to the farming
businesses in Oxfordshire. Changes in the terms of the loan are thought to
have been under negotiation for some time.
News of the bankruptcy proceedings emerged at last Thursday's annual meeting
and took Mr Montague and the board by surprise. The group's bankers and Mr
Ian Clubb, its newly appointed chairman, are continuing to support Mr
Montague.
If he were to be declared bankrupt, he would have to step down from the
board, which has declared that he is key to the group's survival.
The directors were clearly shocked at the circumstances of the bankruptcy
revelations by a shareholder representative at the AGM, where Mr Montague
was already under attack over his remuneration. However, sources close to
Tiphook remain adamant that he will survive this latest indignity.

FT  19 SEP 94 / SA bank plans syndicated loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A South African bank is to launch the first syndicated loan by a South
African company since 1985, marking an important step in the country's
return to international capital markets after its first all-race elections
in May.
Rand Merchant Bank, one of South Africa's three largest investment banks, is
to borrow Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) from a syndicate of international banks
within the next two weeks, according to Citibank, the US bank which is
arranging the deal.
Although the amount is relatively small, larger deals are likely to follow.
Gencor, the South African mining company, is expected to come to the
syndicated loans market at the end of this year with a seven-year Dollars
537.5m loan to help finance the company's acquisition of Shell's Billiton
metals and minerals business.
These loans are emerging as South Africa seeks a debt rating from the
international rating agencies, and follow the completion in July of the
first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African company, a
Dollars 300m deal for Liberty Life, the country's largest life insurance
company. South Africa plans to tap the international bond market, when it
has acquired a rating.
Many international banks are keen to lend to South Africa which is viewed as
a high growth area but which has been largely closed as a result of
sanctions.
In a syndicated loan, one or two banks arrange a transaction and parcel out
portions of the loan in order to share the risk.
Citibank, which is in the process of sounding out interest among other
banks, said the loan will have a final maturity of one year with individual
drawings maturing in 90 to 180 days. It said European banks are expected to
be the main participants but also reported strong interest from the Middle
East.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Too many little piggies come to market: UK farmers' efforts
to escape from a deep trough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most pigs to be slaughtered in the UK this week will be sold at a loss of
about Pounds 3.40 per animal as the pig industry remains in the deep trough
of a year-old recession. Even for an industry used to the ups and downs of
the production cycle, the latest downturn has hit producers hard.
Pig farming is not cushioned by subsidies under the Common Agricultural
Policy, unlike most other sectors of European agriculture, which means
producers must rely on the vagaries of the free market. This has seen
farmers losing up to Pounds 7 on every pig sold when prices dropped to an
all-time low last October.
The severity of the recent downturn has pushed many individual producers out
of business and forced companies to rethink their commitment to pig farming.
Dalgety, the food and agribusiness company, which last week pointed to the
slump in the European market as a dampener on its annual profits, says it
will leave pig farming altogether within the next year.
Pig producers have been operating below break-even for most of the past year
except for a brief respite in May when prices rose above the cost of
production for four to six weeks. Pigs operate in a typical farm commodity
cycle whereby high prices encourage over-production which leads to a slump
in the market.
But the National Farmers' Union complains that the pig cycle - the period
between the peaks and lows in price - used to take five years, but has
recently speeded up to two. Added to that, the current downturn has lasted
longer than usual.
There are a number of factors behind the recent decline. It started in 1991
with the re-unification of Germany when up to 60 per cent of the former East
Germany's swine herd was culled - a factor which depressed pork prices
across the European Union. After that, reform of the CAP in 1992 with its
planned cuts in cereals prices, encouraged many arable farmers to re-direct
some of their farming effort into pigs. France also offered state aids to
some pig producers as a way of ensuring they stayed in production.
Those payments have since been condemned by the European Commission, which
called on the producers to repay subsidies received. But these factors in
the EU market led to 4 per cent over-supply or 700,000 tonnes of pork last
year.
'We've been reducing our involvement in pigs on the feeding side over the
past three years. We've now got only 30 per cent of the sows we did have,'
said Mr Mick Hazzledine, general manager of Dalgety's livestock division. He
predicts Dalgety will have disposed of its remaining pig schemes within a
year.
Dalgety will stay in the high-tech business of selling breeding stock
through its Pig Improvement Company subsidiary.
Others are cutting back or getting out. Unigate, the dairy company, sold its
remaining 6,500 pigs last month, and Daisy Hill Pigs, part of the Usborne
animal feeds group, is to cut its number of sows from 15,500 to 9,000.
But BOCM Pauls, the agribusiness unit of Harrisons and Crosfield, is bucking
the trend and actually expanding its involvement in pigs even though Mr
George Paul, chief executive, says the company lost Pounds 3m on this
business over the past year.
'We called some consultants in to have a very critical look at our business
earlier this year,' Mr Paul said. 'They concluded that the UK does not have
any inherent disadvantages in pig production compared with its European
competitors and that our business is one of the most efficient in the
sector. That's why we decided to expand - an upturn has got to come sooner
or later.'
BOCM Pauls runs the biggest pig production unit in the country as a joint
venture with J. Sainsbury, the supermarket group. Breckland Farms in Norfolk
produces 3,000 pigs a week.
The company also has pigs of its own which farmers look after for a fee. As
part of its expansion plans, it has taken on pigs from the Malton Bacon
factory owned by Unigate and the pig operations of Louis Dreyfuss, the grain
trading company.
These pigs are raised on farms to which BOCM supplies the feed and then pays
farmers a fee for caring for them as well as a bonus for good performance.
While farmers are guaranteed a steady income, the feed company has to absorb
the profit and loss on the sale of the pigs.
Agribusiness companies have traditionally been involved in pig production as
a way of securing outlets for their feed. But Mr Hazzledine says that
farmers sometimes see them as competitors and blame them for distortions in
the market. They are willing to absorb losses for longer than individual
farmers which can distort free market signals.
This could be one reason for the slowness of prices to bounce back from
recent lows. The Meat and Livestock Commission, the UK industry's
promotional organisation, reports last week's price at 99.6p per kg of dead
weight. But the industry's benchmark for breaking even is generally put at
105p per kg which means farmers are still losing money.
The European herd has contracted this year, but supply remains higher than
static levels of consumption and prices are recovering only gradually.

Half-year figures on Wednesday will show a dramatic turnround from last

Pounds 70m, up from Pounds 20m in the first half of last year. The dividend

Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer, is expected tomorrow to
announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 247m, from
Pounds 235m last year, adjusting for new depreciation policies and before
Pounds 4m property losses. Some recovery in margins is expected, but
uncertainty over the extent of this, and over the fortunes of the Catteau

FT  19 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): More losses expected at troubled
bank - Credit Lyonnais/Michelin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, France's state-owned bank, is expected to report another
large loss when it announces its first half results on Thursday, with
earnings depressed by the general fall in credit demand in France and
weighed down by continued bad loan provisions. Its chairman, Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, had earlier predicted that the banking group, which recorded a
1993 net loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 831m) after FFr17.8bn worth of provisions,
would break even in the second half of this year and return to profit in
1995.
But the group has taken longer to clean up its balance sheet than it
expected, and though it has not uncovered any major new problems, it is
likely to have to make further provisions for doubtful loans and investments
by its Althus and SDBO subsidiaries. As a result, analysts expect a first
half net loss well above the FFr1.05bn loss reported for the same period of
1993.
Michelin, the French tyre-making company, will announce first half results
tomorrow which will reveal the extent of recovery at the group.
Last year, Michelin suffered net losses of FFr3.67bn, reflecting the impact
of restructuring costs and the depressed state of the European automobile
industry. This year, most analysts are expecting a sharp improvement as the
benefits of recovery feed through.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): World Cup surge is good for
brewing profits - Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The luck of the Irish football team in the World Cup is thought to have been
good for Guinness, the spirits and brewing group which reports its interim
results on Thursday.
Sales of the famous stout surged on both sides of the Atlantic as fans drank
in celebration of Ireland's progress to the last 16 teams. Guinness, which
sponsored the Irish team, became the fastest growing imported beer in the
US.
The City is expecting pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June
to come in around Pounds 320m, compared with a restated Pounds 305m
previously. The group's strong cash flow is expected to result in a sharply
lower interest charge from the previous Pounds 98m.
Mr Tony Greener, who took over as chairman at the beginning of last year,
warned at the annual general meeting in May that there was no sign of
generally improved market conditions, but he did forecast modest profit
growth for the half year.
Operating profits from brewing, which last year contributed Pounds 99m, are
expected to rise, lifted by higher sales in Ireland and Malaysia, where the
market had suffered under duty increases.
There could be signs that the market in Spain, where Guinness operates the
Cruzcampo brewery, is beginning to improve.
But Guinness makes the bulk of its profits in the spirits market, where it
sells dozens of brands. Conditions have been tough as recession has hit the
group's big markets in the US, UK, and Japan.
Operating profits are expected to be flat, but there are signs of a recovery
in volumes in the UK, while the group is gaining market share in the US.
The City hopes that Mr Greener will announce a new managing director for
United Distillers to replace Mr Crispin Davis, who resigned almost a year
ago.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Britain and US propose IMF support for poorer members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and the US have launched an initiative to allow the International
Monetary Fund to boost the official reserves of former communist states and
other less prosperous member countries.
The treasuries of the two nations are working on a compromise package that
would break many years of deadlock and enable the IMF to issue up to Dollars
23.44bn (Pounds 15.1bn) worth of its own reserve asset, known as the special
drawing right (SDR). The main purpose of the issue would be to strengthen
the finances of those IMF members which have joined the fund since the last
SDR issue was made in 1981.
It is understood that the two countries have suggested the issue of between
SDR12bn (Pounds 11.3bn) and SDR16bn should be aimed at overcoming the unfair
treatment of 37 'late entrants' into the IMF, including Russia and most of
the other members of the former eastern block.
The details of the Anglo-US initiative are unclear. But it would have to
satisfy those countries which have backed Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF
managing director, in his campaign for a general SDR36bn allocation among
all the fund's members, and a minority of IMF member states, led by Germany,
which have been reluctant to countenance any SDR issue.
Germany will play a pivotal role in any agreement. The Bundesbank, which
holds Germany's reserves, has long opposed a general SDR issue on the
grounds that it could be inflationary and that there is no reason for such a
boost to global liquidity. More recently, however, the Bundesbank has
indicated that it might support a 'one-off' issue of SDRs, provided it was
directed at solving the problem of the unfair treatment of recently joined
IMF members.
For the Bundesbank, one attraction of such a selective 'equity' issue of
SDRs is that it would have to be agreed by 85 per cent of the IMF membership
and be the subject of legislative change and ratification by member
governments. This difficult procedure would prevent setting a precedent for
global money creation by the IMF without legislative hurdles.
A general SDR increase, such as that being proposed by Mr Camdessus, would
require only the backing of the fund's executive board of countries,
representing 85 per cent of the voting rights.
Mr Camdessus says an SDR issue is necessary to help meet an estimated need
for SDR400bn of extra liquidity over the next five years to finance growth
of world trade.

Sweden's Social Democratic party swept back to power in yesterday's general
election, as a strong swing to the left led to the defeat of Mr Carl Bildt's
right-centre coalition government.
The Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, a former prime minister,
fell short of a parliamentary majority but indicated they would form a
minority government relying on centre parties to back them on the main
economic policies.
The Social Democrats won 45.6 per cent of the vote, a strong rebound from
37.7 per cent in the last election in September 1991.
Mr Bildt quickly conceded defeat. His four-party coalition, led by his
conservative Moderate party, tumbled to a combined 41.1 per cent from 46.7
per cent three years ago. The former communist Left party won 6.1 per cent,
while the Environment party was returned to parliament for the first time
since 1988 with 5 per cent. The rightwing New Democracy party, which backed
Mr Bildt's government, failed to clear the 4 per cent hurdle to win any
seats.
The outcome is the 'nightmare scenario' for financial markets concerned that
a Social Democratic government dependent on the left might be unable to
implement tough policies to tackle Sweden's deep budget deficit and
fast-rising public debt.
Mr Carlsson's preferred option of forming a coalition with the Liberal
party, a member of Mr Bildt's government, was undermined by the poor Liberal
performance, their vote slipping to 7.1 per cent from 9.1 per cent three
years ago. But Mr Carlsson indicated he would form a minority government,
saying it was 'not realistic' to form a coalition with the Left party or the
Environment party.
He promised 'very strong measures' to tackle public finances. 'Our main
priority will be an economic policy which gets down the budget deficit,
stabilises the state debt and reduces unemployment,' he said.
In the election campaign, the Social Democrats proposed a series of public
spending cuts to help reduce a budget deficit expected to total the
equivalent of 11 per cent of gross national product this year and stabilise
the public debt (close to 100 per cent of GNP) by 1998.
But they came under strong attack from industry for including in their
SKr61bn (Pounds 5.2bn) budget saving package a raft of income and capital
tax increases.
Mr Carlsson will have to turn his attention quickly to the referendum on
November 13 on Sweden's proposal to join the European Union from January 1
next year. The Social Democratic leadership is in favour, but public opinion
is still divided.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Telecoms ministers stress role of global 'highway'

<TEXT>
The early construction of a global information 'superhighway' is critical to
achieving balanced economic growth over the next century, telecommunications
ministers from nearly 50 countries will declare this week.
A draft of the communique from a ministerial meeting, to be held in Kyoto,
Japan, this week, focuses on telecoms expansion as a key element in economic
advance in developed and less developed countries.
The communique, due to be released on Thursday, is likely to be less
explicit about the best means for fostering telecoms expansion, despite
recent strong pressure from the US and international agencies in favour of
privatisation and competition.
The ministers' meeting is being sponsored by Japan's ministry of posts and
telecommunications to coincide with a plenipotentiary conference of the
International Telecommunications Union, to be held in Kyoto from today.
Although several major regional groups, including the EU's Bangemann
committee, have examined the implications of new superhighways, the
ministers' meeting will be the first high-level gathering at which both
developed and developing countries address the issue.
It is likely to have a significant impact on a Group of Seven industrialised
nations meeting set for next February to discuss a global information
network.
The Kyoto communique, prepared from statements submitted by participating
countries, emphasises the desirability of developing 'superhighway'
infrastructures on a global basis so advanced information and communications
services can be provided to every country and region as soon as possible.
Although subject to modification based on discussion during the meeting, it
reflects strong concern among developing countries that they could be left
behind in the modernisation of international telecoms.
Most developing countries have fewer than five telephone lines per 100
people, compared with more than 40 per head across the developed world. The
developed world is also far ahead in the use of mobile communications.
According to a senior official at the Japanese ministry: 'Information will
become more and more important for economic activity, particularly as the
implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement makes the flow of goods and
services increasingly smooth.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the D-Mark this month reflects
uncertainty over the outcome of the forthcoming federal elections in
Germany, coupled with the apprehension that monetary policy in the two
countries is set to diverge as Swiss short-term interest rates rise. The
strength of the Swiss franc - against the US dollar as well as the D-mark
and other European currencies - may delay the implementation of rate
increases, but there is no doubting Switzerland's enhanced attractions as
the safest of Europe's safe havens.
Whether this means that Switzerland's financial markets are due for a
prolonged bout of outperformance vis a vis their German counterparts, is
another matter. Arguably the Swiss franc is overvalued on a purchasing power
parity basis, limiting the scope for a further widening of the differential
between yields on Swiss and German bonds. As for equities, Switzerland has
underperformed European markets by 10 per cent since the course of US
monetary policy changed in early February, and is likely to continue to do.
This is partly due to the currency effect, which depresses earnings at
Switzerland's multinational corporations, as evident from the muted first
half earnings growth reported by Nestle last week.
The Swiss market, which outperformed Germany earlier in the economic cycle,
now gives investors less geared exposure to recovery than Germany, where
analysts expect that, thanks to restructuring, corporate earnings will rise
by 80 per cent this year and 40 per cent next.

FT  19 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate earnings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With input prices rising faster than output prices the risk of a UK
corporate margins squeeze appears of more than academic interest. The worry
is that the earnings and dividend expectations underpinning the London
equity market may have failed to include such problems and are therefore
over-optimistic. The realisation that the City could have been anticipating
unrealistic earnings growth is undoubtedly contributing to the present stock
market turbulence.
The conundrum is whether the experiences reported this month by APV and BTR
were special cases and their margin squeezes specific. The alternative view
is that they represent the harbinger of a more general round of
disappointing results. After all, a trend starts with individual examples.
For the moment, APV's and BTR's problems look exceptional, though
nonetheless worrying. APV suffered specifically from a German competitor
trying to elbow its way into one of its markets through aggressive pricing.
As for BTR, only a small minority of its businesses actually experienced
shrinking margins. By contrast, Cookson, Bowater and Arjo Wiggins Appleton
reported little difficulty passing on the cost of raw material price rises.
Nevertheless, the market will be sensitive to any additional margins
disappointments that might indicate a real trend. Given so much is expected,
those companies failing to match the City's hopes are likely to be find
themselves severely punished.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may look like an excess of Teutonic efficiency that Germany has set today
as the deadline for investment bankers to apply for a role in Deutsche
Telekom's privatisation. After all, the first shares are not due to be sold
until 1996. Nevertheless, there is much to be said for Germany's forward
planning. Many questions need to be answered before a sale, including how
Telekom's balance sheet should be restructured and when its markets should
be opened to competition. It makes sense to take such decisions in the light
of how potential investors might react.
Telekom's balance sheet is a mess. The burden of building a network in east
Germany has pushed gearing over 300 per cent. As capital spending drops,
gearing will fall too. But massive depreciation charges will continue to
weigh down profitability for years. This suggests that earnings could be
tarted up by writing down Telekom's east German network. The snag is that a
substantial write-down could destroy an already ropy balance sheet. There
is, though, a way of squaring the circle: at the same time as overvalued
equipment is written down, Telekom's undervalued property assets could be
revalued.
Ministers will also need to decide when Telekom's infrastructure monopoly
should go. The company itself wants to cling to it for as long as possible.
But, paradoxically, this may not be best for potential investors. The sooner
the monopoly goes, the sooner Telekom will come under pressure to improve
efficiency and the sooner it can expect to be freed from the obligations
that come with holding a monopoly.

The growth rate of Glaxo's R&amp;D spending is decelerating fast. Increases of
25 per cent and 24 per cent during 1992 and 1993 have been followed by a
budgeted rise of only 16 per cent this year. The company expects the budget
to advance only 4.8 per cent in 1995. Part of this reflects Glaxo's own
development programme which has just completed a particularly busy period.
But the slowdown also underscores a more general trend. Last year 11 of the
top 12 US groups moderated the growth of their R&amp;D spending. Three actually
cut their budgets.
The slackening rate of R&amp;D spending is not necessarily damaging for the
sector which had been raising R&amp;D budgets to unsustainable levels. Worldwide
R&amp;D investment expanded from Dollars 5.5bn in 1981 to an astonishing Dollars
30bn last year. To obtain a return of 10 per cent on that sum by 2004, the
world drugs market would have to reach Dollars 448bn, compared with a
present size of about Dollars 200bn. That would require market growth of 8.4
per cent a year, more than double the present rate.
Concerns that slowing investment growth will mean fewer innovative medicines
are unjustified. Much of the recent rise in spending was used to create
worldwide development capabilities. For most groups these are now in place.
Moreover, the waste in the pharmaceuticals industry has been legendary, with
R&amp;D departments among the worst offenders. Drugs groups will have to raise
their productivity by spending their money more wisely. Those failing to do
so will prove incapable of finding the new medicines necessary for survival.

<TEXT>
Sweden's Social Democratic party was last night set to return to power after
defeating Mr Carl Bildt's centre-right coalition in yesterday's general
election, according to early results.
A computer projection, based on almost 20 per cent of the total votes,
predicted a sharp swing to the left, but indicated that the the Social
Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, a former prime minister, would fail to
win a parliamentary majority.
The Social Democrats, who ruled Sweden for most of the past 60 years, were
set to win 45.3 per cent of the vote, easily enough to defeat Mr Bildt's
three-year-old, four-party coalition government. The reformist coalition was
seen to be winning a combined total of 40.8 per cent down from the 46.7 per
cent it gained in the 1991 election. Its rightwing ally, the New Democracy
party, was also set to fail to win re-election to the parliament.
According to the results, Mr Carlsson will have to decide whether to form a
minority Social Democratic government or seek a formal coalition with at
least one smaller party to gain a majority in the Riksdag.
The Left party, a traditional Social Democratic ally, and the Environment
party, were set to hold the balance of power with strongly improved results
compared to 1991. But Mr Carlsson has indicated he might seek an alliance
with the Liberal party, a member of the current government.
Mr Bildt's minority coalition won the 1991 election when the Social
Democrats slumped to their worst result for decades, winning only 37.7 per
cent of the vote. The government promised radical market reforms to
revitalise an economy weighed down by extensive welfare provisions.
But it was hit by the worst recession since the 1930s which shrank the
economy by 5 per cent over three years. The most urgent problem facing the
new government is a recession-induced crisis in the public finances. Sweden
last year ran a recession-inflated budget deficit equivalent to 13 per cent
of gross national product, one of the worst in Europe. The public debt will
soon exceed 100 per cent of GNP and is the fastest-rising among members of
the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.
Uncertainty about the shape of the new government and its policies has led
in recent months to a sharp rise in interest rates, undermined the value of
the Swedish krona and led reduced growth forecasts for next year. The
financial markets were hoping the election would produce a stable government
that would quickly adopt tough fiscal policies.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Leading Article: No quick fix in Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even though Mr Jimmy Carter succeeded in reaching a deal with Haiti's
military junta to avert an invasion, the Clinton administration is making a
mistake if it is hoping for a brief engagement with this troublesome and
unhappy nation.
US armed forces will not be deployed for an attack, but American finance and
support for the country - as part of a broad international effort - will be
needed over the long term if Haiti is not to slide back to dictatorship or
anarchy. The US decision to intervene makes a long-term commitment to Haiti
its moral responsibility; without such a commitment, Haiti will all too soon
re-emerge as a thorn in Washington's side.
Some will argue that US intervention in Haiti is in itself a mistake, and Mr
Clinton can certainly be criticised for the confused and contradictory way
he has handled the issue in the past two years. He came close to boxing
himself into a corner from which the unpopular option of invasion seemed the
only exit.
Yet that does not mean that the threat of an assault was wrong in principle.
Restoring democracy and human rights within Haiti are laudable objectives.
The fact that the US cannot act everywhere should not prevent it from acting
to restore democracy when that is within its power.
The more appropriate question is whether US intervention is likely to
achieve its objectives in a nation that, in 190 years of independence, has
known only a few months of rule by freely-elected government.
Clearly, ousting Haiti's current crop of military leaders will, of itself,
not resolve the problem. If the armed forces and the police are not purged
and professionalised, it will be only a matter of time before the next
military coup. This is a proper subject for international advice and
support.
However, Haiti's needs will not end there. The entire state - a bloated and
inefficient civil service, a corrupt judiciary, barely functioning public
enterprises - needs an overhaul. The country's dilapidated infrastructure
needs renewing and enlarging. Most urgently, the poorest country in the
western hemisphere needs humanitarian aid.
In this task, the international financial institutions have a critical role
to play: donor countries should move quickly to provide support so that
Haiti's arrears to these institutions do not prevent them from providing
finance.
It is, of course, on the Haitian people that the establishment of democracy
will ultimately depend - and on President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the priest
deposed by the military in 1991 after seven months in office. While
unquestionably the rightful head of state, he has not convinced everybody of
his democratic credentials.
He has been criticised for not eradicating human rights abuses while
president, and for statements in which he apparently incited supporters to
violence - though it is true that during his brief tenure in office, he was
under pressure from enemies for whom democracy and the rule of law had no
meaning. Having invoked democracy to return to Port-au-Prince, Mr Aristide
must live by its rules when he arrives there. His statement that he will
stand down when his five-year term ends next year, as the constitution
demands, is thus welcome.
Yet fulfilling the high expectations of his supporters will not be easy. If
democracy in Haiti is to have a chance, a long-term international commitment
to the country is essential.

General Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of the British forces during the
Gulf war, appears just as talented at getting investors to part with their
money as he was at marshalling the troops.
He is apparently flourishing as a director of Robert Fleming, where he has
responsibility for the Middle East, a post he took up two years ago. He has
been raking in buy orders for the current Dollars 750m offering of vouchers
in Pakistan's telecoms company, which Fleming is handling on behalf of the
Pakistani government.
Indeed, some non-resident Pakistani individuals in the Middle East have
placed orders running to Dollars 20m apiece.
No doubt this reflects more a faith in their mother country's phone system
than undying gratitude for Sir Peter's part in hounding out Saddam Hussein -
thereby safeguarding their wealth.

Birgit Breuel, 57, head of Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency, must be
hoping the media will finally stop pestering her, now that she has been
appointed head of Expo 2000, the world exhibition beano to be held in
Hanover at the turn of the century.
It might be thought an odd move for her. Breuel's experience at privatising
the east German economy - and not suffering fools gladly in the process -
surely could have opened up any number of top political jobs after October's
federal elections, assuming Helmut Kohl wins again. After all, she was
finance minister of Lower Saxony from 1986-1990.
Then again, there's been talk that she would be snapped up by industry.
No one is suggesting Expo 2000 won't be challenging. But it could not be as
exhausting as the effort to get the east German economy back on its feet.
Still, Breuel, who leaves the Treuhand next April after four years in
Berlin, always said she wanted to spend more time with her family. No doubt
she will pursue that course industriously.

Foreigners bemused at British willingness to form orderly queues for London
buses are probably unaware that the long arm of the law is at work. London
Transport has some byelaws aimed at keeping order at its bus stops and on
its underground platforms.
Of course, as they were drawn up in 1938 - imposing fines of up to forty
shillings, or Pounds 2, for offences such as queue-jumping or queueing more
than two abreast - ignorance may be excusable, especially as there is no
record of recent prosecutions.
Perversely, LT is now considering scrapping such regulations. So as well as
a mad scramble for national health service hospital beds or a desk at the
better state schools, we shall all be fighting tooth and nail to get on the
buses.
Such is progress.

Clearly disgruntled with the South African government's foot-dragging in
restructuring apartheid-era institutions, Benny Alexander, the ebullient
secretary general of the radical Pan Africanist Congress, has struck his own
blow for change.
It registers scarcely a squeak on the Richter scale of international
explosions, entailing an alteration of his name to 'Khoisan X' and a
denunciation of his previous appellation as 'a symbol of victory for our
former oppressor.'
Khoi, explains the former Alexander, who claims descent from the indigenous
Khoisan peoples of the Cape, means 'one who can manage people.' And the X?
That is 'a mathematical variable denoting that which exists but is yet to be
accurately identified.' Oh yeah, of course.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Intervention in Haiti? Been there, done that. President Clinton has asked
Poland to send along a few armed policemen to help winkle out Port au
Prince's finest. Trouble is, they've been there before. And it was trouble,
too.
Today the Polish cabinet considers Clinton's invitation, aware that a
previous Polish intervention - as part of an 1802 Napoleonic task force,
whose mission was to defeat a slave rising led by Francois Toussaint
L'Ouverture - ended in tears. Many of the 6,000 Polish troops who passed
through the island died of yellow fever; still others decided the slaves had
a point, and joined forces.
Around 500 settled for good, and Polish surnames and Slavic complexions are
sprinkled across some Haitian villages, where catholicism remains strong.
Ethnographers say some Polish curses remain in use, while several hymn tunes
are recognisably Polish in origin.
A mere 500 returned from the Caribbean in the aftermath of a tragic episode,
which taught Poles that the alliance with Napoleon - designed to win them
their freedom - could lead to quite the opposite for others.
President Lech Walesa, keen to join Nato, backs Clinton's request and is
urging the government to follow suit, no doubt in the belief that this time
the Poles will be on the side of the angels. Or at least quickly return
home.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Kuchma's task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the west dispatches firemen to small embattled nations throughout the
globe, Ukraine is quietly emerging as one of the next major tests of the new
world order. Ukraine must implement radical economic reforms and the west
must help to pay for them.
Kiev's capacity for producing disaster is enormous. The current, farcical
power struggle in the break-away Crimean peninsula is one symptom of
festering regional tensions in Ukraine, but if the economy deteriorates
further Ukraine's separatist comedies could turn into the tragedy of civil
war.
Given Ukraine's location on the edge of a more economically robust, but
politically still fragile, eastern Europe, civil strife would be bad enough.
Yet Ukraine's proximity to Russia makes it even more dangerous. Given most
Russians' view that Ukraine is a natural part of their country, the
temptation for Moscow to meddle in a war-torn or destitute Ukraine would be
as attractive as it could prove fatal. Russian involvement in a Ukrainian
civil war would make it the most threatening conflict in Eurasia. Moreover,
a Russian effort to reabsorb Ukraine would break Russia's tentative hold on
democracy because it would require authoritarian measures in Russia itself.
With the election of President Leonid Kuchma in July, a chance to avert
these nightmare scenarios has emerged. Mr Kuchma appears to have understood
that Ukraine cannot survive intact without the economic prosperity which
only radical market reforms can bring.
His task, paradoxically, may be easier than it seems because the previous,
inept government inadvertently inflicted much of the shock of transition on
the country's economy: energy prices are nearly at world levels and the deep
industrial decline which all of eastern Europe experienced has already
happened in Ukraine.
If Mr Kuchma were to add therapy to the shock, he could emerge as a
political hero and his country could prosper. But to do that, he needs
western assistance.
Ukraine is too important, and too potentially disastrous, for half measures.
If Kiev begins reforms, Ukraine must rapidly receive significant western
financing along the lines of the Dollars 4bn promised at this summer's G-7
summit. That money would help support the painful measures Mr Kuchma must
implement: price liberalisation, budgetary discipline, currency
stabilisation, liberalisation of transactions on the current account and
rapid small-scale privatisation. By helping Kiev to pay for the energy
Russia now sells at close to world prices and covering part of the large
budget deficit that even a reformist Ukrainian government could not
initially avoid, the west could give Ukraine a fighting chance.
Ukraine will not survive as a country without radical economic reforms.
Paying for them now would be far cheaper for the west than coping with a
collapsed Ukraine in 12 months time.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Europe in the Pacific century: The west must show greater
sensitivity in its dealings with east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vancouver seems an ideal place to await the Pacific era in a spirit of
optimism: a city of breathtaking ocean views and burgeoning Asian
communities, where Chinese calligraphers play hockey and speak with purring
Canadian accents.
While the city may be forging an Asian-North American future with Confucian
serenity, the scholars and policymakers who gathered there a week ago for a
conference of the International Institute of Strategic Studies were not.
Amid well-rehearsed observations on the rising economic importance of
trans-Pacific links, the conference heard some rather more disturbing ideas.
In their most extreme form, they spelt out a 21st century vision of Europe
relegated to an exhausted backwater and America forced to seek partners on
Asian terms.
The economic case for the Pacific century is impressive. Last year,
trans-Pacific trade amounted to Dollars 330bn, exceeding trade across the
Atlantic by 50 per cent; in five years, the ratio could be 2 to 1 in the
larger ocean's favour.
The number of hours devoted by the American administration to political and,
above all, commercial ties with Asian partners is correspondingly on the
rise.
But, as North Americans at the IISS either acknowledged themselves - or were
told bluntly by their Asian counterparts - it looks increasingly likely that
the Asians will be setting the pace for the new intercontinental love
affair.
Washington's recent decision to decouple trade with China from human rights
was hailed as an overdue conversion to the Asian principle of
non-interference.
Similarly, America's swing from lofty interventionism to pure mercantilism
in ties with east Asia was seen as a sign of 'open-mindedness' and
'flexibility' - a welcome reminder of America's freedom from the arrogance
of Europe's former colonial powers, said one senior south-east Asian
official.
Europe, by contrast, was in bad odour all round. Chided as usual for its
colonial past, protectionism and old-world snobbishness, the old continent
faced a newer charge: it was hostile to Moslems.
As the conference was reminded, the mainly Moslem nations of Malaysia and
Indonesia are highly sensitive to Europe's attitudes to Islam. 'There is a
perception in south-east Asia that Europe is hostile towards Islam,' said a
Singapore-based analyst of the region. 'There has been little effort to put
to rest Moslems' concerns that they are viewed as a threat to Christian
civilisation.'
Western Europe was attacked for its faint-heartedness over Bosnia, its
reluctance to admit Turkey to the European Union, and connivance in the
suppression of Islamic forces in Algeria.
How can Europeans respond to this bewildering array of charges? They are not
merely economic losers, swaggering imperialists with outsize egos and
shrinking wallets, they are anti-Moslem to boot.
Wherever the answer lies, it does not lie in trying to please everyone.
Europe will not convert the fundamentalists of Algeria into partners and
soul-mates by embracing them unconditionally; nor can it be sure of gaining
merit in the eyes of south-east Asian, or other Moslems, by greater
involvement in Bosnia.
It is easy to imagine a scenario in which scores of British or French troops
die in an unequal struggle to defend Bosnia's Moslem enclaves - and western
embassies, from Ankara to Jakarta, are still surrounded by demonstrators
denouncing the treachery of Christendom.
But there are surely some lessons for Europeans to draw from the brick-bats
flying in Vancouver's bracing sea breeze.
Europeans must be more sensitive, in dealings with east Asia, to
anti-colonial sentiment that is nearer the surface than most Britons, French
or Dutchmen guess. Forgetting is easier for the coloniser than the
colonised.
Europeans also need to be absolutely clear, with themselves and others,
about the limits of their influence: their ability to right wrongs and tilt
regional balances.
One of the most palpable legacies of colonialism in Europe is the
instinctive tendency of many people to regard all the problems of the world,
from Santiago to Cape Town to Sarajevo, as well within their own capacity to
solve. Ironically, this imperialist mentality has a strong grip on the
political left - both in Europe and the US.
Whenever western Europe exaggerates its influence over the internal or
external policies of third countries, it risks losing out both ways: lacking
real influence but still seen as a handy scapegoat.
That does not mean that either Europe or America should make a headlong rush
from interventionism to pure commercialism. There are still important
'policing' tasks for the west, in Asia as elsewhere - particularly in arms
proliferation. But in future, they will have to be carried out in
partnership with the rising nations of the east, and with due regard to
their sensitivities.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Jaw-jaw in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland are displaying remarkable
political skill in their efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. On
Friday Mr John Major undertook that any new arrangement for the governance
of Ulster will be put before a referendum. Yesterday Mr Albert Reynolds said
that there would be no united Ireland for at least 20 years, and that even
then the matter would be determined by popular vote.
Both statements are implicit in the joint declaration issued by the two
heads of government last December. The essence of that statement was that
future constitutional changes on the island of Ireland were to be based on
the principle of self-determination, exercised north and south. Mr Reynolds
has since re-iterated this several times, in a number of different ways. So
has Mr Major. Yet such is the depth of suspicion in Irish affairs that it
may have to be repeatedly repackaged and reiterated over the coming months.
The theory is that, in time, the constant deployment of this basic
democratic principle will persuade unionists that while they command
majority support they can safeguard their province, and nationalists that if
they can persuade enough Ulster voters to trust them they can realise their
own dream. If this is an Anglo-Irish conspiracy, its purpose is to convert
25 years of debate by terrorism into peaceful politicking.
Yet it would be a mistake to confuse the wish with its fulfilment. The IRA
has announced a ceasefire, but it resists blandishments to declare it
permanent. Mr Major has rightly lifted the ban on the broadcast of
terrorists' voices, but has not been repaid with a pledge that Armalites
will never again be used. The 'loyalist' murder gangs have not yet accepted
the armistice. Both sides retain their arms. The IRA continues to demand the
release of convicted killers it terms political prisoners.
In these circumstances it is a pity that President Bill Clinton is fighting
difficult mid-term Congressional elections. Looking to the Irish-American
electorate, he is expected to grant a second visa to the president of Sinn
Fein, Gerry Adams. It will come as no surprise if - when - Mr Clinton or
another senior US figure greets the leader of the political wing of the IRA.
The excuse offered in Dublin and Washington will be that this will bind the
IRA/Sinn Fein into the peace process. Mr Major, and the rest of us, can only
hope that that judgment is right.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Not nearly radical enough: Despite free-market reforms,
India's economic upturn is modest rather than spectacular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of market reforms, the Indian economy is showing clear
signs of revival. But the rebound could prove short-lived unless the
government presses ahead with further restructuring.
Industrialists in India are now more optimistic than at any time since Mr P
V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, embarked on liberalisation in mid-1991.
The monsoon was good. Industrial output is forging ahead and the Bombay
Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks last week reached an all-time peak.
Mr Anil Ambani, joint managing director of Reliance Industries, India's
largest company, says: 'We are going to see massive investment growth this
year.'
But the upturn that is causing such excitement is as yet a modest recovery
rather than an industrial take-off. The Reserve Bank of India, the central
bank, last week forecast the economy would grow by 5 per cent in the current
financial year, ending in March 1995, up from 3.8 per cent. This is still
short of the average 5.5 per cent achieved in the pre-reform 1980s and far
below the growth rates of India's economic rivals in the developing world,
notably China.
'We are so slow off the mark,' says Mr Hrishikesh Mafatlal, vice-chairman of
Mafatlal Industries, a textiles-based conglomerate. 'I don't expect economic
take-off . . . of between 7-9 per cent growth . . . in the next three or
four years. It may come only 5-10 years out.'
The immediate risk in such delay lies in the enormous expectations that Mr
Rao's reforms have created among some financial investors. Stock prices have
risen 80 per cent in a year, making Indian equities among the world's most
expensive with an average multiple of price to 1993-94 earnings of 53.
Bombay land prices have doubled in two years. Unless these investments
produce real returns, prices could plunge.
Certainly, India deserves credit for the progress it has made. After 40
years of economic self-reliance, the country is opening up to the outside
world by cutting import duties, reforming the exchange rate and promoting
exports and foreign investment. The 'licence raj', a panoply of industrial
controls, has mostly been dismantled. In spite of a Rs40bn (Pounds 828m)
securities scandal in 1992, when money was illegally siphoned out of banks
into the stock market, financial deregulation has gone ahead.
But Mr Rao has decided against further radical reforms, such as trimming
bloated public-sector enterprises or amending labour laws which ensure jobs
for life. With elections due in the next few months in 10 of India's 25
constituent states and a general election to be held by mid-1996, the prime
minister wants to avoid electorally-unpopular decisions.
Mr Rao believes that, unlike China or other authoritarian states, India
cannot rush politically difficult reforms because it is a vibrant democracy.
But the truth is that India's democracy may not be vibrant enough.
Less than 30m people enjoy the jobs, pensions and other advantages of
legally-protected employment in large-scale organisations. They and their
families - about 150m people - are the main beneficiaries of the economic
status quo. And politicians and bureaucrats are the ones who profit from the
patronage that this allows.
The rest of India's 890m people are largely excluded from the whole process.
If their interests were better represented, the pace of reform might be
quite different. Employers have said that if labour laws were more flexible,
they would shed staff, but would also create new jobs.
Even without restructuring of the organised sector, especially of public
enterprises, the reforms are bearing fruit. Exports after two years of
stagnation leapt 20 per cent in 1993-94. By June 1994, the government had
approved foreign direct investments totalling Dollars 5bn. Foreign fund
managers have invested about Dollars 5bn in the Indian stock market and in
overseas issues made by Indian companies. Foreign exchange reserves have
leapt from Dollars 1bn in mid-1991 to more than Dollars 17bn.
Domestic companies are beginning to invest. Output of consumer goods started
rising last year. Now capital goods production is rising. Industrial
production in April jumped 8 per cent year-on-year.
The central bank estimates that after three years of stagnation, private
investment will rise 10 per cent in 1994-95. As Mr Amit Mitra, secretary
general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, says:
'There's an unbelievable amount of energy in Indian industry now.' Moreover,
partnerships between Indian and foreign companies are sprouting as never
before, including, most recently, the announcement of a joint venture by
Volkswagen, the German auto group, and Eicher, an Indian engineering
conglomerate, to study building a Dollars 190m car factory.
Yet, although India is playing host to more foreign businessmen than ever,
there are worrying signs that the first rush of international enthusiasm may
be waning. Export growth has slowed sharply since the end of March to an
annual rate of 8.3 per cent for the four months to the end of July. Foreign
investment approvals fell in the first six months of 1994 by 38 per cent to
about Dollars 800m, compared with the same period last year. Foreign
portfolio investment has also slowed in recent months.
All these may be temporary blips, but they could also indicate some foreign
companies are having second thoughts about the speed with which they wish to
commit themselves to India.
Their doubts reflect a concern that while India's reforms may be substantial
and irreversible they may not have gone far enough. As Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the
Harvard University economist, said during a recent visit to New Delhi:
'India has made remarkable progress but it is only partial progress.'
To convince the sceptics, India needs to ensure the bureaucrats' fingers are
really being lifted from the levers of economic power. While many controls
have been scrapped, the officials' desire to retain influence has not. In
the power sector, for example, an outline policy for private investment in
power stations was published two years ago, but the details are still being
discussed in negotiations with would-be investors. Apart from the delays,
this case-by-case approach creates scope for corruption.
Similarly in telecommunications, a new policy ending the state's monopoly of
basic services was announced four months ago, but crucial issues, such as
tariffs, still remain to be settled.
India's state-controlled industries and services account for about half the
nation's capital, but produce only a quarter of its output. The government
has sold minority stakes in public enterprises but refuses to embrace
full-scale privatisation. As Mr Sachs points out, the experience of other
countries shows that without privatisation other measures to make public
enterprises efficient are usually futile.
Ministers have made progress in liberalising the capital markets, including
Indian companies' access to the euromarkets. However, they are reluctant to
relax control of the banking industry. The state-owned banks, which dominate
the market, are being allowed to raise private equity, but the government
will retain a majority stake and stifle genuine competition.
Finally, the government has not put its own financial house in order. After
cuts in the first years of reform, public borrowing soared last year to
cover a fiscal deficit equivalent to 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product.
It is falling in 1994-95, but only slowly. Moreover, the burden of interest
payments is rising - from 39 per cent of revenues in 1990-91 to 53 per cent
in 1993-94, according to the RBI.
Mr Rao has called his economic policy a middle way, but in some government
circles it has become known as the muddle way. In an effort to steer a
course between a free-market economy and maintaining a large public sector,
he seems to have lost his sense of urgency.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Yields tell a different story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Interest cost of UK opt out' (September 15), Samuel Brittan says:
'The important point is that opting out of EMU does have an economic price
which the UK may already be paying in long-term interest rates higher than
those of her partner countries, and in the need to reinforce confidence by
base rate increases. . .'
It is difficult to square this with the changes in the gilt-bund spread. In
April 1992 when we were solidly in the ERM and on the way to some sort of
currency union, gilt yields reached a peak of 230 basis points above bund
yields. From January to September 1992 the average spread was around 170
basis points. After we dropped out of the ERM and prospects of EMU receded,
the spread decreased to a low of a little above 40 basis points at the end
of January 1994. The average for the year was around 90 basis points. Today,
after the shake out in world bond markets, the spread is about 130 basis
points - still well below that which ruled when firmly in the ERM.
It is worth noting that, contrary to the predictions of the government and
most of the market commentators, as the ERM fell and prospects of British
membership of any foreseeable EMU virtually disappeared, the spread did not
increase; instead it sharply contracted. With the break up of the ERM all
interest rates, short and long, nominal and real went down - instead of up
as ERM enthusiasts predicted.
If there is a de facto currency union and everyone believes that it will be
sustained, then of course interest will be the same and there would be no
spread at all. But the road to such a union is not smoothly paved with
declining spreads, as the experience with the ERM has so convincingly
demonstrated.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Raise the strategic game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KERRY NAPUK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Campbell's spirited defence of strategic planning was well
founded (Management Page: 'The point is to raise the game', September 14).
However, along with the detractors of planning, Campbell misses the enormous
positive impact strategic planning can have on medium-sized companies. For
them, the planning process often is the first time the management team deals
with fundamental questions facing their company; Where do we want to go? How
can we get there? How do we make it work in our company?
When the senior team shares a future direction - the vision - it creates a
framework in which strategies can be crafted as means towards realising this
greater end. Strategies are useless when unconnected to a desired future
state on one hand and to specific action plans involving teams on the other.
Moreover, strategic planning adds value in bonding the team together,
managing change and creating the appropriate structure to make the plan
work.
Perhaps we need to 'raise the game' by extending the debate over strategic
planning to the much larger pool of medium-sized companies?

Sir, The Conservatives' belief that tax cuts will restore their party's
standing is wrong.
Job security is far more important. The feel good factor will not return
until the country stops reorganising and downsizing. Who these days feels
that their job is secure? Who does not know someone who has been made
redundant? Not until companies start growing again and the public sector
stops reorganising will the country feel good.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The managing director of the National Mutual Life Assurance Society
advances (Letters, September 9) 'a very strong argument' for mutuality, viz.
that mutual offices do not have to pay dividends to shareholders. If the
argument had validity one would expect to find (which one does not) that
mutual offices can offer better terms, or show more favourable maturities
for with-profit policyholders than proprietary companies.
Can it be that the managements of mutuals are less effective precisely
because they lack the stimulus of being directly answerable to shareholders?
There has been more than one case in recent years of a rescue operation
mounted to protect a mutual office's policyholders from jeopardy.
It is virtually impossible to devise a voting structure for mutual offices
which fairly reflects the diverse interests of policyholders. Moreover such
offices are unable to finance expansion by the issue of equity capital,
which is a serious disadvantage for all but the largest mutual offices.
Mutuality is a mixed blessing for building societies and is a positive
handicap for life offices and their policyholders.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russian university already benefiting
from training programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AMNON GOLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was heartening to read John Lloyd's article on Russian plans for
reforming economics teaching ('Russia boosts economics teaching', September
6). Certainly, there remains much to be done to improve academic standards
and curricula in Russian universities and teaching institutions. The
Economic Development Institute of the World Bank recognised this early on
and in 1992 established, with the full support of the Russian government, a
training centre at the premier Russian university, Moscow State University.
The Joint EDI/MSU Training Centre has now been responsible for retraining
large numbers of academics and researchers and, perhaps most importantly,
for using the skills of those who have been retrained to assume primary
responsibility for teaching market economics to a large number of government
officials. With the active collaboration of the core economics ministries
our centre has developed a large and innovative set of training programmes
aimed at improving analytical and policy-making skills, the value of which
is quite obvious.
The philosophy behind this has been to bring on young Russian academics and
teachers to harness their considerable skills in providing up-to-date and
technically competent training to officials, journalists and other key
audiences in Russia. I should add that this approach and the EDI/MSU Centre
has now been cloned, using local institutions, in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and
Uzbekhistan. And a similar strategy was used to develop innovative training
programmes (and to establish a number of training centres) in banking,
project management, investment analysis, enterprise and transport
management, as well as privatisation.
Mr Lloyd indicates that textbooks are a significant constraint in improving
the quality of instruction in Russia. Our centres have now translated a
large number of modern texts and articles into Russian, including Gregory
Mankiw's excellent recent textbook on 'Macroeconomics'. They have also
produced/translated into Russian training videos for bankers and case
studies, text books and glossaries for each of the above mentioned
programmes. Amnon Golan,

FT  19 SEP 94 / The oil has not run out: The sector's comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Out of sight and out of mind could be the motto of the UK offshore oil and
gas industry as it prepares this week to observe the 30th anniversary of the
first North Sea exploration licences.
With most production platforms standing far offshore and support facilities
concentrated in remote coastal towns, the industry's public profile has
slipped below the horizon in recent years. Not so North Sea oil and gas
production. In spite of a widespread perception that the UK oil industry is
long past its heyday, the sector has this year staged a dramatic comeback
with a surge in production that has boosted the trade figures and flattered
overall UK economic data.
Average oil output for the year so far is up by 29 per cent against 1993,
according to figures from the Royal Bank of Scotland, with output recently
running at about 2.4m barrels a day. The high rate of growth, which follows
years of decline, has taken many City economists by surprise. 'Most people
had been aware that oil and gas would expand over the next couple of years,'
says Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at London brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'But
they had not expected it this quickly.'
The main reason is that a sizeable number of new fields have been brought
onstream over the past year and are building up to peak production. Among
the larger ones are Scott, operated by Amerada Hess of the US, Enterprise
Oil's Nelson field and Alba, operated by Chevron. Most were approved three
or four years ago, when oil prices were considerably higher than the present
level of about Dollars 16 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. But the
new fields have also benefitted from the extensive cost-cutting undertaken
by the industry in recent years, as well as from efficiency gains brought
about by new technology.
Technology is also helping companies to extend the life of older fields and
to exploit small accumulations which in the past were seen as uneconomic,
another factor behind this year's surge in output.
A case in point is the Gryphon field, 200 miles northeast of Aberdeen and is
operated by Kerr-McGee, the US oil company. The 100m barrel field is
considered small by earlier North Sea standards, but is typical of the type
of fields that will need to be developed if UK production is to stabilise at
its new, higher levels.
To save money, the company forsook the conventional fixed oil platform,
which would have cost Pounds 400m, and bought instead a tanker-like
'floating production and storage unit' for Pounds 260m, according to Mr Roy
Phillips, Kerr-McGee's general manager in the UK.
The cost advantages of ship-shaped production vessels are such that they are
being considered for a number of new projects, including the first phase of
development at British Petroleum's Foinaven field west of Shetlands, the
most exciting new exploration area in UK waters. The industry's new ability
to drill horizontal wells within the seabed has also 'transformed the
economics of the field,' says Mr Phillips.
Development costs vary according to the field, but many companies have been
able to cut them by half with the help of the new seismic techniques and
drilling methods. BP for example, with one of the most extensive North Sea
operations, has seen its worldwide development costs fall from around
Dollars 10 a barrel five years ago to between Dollars 4 and Dollars 5 a
barrel.
There have been similar reductions in operating costs, with some new North
Sea fields reporting costs as low as Pounds 1 a barrel, although about
Dollars 5 a barrel would be the average for the central and northern North
Sea. That is higher than in onshore fields in many parts of the world, but
low enough to ensure that the UK continues to attract the interest of
international oil companies. Political stability, proximity to markets and
the UK's extensive oil infrastructure are additional attractions.
So too is the government's attitude toward the industry, although oil
companies were divided last year in their response to a sudden change in the
government's taxation regime. It had the effect of removing relief on
exploration, but lowering the tax rate on existing fields.
That pleased companies such as BP and Shell, two of the biggest offshore
operators with extensive but relatively high cost mature assets in need of
refurbishment, but was less well received by aggressive explorers such as
Amerada Hess, which has just joined the top five North Sea companies
according to value of assets.
There were suggestions last year that the tax changes were likely to cause
some international companies to pull out of the North Sea. But there has
been little evidence of that so far. Instead, many US companies, including
Amerada Hess, say they want to expand their operations. Conoco of the US
this month announced it intends to spend Pounds 400m a year in the UK
offshore industry to the end of the decade.
Such plans will please a government clearly enjoying the benefits of the
present oil boom. Second-quarter oil trade, for example, was Pounds 1.31bn
in surplus, its highest level in eight years and nearly three times higher
than in the same period last year. This has helped to allay fears that
Britain faces a worsening balance of payments as higher economic growth
leads to increased imports.
For how much longer can the sector maintain this performance? Most experts
think output will peak sometime next year, before settling at a somewhat
lower 'plateau' level. But that will still leave output above 2m barrels a
day until the end of the decade, even if world prices remain depressed.
A study this year by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultants,
suggested that 59 fields likely to be considered for development over the
next few years would be economic at the current price of Dollars 16 a
barrel. In addition the government's latest licensing round showed strong
interest in deep water areas west of the Shetland Islands and off the west
coast of Scotland. That should ensure the North Sea continues to produce
substantial amounts of oil and gas well into the next century.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Personal View: Plugged into the world's knowledge - US
Vice-president Al Gore explains how a global information system will aid
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AL GORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The linking of the world's people to a vast exchange of information and
ideas is a dream that technology is set to deliver.
President Bill Clinton and I believe that the creation of a network of
networks, transmiting messages and images at the speed of light across every
continent, is essential to sustainable development for all the human family.
It will bring economic progress, strong democracies, better environmental
management, improved healthcare and a greater sense of shared stewardship of
our small planet.
To this end, legislators, regulators and business people must now build and
run a Global Information Infrastructure (GII).
We call upon all governments, in their own sovereign nations and in
international co-operation, to build this infrastructure.
The US will do its part. But the development of the GII must be a
co-operative effort. It cannot be dictated or built by a single country, and
it must be democratic.
The GII will promote democracy by enhancing the participation of citizens in
decision-making. And it will promote the ability of nations to co-operate
with each other.
It will also be the key to economic growth. The information infrastructure
is to the US economy of the 1990s what transport infrastructure was to the
economy of the mid-20th century. Approximately 60 per cent of all US workers
are 'knowledge workers'. Computing and information networks have made US
companies more productive, more competitive and better able to adapt to
changing conditions. They will do the same for other nations.
Digital telecommunications technology, fibre optics and new high-capacity
satellite systems are transforming telecommunications. A fibre optic cable
can carry thousands of telephone calls per second over a single strand of
glass.
In the past, it could take years to build a network. Today, a single
satellite and a few dozen ground stations can be installed in a few months -
at much lower cost.
The economics of networks have changed so radically that a competitive,
private market can build much of the GII. This is dependent, however, upon
sensible regulation.
In the US, we aim to build and maintain through the private sector a
National In-formation Infrastructure of information highways.
Our plan is based on the principles of:
encouraging private investment;
promoting competition;
creating a flexible regulatory framework that can keep pace with rapid
technological and market changes;
providing open access to the network for all information providers; and
ensuring universal service.
Many of these are accepted international principles, which I believe can
inform and aid the development of the GII.
Today, many more technological options make it not only possible, but
desirable, to have different companies running competing - but
interconnected - networks, to make the telecommunications sector more
efficient, more innovative and more profitable.
To promote competition and investment in global telecommunications, we need
to adopt cost-based collection and accounting rates.
International standards are also needed to ensure interconnection and
interoperability throughout the world. National networks must connect
effectively with each other to make real the simple vision of linking
schools, hospitals, businesses and homes.
In order for the private sector to invest and for competition to be
successful, it is necessary to create a regulatory environment that fosters
and protects competition and private-sector investments, while at the same
time protecting consumers' interests.
In the US, we have delegated significant regulatory powers to an independent
agency, the Federal Communications Commission. This is an expert body,
well-equipped to make difficult technical decisions and monitor changing
market conditions.
We also need a flexible, effective system for resolution of international
issues.
Open access is another important principle. Telephone and video network
owners should charge non-discriminatory prices for access to their networks.
Countries and companies will not be able to compete in the global economy if
they cannot get access to up-to-date information or communicate instantly
with customers around the globe. Ready access to information is essential
for training the workforce needed for high-tech industries.
Countries that flourish in the 21st century will be those that have
telecommunications policies and copyright laws that give their citizens
access to a wide choice of information services. Protecting intellectual
property is absolutely essential.
The final and most important principle is to ensure universal service so
that the GII is available to all.
Hundreds of satellites in low earth orbit may soon provide telephone or data
services to any point on the globe. Such systems could make universal
service practical and affordable.
Another dimension of universal service is the recognition that marketplace
economics should not be the sole determinant of the reach of the information
infrastructure.
President Clinton and I have called for positive government action in the US
to extend the GII to every classroom, library, hospital and clinic in the US
by the end of the century.
Schools and libraries in every country could be connected to the Internet,
the world's largest computer network, in order to create a Global Digital
Library. This would allow millions of students, scholars and business people
to find the information they need, whether it be in Albania or Ecuador.
The power of the GII will be diminished if it cannot reach large segments of
the world population.
There are those who say the lack of economic development causes poor
telecommunications. I believe they have it backwards. A primitive
telecommunications systems causes poor economic development.
So we cannot be complacent about the disparity between the high and low
income nations: in how many phones are available or in access to new
technologies, such as high-speed computer networks or video conferencing.
The US is committed to working with other countries on this matter.
To overcome the barriers to GII development, industrialised countries can:
use the GII for technical collaboration between industrialised nations and
developing countries, and to help development agencies link experts from
every nation to solve common problems;
help nations finance the building of telecommunications infrastructure,
through multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank;
create programmes to train telecommunications professionals. USAID (the US
Agency for International Development) and US businesses have helped the US
Telecommunications Training Institute train more than 3,500
telecommunications professionals from the developing world.
The GII could also be used to create a global network of environmental
information, to help protect the environment.
It can provide us with the information needed to improve dramatically the
quality of life around the globe. By linking clinics and hospitals together,
it will ensure that doctors have access to the best possible information on
treatments.
By providing early warning on natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions,
it can save thousands of lives. And by linking villages and towns, it can
help people work together to solve local and regional problems, ranging from
improving water supplies to preventing deforestation.
To promote, to protect and to preserve freedom and democracy, we must make
telecommunications development an integral part of every nation's
development.

Edvard Munch is the centrepiece of an exhibition opening on Friday at the
Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung. It aims to trace the formative influence
which Germany had on the Norwegian painter, and to show how he in turn
influenced German art. Alongside 100 works by Munch, there will be paintings
by German artists he admired and a selection of early Expressionists who
found inspiration in works like 'The Scream'. The show later moves to
Hamburg and Berlin.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts: Pretty boys at Wembley - Take That
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard is getting desperate. He's the tall one in Take That who looks as if
he would be happier as a human being - and the fans know it. When the girls
got the chance to scream for their hero at Wembley on Friday, Howard only
rated a modest teeth-aching neuralgia on the hysteria scale, and while the
Arena was awash with banners inscribed 'Robbie, I want your body' and 'Essex
Girls Love U Mark', there were no 'Show Me How, Howie' placards. Even
growing a ridiculous goatee beard has not helped Howard much.
Still, not long to go now. Life as a member of a top pretty boy pre-teen
band is brief, just the four years it takes for young girls to progress from
Barbie to their first bra. Take That are nothing to do with music - they are
the warm-up to the day when the pop posters disappear from bedroom walls and
real life starts.
Yet there is a move afoot to treat Take That seriously. Lead singer and song
writer Gary Barlow has won Novello Awards and the Manchester money men
behind the hand-picked quintet are constantly tweaking new life into their
creation. Certainly they give a good, wonderfully incoherent, show.
It starts with the lads rising up to the stage dressed as Gestapo despatch
riders and ripping off the Stones' Satisfaction with the bold promise to
10,000 besotted girls You'll get satisfied.
It ends with Lulu, who has found a profitable second career as a child
minder, leading them into the old disco hit Relight my fire, when they dress
as young devils. Now Howard finally flips and bares his bottom in the hope,
presumably, of attracting some of the underclothes the girls rain on little
Markie.
In between there is at least one decent original song in Babe; some
impressive aerobics - the Monkees never attempted somersaults, cartwheels,
and hand stands; a Beatles' medley which displayed delusions of grandeur;
and the inevitable jokey acoustic set just to fool the Musicians Union.
Unfortunately, Take That have to be so amped up to combat their non-stop
screaming, whistle-blowing fans that the sound system is magnified to a
shrill and insubstantial blurr: but who's listening. Fortunately Take That
also threw up one fascinating possibility. Near the end the lads emerge in
peekaboo tops and boxer shorts and camp around like crazy to Give good
feeling. Could the management be preparing for the ultimate, mind-blowing
leap, transforming this year's pubescent teases into next year's icons of
the gay scene?

FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts: Frankfurt, the end of an aria - The cultural crisis
that has devastated the financial heart of Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the outsider, Frankfurt betrays little sign of cultural malaise. Its
annual music festival has just staged four world premieres. Recent
celebrations marking the city's 1,200th anniversary featured the
Metropolitan Opera and a succession of international orchestras. Next month,
the Frankfurt Opera will perform Wagner's Ring, the most challenging work in
the repertory. Like the Frankfurt skyline, these events conjure an image of
confidence and prosperity.
Behind the image, however, lies a devastated city. The vibrant, progressive
culture of Frankfurt in the 1980s is now history - a victim of recession,
reunification costs and political paralysis. Formerly one of Germany's
richest cities, Frankfurt is now its most indebted. It can no longer afford
to support its own cultural life, and has imposed the biggest cutbacks ever
known in postwar Germany. It may have won the race to house a future
European central bank, but it has lost its place in the vanguard of the
arts.
Only a year ago, civic leaders were hopeful that damage to the arts could be
limited if budget cuts were evenly spread. That view turns out to have been
short-sighted. Instead of stabilising, the city's finances have worsened,
and political pressure on cultural spending has increased. Within 18 months
the arts budget has shrunk by 13 per cent. This has had little impact on the
wage-bill - civic employees cannot be made jobless against their will - but
it has decimated morale and creative output.
The Frankfurt Festival, the most important event in the musical calendar, is
being axed. For the past 13 years, it has commissioned new and experimental
work, and given an international platform to local talent. This month's
premieres are the last. The Alte Oper, the main concert venue, is
privatising box office and technical services, and curtailing its own
promotions. In future, it will focus on popular concerts, touring orchestras
and self-financing events like the Met visit. Local choral and instrumental
groups, which until recently formed the backbone of the programme, are being
marginalised.
The Frankfurt Opera's 1994-95 programme is limited to 100 performances -
half the 1986 total. Several productions, including The Ring, have been
borrowed from elsewhere, and the company will suffer the indignity of
vacating its theatre at Christmas to make way for a touring musical. It may
have to suspend all activity for the second half of next year - a tough
prescription for a city which has traditionally counted itself one of
Germany's musical centres. The artistic director, Sylvain Cambreling, has
threatened to resign if the situation does not improve.
Although performing arts companies are the worst affected, the visual arts
have also suffered. In January, museums were forced to introduce admission
charges. Special exhibitions must now be self-financing. As a result, the
museums for modern art, handicrafts and architecture have suffered a 30 to
50 per cent drop in visitors. 'This reduces the legitimacy of museums in the
eyes of politicians,' says Hellmut Seemann, managing director of the Schirn
Kunsthalle, where the budget has been cut by 27 per cent. 'They can now
argue that no one is interested, making it easier for them to carry on
cutting. What is going on is a tragedy. We need to build a cultural policy
not from the viewpoint of the finance ministry, but with an eye for the
long-term benefit to society.'
Frankfurt has suffered more than other German cities for a variety of
reasons. It has a smaller population than Hamburg or Cologne, and more
low-paid foreigners. There are huge social problems, with drugs and
unemployment high on the list. The better-paid white-collar workers - the
biggest cultural consumers - live and pay their taxes outside Frankfurt in
the state of Hesse. But unlike other German states with big regional
centres, Hesse pays nothing to support Frankfurt's theatres and museums - a
cause of much bitterness.
Frankfurt also had further to fall. Thanks to the visionary policies of the
former Social Democratic culture commissioner, Hilmar Hoffmann, it enjoyed a
period of artistic regeneration on the back of the 1980s economic boom.
Hoffmann helped to create the Museumsufer - a row of museums along the banks
of the river Main. The Alte Oper, built from the ashes of the war-bombed
opera house, transformed concert life when it opened in 1981. At the 'new'
opera house, the radical policies of Michael Gielen won worldwide acclaim.
The boom encouraged a free-spending mentality. At one point, there was even
talk of dropping all charges for theatre tickets.
The recession brought Frankfurt down to earth - but the authorities have
done little to cushion the fall. Weakened by instability, the ruling
coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has resorted to piecemeal
cost-cutting, instead of formulating a coherent policy. Hoffmann's
successor, Linda Reisch, has not provided the leadership necessary to fight
the arts' corner. This has helped fuel a divisive debate about the city's
responsibilities.
Those advocating self-support for the arts are currently in the ascendant.
'When money is short, we need to be more businesslike, to cover our costs,'
says Rudolf Sailer, manager of the Alte Oper. 'We need artists who are well
known and have credit with the public. You can't always be crying 'more for
culture'.'
Such a view runs contrary to Frankfurt's traditions. 'It also offers no hope
for the future,' says Dieter Rexroth, outgoing director of the Frankfurt
Festival. 'The purpose of subsidy is to support events which are not
commercially viable, but have a special purpose and value to the community.
If you subject the arts to the same cost-cutting measures as a factory, you
stunt your creative roots - you'll end up with the same circus of touring
orchestras as every other city. That's not culture.'
The debate is especially relevant to the Frankfurt Opera, for which the
financial squeeze is only one of several blows it has received since Gielen
left in 1987. The company was devastated by the fire which destroyed the
opera house shortly after Gielen's successor, Gary Bertini, took office.
Bertini never won the company's confidence, and his early departure cost
DM2m in unfulfilled contractual obligations, plus a lot of damaging
publicity.
The company's image has been further weakened in recent months by a dispute
between Cambreling (who arrived last year) and the administrative director,
Martin Steinhoff, over how to combat a 30 per cent cut in subsidy.
Cambreling, formerly Gerard Mortier's music director at the Monnaie in
Brussels, had no warning of the cut when he agreed to come to Frankfurt. By
general consent he has put together an interesting programme and raised
standards. But he sees little point in staying if the company gives only 50
performances a year - as planned for 1995 - and reduces the size of chorus
and orchestra.
Cambreling accuses Steinhoff of favouring the Frankfurt Ballet and acting as
a message-boy for the city government. For his part, Steinhoff says
Cambreling has failed to confront reality. At present, the company spends an
average DM100,000 per performance on guest singers, on top of the fixed
costs of a permanent company. According to Steinhoff, the choice lies
between changing over to a 'festival' system like the Chatelet in Paris -
bringing in guests for limited-series productions and doing away with
permanent overheads; or building an ensemble of salaried singers on the old
German Stadttheater principle - meaning fewer stars, lower artistic
standards, but regular performances. 'At present we have a mixture which is
not financially viable. We need to forge a pact, because it would be the
final blow for Frankfurt if Cambreling resigned.'

White Heat on BBC2 is one of the most thoughtful series for a long time.
Today's episode considers standardisation and its effects, showing how it
has been central to the development of technology in the past century.
Babbage was unable to realise his design for a mechanical calculator in
1830, arguably a prototype computer, partly because of disagreements with
his engineer but also because of the lack of standardised components. Now
that so much has been standardised, and with genetic engineering a reality,
the programme asks: 'Will the temptation to standardise human beings be
resisted?' (8.00). Happily, GF Newman's dramas always stir things up. He is
a radical who sees it as his job to question the accepted and flout
authority. He reckons medical science has become 'wholly decadent and
self-serving' and his two-part drama The Healer, about a newly-appointed
senior house officer, reflects this (9.30 BBC1). Part 2 tomorrow. The
X-Files is the latest in that stream of American weirdo-drama which began
with 'Twin Peaks'. This time the theme is investigation of the paranormal
(9.30 BBC2).

FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Vindication for odd man out - Karl Popper, the great
philosopher, who died at the weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRYAN MAGEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until he died on Saturday at the age of 92, there were many who regarded
Karl Popper as the greatest living philosopher. Yet he was never in fashion
with other professional philosophers. This fact had important consequences.
One is that he exerted more influence outside philosophical circles than in
them, especially in the fields of science and politics. Another is that his
influence on academic philosophy lagged many years behind his work. Over the
last 20 years he has become a world figure for ideas produced half a century
ago. His period of greatest influence may be yet to come.
Karl Raimund Popper was born in Vienna in 1902 into an unusually gifted
family. His father was a successful lawyer involved in social work and
actively interested in philosophy and the arts; his mother was a talented
musician from a family that included the conductor Bruno Walter. Both were
Jews who had been baptised, with the result that Popper's upbringing was
Lutheran.
For nearly 10 years he was a student at the University of Vienna in physics,
mathematics, philosophy, psychology and music. During those years the
logical positivism of the Vienna Circle became high intellectual fashion, as
did its seductive 'verification principle'. This asserted that any statement
about fact had to be verifiable if it was to claim content: if it was
unverifiable it was not false but meaningless, for if no observable state of
affairs would reveal whether it was true or false there was nothing it
conveyed. The intention was to eliminate metaphysics, including religion,
from rational discourse. Popper pointed out that it eliminated also the
whole of science.
This was because - as he famously argued in his seminal book The Logic of
Scientific Discovery in 1934 - scientific laws cannot be verified. From no
finite number of observations can an unrestrictedly general statement, such
as a scientific law, be deduced. However, since any such statement is
contradicted by one single counter-example it can be proved wrong even
though it cannot be proved right, and it can therefore be tested against
reality. The scientific theories we accept at any given time are those that
have stood up to tests so far, but they remain conjectural, and will almost
certainly be refuted and replaced by better theories.
Apart from Einstein, Popper probably did more than any other individual to
change the 20th century's conception of science. And he showed that since
our scientific knowledge is the most reliable knowledge we have, such a
change radically alters our conception of the nature of knowledge itself.
In doing this he developed a formidable armoury of arguments that were then
trained on the pseudo-sciences of Marx and Freud. The arguments with which
he demolished their claims to be scientific are now as widely accepted as
the arguments with which he demolished logical positivism; yet for decades
he was the object of a hostility amounting sometimes to hatred for putting
them forward.
The Marxist left denounced him as the blackest-hearted of reactionaries; but
the truth is that the Popper who published The Open Society and Its Enemies
in 1945 had been always left-of-centre. Only later in his life did he drift
from liberalism into conservatism.
Meanwhile, because of its positive doctrines, The Open Society established
itself in the eyes of many (Isaiah Berlin, for instance) as the outstanding
work of political philosophy of the 20th century. It has special relevance
wherever human beings are attempting to establish democracy. The collapse of
international communism, for reasons some of which Popper was the first to
formulate, has given him a guru-like reputation in the former communist
countries.
Popper left Austria in 1936. His first university teaching job, which he
took up in 1937, was in New Zealand, and he remained there until the end of
the second world war. In 1946 he arrived in England to take up a readership
at the London School of Economics, where in 1949 he became Professor of
Logic and Scientific Method. The rest of his career was spent at LSE, and
the remainder of his life in Britain. He loved his adopted country. He was
knighted in 1965 and made a Companion of Honour in 1982.
A break in Popper's whole way of life occurred when he left Austria. Up to
that point he had shown an inexhaustible appetite for social activity:
left-wing politics, social work with the unemployed, teaching deprived
children, helping arrange concerts of music by the new Viennese school of
composers. He lived surrounded by friends; and his marriage to a fellow
student, Hennie, brought him lifelong happiness, although there were no
children. But in both New Zealand and England, he and Hennie lived a much
more reclusive life, in which all distractions from productive work were
eventually eliminated. This made possible the uninterrupted production and
publication of ideas that continued well into his 80s.
Popper regarded the analytic approach to philosophy, an approach that
dominated his profession for most of his career, as an error: he believed
that problems of substance were to be solved not by analysis but by new
explanatory ideas. As for the view that philosophy's subject-matter is
linguistic, he had no time for that at all: he regarded a preoccupation with
words and their meanings as inimical to creative thinking (except, of
course, in the field of language studies).
He made a conscious attempt to put his ideas forward in such a way that
nothing of importance depended on the way he used words - though in fact he
had a clear and pungent style, full of character, despite the fact that most
of his work had to be written in a language not his own.
Like many philosophers of the very front rank, he produced creative work
across the whole range of philosophy. He made the biggest contribution of
any to evolutionary epistemology (Objective Knowledge, 1972), and did
outstanding work on the body-mind problem (The Self and Its Brain with J C
Eccles, 1977), and on the philosophical implications of relativity theory
and quantum mechanics (Quantum Theory and the Schism in Physics, 1982).
Popper's axiomatic systems for probability theory have generated a whole
literature. He maintained a steady output of scholarly articles alongside
his more original work - in his 90s he was still publishing major
contributions to the study of the pre-Socratic philosophers of Ancient
Greece. The many-sided story of his mental life is told up to 1974 in his
remarkable intellectual autobiography, Unended Quest.
The fact that he was always, in every field, thinking afresh for himself,
always original, always different, set him apart, and helped to make him a
lonely figure. It also made him difficult to have dealings with. Touchy,
defensive, aggressive, over-intense, a workaholic, he was not easy to like
from a distance; but those close to him loved him for the utter genuineness
of all his many interests and commitments, the self-forgetfulness of his
devotion to them, and his absolute integrity - although that could be
maddening at times.
The prolonged illness of his wife, who died of cancer just short of her 80th
birthday, was a cold, dark tunnel through which he had to pass in old age.
But his own final years were an Indian summer of international recognition
and personal happiness among people devoted to him. He was showered with
doctorates and prizes. Heads of governments from different parts of the
world made unpublicised visits to his home. At the age of 92, this odd man
out - who had been unable to get any academic job until he was 35 - had
lived to see his own vindication.

FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Allen, Tenneco's liaison in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco has put Ken Allen, a 14-year company veteran whose strengths lie in
law and finance, in charge of managing its operations in Europe, writes
Laurie Morse.
Tenneco has not had a co-ordinating executive in Europe for many years, and
Allen's appointment, the company says, is evidence of its commitment to
achieving a truly global presence in all its businesses.
Allen will serve as liaison officer between Tenneco's five companies -
Albright and Wilson Chemicals; Case farm and construction equipment; Monroe
and Walker auto parts; Packaging Corporation of America, and Tenneco Gas -
and serve on Tenneco's European Advisory Council.
Just as important, he will serve as the eyes and ears in the Europe for Dana
Mead, Tenneco's chairman. Tenneco, with Dollars 13bn in sales in 1993, has
spent the past two years stabilising and revitalising its US operations. Now
it is seeking overseas investments. Allen's job, in part, is to pinpoint
business opportunities and takeover targets for the company.
'Ken Allen is a good man for this job,' says Mead. 'He's a lawyer fellow who
has run companies himself, and has headed environmental and risk management
departments, which when considering operations in Eastern Bloc countries
these days, is very important. He has experience with acquisition financing,
and will be a catalyst for our businesses over there.'
The 55-year-old Allen, who is based in London, reports directly to Mead.
Allen spent much of his early career in the insurance industry, coming to
Tenneco from Southwestern Life in 1980 when it was acquired by Tenneco. By
the time Tenneco sold Southwestern Life in 1986, Allen had risen to become
its chief executive. He served as Tenneco's deputy general counsel from 1987
until being named managing director for Tenneco Europe on August 1.

FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Diplomatic move by Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been clear that Volvo has been looking to beef up its corporate
communications team ever since the fiasco of its failed merger with Renault
last December, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
But the vehicle group's announcement last week that Lars Anell, Sweden's EU
ambassador in Brussels, had agreed to take the newly created job of head of
the corporate affairs section as a senior vice president certainly raised a
few eyebrows.
After all, he still has two years to run in his current post - which he
describes as the 'best job in the Swedish civil service' - and he will be
foregoing the chance of seeing his country into the European Union next
January.
There is also the fact that Anell has been a civil servant all his working
life - apart from his time in Brussels, he has been Sweden's ambassador in
Geneva and served as chairman of GATT for two years. The closest contact he
has had with Volvo is the model of car he drives. So what has prompted the
move?
Anell admits it wasn't an easy decision but says the crucial factor was his
age - he is 52 - and the desire 'to try something new. This was probably my
last opportunity to have a substantial career in private industry,' he says.
The role will be a broad one. Apart from the media and investor relations
side, he will be asked to evaluate broader political and economic
developments. He will also be expected to boost the group's presentational
skills, avoiding, if possible, the sort of furore that blew up last autumn
after an initially favourable reaction to the Renault plan.
Anell's political/economic experience is clearly one of his main
qualifications for the post. But he will also bring to Volvo the sort of
international contacts it has lacked since the acrimonious departure of
former chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar last December.

FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Dominique Damon to head Alusuisse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, the Zurich newspapers grumbled bitterly when CS Holding,
Credit Suisse's parent, and the Ciba-Geigy drugs group, decamped to London
for their annual results press conferences, writes Ian Rodger. No question
about it, they were betraying the homeland.
But last Tuesday, when Alusuisse announced that the chief of its packaging
division, Dominique Damon, 47, was to become chief operating officer and the
designated successor to Theodor Tschopp as chief executive, nary a
xenophobic or misogynist squeak could be heard.
Damon is a French national, does not speak German well, does not speak
Schwyzerduutsch at all and does not stay at home every day to look after her
daughter.
Nevertheless, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, the daily oracle of true Swiss
values, observed graciously that it was 'pleasing to see that a woman will
be the head of an important Swiss industrial group in the near future'.
The quietly spoken Damon has gradually won over the Swiss with something
they appreciate - the ability to make lots of money. In her hyperactive
six-year career at Alusuisse, she has transformed a motley bunch of
packaging businesses with annual sales of SFr744m into a highly profitable
world class operation whose sales this year will exceed SFr2.5bn.
Last year's SwFr1.1bn takeover of the big Canadian packaging group Lawson
Mardon was her ninth acquisition, but she is proud of having kept the
management teams largely intact at all of them.
A career executive with long experience at the Danone and Carnaud groups in
France, she believes her most important role is convincing her managers and
employees to believe in their company's goals. Otherwise, she says, the risk
grows that they will sabotage them. So she spends a lot of time travelling.
Indeed, the joke at Alusuisse is that Damon, for all her success and
influence, has no office. She smilingly agrees, saying she keeps up with the
paperwork 'by telephone and fax'. Perhaps she is on to something.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Where soft touch meets hard sell - America's
strong push towards interactive advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The coming year will be a vital one for interactive advertising, as dozens
of magazines and newspapers go on-line and fibre-optic cable television
trials are run in the US.
Interactive advertising allows consumers to control the amount of
information they receive about a product. Anyone who has
scratched-and-sniffed a perfume advertisement has used interactive
advertising, albeit in its most basic form.
At the other end of the spectrum, advertisers envision customers
digitalising an image of themselves and trying on clothes on a TV screen, or
test-driving a new car model through virtual reality.
Interactive advertising, in its truest form, provides layers of information
to draw in the consumer. For instance, J Walter Thompson, the advertising
agency, has developed an interactive advertisement for Ford, which is now
available on Prodigy Online. The Prodigy user is invited to explore the Ford
automobile by clicking on different parts of the car. Click the mouse on the
hood, for instance, and a model of the engine appears. Click on the engine,
and a full description of its mechanics is made available.
Now interactive advertising is poised to move from an experimental phase to
a defined medium. 'By this time next year, we should have a lot better idea
of which direction we're going in and how fast we'll get there,' says Robert
Berenson, president of the advertising agency Grey New York. 'The Time
Warner TV trial, (which will contain an interactive capability), will be in
place by May next year, and we'll have a lot more magazines and newspapers
on the Internet.'
The borders between entertainment, information services and home shopping
networks get blurred in the interactive advertising mix. Nintendo, for
instance, has a game out called Cool Spot, based on the red dot on a can of
7-up soda. Where fun ends and advertising begins is difficult to say.
Interactive advertising will also offer chances to buy products through a
personal computer or TV set.
The ultimate goal of interactive advertising is to lead consumers from the
initial arousal of interest to the point of sale. The New York Times, for
instance, plans to offer a service allowing on-line readers to access
theatre reviews, then make a reservation for a certain show.
The telecommunications group US West is launching a number of TV-based
interactive advertising services. One, City Key, is available at a number of
hotels, and lets users 'take a tour of the city' on TV. The hotel guest can
click on different cinemas, restaurants and museums shown on the screen in
order to obtain more information.
Technology is the main limiting factor for interactive advertising right
now. 'We have so many ideas, but the technology isn't there yet,' says Jean
Pool, senior vice president of J Walter Thompson. 'Since most places are not
hooked up to the Internet, in most cases, the user still has to reach for a
phone. An on-line reader cannot look at a restaurant review and make a
reservation for a table, because not many restaurants are hooked up to an
on-line service.'
Technology is advancing rapidly, though. Last week Cybercash Inc, formed by
executives from the Internet and the electronic payment industries,
announced plans to develop a system giving on-line browsers the chance to
pay for an item by credit card or bank transfers.
Until the fibre-optic TV stations take off, the main experimenting ground
for interactive will be the on-line services. 'The Internet is the only
place right now where you can access a relatively large audience and try
some of these strategies out,' says Clifford Friedman, senior managing
director of the media and technology group at Bear Stearns, the investment
bank.
One reason companies and agencies are so excited about interactive
advertising is that they believe it will be much more effective than passive
advertising. 'Studies show that when people have to respond physically to an
advertisement, it's much more likely to result in a sale,' says Norman
Lehoullier, head of Grey Interactive.
With the technology rapidly falling into place, interactive advertising
looks set to occupy a significant portion of the advertising mix at many
companies. 'It's not even a question of years, but of months,' predicts Marc
Andressen, vice-president of technology at Mosaic, the software group.
'Interactive will be a prevalent form of advertising by the beginning of
1995.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Multimedia moves into OJ's courtroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the double murder trial of OJ Simpson, the former American football
star, gets under way in Los Angeles an elaborate multimedia system will be
used to present evidence to the judge, jury and millions of armchair jurists
watching the courtroom drama on television.
Simpson's lawyers say that they plan to use the system, provided by Trial
Presentation Technologies, to display evidence on a large projection screen
in the Los Angeles courtroom. The same images will also be displayed on
smaller monitors for the judge and lawyers, and be available to TV networks.
Instead of propping up a chart, holding up a photograph or simply referring
to documents, in the conventional manner, Simpson's lawyers will be able to
select computer graphics, text, video or animations previously stored on
computer discs. Diagrams of the murder scene, or of the now-infamous OJ
Simpson estate, will be displayed on a 67in video screen.
Text of the proceedings will be translated automatically from the phonetic
system used by the official court reporter, and will be available to
the judge and lawyers should
they wish to refer back to previous testimony without delay.
This is likely to be the second time that the multimedia system has been
used in a US criminal trial. The first occasion is expected to be the trial
of two off-duty policemen accused of shooting a highway patrol officer,
scheduled to start in Los Angeles today.
But the system has been used widely in civil cases, where it has proved
valuable in presenting complex issues to juries, says Pamela Huenke, chief
executive of Trial Presentation Technologies, a Los Angeles company that is
pioneering the use of multimedia technology in the courtroom.
The technology has important advantages, she says. 'Typically, jurors do not
see exhibits until the end of the trial when they go into the deliberation
room.' The computer system enables them to view the evidence as it is being
discussed. In addition, visual displays typically help people to retain more
information during lengthy court proceedings.
The equipment which is to be installed in Judge Lance Ito's court for the
Simpson trial will be worth about Dollars 120,000 to Dollars 185,000, but
will be loaned to the court by TPT. The opportunity to demonstrate the
system in what is expected to be America's most avidly-viewed trial is
regarded as sufficient reward.
Lawyers are conservative creatures, says Huenke, and have been slow to adopt
technologies that are already established in business. She is confident,
however, that the Simpson trial will demonstrate the advantages of
multimedia and put to rest concerns that it detracts from the serious nature
of the proceedings.

It used to be hard enough to get an itemised phone bill. Now Energis, the
newest UK long-distance phone company, is promising business customers a
full 'telephone management' service.
In addition to a list of all outgoing calls, subscribers will get
information on the numbers of incoming calls - including the number of calls
unanswered and the average length of time taken to answer a call. This will
be broken down into different time periods of the day.
The facts will be issued monthly - and are bound to concentrate the minds of
telephone managers wonderfully.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Architecture: Daring to be different - The career of Theo
Crosby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes courage to be different, especially if you are an architect trained
in the 1930s but interested in much more than dogmatic modernism and the
narrow world of contemporary architecture.
Theo Crosby, who died last week, was a gentle genius who loved architecture,
design and communication. It is hard to think of many other architects of
his generation who worked so hard to restore architecture to its broader
base and to develop links between the members of a polarised profession.
He was born in South Africa in 1925. When he came to England in the 1940s he
worked with leading modernists Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry, and later Denys
Lasdun. He was always interested in the architectural debate and, as
technical editor of the influential magazine Architectural Design, combined
writing and design work. It was his interest in communicating and discussing
architectural ideas that made him so much broader and wiser than many of his
colleagues. His journalism was often original and always questioning.
He also saw the value of exhibitions - the Whitechapel Art Gallery
exhibition This is Tomorrow, held in 1956, was a crucial show that
demonstrated how modern architecture could change the world.
Theo Crosby saw through much architectural dogma, and the varied highlights
of his career show that he was a fast mover, able to put his own stamp on a
wide range of projects.
He was the leader of Taylor Woodrow's design team for the reconstruction of
London's Euston station in the early 1960s, although I don't think he was
ever happy about the demolition of the Euston Arch or some of the political
decisions that influenced the design. His British pavilion at the Milan
Triennale in 1964 won a major prize and led to more work for the British
pavilion at the Montreal Expo of 1967.
By the mid-1960s he had created a partnership with Alan Fletcher, Colin
Forbes and Bob Gill. Under the name Pentagram, this was to become one of the
world's leading design firms. It put architecture into context and pulled
together all the design disciplines.
Theo Crosby was always a benign presence in the firm's London offices, where
his hospitality encouraged meetings and discussion groups.
It was later in his career that some of his more maverick sides emerged in
his architecture. There is a fascinating brick elevation, at the back of one
of the Nash Terraces in Regent's Park, which is almost Victorian in its
richness.
He was chosen by Unilever to transform its London headquarters at
Blackfriars and it is doubtful whether anyone else could have persuaded the
company to embellish a building in the art-deco style. He even succeeded in
commissioning larger-than-life-size sculptures for the parapet and to
involve several artists in elements of the building, from the lift doors to
the board room furniture.
A project which preoccupied and fascinated him for a long time was the
re-creation of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on the banks of the Thames at
Southwark's Bankside. With the late Sam Wanamaker, he persisted against the
odds, winning friends and influencing people until his design could be
built.
Crosby's design is more than a 'wooden O' While it has the replica theatre
at its heart it also has towers, balconies and crenellations which will give
Bankside the humanity and richness it very much needs. The idea of the Globe
appealed to Crosby as an extraordinary challenge to ensure scholarly
authenticity while making the theatre work.
He loved theatres. Before he died he was working on a project for a new
small opera house near his home in Spitalfields. With his wife, the artist
Polly Hope, Theo Crosby presented an annual summer opera or concert at their
home - the sight of Theo in a pale blue silk kaftan remains a memorable one.
Crosby led an inspired life full of creative energy: his design for the
Globe must be completed. The sad thing is that his other London memorial had
only just begun. He was commissioned (and welcomed the impossible task) to
humanise and refurbish the interiors of the Barbican Centre. I pray that
will continue. It will be Crosby's greatest victory over architectural dogma
and bring colour and joy to the City of London's impenetrable concrete
monster.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Media Futures: PA invents a freer press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last century, Reuters used pigeons to be first with the news. And in
past decades one of the first tasks of a journalist away from the office was
to make sure there was a phone box nearby, so that he or she could file a
story to copytakers. All that changed with the advent of the mobile
telephone. And now the Press Association, the UK domestic news agency, has
taken the process a step further. It has put together the laptop computer
with mobile radio communications to produce Journalist 2000 - a system that
frees journalists from the need for telephone systems of any kind when
filing their stories.
PA news reporters used the system in their coverage of the D-Day
commemorations, filing from the Normandy beaches and on-board ships. Defence
correspondent Charles Miller filed his piece on the ceremony in the Bayeux
cemetery direct from a laptop resting on a gravestone. Brendan Berry was
aboard the Canberra and filed copy from the middle of the English channel.
Journalist 2000 combines a Hewlett Packard Omnibook with a mobile modem,
linking the 2.8lb portable computer to the RAM, mobile data network. Once a
story is tapped into the laptop there is little to do but key in the
password and press the return key. The story is then transmitted in seconds
to the PA database in the news agency's Fleet Street, London headquarters.
Because of the success of the system, PA is now experimenting with
Journalist 2000 operations from other countries in Europe and the US -
particularly for sports coverage. The system - PA believes it is the first
of its kind - also allows two-way communications. Journalists can use it to
go into their own computer data baskets at headquarters. Thus they can pick
up messages, ensure their articles have arrived safely or keep in touch with
breaking stories in the PA news file.
PA has already equipped more than 50 of its journalists with Journalist 2000
and is now trying to market it to other regional and national news
organisations.
The hardware costs around Pounds 3,000, most of which is accounted for by
the powerful notebook. But the subscription charge, for unlimited use of the
network, is Pounds 45 a month.
This almost certainly makes the PA system cheaper to use than the obvious
alternative - a laptop with a modem connected to a cellular telephone.

Cameroon's new international airport was open again on Wednesday after a
one-day strike by air traffic controllers, firemen and meteorologists
claiming five months of unpaid wages.
Strike leader Vincent Baleba said he had called off the stoppage after
government officials told him on Tuesday evening that four months arrears
had already been transferred to workers' bank accounts.
But he warned that the strike would resume immediately if the full amount
was not paid by September 20.

Drinkers should head for Milan and smokers for Madrid, according to a survey
of duty-free shopping in the European Union.
But they should steer clear of London, which the European Consumers'
Organisation found to be the most expensive place for either commodity.
The survey also found that Dublin was the cheapest place to buy duty-free
perfume and Paris the best for cameras.
Lisbon was the most expensive for perfume, with at least one brand found to
be markedly cheaper if bought in town rather than duty-free.
Frankfurt and Copenhagen were the two most expensive duty-free shops for
cameras.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Delays in Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers to and from Kuala Lumpur have been facing frustrating delays due
to radar problems at the city's airport, writes Kieran Cooke.
A recent fire - the third in 18 months - has knocked out an important radar
installation and air traffic controllers have had to resort to manual
tracking, which has led to the rescheduling of many flights. Departing
flights are frequently being delayed for more than an hour - incoming
passengers, particularly on shuttle flights from Singapore, also face
problems.
It is likely things will not return to normal until next month.
Malaysia's department of civil aviation has reported two near misses at
Kuala Lumpur since the radar went out of action. In the latest incident the
department blamed a Singapore Airlines pilot for not following certain air
traffic procedures during a landing approach.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Continental cuts fares to US for
penny-pinchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Airlines is wooing the new breed of penny-pinching business
travellers, forced by their employers to fly economy class, by cutting its
full unrestricted economy fares across the Atlantic by more than 40 per
cent.
The large US carrier is launching what it calls 'corporate economy fares'
between London and 28 US destinations.
The airline said research had shown that business travellers flying in the
economy cabin were unhappy with the high price they had to pay for
flexibility. Unlike the leisure traveller, who often sacrifice flexibility
for price, the business traveller needed to have a refundable ticket that
could be changed at short notice.
Continental's new fares will, subject to government approval, cut the
one-way price between London and New York from Pounds 423 to Pounds 249. One
way from London to Houston will be Pounds 319 and to Denver Pounds 339.
The latest move by Continental is being closely watched by rivals. The UK's
Virgin Atlantic, which offers a separate Mid Class cabin for passengers
paying the full economy fare, said it was considering whether to match the
new fares.
United of the US said: 'If it's something where we compete directly with
Continental, we will match their fares.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: How to crack the code-sharing deals - The
pros and cons of buying just one ticket for a complicated series of flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow to Des Moines, Iowa, in the farming heartland of the US, may not seem
the most conventional airline route. You might imagine that such a journey
involves four aircraft changes, three tickets, the risk of lost luggage,
long walks across airport terminals and frazzled nerves.
But with just one ticket and one boarding pass, you can travel all the way.
Or, for that matter, from Kuwait City to Phoenix, Arizona; from Copenhagen
to Grand Rapids, Michigan; or any number of other improbable routes.
Your baggage will be checked all the way from your starting point to your
final destination, and flight changes should be co-ordinated with connecting
flights, on aircraft parked in nearby bays within the same terminal if
possible.
These are the benefits of code-sharing, an increasingly popular arrangement
which allows airlines to book passengers on each others' flights.
It means that on United Airlines' Moscow-Des Moines flight, you fly by
Lufthansa, the German carrier, to Frankfurt; change to another Lufthansa
flight to Chicago; and finally board a United aircraft to Des Moines.
Most large airlines have made alliances with others around the world: there
have been about 120 liaisons, covering roughly 5,000 routes. Code-sharing
partners include United and Lufthansa, British Airways and USAir, KLM of the
Netherlands and Northwest of the US, and the multiple alliance of British
Midlands with American Airlines and United. Delta of the US and Virgin
Atlantic of the UK are still awaiting approval for their proposed agreement.
Airlines trumpet the benefits of such arrangements to their customers, but
some consumer groups are concerned that they are not always in the interests
of air travellers.
The US Department of Transportation discovered that 30 per cent of all US
passengers booking international reservations on code-sharing flights do not
know which airline they are flying when they purchase their tickets. Last
month the department proposed new rules to require airlines and travel
agents to disclose all code-sharing arrangements at the time a passenger
books a flight. No such ruling exists or is proposed in the UK.
Consumer groups claim that passengers may end up on inferior carriers. 'The
pitfall is if the partner with which an airline ties up is not in the same
league in terms of quality of the service or safety levels,' says Richard
Smithies, assistant director for government affairs at the International Air
Transport Association.
Large airlines say they would never go into a deal without conducting
extensive safety and service checks on potential partners. 'We have
something like a Bible of requirements that a code-sharing partner has to
adhere to,' says Delta.
Most of the big airlines have internal policies requiring reservation
officers to inform passengers of any code-sharing arrangements. But consumer
groups say this is not effective. According to Tony Hockley, economic
adviser to the Air Transport Users Committee: 'Airlines can insist that
passengers are told about code-sharing, but whether that actually happens
depends on the point of sale. We are not convinced that all travel agents
are trained in the use of code-share flights.'
'We would expect our members to be as transparent as possible,' says the
Association of British Travel Agents. 'But there is not a requirement about
code-sharing in our code of practice.'
The European Commission and the European Civil Aviation Commission have
agreed that airlines may list a single flight no more than twice in computer
reservation systems. Code-sharing makes multiple listings fairly easy,
because each airline can list the flight under its own code.
In the US, the American Society of Travel Agents, the Association of Retail
Travel Agents, American Airlines and Trans World Airlines are petitioning
the US Department of Transportation to ban multiple listings of code-share
flights in computer reservation systems. They believe such practices deceive
consumers and push flights run by single carriers further down computer
screens, causing travel agents to book the code-share flights rather than
routes that could be more direct.
So if you want to know exactly which airlines you will be flying and where
you will be changing, make sure to ask when you book the flight. And find
out whether you will get frequent-flyer points for the entire trip.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Sport: Talk turns to football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quite often I spend Sunday at my parents' home, where the languid hours are
given structure by the Sky Television broadcast of a Premier League football
match. 'What's the game today? Ah, that'll be a good one,' my father will
say to me during lunch. In so doing he speaks the words which begin the
afternoon ritual.
By 2.45pm the television will be tuned to Sky Sports, the better to savour
the moments before the programme begins: within the flickering images we
conjure those of the perfect football match. During the hours of build-up to
the game itself, which Sky fills with prognostications and statistics, we
create in the living room a studio debate of our own. Back and forth go the
comments: 'Who's going to win it?' - 'Newcastle, 3-0' - 'No, Spurs will get
one' - 'Their bubble's burst' - 'Think they'll go down?' - 'Think Newcastle
will win the league?' - 'Their bubble might burst'.
At 4pm, the moment of kick-off, we will have reached a peak of expectation.
For the first 10 minutes we will follow play like metal detectors moving
along the ground. Then it will become apparent that the game is no longer
exerting the hold over us that it should. By approximately 4.20pm, my eyes
will be irresistibly drawn to the Sunday papers, my mother will have removed
herself from her studio chair and my father will be fast asleep.
To us, clearly, the true joy of football lies in the paraphernalia that goes
with it, and especially in those meaningless, circuitous, wonderfully
comforting conversations that anyone with the slightest idea about the game
can have. When I worked in the theatre, we would talk endlessly about other
actors and directors - 'Oh, he was in his hamlet' - 'Oh she auditioned for
that' - with a good deal more zeal than we would bring to the serious
business of acting and directing. In the world of sport, the subject of the
conversations may be very different but the conversations themselves are
exactly the same.
Of course, many of the people who indulge in football chit-chat are true
lovers of the game, capable of staying awake throughout an entire Sunday
afternoon with Sky Television. Sometimes I have one of these conversations
with my mother's window cleaner, a diehard Luton Town supporter. It is
obvious that we are saying the same things for different reasons. I am doing
it for the pleasure of affirming my knowledge, and he's doing it for the
pleasure of talking about the thing that he loves.
To me, the thought of going to watch Luton Town is entirely unappealing, as
indeed is the thought of going to most football matches. And I suspect that
is true of a large number of people who purport to love football. What they
love is knowing about it. They love being au fait with transfer deals and
intrigues: they love talking about it. These are the people who were tapped
into by Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch. That book was written by a true fan of
football, but its genius is that it spoke not merely to those who loved the
game, but to those who loved the paraphernalia of the game.
And the great thing is that it is so easy to talk about football. What do I
know about Luton Town? Nothing. But by deploying a few totemic phrases, for
example referring to the fact that the manager - Pleaty - has no money with
which to build his teams, I can hold a conversation with someone who has
seen them play practically every weekend of his adult life. Ridiculous, yet
true.
Sometimes I wonder, though, who really does know anything about football.
Who really understands its infinite but oddly banal complexities? Managers
are the avowed experts, but look at the howlers that most of them make.
Look, too, at Terry Venables, hailed as the man who would revitalise
England, reduced to recalling most of the players used by the reviled Graham
Taylor; where is the magical knowledge that can unearth the unexpected? For
heaven's sake, even I could have picked the team that played recently
against the USA.
Football is, in fact, the most slippery and mysterious of sports. So much
should be possible, but so often this potential turns to predictability.
There must be thousands of ways in which a team can score, but goals almost
always occur simply through luck. The lacklustre World Cup final between
Brazil and Italy proved that football can never be relied upon to entertain;
last week's UEFA cup defeat of Blackburn by part-timers Trelleborgs proved
that mediocrity can always triumph over talent. Really, sometimes one
wonders why anyone likes football at all. At the moment, sated after days of
unrelenting bombardment, I have as much appetite for it as I would have for
the last meal of a gourmet weekend.
But you still can't stop me talking it.

<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN

<TEXT>
Anonymous 4, the all-American female group who sing early unaccompanied
vocal music, turn to a collection of 13th century courtly love texts for
their latest offering, Love's Illusion (harmonia mundi). The verses, chosen
from the Montpellier Codex, the richest single source of French polyphony,
are all based on two simple precepts: that true love may exist only outside
of marriage and that a man must subject himself totally to the will of his
beloved, no matter how irrational it may seem. It sounds subversive, and not
a little dangerous, to me, but the texts are beautifully sung and the
packaging exemplary. Anonymous 4 make their first-ever British appearance at
St John's, Smith Square on September 27.
Not much courtly love on Robert Palmer's new album Honey (EMI), but
followers of the smoothie's career will not be surprised to see him adorned
by yet another beautiful woman on the unimaginative sleeve. The music itself
is a welcome return to form for Palmer after a few years of self-indulgent
experimentation, drawing on a rich variety of musical styles and driven
relentlessly by Nuno (Extreme) Bettencourt's cutting guitar.
Amanda Roocroft is a young British soprano who has refused to play safe in
compiling the material for her debut album on EMI, preferring to stretch her
repertoire all the way from Handel to Richard Strauss, taking in Mozart (her
strongest performances), Puccini and Verdi along the way. Franz Welser-Most
conducts the London Philharmonic in accompaniment.
Swing Out Sister attempt to join the Four Weddings and a Funeral bandwagon
of monstrous success with the release of their version of the Delfonics' La
La (Means I Love You) from the movie soundtrack. It also features on the
band's new album, The Living Return (Mercury), a happy enough slice of
jazz-funky languor which, I can't help thinking, should have been released
in time for the summer - it's that kind of sound.
Bad idea of the week: If I Were a Carpenter (A&amp;M), an 'alternative,
irreverent' tribute album to the torpid duo featuring American Music Club,
The Cranberries, Sonic Youth and others. One can take 1970s nostalgia
several steps too far. Even worse is Balearico (Mercury), a 'house-style,
hi-NRG adaptation' of Ravel's Bolero. It has come from the night clubs of
Ibiza, and should have stayed there.

Once upon a time, many years ago, Len Deighton wrote some wonderful
spy-thrillers which created romantic magic out of a dirty Cold War world -
The Ipcress File, Billion-Dollar Brain and the rest of the 'Harry Palmer'
books and films. Then he became a one-man industry, swapping from fiction to
(rather good) non-fiction, and the peculiar charm disappeared. He was always
readable, but he lost - or jettisoned - his romantic sub-text.
Worst of all, Deighton got involved in an interminable series about a boring
and middle-aged British agent called Bernard Samson. So far we have been
given Game, Set and then (wait for it) Match; an historical Winter as a
breather; then Hook, Line and Sinker. Now, God help us, we have Faith, which
will assuredly lead to Hope and Charity in due course.
Can no-one persuade Deighton to call it a day? The end of the Cold War,
which has pole-axed most thriller writers, has meant nothing to Deighton.
With Faith he is cheerfully harking back to 1987, and making much of the
tensions in East Germany as glasnost gains ground.
We have the same old cast of characters: Bernie's wife Fiona, who, in a
deeply implausible plot device that straddled a batch of books, was a
double-agent defector; his old Berlin pal Werner Volkmann; smoothie American
colleague Brett Rensselaer; nubile and loving young girl-friend Gloria;
Tante Lisl, now with a new hip, in her Berlin hotel; ancient bossman Silas
Gaunt; youthful bossman Dick Cruyer; and the station chief in Berlin, Frank
Harrington.
All are utterly incredible. But they have a residual charm, and Deighton
writes with a fluency which helps this nonsense slip down as easily as some
of his carefully-described meals. Bernie is back with Fiona, worried about
the kids and still in love with Gloria; Fiona is in need of treatment, even
as she is rumoured for head of MI6; Bernie is beaten up more than can be
good for a chap of his age; Werner is looking as suspicious as ever.
Curious, but absurdity like this can grow on you.
Faith, by Len Deighton. (HarperCollins, Pounds 14.99, 337 pages).

Plays by G F Newman usually create quite a stir - Law and Order, for
example, led to allegations of bias and a ban on the BBC filming in jails
for a year - so there is some anticipation about his latest, The Healer
(Tonight, 9.30-10.45pm, BBC1). Paul Rhys plays the new boy on the hospital
ward who discovers he has miraculous powers, with a laying on of hands
proving far more effective than anything he can prescribe. He faces
hostility from within the medical establishment and accusations of quackery
from the press. Geraldine James plays his only white-coated ally. Although
the script is unevenly paced, Newman's polemical thrust drives the drama
along. This after all is the man who banned meat from the catering vans
during filming. The concluding part will be shown tomorrow (9.30-10.25pm).
An astonishing 60 per cent of the world's money is now held in off-shore
accounts according to the Panorama team whose three-parter on the subject,
Dirty Money (Tuesday, September 20, 10.25-11.05pm, BBC1) ends with a look at
Grand Cayman. This Caribbean island is said to be the fifth largest
financial centre in the world, with over Dollars 600bn passing through its
500 banks every year. Gavin Hewitt talks to Jack Blum, a US investigator
into the BCCI affair, who argues that offshore centres provide a safe haven
for money launderers by putting a stop to any serious scrutiny. We also get
to hear from a man who claims to have laundered hundreds of millions of
dollars through British dependent territories in the West Indies. 'I
regarded it as easier than brushing your teeth,' he boasts.
After a seven-year sabbatical, University Challenge returns to television
(Wednesday, September 21, 8.30-9.00pm, BBC2) but on a new channel and with a
new presenter. Jeremy Paxman, having honed his interrogating skills on
politicians, will be showing his nicer nature by throwing questions at
undergraduates, beginning with the University of Birmingham and Aberdeen
University. The revival is due as much to nostalgia as it is to the
intrinsic worth of the programme. So expect to hear the phrase 'your starter
for ten'. Whether Paxman, however, will feel comfortable about saying 'well
remembered, Queens', as Bamber Gascoigne was wont to, is a moot point.
The spoof chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge (Friday,
10.00-10.30pm, BBC2) gathers strength with its second episode. This spin-off
from the Radio Four series is coarser in its approach than its progenitor
but there are some exquisite moments. Tonight our man in the bad wig
interviews Daniella Forest, the new agony aunt for a girlie magazine, who is
described as 'a quality guest from top to bottom and back again' and a
thespian couple - Tany Beaumont and Gary Barker, the bad boy of Beverly
Hills. The team behind this - Steve Coogan, Patrick Marber, Rebecca Front
and Doon Mackichan - represents the latest wave of ex-Oxbridge comics,
following on from John Cleese et al in the 1960s, the Not The Nine O'Clock
News team in the late 1970s and Stephen Fry and his coterie in the 1980s.

FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: FT guide to crime in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How bad a problem is crime in the US?
Opinion polls show more than 20 per cent of those questioned now rate crime
as the most serious issue facing the country, more than any other issue.
Foreigners share that view; the British Foreign Office issues the same kind
of travel warning for Miami that it gives for countries in the midst of
civil war. Since the homicide rate in the US is now seven times that of
Canada and 20 times Germany's, there is good reason for feeling that way.
After all, homicide is now the number three cause of death among elementary
and middle school children, and a child is 15 times more likely to die from
gunfire in the US than in Northern Ireland.
Is it getting worse?
In the mind of the public, there is no question. Polls show people are twice
as afraid of being murdered as they were just one year ago. But
criminologists at the Justice Department say the most reliable statistics
indicate that the total number of crimes has fallen from a peak between 1975
and 1982, while violent crime rates have stayed largely the same. Around 32
people per 1,000 households are victims of violent crime in any given year,
they say. But the level of violence against specific groups such as
teenagers and blacks has risen sharply in recent years.
How much of the problem has to do with drugs?
The total drug arrest rate has climbed over the last decade from 256 per
100,000 inhabitants to 435 per 100,000, and within that total the rate of
arrests for the sale of heroine or cocaine has increased more than
eightfold. The rate of drug arrests increases in line with the size of the
city, to 1,031 per 100,000 in cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants. And
Department of Justice surveys show that two-thirds of all those arrested
test positive for some kind of drug.
What is the federal government trying to do about it?
According to Congressman Charles Schumer, head of the House of
Representatives crime committee, left wingers want all prevention and no
punishment, while right wingers want all punishment and no prevention. But
last month Congress finally passed a crime bill that tries to combine
punishment, prevention and gun control. Over six years the bill will provide
Dollars 8.8bn to hire up to 100,000 new police officers, Dollars 7.9bn to
build prisons and Dollars 6.9bn to pay for social programmes intended to
reduce crime, such as drug rehabilitation and improvements to lighting in
city parks. It would also ban the manufacture or possession of guns
classified as assault weapons and impose tougher sentences for certain
crimes: the death penalty for dozens of new federal offences, such as the
murder of law enforcement officials, and a mandatory life sentence for a
third violent felony.
Will it work?
Probably not. Crime is overwhelmingly a state and local responsibility, and
most federal action on the issue is largely political posturing. Money for
more police officers could help some beleaguered local governments, though
the cities with the worst murder rates, such as Detroit and Washington,
already have some of the largest police forces in proportion to their
populations. The assault gun ban will not touch handguns, which account for
83 per cent of all violent crimes involving firearms. Some prevention
programmes have proved their worth at a local level, but it is always
difficult to duplicate them nationwide. And many local officials doubt
whether Congress will actually find the cash to fulfil the bill's promises.
What about the tougher sentences?
It is traditional to include lots of new death penalties in crime
legislation, but mostly these are exotic offences such as the murder of a
federal poultry inspector. The death penalty is mostly inflicted for murder,
which is a state offence. The federal government last carried out an
execution in 1963, for kidnapping. Mandatory life sentences for repeated
violent offenders could prevent some crimes committed by released prisoners,
like the murder of Polly Klaas in California. But some officials worry that
it could simply fill up the prisons with elderly criminals, and force them
to release other prisoners early because they don't have enough money to
build all the new jails they need. If more executions and more people in
prison were the answer, then the US would already be one of the safest
places in the world. It is virtually alone in the western world in its
insistance on capital punishment; its prison population, with 519 people
jailed for every 100,000 citizens, is five times that of other
industrialised nations and matched only by Russia's.

Should comedy comfort or disturb? If you have never entered the world of
Czech animator Jan Svankmajer before, you should try his Faust, opening in
London this week. The most inventive model-worker and puppeteer in modern
cinema, his last feature was a black-comedy version of Lewis Carroll's
Alice.
Faust takes marionette mayhem even further: bizarrely stylised faces and
figures; bits of nightmare surrealism; pastiche touches of 'antiquity' -
Svankmajer approaches Christopher Marlowe as if by a route through Spitting
Image and Hieronymus Bosch.
If you prefer your humour without a hint of the hellish, there is the new
City Slickers 2. Raved over across the Atlantic, this second cowboy comedy
has Billy Crystal again as star-screenwriter, plus a Jack Palance still
going strong after those Oscar show press-ups when he won Best Supporting
Actor for Slickers 1.
Peter Greenaway's The Falls is the video treat of the week and ideal for
those who like their comedy neither black nor wacky, but very dry. Three
hours of spoof research into a group of 'mysterious' accident victims, the
1980 film was made before Greenaway slipped into mainstream movie-making
with The Draughtsman's Contract. But it has all his gnomic wit, his love of
the absurd and his eye for jewelled, eccentric imagery.
Nobody does comedy better than Woody Allen: even when there is little to
smile at in his own life. With his new film, Bullets Over Broadway headed
for late-year British release after delighting audiences (including me) at
the recent Venice film festival, why not limber up by re-seeing the
20-year-old Annie Hall and the one-year-old Manhattan Murder Mystery? Both
are at the National Film Theatre this week.
With MMM also out on video, you can make up your mind whether Allen's humour
has really hit the skids - as American commentators inferred from the film's
poor performance at the US box office - or whether scandal has simply
clouded everyone's minds. In my view, he is still the funniest man in the
world, and his newest comedies among his best.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Management: Little taste in flavour of the month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just in case it had escaped your notice, this is the year of the London
Taxi. It might sound daft to call a year after a means of transport, yet it
is no dafter than calling a month after a management fad.
In October, the US will celebrate National Quality Month. For those four
weeks there will be general rejoicing over the techniques of total quality
management, and newspaper and magazines will be filled with articles on best
practice and recent innovations in TQM.
On the face of it, Quality Month seems a pointless exercise. TQM is not a
new phenomenon that needs promoting, neither is it the sort of worthy
project - like planting a tree - that requires a special day devoted to it
to spur people into action. Yet Quality Month has become an institution in
the US: it has been running for 10 years, and is still going strong.
On closer inspection, the event is anything but pointless. It is an
opportunity for some big US corporations to tell us how marvellous they are,
and for the consultants who have made a killing out of TQM to lay out their
stalls.
The latest Fortune magazine contains a 40-page special section on the
shindig, packed with advertisements for the companies that are sponsoring
the event. Ford declares that it gives customers 'the best service on
earth'; Coca-Cola shouts that its 'commitment to quality is judged 705m
times every day'. Chase Manhattan, General Motors, Goodyear, and many others
boast about how long they have been quality devotees, and how dedicated to
the movement they are.
While as a management tool, quality is old hat and flawed to boot, as an
advertising message it is still powerful. Yet as I turned page after page of
these advertisements, I wondered if the top of that cycle had been reached.
When one company tells us about the quality of its employees, its service or
its product and about how hard it tries to delight its customers we may feel
impressed. But when everyone is noisily delivering the same message the
impact is lost.
As far as I know, there is not yet a special month devoted to partnership
sourcing. And just as well: last week this fashionable management notion
received some serious blows. AT Kearney, the management consultants, has
just published a report showing that while 90 per cent of companies are
interested in the idea, those who have tried it are sceptical. More
momentous, Intel and Compaq Computer, whose business interests as customer
and supplier are irrevocably linked, were revealed last week to be at
daggers drawn over differences in strategy.
Disappointing it may be, surprising it is not. The idea behind partnership
sourcing is a pleasing one: customers and suppliers should stop their vain
struggle for power and for margin, and instead join hands in product
development and marketing for their mutual advancement.
But it is a fantasy to expect these partnerships to work effortlessly. All
relationships are difficult - one in three marriages ends in divorce, and in
the case of husband and wife the liaison is not usually built on a
fundamental conflict of interest. In the case of two separate companies,
both of which are trying to maximise their own profits and pursue inevitably
different strategies, it is amazing that any partnership sourcing
arrangements ever work at all.
There are plenty of seminars that promise to turn bumbling managers into
world-class communicators. But there is a sad lack of more modest courses
which accept that inept people are not going to change, and instead offer
them advice on how to extricate themselves from the regrettable situations
into which they stumble.
I felt the absence of any such lessons the other day when I got myself into
hot water at the Savoy Grill. I was greeted at the entrance of this famous
lunching haunt by the maitre d'. Due to temporary memory failure, I gave him
the wrong name of my host. He told me that there was no such booking, and
sent me to the hotel's other restaurant, where there was a reservation in
the name I had given.
For half an hour I sat at someone else's table scattering bread crumbs and
sipping the drink I had taken the liberty of ordering. There was some
consternation when the real occupants turned up, until an immaculately
polite waiter inquired whether I was in fact due to dine with someone of a
different name who had been patiently waiting all this time in the Grill.
I could see no alternative than to tell my host the whole ugly truth, but
with hindsight I wonder whether there was not some more graceful form of
escape. I know all those techniques for remembering peoples names like
repeating them over and over when you are first told them. But this was a
more serious lapse. Maybe if you can't remember the name of a business
acquaintance who you know quite well you are beyond the help of any mere
management course.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Management: An angry young warrior - Emiko Terazono and
Christopher Lorenz explain how Fuji Xerox's desire to spread its wings is
putting a strain on relations with its US parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the many joint ventures between American and Japanese companies, Fuji
Xerox has long been regarded as a model. The Japanese affiliate of Fuji
Photo Film and Xerox, the US copier maker, has not just been a success in
its own right. It also rescued Xerox from oblivion in the 1980s by supplying
it with a string of successful products. Even more important, it has
provided its US parent with a continuous flow of object lessons in better
management techniques, notably total quality and 'benchmarking'.
Xerox has since transferred its 'TQM' and benchmarking expertise to a host
of other companies in the US and Europe, making Fuji Xerox as influential a
source of management expertise - albeit an indirect one - as Toyota in
manufacturing or Sony in innovation.
At the age of 32, with 27,000 employees and revenues last year of Y706.6bn
(Pounds 4.6bn), the 50-50 venture is pretty mature by the standards of most
inter-company alliances. But, in common with many younger ventures, it is
suffering a delayed bout of growing pains over relations with one of its
parents.
Set up in 1962, its success in the low end of the copier market in the 1970s
and 1980s contrasted sharply with Xerox's problems. The troubles of the US
group were so severe at one point that the joke among consultants was that
the Japanese affiliate would buy out its American parent.
Now, when a resurgent Xerox is reorganising many of its international
operations in order to improve what it calls the 'line of sight' (direct
influence) of its US-based business divisions over their markets around the
world, Fuji Xerox is straining at the leash. It claims - as it has often
done in the past - that it is finding the group's organisation an increasing
constraint on its own growth. The group structure divides global
responsibilities geographically between Xerox, Fuji Xerox and Rank Xerox,
the European affiliate.
Under this arrangement Fuji Xerox's external sales are limited to the
Asia-Pacific region, although it also supplies a substantial volume of
products and designs to the Xerox network in North America and Europe. The
latter are thought to account for about 10 per cent of its revenues,
slightly more than its Asian sales.
'As our client companies expand globally, we are finding that the group's
division of territories is hampering business and making it hard for us to
counter the competition,' says Toshio Arima, strategic planning director of
Fuji Xerox and the main link with Xerox on policy matters. 'It's a very
difficult problem and we are trying to solve things one (issue) at a time,'
he says.
Arima says effective technical and service support of Japanese
multinationals is one issue which needs to be resolved, while a global
manufacturing strategy to improve competitiveness is another.
Jeff Kennard, who for five years was executive assistant in Tokyo to the
venture's president and is now director of Fuji Xerox relations at Xerox
headquarters in Connecticut, counters in the friendliest of tones. He says
Fuji Xerox already copes with this problem by having account executives
around the world who, in conjunction with local representatives from Xerox
or Rank Xerox, deal successfully with global customer companies.
Although he stresses that Fuji Xerox can only operate 'where the agreement
allows them to', Kennard, who is one of five Xerox westerners on the
venture's 28-person board against only two from Fuji Photo Film, points out
that the affiliate's territory was expanded only four years ago.
In addition to Japan, it previously held the right to sell in Indonesia,
South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. In 1990 it acquired the
Australian, New Zealand, Singaporean and Malaysian markets from Rank Xerox.
The Japanese affiliate had argued since the early 1980s that Rank Xerox's
strategy of targeting the high end of the market was ineffective.
While Fuji Xerox has considerable autonomy in developing and marketing
products for these countries, its design of products for multinational
markets is now subject to close co-ordination with the US and European
organisation - a form of control which, however sensible, sometimes irks
Japanese pride.
At US headquarters, Kennard says that although the separate nature of the
two organisations causes inevitable complexities in the co-ordination of
strategy, technology, product development, manufacturing and marketing to
key customers, 'we're proud of how well the two managements work together'.
They must do so even more closely now that digital technology is turning the
copier business into an integral part of the information technology industry
 -a trend which will expose Xerox to even stiffer competition than in the
past.
As Kennard says: 'It's a bit like a husband and wife. You don't just order
people around if you want to maintain a good relationship.'
This is not the first time that American satisfaction with the relationship
has been matched by an urge on the Japanese side for more independence over
where and how to do business.
The issue has been endemic to the relationship for well over a decade. It
rests partly on Fuji Xerox's stubborn independence in the past in product
strategy, which paid off handsomely on repeated occasions, and partly on a
long-standing view, in the words of one Fuji Xerox manager, that 'our
(world) market should be protected by ourselves'.
There has also been resentment over the years that, because of the
territorial agreement, Fuji Xerox could never achieve as high an export
ratio as independent rivals such as Canon. This, the Japanese believe, puts
a brake on the joint venture's growth.
This tension is reinforced by the usual clash between Japanese and western
priorities. In common with other Japanese companies, Fuji Xerox has placed
more emphasis on growing its market share than on increasing its
profitability and return on assets. The balance has had to be redressed
somewhat since its profits were hit by the recession in 1991, but there is
still comment within the venture that this difference contributed to its
rise and Xerox's decline during the 1970s and 1980s.
In its early years Fuji Xerox managed to position itself in Japan by doing
business very much the 'Japanese way'. When the joint venture was set up,
the manufacturing was done by Fuji Photo Film, and day-to-day operations
were looked after by former Fuji managers. Today Fuji Xerox still prides
itself on being more Japanese than a Japanese company.
However, a contract between the two parent companies stipulated that as a
shareholder, Fuji Photo Film could collect information from Fuji Xerox but
could not use it in its own operations. This limited the extent of Fuji
Photo Film's involvement in the affiliate. Its direct role was virtually
terminated when production was transferred to Fuji Xerox in 1971.
Another element which heightened the sense of autonomy was the technology
and licensing agreements made between the US parent and the venture. 'The
agreements are like those between two independent companies, rather than
loose acknowledgements of the sort which exist within Japanese companies,'
says Arima.
In the early 1970s, Xerox grudgingly allowed Fuji Xerox to go its own way in
research and product development. The Japanese subsidiary wanted to expand
market share by developing cheap compact copier machines for outright sale,
while Xerox's main priority was maintaining large profit margins and return
on assets by targeting the high end of the market - and continuing its
traditional policy of rental.
Fuji Xerox also foresaw Japanese companies threatening the copier market
once Xerox's xerography patents expired in the early 1970s.
Strong leadership helped tackle these problems. In spite of Xerox's initial
demand that the venture stop R&amp;D in the low end of the market and desist
from direct sales, the Japanese affiliate forged ahead with its own agenda
under Yotaro Kobayashi, then president and now chairman.
Having suffered badly in the Japanese market at the hands of arch-rival
Ricoh, Kobayashi initiated Fuji Xerox's quality control programme, which
eventually led to the company winning the Deming Prize, awarded to companies
that show outstanding quality management.
It was only in the late 1970s that Xerox finally woke up to Japanese
competition - and, with it, the full virtues of its offspring. With its back
against the wall, it started importing the low and mid-market copiers from
Fuji Xerox which it had at first scorned. It adopted the venture's quality
discipline of halving manufacturing defects and slashing the number of
suppliers. By as early as 1980 the benchmarking of its operations against
those of Fuji Xerox had helped it to narrow sharply the 50 per cent cost gap
that had existed with its Japanese rivals, and it made further progress in
subsequent years.
All this, plus the increasing importance of Fuji Xerox's financial
contribution to the Xerox group's earnings, brought the two sides much
closer than they had been. During the 1980s they intensified co-operation on
research, product development, manufacturing and planning, and exchanged
more personnel than in the past to reinforce the relationship.
For the Japanese, the sense of being an equal was heightened further this
year when the original Technology Assistance agreement governing the
relationship between the two companies, and under which Xerox licensed
technology to Japan, was upgraded into a Technology Agreement. The
difference in wording is marginal, but it reflects the fact that the flow is
now two-way - although Kennard points out that it is still much greater from
the US to Japan than vice versa.
At a time when the yen's sharp appreciation is eating away export profits
and the focus in the group's technology has shifted from hardware to
software, Arima says Fuji Xerox is once again looking to its parent for its
some of its R&amp;D capability.
To the consultants' old joke about buying Xerox, he says: 'We wouldn't dream
of it. We're good at making the boxes, but they're better at creating added
value.'
Kennard adds that the possibility of Xerox buying out any of Fuji's stake is
just as unthinkable. Such a move was considered by the Americans in the late
1960s when Xerox took 51 per cent control of Rank Xerox, and again in the
1970s when Fuji Xerox stepped out of line by starting to design and make its
own copiers. But recently it has not crossed anyone's mind, Kennard insists.
The effect of Xerox obtaining even 51 per cent would be negative, he says.
'We would risk alienating management, hurting the well-earned pride of the
Japanese employees and throwing away the stimulus which Xerox gets from the
healthy tension between the two of us.' On top of that, he says 'how much
practical control we could get would be questionable.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Lord Alexander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Alexander of Weedon QC, 58, is chairman of National Westminster Bank.
He has been chairman of the Takeover Panel, and chairman of the Bar Council.
He is currently deputy chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
What would you take with you?
My family. We have a builder, cook, vintner, garden designer, decorator and
banker. We could set up a travel lodge, Relais and Chateaux style, with a
journalist to handle the publicity and an insolvency lawyer if it fails
spectacularly.
What technology would you need?
The machine of the near-future: a voice-activated word processor. I would
need 48 hours' notice of departure for a quick training course. Then I could
simply live by talking, the ultimate joy for an advocate.
What would you like to leave behind?
London's polluted air. My own slight asthma returned this year for the first
time since youth. Pollution levels are intolerable, and I should like to
stay marooned until strong environmental action has been taken.
If 10 per cent of vehicles produce 40-50 per cent of air pollution, it seems
an admirable first step to clamp down on them. Meanwhile, we could use the
island versions of public transport - walking and swimming.
Anything else?
The way in which customer complaints are sometimes covered in the tabloid
press. Sometimes they are sadly accurate, which upsets us all. But when they
are distorted or over-hyped, they are annoying.
What would you miss most?
The theatre. The Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre are
among our country's greatest glories. Charades by the camp fire would not be
the same.
What books would you take?
'Other Men's Flowers,' the poetry anthology compiled from Lord Wavell's
memory. And the complete Dickens. I love the 19th century but history books
can be dry. He is a wonderful chronicler of its darkness and light, richness
and drabness.
It would make me think about how much of our society has its roots in the
last century - the parliamentary franchise, the social mores, and the
infrastructure we still rely on. It was a time when we had come through the
most raw and crude parts of the industrial revolution but there was still an
extremely powerful economic engine in this country.
What would you eat and drink?
The island's fish and vegetables would supply our every want. My taste in
drink is simple. Champagne in winter and beer in summer.
What would you do for exercise?
I would take a beach cricket set.
An item to preserve sanity?
My London diary to remind me of the contrast. I feel that I am always
rushing at work, and when the pressure is released on holiday it is
glorious.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Gain and Fable: The greatest story never told - If the DTI
report into alleged insider dealing by Lord Archer were published, it would
probably become a best-seller to rival the success of the novelist himself.
But the account is very unlikely to appear. Robert Peston sets out here what
the investigators might have written

<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry's report into alleged insider trading
by Lord Archer in Anglia Television shares would be a best-seller if it were
published, perhaps rivalling the sales of the best-selling novelist's own
thrillers.
But publication of the real thing seems very remote. So in the interests of
honest competition with Lord Archer's highly profitable works of fiction, a
version of what the DTI inspectors might have written is presented below.
The intention is to shed light on how and why in mid-January Lord Archer
placed orders to buy 50,000 Anglia shares, days before an agreed takeover
bid for the company was announced.
1 A brief history of Anglia Television
The company was incorporated in September 1958. Its main subsidiary, Anglia
Television Limited, is licensed by the Independent Television Commission to
hold the broadcasting franchise for the east of England. In January, its
board estimated that in the year to December 31 1993, the company made
profits before tax of at least Pounds 16m, including an exceptional credit
of Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 14.5m the previous year.
2 Lady Archer and the Anglia board of directors
On January 29 1987, Anglia Television announced that Dr Mary Archer, for 10
years fellow and college lecturer in chemistry at Newnham College Cambridge,
was joining its board. Her fellow directors describe her as 'punctilious'
and 'very professional'.
Dr Archer, as she prefers to be known, is also head of the Lloyd's hardship
committee, which assesses whether penurious members of the London insurance
market should receive financial support.
3 Lord Archer, fiction and the Conservative party
Dr Archer is the wife of the best-selling novelist, Lord Archer, formerly Mr
Jeffrey Archer, who was created a life peer in 1992 and was deputy chairman
of the Conservative party from 1985 to 1986. Mr John Major, the prime
minister, is a friend.
Lord Archer has had a volatile career. He became Tory MP for Louth in 1969.
However, he stood down in 1974 after a businessman, Mr Anthony Bamford,
started bankruptcy proceedings against him to recover funds that Lord Archer
had invested in Aquablast, a Canadian company which turned out to be
fraudulent. Lord Archer was financially ruined, but rebuilt his fortune when
he discovered a talent for writing popular fiction.
4 Lord Archer, Broosk Saib, Kurdistan and the PM
In April 1991 Lord Archer became involved in fundraising for the Kurds of
northern Iraq by organising the Simple Truth pop concert. Through his visits
to Kurdistan, he became friendly with Mr Broosk Saib, a London-based Kurdish
businessman.
Mr Saib, who is 32, controlled two companies, Broosk Estate Agents and
Broosk Interior Designs, which were wound up in 1991. When liquidated,
Broosk Estate Agents was unable to repay creditors owed Pounds 71,673.
From January 3 to January 9 of this year, Lord Archer travelled in Iraq to
investigate the plight of the Kurds. On returning, he met the prime
minister, Mr John Major, to give a report on their condition.
5 Anglia directors' share dealing code
On September 23 1992, the Anglia board adopted new rules 'governing dealings
by officers (which include all directors) of the group in the securities of
the company'. These rules were 'applicable to any dealings by the officer's
spouse or on behalf of any infant child or by any other person connected
with him'.
The rules also applied to other dealings in which the officer or any other
person connected with him 'is or is to be treated as interested'. The rules
prohibited dealings by officers and their spouses when the officers
possessed information which was 'likely, upon publication, to affect the
market price of those securities'. Information about a possible takeover of
Anglia fell into this category.
The rules also contained an explicit prohibition on dealings by any director
or their spouse in Anglia shares during the 'close period', from the end of
the company's financial year on December 31 to the publication of its annual
results, normally in the middle of March.
Each director was required to sign a copy of the rules, confirming that they
had received them and that they would 'act in accordance therewith'.
Directors informed their spouses and connected parties.
6 The outhouse in the Grantchester garden
Lady Archer has told her fellow Anglia directors that she keeps all her
confidential board papers in a converted Victorian folly in the garden of
the main family home at Grantchester near Cambridge. She and Lord Archer
have separate offices in the folly.
7 Lord Archer, fiction and stockbrokers Charles Stanley
Since the early 1970s, Lord Archer had sporadically done business with Mr
Simon Wharmby and Mr Frank Watts, two stockbrokers who have worked as a team
for a variety of City of London firms.
They both joined Charles Stanley in October 1993, having left Sheppards
after it was merged with Carr Kitcat. Charles Stanley is a medium-size
stockbroker that can trace its roots back 200 years. It is controlled by the
Howard family, which is well-known in the City of London. Its typical
clients are wealthy individuals, including 'senior members' of the
Conservative Party, according to one of its executives.
In the 1970s, Mr Watts and Mr Wharmby worked for Rowe Rudd, an aggressive
stockbroking firm used by Lord Archer which no longer exists. Mr Watts has
told friends that he had tried to deter Lord Archer from making his ruinous
investments in Aquablast.
Coincidentally, a character called 'Frank Watts', also employed by a 'Rowe
Rudd', appears in Lord Archer's first novel, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny
Less, which launched him back on the road to fortune. The novel contains a
scene in which Mr Watts receives an order to buy and sell a parcel of shares
within a single dealing period or 'account' from an insider dealer.
For the past few years, neither Mr Watts nor Mr Wharmby had had any business
dealings with Lord Archer, according to a friend of theirs.
However, Mr Wharmby telephoned Lord Archer twice shortly after joining
Charles Stanley. He did this because he was contacting all wealthy former
clients to inform them where he could be reached. Around Christmas, he then
contacted Lord Archer again to ask him if he wanted to invest in an unusual
scheme to salvage a ship sunk during the second world war. Lord Archer
declined.
8 Regulatory changes which made Anglia a takeover target
In May 1993, the then national heritage secretary, Mr Peter Brooke, launched
a review of the rules preventing any company from holding more than one
large broadcasting franchise. He announced on November 24 that each ITV
company would be permitted to hold two regional franchises, subject to
approval by both Houses of Parliament. The new rules came into effect on
January 1.
As a smaller television company, with a market value in December 1993 of
Pounds 190m, Anglia was widely viewed after the rule change as vulnerable to
a takeover by a bigger franchise holder or media company, such as MAI, which
controls Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company.
9 Events leading to the takeover of Anglia by MAI
In December 1993, MAI indicated to Anglia that it would be interested in
making a bid for the company. Board papers which gave details of this
tentative offer were sent to directors on December 31.
MAI's interest in the company was discussed by the Anglia board for the
first time at a meeting held in their Leicester Square office in the centre
of London on January 5. The meeting, which was attended by Lady Archer, ran
from 10.30am until lunch. Directors also discussed and rejected a
complicated four-way partial merger involving London Weekend Television,
Yorkshire and Tyne Tees. However directors kept open the options of
combining with MAI or remaining independent.
10 MAI's bid proposal
A firm bid proposal from MAI was discussed for the first time by the Anglia
board at a meeting on January 12. The meeting, held again at Anglia's London
offices lasted from 9am until lunch. MAI was offering around 610p a share.
The board authorised Sir Peter Gibbings, Anglia's chairman, to negotiate a
takeover at close to 650p a share.
That afternoon, Sir Peter and his chief executive, David McCall, met Lord
Hollick, MAI's managing director, and Sir James Mackinnon, MAI's chairman,
to discuss takeover terms. Agreement on a takeover price of about 650p was
reached. The following morning, Anglia directors were invited to attend a
further board meeting, to be held on Sunday January 16.
11 Anglia's share price performance
Because Anglia was widely viewed as a takeover target, its shares had
performed strongly in the latter months of 1993 and early 1994. On January
4, its share price was 428p. By January 12, the day before Lord Archer
placed his first order, it had risen to 482p, a rise of 13 per cent in just
seven working days. Brokers say that if there had not been a takeover bid
for the company, the price might well have fallen.
12 Lord Archer's first order to buy Anglia shares
At around 10am on January 13 Lord Archer telephoned Mr Wharmby and asked him
to check the 'price and size' - or availability - of Anglia shares. This was
the day after the Anglia board meeting which first discussed MAI's detailed
takeover proposals, including a 610p bid price which was subsequently
revised upwards. It was also during the 'close period', during which any
dealings by Anglia directors and their spouses were prohibited by the
company's rules.
Mr Wharmby called Charles Stanley's dealers, who told him that a parcel of
80,000 shares was available. He then telephoned Lord Archer to tell him
this. However, Lord Archer said the cost was too great. Instead, he placed
an order to purchase 25,000 shares at a price of 485p.
Mr Wharmby then spoke again to Charles Stanley's dealers, who clinched a
deal with a market maker (a wholesaler of shares). According to stock
exchange records, the deal was executed at 10.25am.
Mr Wharmby then called Lord Archer and told him the deal had been completed.
Up until this moment, Mr Wharmby had assumed that the shares were being
bought for Lord Archer himself. However, when Mr Wharmby asked Lord Archer
how he wanted the deal to be recorded, Lord Archer said the shares should be
booked in the name of Mr Broosk Saib, an individual for whom Charles Stanley
had never dealt and who did not have an account at the firm.
Stockbrokers say that it is unusual for an individual to place an order on
someone else's behalf and not mention that the shares are being bought for
this other person before the deal is transacted. 'It is even stranger if the
acquaintance does not already have an account with the stockbroker,' said a
leading broker.
13 Lord Archer's address as mailbox for Mr Saib
To carry out the transaction, Charles Stanley had to set up an account in
the name of Mr Saib and in order to do so it needed an address for the
Kurdish businessman.
Mr Saib has a London home, at 14 Heath Rise, Kersfield Road, Putney.
However, this was not supplied by Lord Archer.
Instead the novelist asked that the name and address on the account details
should be: 'B Saib Esq, c/o J Archer, Alembic House, 93 Albert Embankment,
London SE1 7TY.' Alembic House is Lord Archer's London residence.
14 Mr Saib says he is a frequent dealer in shares
Mr Saib had never before used Lord Archer's address as a mailbox when
dealing in shares through any City of London stockbroker. This was
ascertained by Charles Stanley when it checked Mr Saib's creditworthiness
through the Stock Exchange Mutual Reference Society, a database containing
the names and addresses of all exchange members' clients.
Charles Stanley did not check whether Mr Saib had ever dealt in shares using
his own address in account details supplied to a broking firm.
Mr Saib has subsequently said: 'I have bought a lot of shares in my
lifetime, and I continue to do so.' However, he has not said why he needed
to use Lord Archer to place the orders on this occasion.
15 A second Anglia share order
Having instructed Mr Wharmby to register the shares in the name of Mr Saib,
Lord Archer said that he would be interested in buying more shares if they
became available at the same price. As a result, the following afternoon Mr
Wharmby telephoned him and offered him a second parcel of 25,000 shares,
again at 485p, which Lord Archer agreed to buy. Once more he bought for Mr
Saib's account.
According to Stock Exchange records, the deal was executed with a market
maker at 1.58pm.
16 Lord Archer as effective guarantor of the deal
On the morning of January 14, a few hours before this second order was
placed, Mr Peter Hurst, Charles Stanley's finance director, noticed on his
copy of the firm's dealing sheet that a new client, Mr Saib, had bought
25,000 Anglia shares. Because he had never heard of Mr Saib, he wondered
whether the firm should be giving him Pounds 121,250 of credit to pay for
the shares.
Under Stock Exchange settlement procedures, whenever anyone buys shares his
or her broker provides credit to pay for them. This de facto loan lasts
until 'account day', when the client has to deliver the funds.
Mr Hurst therefore asked Mr Wharmby why he had dealt for Mr Saib. Mr Wharmby
explained that the order had in fact been placed by Lord Archer. Mr Hurst
therefore came to the reasonable conclusion that Lord Archer would be 'good
for the payment' if Mr Saib could not come up with the funds. He therefore
gave Mr Wharmby permission to buy the second parcel of shares for Mr Saib
that afternoon.
Mr David Howard, managing director of Charles Stanley and an expert on
stockbroker contract law as author of a Law Society paper on the subject,
was convinced that Lord Archer, the agent for the transaction, would have
been found liable in the courts if Mr Saib had failed to pay for the shares.
17 No payment is made for the shares
In fact, the question of who would pay for the shares turned out to be
irrelevant. They were bought and sold within a single account period, under
a Stock Exchange settlement system which has now been superseded. Because
the purchase and sale fell within a single account, the buyer did not have
to put up any money.
Lord Archer had to make special arrangements to ensure that the purchase and
sale fell within a single account in this way, because January 13 and
January 14 were the last two days of a dealing account. He asked for the
shares to be bought for 'new time' by paying a slight premium over the
market price for the shares. As a result the transactions counted as falling
into the next dealing account period.
If the shares had not been bought in this way, payment for them would have
been required on January 24. Instead, settlement day was deferred until
February 7.
18 Anglia is reminded of the restrictions on dealings
Meanwhile, Anglia's solicitors, Linklaters and Paines, wrote on January 14
to the Anglia company secretary, Mr Robin Stephenson, asking him to remind
the board that neither they nor their spouses, dependents or connected
parties should be dealing in Anglia shares, in view of the negotiations with
MAI.
19 Anglia's board agrees to the takeover
On Sunday January 16, Anglia's board met at the offices of the company's
merchant bank, SG Warburg, in the City of London. The meeting lasted from
2pm until the late afternoon. The board gave approval for the merchant
bankers to finalise the takeover terms with MAI. The merchant bankers -
Warburg for Anglia and NM Rothschild for MAI - then worked through two
nights so all remaining impediments to a deal could be removed.
20 The takeover is announced to the Stock Exchange
At just after 8am on January 18, MAI's recommended offer for Anglia was
announced. The terms in cash and new MAI convertible preference shares
valued the company at approximately Pounds 292m and each Anglia share at
'not less than 637p', with the precise value dependent on how the stock
market would eventually value the MAI preference shares.
21 Lord Archer's instructions to sell the Anglia shares
Immediately after the bid was announced, Anglia's share price soared.
At around 10am that morning Lord Archer telephoned Mr Wharmby and instructed
him to sell all 50,000 shares. Stock Exchange records show the deal was
transacted at about 10.15am, at a price per share of 646p, realising a gross
sum of Pounds 323,000. The net profit on the deal, after deducting
commissions and stamp duty reserve tax of 0.5 per cent, was Pounds
77,219.62.
22 The Stock Exchange's preliminary investigation
On the same morning, Mr Hurst of Charles Stanley noticed the Stock Exchange
announcement of MAI's bid for Anglia. He asked his firm's compliance
officer, Mr Eric Hurrell, who is responsible for ensuring that it sticks to
the rules of the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Authority, to
have a close look at Lord Archer's share orders.
These deals were conspicuous. Although the firm had received several orders
to buy Anglia shares in the preceding weeks, there had been only Lord
Archer's on each of January 13 and January 14.
At a meeting of Charles Stanley's directors the following day, Mr Hurrell
pointed out quite how well-timed these had been. An executive of the firm,
who happened to be in the room, then exclaimed that Lady Archer was an
Anglia director.
The managing director, Mr Howard, responded: 'My God, this is front page
stuff.' He instructed Mr Hurrell to pass on the details to the Stock
Exchange's insider dealing group, which has responsibility for the initial
stages of insider dealing probes.
However the exchange had already left a telephone message for Mr Hurrell. It
wanted him to review all the firm's Anglia deals to see if any could have
been transacted on the basis of inside information.
Mr Hurrell told the exchange: 'I have been expecting your call.' He went on
to say that Lord Archer's share orders should be scrutinised carefully.
23 The launch of a formal DTI investigation
In the following three days, the Stock Exchange collected as much
information as it could about Lord Archer's Anglia share orders.
At the beginning of the following week, the exchange passed its dossier on
the transactions to the Department of Trade and Industry. The prime minister
was then informed of the dealings. On February 8, the DTI appointed Mr Hugh
Aldous, an accountant from Robson Rhodes, and Mr Roger Kaye QC, to
investigate 'possible insider dealing contraventions'.
24 Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less
Charles Stanley was uncertain whether it should pay the cheque for the
dealing profit to Mr Saib, in view of the inquiry being conducted into the
transactions. It was advised by its solicitors that it should probably hang
on to the money.
There was a risk, according to the solicitors, that Charles Stanley could be
embroiled in a court case if the market makers who sold the shares to Mr
Saib via the broker sued on the basis that the purchaser might have
benefited unfairly from inside information.
However, the Stock Exchange gave the broker informal guidance that it would
prefer that the cheque were paid as though nothing unusual had occurred. It
did not want Mr Saib or Lord Archer alerted to the possibility that an
inquiry was taking place.
So on February 4, Charles Stanley sent a cheque for Pounds 77,219.62 to Lord
Archer's home. It was an 'account payee only' cheque dated February 7 and
drawn on the Bank of Scotland.
25 The cheque is banked and Pounds 10,000 in cash is withdrawn
On February 10, the cheque was deposited in Mr Saib's account at the
National Westminster Bank's branch in Cromwell Road, west London.
Mr Saib already had a current account at the Cromwell Road branch. However,
he opened a Premium Reserve interest-paying account, into which he
transferred just over Pounds 50,000 of the proceeds.
In February and March there were three significant withdrawals from Mr
Saib's NatWest account: there were payments to external accounts of Pounds
10,000 and Pounds 12,000, plus a cash withdrawal of Pounds 10,000.
The external accounts which received the payments belonged to 'individual
organisations' unconnected to Lord Archer, according to an official with a
close knowledge of the DTI investigation.
26 Lord Archer contacts Simon Wharmby again
Towards the end of February, Lord Archer, having been approached for an
interview by the DTI's inspectors, telephoned Mr Wharmby. He inquired what
the investigation might concern and appeared surprised that anyone should
believe there was anything peculiar about the Anglia share orders.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Delegates are advised to reject minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called on his party
to reject proposals for the introduction of a rigid minimum wage, urging
them to back 'flexible' policies on the economy and the labour market.
As Liberal Democrats prepared to debate the economic policies with which
they will fight the next election, Mr Ashdown told delegates that they must
issue a clear rejection of wage controls at this week's conference if they
are to underline the distinction between their party's economic policies and
those of Labour.
In an eve-of-conference speech the Liberal Democrat leader poured scorn on
Labour's 'umbilical attachment' to a rigid national minimum wage, which, he
said, was foisted on them by the public-sector unions. Instead, he urged the
introduction of 'wage watchdogs' which would 'investigate' allegations of
exploitation by employers.
He said: 'The right way to tackle exploitation is through targeted policies
 -decentralised, flexible, running with the grain of the market - policies
that protect both the wages and the jobs of the lowest paid.'
Senior party officials admit, however, that the conference may endorse a
call for more rigid wage regulation tomorrow in its discussion of
employment. This would include the setting of a regional minimum hourly rate
of pay by a Low Pay Commission.
With debate already raging over how the Liberal Democrats should deal with a
Labour party led by Mr Tony Blair, some of Mr Ashdown's colleagues believe
the party must clearly reject 'old-style' socialist policies.
They believe that the party will avoid calling for renationalisation in a
debate today in spite of discontent in the Liberal Democrats' heartland in
the west country.
The Liberal Democrat leader is also determined to avoid a clash with
delegates this week on the party's commitment to tax incomes over Pounds
100,000 a year at the rate of 60 per cent.
Mr Ashdown is understood to believe a recent Liberal Democrat resolution
calling for this level of taxation is far too punitive. The leader of the
party's Parliamentary Candidates' Association said at the weekend that the
party had 'pressed the self-destruct button' with its taxation policy.
Nevertheless, some senior party figures take comfort that this level of
taxation is less severe than the rate imposed by the Conservative government
for most of the 1980s.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Blair casts long shadow over Ashdown's future: Philip
Stephens says Labour, with a new leader, has shifted the ground on which the
third force in politics is fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the issue on everyone's mind. Most would prefer not to talk about it.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, was nowhere to be seen as
the Liberal Democrats gathered in Brighton yesterday at the start of the
autumn political season. His shadow was everywhere.
The Labour party's decision to elect as its leader an aggressive and
attractive young moderniser has shifted irrevocably the political ground on
which the Liberal Democrats must fight the next election.
The already threadbare pretence that the third force in British politics
could remain neutral between the Conservatives and Labour has been torn
open. The doctrine of 'equidistance', so cherished by Dr David Owen in the
1980s, when as leader of the now-defunct SDP he flirted with the
Conservatives, no longer has even the pretence of credibility.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's party does have other things to discuss in Brighton. In
other circumstances it would feel entitled to some modest
self-congratulation. It is only five years since the party almost destroyed
itself during the break-up of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance. But it is still
here, and as strong now as it has ever been in post-war politics.
As Mr Ashdown never ceases to remind us, the Liberal Democrats hold a record
4,600 council seats as well as their 23 places at Westminster. After the
heady by-election successes of Newbury, Christchurch and Eastleigh the
European election result in June came as a disappointment. But the party's
two seats in the Strasbourg assembly provide its first representation in
Europe.
More importantly the party, always relatively strong in Scotland, has broken
out of its other bastion in Devon and Cornwall to establish a wider
political base in south-west England. That means it has become more
efficient in turning votes into seats.
The electoral successes have been accompanied by a more mature approach to
policymaking. Compared with their two larger opponents the Liberal Democrats
still occasionally come up with pretty eclectic policies. Activists reserve
the right to debate at length the sort of issues which ensure that the party
is regularly panned in the tabloid press.
The conference will argue whether the monarchy should be scrapped and
whether young girls should have access to contraceptives. Mr Ashdown will
find it hard to win time on television news bulletins for more important
debates on the economy, the constitution and the environment.
In spite of eccentricities Mr Ashdown has shifted the Liberal Democrats'
political centre of gravity.
It is true that some of the specific ideas - a massive shift away from value
added tax to a raft of new pollution levies, hypothecation of income taxes,
curfews for young criminals and local referendums on planning decisions -
frequently owe more to a craving for distinctiveness than to careful
analysis. But taken together the burst of policymaking since the 1992
general election has positioned the party on the hard centre-left.
By and large it has come to terms with an enterprise-based economy, the need
for flexible markets and the need for reform of public services. Mr Ashdown
hopes that this week it will shy away from joining Labour in backing a
national minimum wage and will cut its proposed top rate of income tax to 50
per cent.
More broadly, ideas for constitutional reform now stretch well beyond the
self-serving demand for proportional representation. The party is beginning
to acknowledge that European integration will not solve all of Britain's
problems. And there are signs that the hard-headed realities of Westminster
are starting to be understood by the party's local activists.
So it is understandable that Mr Ashdown should want to spend this week
reinforcing the notion that his party has at last established a mature,
distinctive identity.
Third-party politics cannot, however, operate in a vacuum. The chorus of
acknowledgements from senior party figures yesterday that the Liberal
Democrats could not respond to an inconclusive general election by
sustaining the Conservatives in office was in one sense stating the obvious.
There has never been much logic to the notion that because the party is
frequently a natural home for disgruntled Tory voters it must keep open the
option of support for a Conservative administration.
The Liberal Democrats are committed to pluralist government and
constitutional reform. They cannot sustain in office a party that by the
time of the next election will have governed Britain for 18 years.
Admitting the obvious is one thing. Defining the possible extent of any
collaboration with a Labour administration is altogether different.
There are too many imponderables. The success of Mr Blair's project to turn
Labour into a modern social democratic party is one. The outcome of the
general election is another.
Neither Liberal Democrats nor Labour can envisage pre-election pacts. If Mr
Blair were to win an overall majority at Westminster his present inclination
for co-operative rather than confrontational politics between the two
parties may change.
Mr Ashdown is right to say that the only option facing his party is to
compete on independent ground before the next election. But he will not be
able to hide the fact that there is only one route for the Liberal Democrats
into government - behind Mr Blair.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Lib Dems scorn idea of deals with Tories: Move to drop
'equidistance' from rivals brings angry response from leader as party
gathers in Brighton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday abandoned their neutrality between the
Conservatives and Labour as a raft of senior figures insisted there were no
circumstances in which the party could help keep the present government in
office after the next general election. But the decision by leading Liberal
Democrats to drop publicly the stance of 'equidistance' adopted since the
1992 general election brought an angry response from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
party leader.
In spite of an oblique admission in a speech last night that he accepted the
present stance was unsustainable, Mr Ashdown said colleagues indulging in
public debate on the issue were 'wasting very important time'.
Mr Ashdown said at the start of the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton
that the party's main task was to entrench its own distinctive and
independent identity as a powerful third force in British politics.
His comments followed public statements by Lord Jenkins, the leader of the
party in the Lords, Baroness Williams and Mr Simon Hughes, the party's
environment spokesmen in the Commons. They welcomed the election of Mr Tony
Blair as the leader of the Labour party.
Lord Jenkins and Lady Williams, both founder members of the defunct SDP,
said there could be no question of the Liberal Democrats helping the
Conservatives remain in office for a fifth term.
Mr Simon Hughes, an influential figure from the old Liberal rather than the
SDP wing of the party, took up a similar theme.
He rejected any notion of pre-election pacts with Labour but told
journalists in Brighton: 'The one thing in my view that is ruled out is we
and the Tories doing a deal.'
In his speech at a pre-conference rally Mr Ashdown said: 'I do not rule out
co-operation for the common good if we find there are others of like mind.'
But he added: 'We are the enemies of old-style Labourism quite as much as of
new-style doctrinaire Conservatism.' He made clear that he wanted to wait
and see the extent to which Mr Blair reformed the Labour party before
joining his colleagues in publicly rejecting neutrality.
Labour similarly dismissed any talk of pacts. Mr John Prescott, the deputy
leader, said: 'They are not acceptable. We don't need them and the country
wants a distinct alternative.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Bidders asked to talks on coal sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to the government on coal privatisation will hold detailed talks
with bidders for mining assets this week with the aim of helping ministers
to select the preferred tenders next month.
NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, contacted the bidders immediately after
the deadline for tenders last Wednesday to arrange appointments for
'clarification' discussions.
The speed with which the talks have been arranged reflects the tight
timetable to which Rothschild is working. Bidders believe the bank wants to
make recommendations to ministers on preferred bidders in early October.
Ministers want to complete the sales by the end of the year.
Sixteen bidders have now confirmed their interest. Another two companies,
Rackwood and Kier Mining, are qualified to bid but have not said that they
have done so.
The confirmed bidders are: Aberthaw Mining, a team of former BP Coal
managers, for the South Wales region. Caledonian Mining, a privately-owned
company, for South Wales. Celtic Energy, a buy-out team, for South Wales.
Coal Investments, a quoted company, and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers,
for the central England regions. CP Holdings, a private company, for at
least one, unspecified region. English Coal, a management buy-out team, for
the three English regions. Mining (Scotland), a consortium, for Scotland.
Northern Coal, a management buy-out team, for central north. NSM, a quoted
company, for South Wales. RJB Mining, a quoted company, for all five
regions. Ryan Group, a private company, for South Wales. Northumberland
Coal, a joint venture between Ryan and British Alcan Aluminium, for
north-east England. ScotCoal, set up by Ryan and Miller Group, for Scotland.
Taylor Woodrow, the construction company, for at least one unspecified
region. Tebo (Tower Employee Buyout Team) for the Tower pit in South Wales.
Wimpey/Powell Duffryn for South Wales.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Action urged on electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Kennedy, the outgoing party president, called for determined
efforts to establish cross-party agreement on constitutional reform before
the next general election.
He warned that the legislative measures needed to introduce electoral reform
and other changes were almost certain to face formidable parliamentary
obstacles whatever the political complexion of the next government.
Mr Kennedy said: 'The way must be prepared well in advance, within parties
and across them, if constitutional measures are to be addressed.'
The crisis faced by Mr John Major over the Maastricht treaty on European
Union, when a government with an apparent working majority had been reduced
to a 'broken-back' state, underlined the hazards of constitutional bills.
Mr Kennedy suggested that, if the Conservatives lost power, their MPs in the
next parliament would be under pressure to close ranks and oppose any
constitutional reform.
He urged 'reformers of all political allegiances' to start discussions on
the desirability of constitutional change and on how to deliver it.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Labour warned to resist welfare cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning to Labour not to be panicked into advocating 'ungenerous and
unnecessary' cuts in the welfare state is issued today by the Fabian
Society.
Mr Simon Crine, general secretary of the centrist Labour pressure group,
urges the body to resist 'siren voices' saying the social security system
will go broke within 50 years.
His call comes in a pamphlet published a month before the party's Social
Justice Commission is expected to make its final report.
Basing his conclusions partly on scrutiny of the US welfare system, Mr Crine
strongly backs universal benefits as a way of targeting the poor. National
Insurance is a better way of funding 'core social security benefits' than
general taxation.

Several police forces in England could get less money in 1995-96 than they
were expecting if proposals outlined last week in a Home Office consultation
document are adopted.
The proposals would change the formula for allocating government funding
between individual forces by taking into account new factors including
population density.
Among those that would lose out under the new formula are the forces in
Surrey and Gloucestershire and the Metropolitan Police. Gainers would
include forces in Sussex, Northumberland and Hampshire.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Company nurses 'pressed to flout code'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal College of Nursing says there has been a disturbing increase in
complaints by company nurses who are being pressed by personnel managers to
release information on patients, Richard Donkin writes.
Mr Graham Johnson, chairman of the RCN's occupational health nurse section,
said that cases of company managers asking nurses to break their
professional confidentiality code were on the increase.
He said: 'Registered nurses have a professional duty of confidentiality to
their patients, yet some of them are being faced with managers insisting
that they disclose personal details of individuals.'
In one case, featured in today's issue of Personnel Management Plus
magazine, a nurse said she had been told by her human resources director
that she would face disciplinary action unless she handed over information.
Most of the problems were arising in companies with fewer than 500
employees, he said. Nurses were particularly vulnerable to employer pressure
when they worked alone in companies.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Council offers to open books

<TEXT>
Labour-controlled Birmingham city council yesterday invited the District
Auditor to examine its spending procedures in an attempt to clear the air
after newspaper allegations that councillors tried to buy votes in May's
local elections.
Announcing the decision to invite inspection of decisions taken under the
Pounds 7m Meeting Needs Across the City programme, Ms Theresa Stewart,
council leader, said she was confident that the district auditor would find
'no basis for these allegations and nothing improper'.
According to the allegations, published in the Sunday Times, money
supposedly earmarked for improving environmental conditions in deprived
areas was used instead to win over middle-class voters in vulnerable Labour
wards.
In the local elections Labour held its majority against the expectations of
many. One of its two gains was in middle-class Edgbaston, which had never
gone Labour before.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Outlook for jobs buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employment opportunities for the last quarter of this year are the best of
any last quarter for five years, the latest Manpower survey of employment
prospects shows.
The survey - based on responses from 2,100 employers - shows 27 per cent of
employers forecasting job increases and 13 per cent forecasting losses. The
net balance of 14 per cent is double the 7 per cent for the last quarter of
last year, although below the 15 per cent of the third quarter of this year.
No region is forecasting job cuts in the three months to the end of
December. The home counties is the most optimistic region with a positive
net balance of 20 per cent. Only two regions are forecasting a worse
position than last year - Scotland and the north-east.
The private service-sector is the most buoyant with retail, hotel and
catering, and transport and distribution all showing traditional strength in
the run-up to Christmas.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Retailers of fitness products face legal fight with
franchiser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former retail franchisees of Weider Health &amp; Fitness, a subsidiary of the US
fitness and bodybuilding products group, are engaged in a legal battle with
the company.
Six former franchisees, running nine stores in England and Scotland,
terminated their contracts with Weider last year and changed the names of
their shops to Work-Out World. They said Weider had broken a verbal
agreement not to supply goods to other retailers, leaving them unable to
compete.
Weider withdrew an application for a High Court injunction last month to
stop the franchisees from trading, on the grounds of breach of contract. But
the company is now suing the franchisees for 'conspiracy to take away
Weider's business'.
The franchisees have been told the legal action is likely to continue even
though Weider's UK retail business was recently sold to a group run by
former Weider employees.
Three franchisees travelled to the US 10 days ago, where they secured a
promise from Mr Ben Weider, president of the International Federation of
Bodybuilders and younger brother of the group's founder, former bodybuilder
Mr Joe Weider, to investigate the case.
Weider UK refused to comment.
The franchisees say that when they entered their agreements in the late
1980s they had a verbal, though not written, commitment from Weider that it
would not supply its products to any other retailer, except for a limited
range at Argos, the catalogue retailer.
About 2 1/2 years ago, however, they found an increasing number of other
retail outlets being supplied with Weider goods.
As franchisees had to pay Weider 10 per cent royalties on all goods -
including non-Weider goods - sold, they say they could not compete with
other retailers on price. Five franchisees claim to have gone bankrupt as a
result.
One franchisee, who asked not to be named, said: 'When I went into this
business I was a layman. My understanding was that the term franchisee
implied something with trade exclusivity.'
The retailer said his weekly turnover fell from up to Pounds 7,000 a week to
between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 3,500 after Weider goods began being stocked
by other retailers. He added that even before this, after paying Weider
Pounds 50,000 royalties out of his Pounds 500,000 annual turnover, he was
left with a profit of only Pounds 9,000.
The rebel franchisees say that while their contracts with Weider prevented
them from trading in the same area for two years after termination of the
contract, they had received legal advice suggesting this was not
enforceable.
They say they no longer sell Weider goods, and have changed their product
mix to include swimwear and athletic wear. They add that there is no
question of a 'conspiracy' to take business from Weider.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Guinness jealously guards liquid gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More valuable than all the gold in the Bank of England? Casks of whisky lie
maturing in Guinness' warehouse complex in central Scotland. The whisky,
from more than 50 distilleries, will be stored for up to 25 years. Some 2
per cent of it evaporates each year, a loss known as 'the angels' share'.
Said to be the largest warehouse complex in Europe, the 250-acre site has 49
buildings each the size of a football pitch. Guinness, which reports its
interim results on Thursday, tries to keep the precise location secret,
although local people could hardly miss it.
Tradition has it that the stocks are worth more than the gold in the Bank of
England. The claim is impossible to verify but a back-of-the-envelope
calculation suggests the Bank can sleep easy in the knowledge that it, not
Guinness, sits on the biggest hoard of hard assets in the country.
Guinness' 1993 accounts show Pounds 1.47bn worth of maturing spirits stocks,
more than half of which are likely to be in the warehouse complex. But they
are carried at Guinness' manufacturing cost. The 'street value', including
hefty tax could be up to five times higher.
The Bank of England is no more forthcoming. The UK has 18.4m ounces of gold
reserves worth about Pounds 4.8bn. But it refuses to say how much of it lies
in its vaults beneath Threadneedle Street. Moreover, the vaults also contain
an unknown quantity of gold it stores for foreign clients.
The Bank welcomes speculation about Guinness' wealth.
An official said: 'For security reasons, we're glad of anything that takes
attention away from the gold in our vaults.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Banks seek role in China unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British fund management companies will this week press the Chinese
government for permission to participate in introducing unit trusts to China
as a means of reducing the volatility of share prices on local stock
exchanges.
A mission to China by British Invisibles, the cross-sector organisation
which promotes invisible exports, is to seek access to the Chinese equity
market for fund and management companies, including the asset management
arms of UK banks and investment banks.
The 30-strong delegation, which will give seminars on aspects of regulatory
policy and financial practice in the City, will press for a more certain
framework of financial law to give overseas institutions certainty that
their contracts are binding.
The mission is the sixth by British Invisibles since 1980 and comes amid a
rapid growth in interest among financial institutions in gaining access to
China. Foreign banks have previously not been allowed to gather local
currency deposits or sell Chinese shares to local investors.
Mr Robin Box, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, said
the Chinese government had accepted that the development of a unit trust
industry would help to curb stock-market volatility by channelling the flow
of retail investment.
Mr Fox said banks and investment banks with fund management arms would try
to persuade the government to allow them to take part in joint ventures with
local companies.
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said that the
uncertainty of Chinese law limited investment in the country. Banks were
made more reluctant to lend by the difficulty of obtaining legally binding
covenants on loans.
Mission leaders said they did not believe that UK companies were at a
disadvantage because of disagreements between the UK and Chinese governments
over Hong Kong. Mr Fox said that odd cases of discrimination had occurred
where 'a local official did not want to create a rumpus'.
Domestic share prices in China have fluctuated wildly this year. Events such
as the government's statement that it would allow foreigners to invest in
the 'A shares' that are currently restricted to local investors have sent
share prices up by more than 60 per cent.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Romford brewery heads for Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Romford brewery, famous for its John Bull bitter, is to be shipped off to
China tank, tun and keg to help slake thirsts in one of the world's
fastest-growing beer markets.
San Miguel, the Philippines-based brewer, has bought the complete plant and
will re-erect it about 100 miles south of Beijing. It will use it to brew
its own lager, which is one of the best-selling foreign brands in China.
A victim of over-capacity in the UK market, the brewery was closed early
last year ending nearly 200 years of production on the site, which was the
original home of Ind Coope.
Mr Iain Oag of Carlsberg-Tetley, the seller, said: 'It was a sad but
necessary day.' The company pools the UK brewing interests of Carlsberg, the
Danish brewer, and Allied Domecq, the UK spirits group which today changes
its name from Allied-Lyons.
In addition to the Romford equipment, which can brew 1m barrels a year, San
Miguel is buying a bottling line from Carlsberg-Tetley's Northampton
brewery, which was closed a year ago. Carlsberg-Tetley declined to disclose
the sale price.
Much of the equipment dates from the early-1980s but some is newer. Most of
it is small enough to fit in containers but one 30-ft diameter tun, a
stainless steel separation vessel, will be cut in half and reassembled in
China.
China's annual beer consumption is running at only 8.4 litres a head
compared with 100 litres in the UK and 158 litres in Germany. But China is
already the third-largest producer in the world after the US and Germany.
UK consumption is falling by about 2 per cent a year. With production
running at about 34m barrels a year, the industry is operating at
over-capacity of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Clinton will not meet with Adams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US government has assured Mr John Major that President Clinton will not
meet Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, when he visits Washington soon,
Kevin Brown writes.
British officials said Mr Major had not sought guarantees on the treatment
to be given to Mr Adams, who is expected to be given a visa for a second
visit to the US.
US officials are understood to have responded sympathetically to British
warnings, however. Britain has also told the US that it would prefer Mr
Adams to be given a limited visa, which would prevent him travelling to many
centres of Irish republican support.
Washington is said to have accepted British advice that contacts with
constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland should be stepped up.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Sinn Fein says talks may start in a few weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior member of Sinn Fein yesterday raised the prospect of talks before
Christmas with the British government, saying there was 'absolutely no
reason' why the two sides could not be involved in discussions 'within a
matter of weeks'.
The prediction - by Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive
 -came as the hardline Democratic Unionist party indicated that last week's
statement by Mr John Major, the prime minister, could pave the way for it to
rejoin political talks with Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland
minister.
But the DUP made it clear it did not accept that the IRA ceasefire
announcement was not the result of a secret deal with the government.
Earlier this month, Mr Major ordered Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, to
leave Downing Street when he refused to accept the prime minister's
assurances on this matter.
While Sinn Fein indicated that Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, was
set to go to the US for several weeks before the end of the month, Mr
McGuinness said it was 'quite clear' that talks would take place 'between
all the parties'.
'Hopefully this will happen before Christmas,' he added. 'Hopefully Sinn
Fein will be in discussion with the British government. It will be
impossible for the British government not to enter talks with Sinn Fein, and
it is only a matter now of when this will happen.'
But in remarks made less than 48 hours after Mr Major lifted the
government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, Mr McGuinness said he was
disappointed at a suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, that there would be no united Ireland in this generation.
'I was surprised and disappointed to hear what Mr Reynolds had said, and I
think many other people, particularly nationalists, will have been, too,' he
said.
'We should not take pessimistic views at this stage. We have to be
realistic, but we should not be pessimistic.'
Commenting on Mr Major's promise last week to submit the outcome of
political talks to a referendum inside Northern Ireland, Mr McGuinness said
any settlement reached would have to be put to all the people of Ireland.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Milk prices sour the cheesemakers: Companies face paying far
more in a liberalised market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheesemakers are feeling the pinch from the impending deregulation of the
Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales, which is pushing up prices
for almost all buyers.
Mr Tony Craske, managing director of Abergavenny Fine Foods, which he claims
is the largest speciality cheesemaker in Wales, said he faces a 16 per cent
increase in the price of his supplies.
He said: 'We're competing at the supermarkets almost exclusively with
continental cheesemakers and I'm not sure we'll be able to pass on the rise
in price.'
Under liberalisation of the milk market on November 1 the Milk Marketing
Board, the government's statutory purchasing body, will be abolished. In its
place will be Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative which has
already signed up 65 per cent of producers.
Since cheesemakers paid one of the lowest prices for supply under the milk
board's allocation system, they are facing the highest rises in the new free
market because they have to compete with all other milk buyers.
Mr Stephen Curtis, managing director of Horlicks, a mature-cheddar producer
in Ilminster, Somerset, said: 'I'm concerned and very angry with the
government for authorising a system which was almost certain to have this
effect.'
Mr Curtis is paying 18 per cent more for his supplies, which he believes
will be difficult to recover from a competitive marketplace.
Mr John Price, director-general of the Dairy Trade Federation, the dairy
industry group, said all manufacturing companies faced significant price
increases.
The federation has applied for a judicial review of the government's plans
for the milk industry. The hearing to decide whether to grant a judicial
review takes place tomorrow. If it is successful, the federation will push
for a decision to be speeded up so that a conclusion can be reached next
month, before the market is opened up.
Milk supplies in Britain are kept tight because of European Union quotas
which mean farmers can produce only 85 per cent of UK needs. Under the milk
board scheme prices were kept low by a rationing system which gave priority
to dairies selling liquid milk.
But the new free market means buyers can bid up supplies as they rush to
secure enough milk for their own uses. One producer in Lancashire has found
his demands were still scaled back by 60 per cent even though he was paying
3.2p per litre more for his milk under the new Milk Marque auction system.
Mr Paul Plowman, sales and marketing director at the milk board, said it was
too simplistic to compare the board's rationing system with the new auction
which offers specific service contracts.
He said: 'Today companies will be able to buy defined volumes and be able to
plan their businesses more effectively.' But many cheese producers disagree
with him, saying they will face more uncertainty in the new market.
Ironically, the price rises have led to uncertainty over the flotation of
Dairy Crest, the milk board's own processing arm, which was hoped to be sold
before the November launch. The flotation has been put off indefinitely.
One of the benefits of liberalising the market is to allow companies to buy
supplies directly from farmers. But small dairies and cheese producers
cannot afford to hire tankers or employ testing equipment to make collection
of the milk worthwhile.
Mr Craske said: 'For dairies using less than 3,000 gallons a day it's not a
proposition to buy directly from farmers.' Even larger dairy companies are
finding it difficult to secure supplies as Milk Marque has signed up 65 per
cent of milk production.
The price changes are forcing many small dairies and cheesemakers to
reconsider their business plans. Mr Craske has been trying to break into the
North American market with a promotion timed for St David's day next year,
but has been forced to reduce his efforts. 'We're squeezed so much on
margins - we don't have any money left for that sort of thing,' he said.
The Lancashire producer is planning to re-direct his business to the
production of cheeses such as Cheshire, Lancashire and Wensleydale in
smaller quantities, which is a more lucrative market niche than before. He
expects to give up exporting double Gloucester in 20kg blocks.
Many dairies believe imports will rush in to the UK market in November to
compete with higher-priced domestic products. Mild cheddar cheese is
expected to be the most competitive sector.
Mr Craske said: 'I can't believe it was one of the government's objectives
of milk privatisation to allow one company to hijack the nation's milk
supply and hold them to ransom at a hugely inflated price.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is to send a team of technical and financial experts to Saudi Arabia
to advise King Fahd on the Saudi government's fledgling privatisation
programme, Kevin Brown in Jeddah writes.
British officials said the king confirmed the Saudi government's growing
interest in privatisation during several hours of talks last night with Mr
John Major, the prime minister, who is on a week-long trip to Saudi Arabia,
Abu Dhabi and South Africa.
Officials said Britain had agreed to send two telecommunications experts to
advise on the possible sale of the state telephone company. Saudi Arabia has
given no formal indication of other industrial sectors which might be
privatised, but the petrochemical industry and the state-owned airlines are
thought to be prime candidates.
Saudi Arabia is believed to be considering the privatisation of parts of the
public sector to replenish reserves depleted by the cost of the Gulf war.
Declining real prices for oil exports and rising spending, particularly on
arms, have pushed the government's finances into deficit for 12 consecutive
years.
Mr Major also hopes to initiate privatisation discussions in South Africa,
where he arrives tomorrow for the first official visit by a British prime
minister since 1960.
Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for privatisation, will
have extensive talks with government and commercial officials to identify
state assets which could be sold.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Confidence grows of 51% Royal Mail sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading supporters within the cabinet of privatisation of the Post Office
are confident that the government will press ahead with a majority sale of
the Royal Mail.
They believe, however, that formal approval for the sale of a 51 per cent
stake in the Royal Mail might signal an indefinite delay in the government's
equally controversial plan to open up the domestic gas market to
competition.
A final decision on the Post Office sale will be deferred until the
conclusion of the consultation period at the end of this month.
In spite of the opposition of a hard-core of Tory MPs, Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, expect
the cabinet to adopt the preferred option set out in the government's white
paper in July.
Mr Clarke, in particular, believes that a decision in favour of
privatisation is essential to demonstrate that the government has maintained
its radical momentum.
Mr John Major is still wary about the potential political cost of a decision
which the Labour party says will signal a significant run-down in rural post
services and the closure of many village post offices. But Mr Douglas Hurd,
who in spite of his role as foreign secretary has emerged as a pivotal
figure in the cabinet debate over the future of the Post Office, is said by
aides to remain in favour of a 51 per cent sale.
On that basis, Downing Street officials expect Mr Major to give the go-ahead
for the sale. That would allow Mr Heseltine to announce the decision at the
Conservative party conference in mid-October. Ministers believe that strong
conference backing for the plan would put pressure on dissident backbench
MPs to fall into line.
The dissidents have been calling for a minority sale of the Royal Mail, with
the government retaining 51 per cent of the shares. But Mr Bill Cockburn,
the chief executive of the Post Office, has dismissed that idea as
'unworkable'.
On the assumption that a majority sale will go ahead, the Department of
Trade and Industry has already established a separate team to prepare the
legislation. The Treasury is also considering a number of financial
arrangements for a privatised Post Office.
The expectation that the sale will go ahead, however, has cast further
doubts over whether the government will meet its commitment to open up the
domestic gas market by April 1996. Ministers backing the break-up of the
monopoly enjoyed by British Gas acknowledge that it might be impossible to
fit legislation into the forthcoming parliamentary session alongside a Post
Office bill.
British Gas has also alarmed many Conservative MPs by insisting that
competition in the domestic market will lead to higher prices for millions
of consumers. The threatened price rises might be particularly steep in the
rural areas where Post Office privatisation is causing most public concern.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Europe issues storm warning to Serious Fraud Office: The
Saunders judgment threatens the power to demand answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too early to say yet that Mr Ernest Saunders has won a famous victory
at the expense of the UK authorities, but the the European Commission on
Human Rights judgment that the 1986 Guinness trial was unfair will cause
profound concern among UK prosecutors - and particularly those at the
Serious Fraud Office.
It is virtually certain that the case, which centres on provisions under UK
law allowing the removal of the right to silence, must be taken to the
European Court of Human Rights for a final decision.
This could take more than a year and the UK authorities may yet have their
position upheld. In the meantime, prosecutors will be looking anxiously at
the precise terms of the commission's ruling, which is expected to be
published later this week.
It is already clear, however, that the most obvious threat posed by the
ruling is to the power under Section 2 of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act,
which enables it to compel suspects to answer questions.
The future of the SFO is already under review. A successful challenge to
this power, which is unique to prosecutors, would further undermine its
credibility.
The issues may not stop there. If the UK authorities lose before the
European Court then the direction of the government's wider policy on crime
could be in question. The provision passed in the last criminal justice act,
limiting the right to silence for anyone questioned by police, could then
also come into conflict with European law.
The government's overall policy of shifting the balance of advantage in
favour of the state could then face being halted by the judges at
Strasbourg.
The case brought by Mr Saunders concerned the use of evidence he gave under
compulsion to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors carrying out their
investigation into the 1986 Distillers takeover.
This evidence was later used against him at his trial. Mr Saunders not only
claimed that presenting this evidence to the jury was unfair in itself but
that the whole criminal process which followed the DTI investigation was an
abuse of human rights because of the initial removal of his right to
silence.
The commission's judgment upheld his first complaint in full. To have used
the evidence from the DTI inquiry rendered the trial unfair and was a breach
of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, it said. It stopped
short of agreeing with Mr Saunders' wider claims, however.
In the case of Mr Saunders and the three men convicted with him - Mr Gerald
Ronson, Mr Tony Parnes and Mr Jack Lyons - the consequences of this judgment
are specific. The UK authorities have the option of accepting the judgment
and settling the case with Mr Saunders, possibly asking for his conviction
to be quashed and compensation offered.
In the view of most lawyers this is inconceivable. The Serious Fraud Office
would hardly be prepared to admit that the Guinness trial - the highlight of
its mixed history - was profoundly misconceived. The issue, most believe,
will have to go to Europe.
The investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime has moved on since
the Guinness trial. The judgment will not affect the ability of the DTI to
continue to mount inquiries and compel witnesses to answer questions, since
these are not criminal proceedings.
But the SFO has taken over some of the de facto role of DTI inquiries. Cases
where DTI evidence is used in court are now rare.
It is therefore the SFO which has most cause for concern. Its Section 2
powers enable it to compel suspects to answer questions although this
evidence may only be used in court if the account a defendant gives in court
differs from what he told investigators.
This safeguard does not alter the fact that, since its introduction in 1988,
Section 2 has had a powerful effect on the prosecution of financial crime.
Its legality has also been successfully defended before the House of Lords.
Lords rulings will be of little help if the European Court eventually finds
in Mr Saunder's favour, however.
As Mr David Kirk of solicitors Simons Muirhead Burton said, the government
would not be able to respond with legislation. 'The commission's judgment
will be extremely far-reaching,' he said. 'If this is upheld by the European
Court, then there would be absolutely nothing the UK government could do
about it.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Many self-employed 'among poor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth in self-employment in the 1980s has increased the proportion of
self-employed who are women, young people or formerly unemployed, says a
report published today.
The Institute of Manpower Studies says that much of the growth has been in
parts of the service sector where earnings and business survival prospects
are low.
This means that a self-employed person is more than three times as likely to
be in the poorest tenth of the workforce than an employee, the institute
says.
Many of the self-employed end up with low incomes and savings in retirement,
having failed to build up pension entitlement outside the state scheme.
This includes people who have spent only short periods in sectors such as
distribution, hotels and catering.
The report says that a larger proportion of the working population
experiences self-employment than in other European countries.
Self-employment nearly doubled in the 1980s, with one in eight working
people self-employed by the end of the decade.
About a fifth of those who became self-employed during this period were
previously unemployed, a much higher proportion than in the rest of Europe.
Women account for more than a quarter of the self-employed, compared with a
fifth in 1979.
The report, commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social
research organisation, says that the self-employed are over-represented in
both the richest and poorest 10 per cent of incomes.
Those at the top end of the income distribution are more likely to be men
working in sectors such as banking, finance and business services.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Nadir aide may see SFO today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A close associate of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former head of Polly Peck
International, is expected in London today to meet officials of the Serious
Fraud Office and police.
Mrs Elizabeth Forsyth worked in London at South Audley Management, a company
with links to the Nadir family, before going to northern Cyprus three years
ago. Her return has been timed to coincide with the fourth anniversary of
the police raid on the company's offices, which precipitated the Polly Peck
collapse.
A spokeswoman for the SFO said yesterday: 'We would like to talk to her.'
There is, however, no warrant for the arrest of Mrs Forsyth and it appears
unlikely that any attempt would be made to detain her when she lands.
The Jasmine Court Hotel in Kyrenia in northern Cyprus, where Mrs Forsyth had
been staying and which is owned by Mr Nadir, said yesterday that she had
left to take a flight to Britain and that she would not be returning for
three weeks.
The SFO denied that the way it dealt with Mrs Forsyth would have
implications for its treatment of Mr Nadir, should he return from his
self-imposed exile. Sources close to Mrs Forsyth had suggested that a
failure to charge her would in effect mean that the SFO had no case against
Mr Nadir.
The SFO said: 'Asil Nadir has skipped bail and is a fugitive from justice.
There is a case ready to proceed against him and we are ready to try him
when he returns.'
Mr Nadir fled to Cyprus in May 1993 while facing 13 charges of theft and
false accounting involving Pounds 34m.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Societies watchdog softens on new code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, has
softened its guidance on how the Cadbury code of corporate governance should
apply to societies.
The new guidance, which was sent to society chief executives on Friday,
comes before government suggestions on ways in which society boards should
be more accountable to their millions of members.
These are expected to be published next week as a consultation paper which
makes up the second stage of the Treasury's review of building society
legislation.
The proposals will include reserving a small minority of board places for
non-executive directors elected by society members without a contest
involving candidates nominated by the board.
Provisional guidelines on corporate governance which were published last
year in the form of a draft prudential note were severely criticised by many
societies, which said they went beyond the Cadbury committee
recommendations.
Prudential notes have a particular status in the regulation of building
societies. Any society that does not comply with such a note normally has to
explain itself to the commission and might also find its credit rating
affected.
The final guidance still runs to almost 20 pages, but the commission now
says that only the three pages of the code of best practice will count in
terms of the requirement to offer an explanation to the regulator of any
failure to comply.
There are also some concessions in the substance - such as removal of the
requirement that boards include at least one member with relevant
professional expertise to direct a society's non-core activities.

Those at the bottom end of the income distribution are more likely to be
women in services such as hairdressing and cleaning, and in manufacturing
trades such as the clothing industry.
The report concludes that the expansion of self-employment has contributed
to the growing inequality of earned incomes in the UK.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Sinn Fein says talks may start in a few weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior member of Sinn Fein yesterday raised the prospect of talks before
Christmas with the British government, saying there was 'absolutely no
reason' why the two sides could not be involved in discussions 'within a
matter of weeks'.
The prediction - by Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive
 -came as the hardline Democratic Unionist party indicated that last week's
statement by Mr John Major, the prime minister, could pave the way for it to
rejoin political talks with Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland
minister.
But the DUP made it clear that it did not accept that last month's IRA
ceasefire announcement was not the result of a secret deal with the
government.
Earlier this month, Mr Major ordered Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, to
leave Downing Street when he refused to accept the prime minister's
assurances on this matter.
While Sinn Fein indicated that Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, was
set to go to the United States for several weeks before the end of the
month, Mr McGuinness said it was 'quite clear' that talks would take place
'between all the parties'.
'Hopefully this will happen before Christmas,' he added. 'Hopefully Sinn
Fein will be in discussion with the British government. It will be
impossible for the British government not to enter talks with Sinn Fein, and
it is only a matter now of when this will happen.'
But in remarks made less than 48 hours after Mr Major lifted the
government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, Mr McGuinness said he was
disappointed at a suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, that there would be no united Ireland in this generation.
'I was surprised and disappointed to hear what Mr Reynolds had said, and I
think many other people, particularly nationalists, will have been, too.'
He added: 'We should not take pessimistic views at this stage. We have to be
realistic, but we should not be pessimistic.'
Commenting on Mr Major's promise last week to submit the outcome of
political talks to a referendum inside Northern Ireland, Mr McGuinness said
any settlement reached would have to be put to all the people of Ireland.
'It is quite clear that Irish nationalist opinion is agreed that there can
be no internal settlement, that there can be no partitionist arrangement and
there can be no veto for anyone.'
Mr Adams is widely expected to be granted a visa enabling him to go ahead
with plans to visit at least 10 US cities in spite of the fact that
republican leaders have still not satisfied the British government that the
IRA's ceasefire is permanent.
Downing Street said yesterday that it was 'still waiting to hear' that the
ceasefire was permanent.
It added that it was up to the US to decide on the granting of a visa but:
'We have always said the Americans will no doubt want to hear from Mr Adams
about permanence.'

Rudeness and discourtesy towards job applicants is widespread, the
Industrial Society says in a report published today, Richard Donkin writes.
Ms Julie Amber, the society's recruitment specialist, said she had found a
surprising number of personnel managers who treated job applicants with
complete disregard and rudeness.
She found that many never replied to applicants who failed to be
shortlisted, that treating people discourteously at interview was
commonplace and that candidates were often not informed quickly enough about
interview results.
She said: 'Organisations will spend thousands of pounds on public relations
and yet many of them fail to understand that people who seek jobs with them
will tell their family and friends if they have been poorly treated.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Extension urged for Tessa status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Different forms of savings - whether in equities or deposits - should
receive similar tax treatment, perhaps through the development of a
'personal investment plan', the Building Societies Association argues today.
In a paper to the Treasury as part of the government's review of savings,
the association calls for the tax-free status of Tessas - tax-exempt special
savings accounts - to be extended beyond the five-year period originally
intended when they were introduced in the 1990 Budget.
It warns that failure to take such action could create de-stabilising flows
of personal savings out of building society and bank accounts in January
1996 when the first Tessas mature, as investors seek more tax-efficient
places for their money.
The Treasury review comes against a background of intense competition for
retail savings. Mr Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, said that the tax
system should be consistent and 'should not mask the differences between
deposits and equity-based products'.
The paper highlights the progressive relaxation of the rules for tax-exempt
Personal Equity Plans since they were introduced in 1986, particularly in
the increasing freedom to use unit trusts, and contrasts this with the
position for Tessas.
An individual can invest up to Pounds 9,000 a year in Peps, by putting
Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep.
The most that can be held in a Tessa is Pounds 9,000 over five years.
To make the tax system fairer in this area, the BSA suggests a personal
investment plan in which an individual would be entitled to free capital
gain and income on a sum of up to, say, Pounds 6,000 a year, whatever the
investment.
The Association of British Insurers has also used the savings review to
attack the favourable tax treatment of Peps.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Mandela to hold Zulu talks: A rift between the King and
Chief Buthelezi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela today holds talks with two of South Africa's most
influential Zulu leaders in a bid to defuse growing tensions in the tribal
region.
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is at odds with Inkatha Freedom Party leader
and Home Affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is also the King's
traditional prime minister, over an invitation the monarch issued to
President Mandela to attend next Saturday's Shaka Day ceremony in Ulundi,
the Zulu capital.
Chief Buthelezi has objected to President Mandela's presence at the
celebrations, held annually to commemorate the great nineteenth century Zulu
monarch, on the grounds that proper protocol was not followed when the
formal invitation was made directly to the president instead of being routed
through him as the King's chief minister.
The invitation is seen as part of a strategy adopted by the King to reduce
his dependence on Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party by building up
independent links with the African National Congress and thereby setting
himself up as an apolitical tribal monarch.
Even if compromise is reached on the Shaka Day issue, the controversy is
still damaging to the minister as it tarnishes his image as the King's main
political ally.
In the run up to the April elections, Chief Buthelezi, who is a member of
the royal family and uncle to the king, portrayed himself as the main
defender of the Zulu monarchy in order to boost his Inkatha Freedom Party's
stature among conservative Zulus.
Since then, however, King Goodwill appears to have grown dissatisfied with
his role as a virtual puppet of his uncle and there has been speculation
that he may dismiss Chief Buthelezi from his role as prime minister to the
King and replace him with another royal family member more sympathetic to
the ANC.
In other signs of tension, the King recently replaced his KwaZulu police
bodyguard, appointed by Chief Buthelezi, with national police officials and
at the weekend the Chief failed to turn up to the annual reed dance festival
in Nongoma, near Ulundi, at which he traditionally accompanies the King.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Cuba acts to end chronic food shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Cuba, moving to resolve chronic food shortages which have caused discontent
among its population, will soon introduce markets where state farms and
individual farmers will be able to sell excess produce after fulfilling
established government production quotas.
The weekend announcement of the change in policy was made by Cuban defence
minister General Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro and the
number two in the ruling Cuban communist party hierarchy.
The announcement signalled another step in Cuba's cautious moves to
introduce limited market reforms to its centrally run state economy.
The changes are expected to follow the lines of similar farm reforms already
introduced by China and Vietnam. Gen Castro said solving the food crisis was
a priority for the government. While the agricultural markets would have
regulations and taxes, 'supply and demand should basically operate', said
Gen Castro, saying the government would not involve itself in setting
prices. Prices would in any case be much lower than those existing on the
black market, he said.
The production of food, especially staples like meat, rice, beans, fruit and
vegetables, has been a particular black spot in the Cuban economy since the
collapse after 1990 of trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc.
Starved of inputs like fertilisers, herbicides and tractor spares, farm
production, including strategic sugar exports, has fallen sharply, a
situation made worse by adverse weather.
Other factors were inefficiency, wastage of resources and lack of price
incentives for farmers obliged to sell exclusively to the state, foreign
diplomats said.
Popular pressure had grown for the liberalisation of food production, but
the topic was surrounded by agonised ideological debate at the highest
levels of the party.
In the first half of the 1980s, Cuba introduced a similar experiment with
so-called 'peasants' markets' where farmers could sell vegetables, fruit,
pork and chicken.
But these were shut down after President Castro complained they led to the
excessive enrichment of some individuals, especially middlemen who bought
and re-sold produce. Raul Castro's announcement was the first public
acknowledgement that the farm reforms were imminent, but senior officials
said more than 70 markets were already operating experimentally around the
island, excluding Havana city.
One such 'pilot' market was operating at San Nicolas de Bari in Havana
province, where farmers at the weekend directly sold rice, avocado, bananas
and yucca (manioc root) to the public.
Since the 1960s, small private farmers have made commitments to sell
previously agreed upon quantities of produce each year to the government.

FT  19 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Politicians ready for next stage
of 'ice hockey' war - Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Parizeau often compares his Parti Quebecois' struggle for
independence from Canada to the three periods of an ice hockey game.
The first period ended with last October's national elections, when
separatists gained a powerful voice in the federal House of Commons by
becoming the official opposition with 54 MPs. The second period was last
Monday's provincial election in Quebec, in which the PQ hoped to gain a
strong mandate to lay the groundwork for its planned breakaway.
If Mr Parizeau's dreams come true, the final period has now begun, and will
culminate in a big Yes vote in an independence referendum some time before
the end of 1995.
With the start of the hockey season just a few weeks away, it wasn't
surprising that many Quebec newspapers took up Mr Parizeau's metaphor to
comment on the outcome of last Monday's poll. The PQ won 77 of the 125 seats
in the National Assembly, but gained only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote,
just a fraction more than the defeated Liberals.
The Quebec media, by and large, has tended to sympathise with the
nationalist cause. But several of the province's most influential
commentators see the hockey game developing somewhat differently from Mr
Parizeau's scenario. 'The third period will be long, rough and chaotic,'
wrote Mr Gilles Lesage, in Le Devoir, Quebec's highbrow, French-language
paper.
A cartoon in another paper showed Mr Parizeau and Liberal leader Daniel
Johnson in hockey gear, facing off for the third period. Neither of the two
men carried a hockey stick.
Referring to the 1980 referendum on a loose form of
'sovereignty-association' which was held when the PQ was last in office, Mr
Lesage noted that 'there's the risk of Quebec being broken in two as it was
15 years ago, as it turns towards a nightmare in which no one wins.'
The unexpectedly low proportion of Quebeckers who voted for the PQ is widely
interpreted, at least for the time being, as evidence that the separatists
face an uphill struggle in the referendum campaign.
Lysiane Gagnon, a columnist for La Presse in Montreal, noted that even fewer
people would have voted in favour of independence last week than supported
the PQ. She concluded that 'the PQ must convert more than 10 per cent of the
electorate in less than 15 months: soft federalists, lukewarm nationalists,
third-party supporters ..'
Under the headline 'Parizeau cornered', Le Soleil, Quebec City's main daily,
advised Mr Parizeau to concentrate on such bread-and-butter issues as
control of government spending, job creation, health care and education.
Michel Auger, political columnist for the tabloid Journal de Montreal -
which devoted a numbing 20 pages to its day-after coverage of the election -
agreed that the Liberals have the upper hand as the third period gets under
way.
But Auger cautioned that the federalist forces should not rejoice too soon.
'On the highway to sovereignty, there will be numerous opportunities for
flat tyres, and one has often seen broken-down buses which have found a way
to arrive at their destination.'
The separatists will be counting on English-speaking Canadians, especially
in faraway western provinces, to prove that the rest of the country would
prefer Quebec to leave. However, editorial writers in western Canadian
cities were remarkably restrained in their early reaction to the election.
'All Canadians, within and outside Quebec, should take this opportunity to
quietly reaffirm the successes - the cultural richness, the economic
well-being, the social harmony and the political security - which have come
with Confederation,' said the Calgary Herald. 'For those benefits, Quebec's
ambivalence and its need to test its national identity are a small price to
pay.'
The Globe and Mail, which calls itself Canada's national newspaper, struck a
hopeful note about the future. An editorial, titled 'The Genius of Canada',
suggested that 'Canada has far more strength and commands far more loyalty
among its many communities than the chattering classes generally
understand.'
But in case anyone is naive enough to assume that the coming referendum will
mark the end of the interminable wrangle over Quebec's place in Canada, a
cartoon in New Brunswick's Moncton Times-Transcript shows a man in the year
2094, fast asleep on his sofa. A voice from the TV set in front of him
intones: 'And in today's news. . . Canada has again failed to separate from
Quebec.'

FT  19 SEP 94 / Investors relieved at Dollars 5bn Exxon award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exxon's share price is expected to rise when trading begins today following
a federal jury's award of Dollars 5bn in punitive damages against the oil
company for the 1989 oil spill from its tanker Exxon Valdez.
Financial analysts expected the news to cheer investors, who have been
concerned that damages for the Exxon Valdez spill, which devastated Alaska's
Prince William Sound, could run as high as Dollars 15bn.
The damages award is one of the last phases in a drawn-out legal battle over
Exxon's liability for the Exxon Valdez wreck, which destroyed fish stocks
and wildlife with an oil slick of more than 250,000 barrels.
When the jury verdict was announced late on Friday in a federal court in
Anchorage, Exxon shares rose by Dollars 1.50 to a New York close of Dollars
60.25, and further gains were recorded in trading after hours.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they were 'ecstatic' about the award.
The 80 law firms involved are expected to reap more than 20 per cent of the
money.
Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman, denounced the award as 'excessive by any
legal or practical measure.'
'We will use every legal means available to overturn this unjust verdict,
which is not a final judgment,' Mr Raymond said.
'It will be reviewed and we trust it will be modified by the trial court or
by appellate courts.'
Legal experts said Exxon could either seek to have the award reduced by the
courts, or use it as a ceiling for a negotiated settlement with the
thousands of fishermen, native Alaskans and landowners who brought the
claim.
Exxon has spent Dollars 2.1bn on cleaning up the spill and paid Dollars
1.3bn to settle a range of civil and criminal charges brought by federal and
local governments, residents and businesses.
In this suit, the jury last month awarded Dollars 287m in compensation for
the damage caused by the oil slick to fish stocks.
But the jury found that Exxon and Mr Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon
Valdez, had acted recklessly, paving the way for additional punitive
damages. Plaintiffs had claimed up to Dollars 15bn.
Other cases involving crab fishermen and native Alaskan corporations are
still pending, with some of the claims being heard in state court.
The jury also ordered Mr Hazelwood to pay Dollars 5,000 in punitive damages,
even though the plaintiffs had only asked for a symbolic Dollars 1 award
against the tanker captain.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Haiti: Carter, world troubleshooter extraordinaire - The man
who was catapulted into Haiti at the eleventh hour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by his own standards, this was not exactly a normal weekend in the
extremely busy life of former President Jimmy Carter.
Mr Carter himself was in Port-au-Prince at the head of the US delegation
seeking a last minute solution to prevent the fully-fledged invasion of
Haiti.
From the other side of world, the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, came
word that Kim Jong-il was seeking his services to arrange a summit between
himself and President Kim Young-sam of South Korea.
The list of the former president's international mediation over the last
five years is quite extraordinary, beginning in 1989, when he helped broker
the settlement in Ethiopia that led to the independence of Eritrea.
In 1990, he led international monitoring teams covering the elections in
both halves of the island of Hispaniola - the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
It was during the latter that he established a relationship with Lt Gen
Raoul Cedras, then in charge of security for the elections and nine months
later leader of the coup that removed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The
two have remained in touch in recent weeks.
In 1991, he was a principal monitor of the elections in Zambia, in 1992
Guyana and in 1993 Paraguay. Earlier this summer, in Pyongyang, he managed
to persuade Kim Il-sung, the late North Korean dictator, to reopen
negotiations with the US that, for the moment, have defused tensions over
the nuclear question.
These are merely the most visible of his activities, along with his domestic
good works, mostly centred on building affordable public housing for the
poor.
As a result, Mr Carter, buried under the Reagan landslide of 1980 after one
term in office, has re-established himself as one of the most respected
Americans of this generation. His public standing is now far higher than
that of former President Reagan.
He has not always been a predictable envoy. Administration officials were
concerned that, in his North Korean mission, he did not always appear to
represent US government policy accurately. But they could not deny that his
efforts certainly bore fruit.
Like the other leading members of his Haitian delegation - Senator Sam Nunn,
the Democrat from Georgia who heads the armed services committee, and former
General Colin Powell, previous head of the joint chiefs of staff - he has
never publicly endorsed an invasion.
Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said yesterday that the
composition of the team was decided between President Clinton and Mr Carter.
But the combination of Mr Carter's stature, his knowledge of Haiti and his
independent streak called into question the White House's insistence that
his mission to Port-au-Prince is limited only to the matter of arranging the
departure of the junta, as demanded by Mr Clinton.
There was, for example, some surprise in Washington that the Carter
delegation should have talked over the weekend with Mr Emil Jounaissant,
installed by the junta as acting president. This gave rise to speculation
that more wide-ranging discussions were under way.
With his latest mission, Mr Carter has built his stocks of credit even
higher. There is some doubt, however, whether the president will be so
lucky.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Haiti: High hopes from Haiti's downtrodden - The country's
economy is at rock bottom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, being returned to power on the back of
American pressure, will face a devastated economy and high economic
expectations from Haiti's poor majority.
In spite of a reputation as a left-wing liberation theologist, he has
indicated to donors that he intends to introduce an economic reform
programme backed by an International Monetary Fund standby loan.
According to a study by the International Development Association, the
soft-loan arm of the World Bank, the country will need some Dollars 550m
(Pounds 354m) in foreign assistance in the first 12-15 months. Mr Aristide's
officials have calculated some Dollars 770m in aid commitments over the same
period, though it is not clear that the type of commitments exactly meet
assistance needs.
The US has indicated it will provide some funding, while traditional donors
such as Canada and France will also contribute, along with the international
financial institutions led by the IMF. Some funds will come from the
unlocking of Haitian foreign assets which have been frozen as part of the
economic embargo.
Mr Rainer Steckhan, the World Bank official leading aid efforts for Haiti,
said the initial priority is humanitarian assistance and poverty relief. Per
capita income has dropped unremittingly since the early 1980s with a
precipitous decline in living standards in 1992 and 1993, in the face of
international economic embargoes following the 1991 coup. Half the 7m
population is receiving just 75 per cent of nutritional requirements; one in
10 babies die before they are one-year-old.
The next step should be one of reconstruction and rehabilitation: rebuilding
bridges, rural roads, port facilities, and public services such as
waterworks. The World Bank estimates that in Port-au-Prince, a city of
between 700,000 and 1m, only 50,000 people receive water from the water
company.
The next priority is the development of infrastructure, in particular power
generation and water treatment, which envisages an important role for
privatisation and a reduction of the role of the state in the economy. In
rural areas, where initially some credit will be needed for small-holders
for example to buy seed, help will be needed to reforest the country and
prevent further soil erosion.
According to an assessment presented to donors in Paris last month by the
IDA, a series of reforms to modernise the state is necessary. A cut in the
size of the armed forces, perhaps to a fifth of their 7,500 strength, and
creation of a proper police force are seen as the main priorities.
The number of public servants, estimated at around 45,000, should be cut and
the civil service reformed. This should be accompanied by privatisation and
deregulation, including an ending of exchange controls.
Some of these will be difficult and unpopular decisions. Public service has
been traditionally used to offer jobs as a reward for political favours and
the envisaged trade liberalisation will be resisted. The IDA has recommended
that import restrictions be lifted and that tariffs removed, except those on
rice, corn, beans and sorghum, which should be halved.
Economic improvement in the months after a change of power will depend on
the speed at which important institutions can be rebuilt. The integrity of
the commercial banking sector has been undermined by increasing interference
by the monetary authorities seeking finance for the state. The position of
the banking sector worsened last month after virtual raids by the central
bank inspectorate, ostensibly to verify foreign currency holdings.
The country's fiscal accounts, usually in deficit, have depended in better
times on ever increasing customs duties applied to a dwindling volume of
imports.
The money printing presses have been used freely to finance the military
government, leading to inflation and sharp currency depreciation. The
gourde, Haiti's currency, has devalued 60 per cent since the start of this
year. Inflation, 15 per cent in 1991, rose to 48 per cent last year, while
unemployment is estimated at 55 per cent, although about two out of every
three Haitians are not part of the formal economy.
The light manufacturing sector, based on assembly for export - mainly of
sporting goods, textiles and electrical appliances - has been killed by the
trade embargo. A similar fate has overtaken export agriculture with coffee
the main export. According to the IDA, Haiti saw its exports decline from
Dollars 163m in 1991 to Dollars 72m in 1993, while imports fell from Dollars
300m to Dollars 173m in the period.
Successive administrations have defaulted on repayments on the foreign debt
of Dollars 820m, and the country is in arrears to the international
financial institutions by about Dollars 80m. These arrears will have to be
cleared - probably by donors - before the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican
Development Bank can resume lending. The country will also need debt
write-offs similar to that in July 1991 when France forgave Dollars 55m.
Any post-Cedras government is likely to find itself under pressure to
deliver quickly. Mr Aristide's supporters, mainly from Haiti's poor
majority, had expected an almost immediate improvement in living standards
when he took office in 1991. His return would refuel expectations.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Companies in shadow of gun: Squeezed by new laws curbing
racketeering, Japanese gangsters may be stepping up violence against
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The murder last week of a senior executive of one of Japan's largest
companies has brought into alarmingly sharp relief the activities of the
country's organised crime syndicates. Police suspect that the killing may be
the latest episode in what they believe to be an escalation of the war
between the racketeers and Japanese corporations.
The body of Mr Kazufumi Hatanaka was discovered outside his apartment in
Nagoya, Japan's fourth largest city, 120 miles west of Tokyo. He had been
shot once through the head. Mr Hatanaka was the director of Sumitomo Bank's
Nagoya branch.
Police have traced no motive and identified no suspects, but the
circumstances of the killing and the use of firearms, which are severely
restricted in Japan, suggest the involvement of organised crime.
Immediate speculation, that police did little to dispel, focused on the
relationship between Sumitomo Bank and some of its less salubrious
customers. In the 'bubble' years of the 1980s Sumitomo, like most other
Japanese commercial banks, advanced vast sums in property-related loans as
land prices soared. When the property market collapsed in the early 1990s,
the bank was left with a mountain of bad debts, which reached a peak of more
than Y1,100bn (Pounds 7.2bn) a year ago. At the large Nagoya branch, Mr
Hatanaka was closely involved in the collection of bad loans, and police
suspect it may have been this that cost him his life.
The murder comes 18 months after the bank and related companies in the
Sumitomo group, one of Japan's largest business conglomerates, were the
victims of a remarkably concentrated series of attacks. Between February and
May 1993 assaults on the companies ranged in seriousness from the practical
joke - glue in keyholes - to the violent crime  - shootings and
firebombings.
But police indicate that they have found no connection between these
incidents and the murder of Mr Hatanaka. There are important difference
between last year's attacks and Wednesday's killing. The attackers last year
stopped short of inflicting injuries on Sumitomo employees, and there had
been no repeat of the incidents since May 1993.
Police believe the Nagoya shooting fits a more recent and more alarming
pattern of violent crime by organised gangs. In a little over a year, three
senior executives of Japanese companies have been murdered. Mr Hatanaka's
death was preceded in February by the murder of a manager of Fuji Photo
Film, stabbed to death by samurai-sword-wielding assailants in front of his
home in Tokyo, and in August 1993 by the shooting of a vice-president of
Hanwa Bank. The common element in all three murders could be that the
victims were all trying to resist demands from crime syndicates.
In the last two years, police believe, criminal groups have been hit hard by
the combined effects of tougher legislation and economic recession. For many
syndicates the principal source of revenue is extortion. Racketeers, known
as sokaiya, extort money from companies in return for agreeing not to
disrupt annual shareholders' meetings with embarrassing questions about the
behaviour of company executives. Such extortion inhabited a grey area of
Japanese criminal law.
But in 1992 legislation was passed that began to curb the activities of the
gangs. The main effect was to define much more clearly the criminal activity
of racketeering. As a result companies have grown less willing to acquiesce
to the demands of the groups.
At the same time, economic conditions have militated against the gangsters.
Japan's longest recession since the second world war has left many companies
simply unable to meet their demands, irrespective of their legality.
Intimidation by the sokaiya has, in the past, rarely extended to the
extremes of physical violence seen in the last year. If organised criminal
gangs are ratcheting up the level of their intimidation of company
executives to the ultimate penalty, the authorities' deepest fear is that
few companies will prove determined or brave enough to resist.

<TEXT>
India at the weekend laid down tough terms for the entry of private
companies, including foreign groups, into the country's telecommunications
market.
The government, which said in May it was ending the state's monopoly of
basic telephone services, had raised hopes that it would set attractive
conditions for entrepreneurs because it is seeking substantial investments
of up to Rs230bn (Pounds 4.7bn).
But opposition from officials and workers in the telecommunications
department has persuaded the government to impose important restrictions. In
addition, crucial issues such as revenue-sharing arrangements between the
private operators and the state service have yet to be settled.
Under the new policy, announced by Mr Sukh Ram, the telecommunications
minister, private companies will be limited to providing local networks.
They will be barred from operating the much more lucrative long-distance and
international services.
Foreign companies, which are expected to contribute most of the technology
and expertise to the new carriers, will be limited to a 49 per cent stake in
an Indian carrier.
Companies will be free to bid for licences in 18 regions, which roughly
correspond with states. Only one private carrier will be permitted to
operate in each region, and will compete with the state-owned service.
Licence-holders will have to offer lines in rural areas as well as more
lucrative towns and cities.
The licences will run for 15 years and there will be no restriction on the
number awarded to any one company. Mr Sukh Ram said bids would be invited in
the next two or three months and he hoped the first private carrier would
start operating in 1995.
Mr Sukh Ram also announced the establishment of a regulatory body, called
the Telecom Regulatory of India, which will oversee the private operators.
The new guidelines evoked a mixed response from the industry. While there
was relief that the announcement brought forward the day when private
operations might start, there was disappointment about the conditions of
entry and the fact that revenue-sharing and tariff arrangements have yet to
be decided.
Mr Amit Sharma, head of the Indian office of US electronics group Motorola,
said: 'The policy of opening up basic services on a limited scale is clearly
disappointing. In most countries when basic services are opened up, the
long-distance and international lines are the first to be opened, as these
are seen to cross-subsidise local services.'
India is partly liberalising its pharmaceutical industry, taking measures to
let foreign companies take majority stakes in their Indian ventures. Foreign
groups will be able to own up to 51 per cent of an Indian pharmaceuticals
company, according to Mr Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav, the minister for chemicals
and pharmaceuticals.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Big turnout for Hong Kong elections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Chan, with his panda mascot, canvasses support in his campaign for
elections in Hong Kong yesterday. Nearly 700,000 people turned out to vote
in the colony's first fully democratic elections under British rule,
undeterred by threats from Beijing to overturn the result of the poll when
it resumes sovereignty in 1997. In the poll 756 candidates contested 346
seats which comprise 18 district boards. An exit poll conducted by TVB
television station found that 70 per cent of those who voted said they were
not concerned by China's stated intention to overturn the election.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Beijing to step up Gatt drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China this week steps up its efforts to secure crucial US backing for its
membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade during talks to be
held in Geneva.
Mr Long Yongtu, China's Gatt negotiator, said Beijing's latest package
presented in talks last month with the Americans contained significant
concessions, especially in the proposed phasing out of non-tariff barriers
on agricultural products.
Officials in Beijing are describing as 'crunch time' the latest round of
discussions on China's application to re-enter Gatt and become a founder
member of its successor body, the World Trade Organisation.
The US, which has been entrusted with responsibility for negotiating terms
for China's Gatt entry, has said Beijing still has some distance to go
before it fulfils requirements.
US official have been focusing on the 'national treatment' issues under
which Gatt contracting parties are expected to accord one another similar
market access privileges.
American negotiators have been complaining about China's reluctance to agree
to a timetable for reciprocal access to such areas as services, including
banking and insurance. The US wants to avoid repeating what is known as the
'Japanese mistake' under which the US contends that Tokyo was allowed into
the world trading body on 'soft terms' enabling it to maintain its closed
trading system.
China last month presented a 900-page proposal for discussions with US
officials. Negotiations are expected to last through October. Western
officials doubt negotiations can be completed in time for Beijing to be a
founder member of the WTO, if that body comes into effect as planned at the
beginning of 1995.
But China, which was an inaugural member of Gatt in 1949 before withdrawing
in 1950 after the communists came to power, is insisting that its growing
weight as a trade power makes it imperative that it be admitted to the world
trading body. Mr Long, a vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation, said China's new Gatt package included undertakings
to phase out the remaining 784 items covered by non-tariff controls. He said
China was not seeking special privileges in the new world trading system.
Beijing has proposed that as a developing country it be allowed a transition
phase to tailor its economy to Gatt requirements. The US has shown little
enthusiasm for this proposal, but is expected to agree to such an
arrangement in the end.

FT  19 SEP 94 / China seeks foreign funds for petrochemicals boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans investment of Yn100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) in its outdated
petrochemical sector by the year 2000, with a big chunk of the funds coming
from abroad, including equity participation.
Mr Li Yizhong, vice president of the China Petrochemical Corporation,
promised an aggressive approach to capital raising on world markets to
overcome one of the acknowledged weak spots of the Chinese economy.
'It's apparent that we should resort to international capital markets other
than just rely on domestic funds to achieve our goals. . . utilising foreign
capital, especially direct investment, would be our long-term strategy,' Mr
Li told the Business Weekly newspaper.
He said that before 2000 China would give priority to revamping and
expanding existing facilities, especially those in coastal regions
accessible to crude oil imports.
Sino-foreign joint venture refineries would be allowed to sell part of their
product in the domestic market, Mr Li said.
China is negotiating investment deals with several big oil producers and
refiners, including Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state oil company, for the
establishment of joint venture refineries.
China's need for additional refining capacity is underscored by the fact
that with 20 per cent of the world's population, it has just 3.7 per cent of
world capacity for crude oil processing. It last year became a net importer
of crude oil, and demand for refined products is continuing to grow rapidly,
in line with explosive economic growth.
In 1993, China exported 3.38m tonnes of product, but imported 12.8m tonnes.
Crude imports reached 15.65m tonnes. Total output of crude last year was
143.7m tonnes from both onshore and offshore fields, but China is struggling
to maintain these production levels.
Beijing earlier this year clamped down on crude oil imports in an effort to
bring order to a chaotic local market, but Mr Li predicted that imports
would rebound next year. Buoyant demand would last for a long time to come,
he said.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Price curb campaign launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China is redoubling its efforts to contain inflation with a new campaign to
curb rises in the prices of grain, cotton and chemical fertiliser.
Beijing also promised at the weekend a drive to recoup unpaid taxes, to
overcome an expected revenue shortfall this year. Tax receipts have fallen
well short of expectations. The government also said it was strengthening
its prices surveillance to 'stop unauthorised rises in grain, edible oil,
meat, eggs and vegetables'.
The latest anti-inflation drive reflects official concern over signs of a
renewed acceleration of prices following some slowing this year. Figures
published last week by the State Statistical Bureau showed that consumer
prices in China's 35 main cities rose 27.1 per cent during the year to
August, compared with 24.2 during the year to July. The surge prompted an
announcement by a worried leadership that fighting inflation would be the
government's main priority for the rest of this year.
In his work report to the annual session of China's parliament this year,
Premier Li Peng said the government would strive to contain price rises
nationally to 9 per cent; but that figure has since been revised to 15 per
cent. This compares with the national retail price index of 13 per cent last
year.
Western economists say the government will have its work cut out to bring
inflation below 20 per cent by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, one of China's top tax officials has sounded the alarm about
difficulties collecting taxes under a new tax regime introduced at the
beginning of this year. Mr Xiang Huaichen, deputy director of the State
Administration of Taxation, said tax inspectors were being urged to step up
efforts to retrieve unpaid taxes. According to Mr Xiang, taxes collected
from industrial and commercial sectors, which account for the bulk of taxes,
were just 64 per cent of the total due in the first eight months of the
year. 'We face a hard task getting the remaining 36 per cent in the next
four months,' he told the official Xinhua newsagency.
China budgeted for a deficit of Yn66.9bn (Pounds 5bn) this year, but total
obligations, including debt service, will exceed Yn100bn. Unexpectedly low
tax receipts are putting pressure on the budget.
A senior Chinese economist has warned of the risks to agricultural
production of the loss of arable land. Mr Li Jiange, deputy director of the
State Securities Regulatory Commission, blamed 'inadequate agricultural
production' for pressure on prices. China was losing 270,000 hectares of
arable land each year while adding 14m citizens, he said.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Hurd takes trade plea to Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will today urge Japan not to cut it, or any other nation, out of a
trade deal between Tokyo and the US.
The UK's concern, shared by other European Union member states, will be
voiced by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in meetings with Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime minister, and with the ministers
responsible for trade, finance and foreign affairs.
Mr Hurd's three-day visit, ending tonight, is the latest annual high-level
political consultation between Japan and the UK. It is his first personal
contact with the new three-party coalition government, which took power in
June.
Trade matters, including the role of the future World Trade Organisation,
are at the top of his agenda. But Mr Hurd is also aiming to range widely
over foreign policy issues important to both countries.
He is expected to register gratitude for Japan's discreet diplomatic advice
to China to try to be calm in the bumpy lead-up to the transfer of power in
Hong Kong. Japan's bid for membership of the United Nations security
council, now supported by a previously wary Britain, and North Korea's
nuclear ambitions may also crop up.
On trade, Mr Hurd is expected to remind his hosts of British support for
Japan's opposition to US demands for numerically targeted increases in its
share of Japan's domestic market. Tokyo and Washington are struggling, with
little success, to reach a framework trade and economic accord before the
September 30 deadline after which the US has threatened to start sanctions
proceedings.
At the same time, Mr Hurd will voice UK concern that Japan and the US will
be tempted to strike a purely private deal, a serious worry to exporters of
car components. Overall British exports to Japan rose by 17 per cent to
Pounds 1.4bn in the first half of this year.
There are long-standing bilateral trade disputes, on which Mr Hurd is
expected to remind Japan that Britain is dissatisfied with the small
progress made in recent years. These include tax on imported whisky, still
much higher than Japanese spirits, the continued ban on foreign law firms
hiring Japanese partners, and barriers to competition in insurance and other
financial services.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Singaporeans weary of the high cost of driving: The price of
running a car in the cramped island state has risen again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thinking of buying a new car but shocked by the expense? Take comfort. You
could be living in Singapore.
A Jaguar XJ3.2 costs about SDollars 320,000 (Pounds 139,000) to put on the
road in Singapore. The equivalent model in Britain costs around Pounds
28,000. At the other end of the market, a Proton manufactured in
neighbouring Malaysia costs about SDollars 95,000 to drive in Singapore. In
Britain a Proton can be picked up for under Pounds 7,000.
Import duties and other taxes take their toll but priciest is the fast
accelerating cost of a government Certificate Of Entitlement (COE), the
vital piece of paper that allows you to take your already expensive
machinery on to the road.
Singapore has 2.8m people squeezed on to an island of only 240 square miles.
Determined to avoid the traffic chaos of Bangkok and many other Asian
cities, the government brought in the COE system in 1990 in order to control
the car population. The government releases only a certain number of COEs
each year. A new car cannot be registered without one.
COEs are obtained by dealers and the public through a monthly bidding system
with the government. If 8,000 people are bidding for 4,000 COEs available,
the government fixes the COE cost at the level of the lowest successful bid.
On Friday the government announced the prices for October COEs. In future
Singaporeans will have to dig even deeper into their pockets to experience
the joys of motoring. Over the past month a COE for the bigger, more
luxurious models has gone up by SDollars 10,000 to SDollars 94,000. COEs for
smaller engined cars have gone up by about SDollars 5,000.
Mr Philip Eng, managing director of Cycle &amp; Carriage Industries, the company
which has the franchise for Mercedes and various other makes in Singapore,
says people thought SDollars 1,000 was a lot to pay for a COE four years
ago. 'No one ever expected the price of the certificates to go up so fast,'
says Mr Eng.
'But what is really amazing is that the market is still growing. In the case
of some cars we can't get deliveries fast enough.'
A top of the range Mercedes S class costs about about SDollars 330,000 in
the Singapore showroom. But add on a new COE and the price comes to around
SDollars 420,000. The same car in Germany costs around DM100,000 (Pounds
41,000).
At the lower end of the market a Proton's showroom price will be around the
SDollars 45,000 mark. Add in the cost of a COE and the price will more than
double.
According to Mr Eng, 'The prestige level of owning a car here is much higher
than in Europe or the US. Here, all the extras we fit in our cars, like
stereos or the upholstery, have to be top of the range.'
Mr Eng says that with about 12 per cent of the total car market, Mercedes
has a bigger market share in Singapore than anywhere else in the world.
He says that demand well exceeds supply for C class, the compact Mercedes
range. Sales of the S class vehicles are growing and now running at about
500 a year.
But while incomes of Singaporeans have risen sharply in recent years, owning
a car is an impossible dream for many people. The rapidly rising costs of
cars has become a political issue.
The COE system brings billions of dollars into the exchequer each year.
However, the government is criticised for what is seen as an inequitable
system.
One government critic asks: 'What about the market trader or hawker? They
need cars more than the Towkays (big businessmen) and their Tai Tais (ladies
of leisure).'

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of France's extreme right National Front
party, yesterday became the first French politican to announce his candidacy
for next year's presidential election, John Ridding writes from Paris. Other
potential candidates on the right raised the prospect of a divisive contest
by hinting at their own bids for the spring contest.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the centre-right UDF party and a former
president, appeared to edge closer to a new run for the Elysee, calling for
measures to tackle France's acute problem of unemployment.
Mr Philippe de Villiers, who won a surprising 12 per cent of the vote in
June's European elections on an anti-Maastricht ticket, also indicated he
might stand. The two heavyweight contenders on the right, however, prime
minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, have not yet declared their
intention to run, although they are engaged in a thinly veiled contest for
the candidacy of their gaullist RPR party.
Mr Le Pen, who advocates tough anti-immigration policies and is opposed to a
federal Europe, told a rally he would also make the fight against corruption
a central plank of his campaign.
Mr de Villiers said he was officially breaking from the centre-right
Republican party, from which he has been estranged for several months,
citing corruption cases involving the PR.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Paris austerity budget on way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government will this week unveil an austerity budget for 1995
which banks on stronger economic growth next year to prune the central
government deficit and bring France closer to European criteria for monetary
union.
Most of the planned reduction in the budget deficit - from FFr300bn (Pounds
36bn) this year to FFr275bn next year - is due to come from the automatic
increase in tax revenue that is expected from 3.1 per cent growth in the
French economy next year, and from refusing to let public spending rise more
than next year's expected inflation rate of 1.9 per cent.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said last night that growth next
year would be supported by consumption and an increase in investment of just
below 10 per cent. He said the budget predictions envisaged a reduction in
the number of unemployed of about 150,000. The number of French unemployed
currently stands at about 3.3m.
Senior government officials expect the budget, to be unveiled on Wednesday,
to win plaudits from the international markets. As one said: 'It shows that
we are mastering our spending while still continuing our structural reforms
to encourage employment', with the state shouldering more of the welfare
taxes currently borne by companies.
But another proposed 'structural' reform has stirred an outcry from the
Patronat employers' federation. This would reduce the rebate that companies
get from the central government on the 'professional tax' which they pay to
French local authorities and which is levied on their capital assets and
payrolls. The threshold at which the state would start paying its rebate
would rise from the first 3.5 per cent of the tax to 4 per cent. The change
would save the government, and cost the companies, FFr4bn.
Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, last week called the measure
'counter-productive' because it would discourage both employment and
investment, thanks to the way the tax is calculated. Employers say they are
dismayed to see a conservative prime minister - Mr Edouard Balladur -
reverse the steady trend over the past decade, mostly by Socialist
governments, to reduce the corporate tax burden.
But Balladur aides counter that French companies are now sufficiently flush
with cash and committed to planning for economic recovery to be now deterred
from hiring or investing by the minor tax increase. French companies should
recognise that their 'Balladur balance sheet' is positive, said one aide,
because they gained a cash injection from faster value added tax
reimbursement last year and will be relieved of FFr17bn in family allowance
charges this year and next.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, yesterday claimed that the
increased burden of the 'professional tax' would fall only on large
businesses and would not affect companies with annual sales of less than
FFr50m. The CGPME, the industry association which represents small and
medium-sized businesses, said it was reassured by the minister's statement.
Mr Balladur's budget may spark some dissent within his conservative majority
in parliament, where some deputies would like to see cuts in income tax as
well as welfare charges while others may take up business complaints. But
such concerns are unlikely to drive them into the rival presidential camp of
Mr Jacques Chirac, who has been urging the government to pay more heed to
social concerns - a point Mr Balladur hopes to blunt in his budget by giving
the biggest spending increase to the labour ministry.
This year's squabbles between ministers over whose departmental budgets
should bear the brunt of austerity were described by a Balladur aide as 'a
harder battle' than last year, when spending for public housing and works
was increased to counter recession.
But ministers were said to have been unanimous on the need for overall
restraint on current budget spending, out of recognition of the other two
looming problems of servicing a greatly increased state debt and of plugging
the social security deficit.
Other measures in the budget include tax rises of 4 per cent on leaded, and
6 per cent on unleaded, petrol. The government has felt able to abandon
recent practice of fiscally favouring the unleaded variety, because its
increasing use is mandated by European environmental rules anyway. The
government has also hit on a ruse of gaining more money from tobacco without
upsetting 'the smokers' vote' next year. The tobacco companies are to said
to have made a 'spontaneous' decision to raise their prices by about 7 per
cent, a move that should bring an estimated FFr4bn in extra tax receipts.

Poul Nyrup Rasmussen
The 51-year-old leader of the Social Democrats and incumbent prime minister.
He ousted Svend Auken in a leadership contest to become head of the party in
April 1992 and became PM in January 1993. A political science graduate, he
made a career as an economist with the Confederation of Danish Trade Unions.
While his government coalition seems certain to lose seats, he could well
remain in office.
Hans Engell
The 46-year-old leader of the Conservative party and a former minister of
defence and minister of justice. Trained as a journalist. Opinion polls
indicate majority of non-socialist supporters would prefer him as PM in a
non-socialist government over the Liberal party's Ellemann-Jensen. But his
own party, reckoned to be to the left of the Liberals, is not likely to do
as well in the election as the Liberals.
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen
The 52-year-old leader of the Liberal party and foreign minister from
September 1982 to January 1993. Has a political science degree and made an
early career in journalism. Won strong international reputation as foreign
minister, but his provocative tongue offends many consensus-minded Danes.
His party can expect a good result, but this will probably not be good
enough to get him the top job.

There will be many losers and no winners in the election to the Danish

The opposition Liberal and Conservative parties, hoping to form a coalition
government, will make gains, but not enough to control a majority. The
four-party centre-left coalition government, headed by the Social Democratic
leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, will lose seats, but Mr Rasmussen is
expected to hang on as head of a minority administration.
Such a government, however, would be dependent on the parliamentary support
of the left-wing Socialist People's party, an uncomfortable ally. The SPP
has no inhibitions about government spending, and is not put off by the fear
of speedier inflation, a stance which the financial markets have already
noted.
Mr Rasmussen's campaign has gone sour. For months he has promised that his
government would 'put a downward kink in the unemployment curve'. However,
despite an expansive fiscal policy, which will give the country a GDP growth
rate of 4 per cent or more this year, the July unemployment figures played
into the opposition's hands: they showed an upward kink in the jobless curve
from 12.3 to 12.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted.
Welfare is the election's other central issue. Mr Rasmussen, promising more
and better welfare, has not always scored well on this issue either. In a
campaign devoted almost entirely to photo opportunities, he strode into a
Copenhagen hospital last week, taking the hands of a frail patient and
telling her how much better the hospitals would be if his government was
confirmed in office. A television crew stayed behind when Mr Rasmussen
rushed on and asked her if she believed the prime minister's promises. Her
convinced and articulate negative was the highlight of the main evening TV
news.
Small mishaps, perhaps, but the SDP's opinion poll ratings, excellent at the
start of the campaign, have weakened by the day. Gallup at the weekend gave
the SDP about 33 per cent, compared with 37.4 per cent in the last election.
Nor has the campaign been a great success for Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the
Liberal leader, or Mr Hans Engell, the Conservative leader. Their only
chance of a forming a government requires the parliamentary support of the
right-wing populist Progress party, but wooing the populists worries
moderate voters. They find the Progress party's refugee policy, calling for
closed frontiers, and with racist undertones, particularly distasteful.
Mr Poul Schluter, Conservative prime minister for 10 years from 1982 (and
now a Euro MP), undoubtedly expressed the feeling of many moderate
non-socialist voters when he said last week that he was unhappy at the
prospect of a formal alliance between the Liberals and Conservatives and the
Progress party.
The Liberals and Conservatives are also making heavy weather of their
message that a country where government expenditure has reached 64 per cent
of GDP and which has the highest tax burden of any country in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, about 49 per cent of
GDP, needs to reform the welfare state before the welfare state precipitates
economic collapse. No less than 44 per cent of the adult population is
dependent on transfer incomes such as benefits and pensions from the
government, and the state sector provides 35 per cent of total employment.
There are echoes in this of the campaign for yesterday's election in Sweden
where the incumbent centre-right of government Mr Carl Bildt sought to
persuade voters that drastic cuts in government spending were required to
solve the crisis that has already hit Sweden's public finances.
'It's a difficult message,' said Mr Ellemann-Jensen. 'Almost 50 per cent of
the voters think we are going to take something away from them.'
The Liberals and Conservatives want to concentrate resources on the health
system, education and social services, and to curb cash welfare benefits.
Only one thing looks as if it could upset Mr Rasmussen's chances of a second
term. This is that one or more of the small centre parties in his present
coalition, the Radical Liberals, the Centre Democrats and the Christian
People's party, become so worried by the prospect that the SPP will obtain
leverage on the government that they switch their allegiance and back a
government headed by either Mr Ellemann-Jensen or Mr Engell.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Truck sales show signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The west European truck market, battered by falling sales for the past four
years, is beginning to show signs of moving slowly out of recession.
Sales of new trucks (over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) were virtually
unchanged in the first seven months of the year after continuing to fall by
4.7 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.
According to a study of 14 markets across west Europe by Automotive Industry
Data, the UK-based analysts, new truck registrations in the first seven
months this year fell by only 0.7 per cent to 129,610 from 130,470 a year
ago. European truck sales, a significant indicator of economic activity,
fell by 21 per cent last year to 220,000, the worst year-on-year decline in
the post-war period, according to AID, and have declined by nearly a third
from the peak of 321,000 in 1989.
'The provisional April to July figures indicate that a likely turning point
has been reached. . . with a gradual pick-up in truck demand during the
second quarter,' says the report.
The recovery is being led by the UK, which was one of the first markets to
enter recession in the second half of 1989, and by Scandinavia and France.
Overall sales in the first seven months were higher than a year ago in 10 of
14 European markets.
New truck registrations in the UK rose by 21.7 per cent year-on-year in the
first seven months to 21,300, while sales in France increased by 12.2 per
cent to 20,200.
The French truck market has suffered its worst decline since the second
world war with sales halving from a peak of 52,247 in 1989 to only 28,376
last year, the lowest level for more than 30 years.
In the UK truck sales fell from 69,234 in 1989 to 31,398 in 1992, the lowest
level since the early 1950s.
The most severe recession has been suffered in Spain, however, where the
market has contracted by almost two-thirds during the last four years to
13,569 last year from 36,379 in 1989.
The Spanish market, too, has shown signs of recovery in the second quarter,
however, with sales growing by 2.5 per cent after the first six months to
6,400, reversing a further decline of 12.5 per cent in the first quarter.
Sales were still lower than a year ago in Germany, Italy, Portugal and
Belgium with Italian truck sales plunging by 35.4 per cent in the first six
months to 7,300, while registrations in Germany fell by 11.1 per cent in the
first seven months to 48,000.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Oil companies to sign Azerbaijan extraction deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partners in a British Petroleum-led consortium of western oil companies
expect to sign a Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) extraction deal with the former
Soviet republic of Azerbaijan tomorrow
The contract will represent a breakthrough after four years of hard
negotiations. It is the first big western oil deal signed in the energy-rich
region since Russia asserted its right to a primary role on the Caspian Sea
about a year ago. Delegations from most of the eight western oil companies
involved flew to the Azeri capital of Baku last night.
The two offshore fields, known as Azeri and Chirag, contain an estimated 4bn
barrels of oil; the extraction deal is estimated to be worth an eventual
Dollars 118bn. Azerbaijan is to receive 80 per cent of the proceeds, and the
consortium the remainder, sources said. The contract comes after setbacks in
the consortium's attempt to extract oil from Azerbaijan, including a
seemingly solid agreement which fell through in June last year when
Azerbaijan's government was ousted in a coup.
The deal includes a strong Russian involvement in Azerbaijan; the Caspian
republic grudgingly returned to Moscow's fold during the coup's aftermath.
The Russian firm Lukoil will have a 10 per cent stake in the foreign
consortium and has also been granted a primary role in developing a third,
adjacent oilfield called Guneshli.
'Everybody is very pleased with the contract,' said Mr Steve Remp, chairman
of Ramco Energy, one of the western partners. Two other major contracts have
been signed on the inland sea, both in Kazakhstan, one being Chevron's
agreement to exploit the Tengiz oilfield, the ex-Soviet Union's biggest
single western oil deal.
However, no drilling or new oil flow has begun, largely because of obstacles
thrown up by Moscow, which argues that it deserves a big part in the deals
because Russian engineers found and developed the fields during the Soviet
period. Western analysts, meanwhile, have asserted that Russian government
and military officials are also intent on retaining a strong political
influence in the region by restructuring its energy development and
resulting economic independence.
The current contract is the product of six weeks of final negotiation in
Houston which finished last Thursday. The consortium partners were notified
almost immediately that Mr Heydar Aliyev, the Azerbaijan president, had
approved it subject to parliamentary ratification. Other members of the
consortium include Statoil, Pennzoil, McDermott and Turkish Petroleum.
The two sides did not resolve a dispute over how the oil will be transported
out of the region, and negotiation on a pipeline were to begin almost
immediately after the signing. Moscow has insisted that the consortium use
the existing pipeline route through Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossisk.
But some western analysts have seen this as a Russian attempt to maintain
its economic control over ex-Soviet energy and that a proposed alternate
route ending at the Turkish port of Ceyhan would be more economical, as well
as wiser politically for Azerbaijan.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Yeltsin in talks on Abkhazia refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will today meet the leaders of Georgia and
its breakaway region of Abkhazia as Russian peacekeeping troops are
scheduled to begin resettling Georgian refugees returning to Abkhazia after
being driven out in fighting last year.
The official Russian news agency Itar Tass said that Mr Yeltsin would meet
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian parliament, and Mr
Vladislav Ardzimba, head of Abkhazia, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
The Abkhazians, a minority in the region bearing their name, succeeded in
defeating Georgian troops during a long-drawn out conflict - a defeat which
was followed by an exodus of many thousands of the Georgians who made up the
majority of the region.
Near-riots broke out in Tblisi, the Georgian capital, over the weekend as
the price of bread rose by nearly 300 times and other commodities and
services also rose by huge amounts.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Moscow weighs up coal restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of the Russian coal industry is under urgent consideration
by the Russian government.
At stake is a sector employing nearly 800,000 workers attracting massive
subsidies from an impoverished budget - and a Dollars 500m (Pounds 322.5m)
loan from the World Bank which would be paid if the government committed
itself to the huge redundancy and social programme entailed in making the
industry efficient.
Though no decision has yet been made in principle to adopt a fully-fledged
closure strategy, the state body which oversees the industry, Rosugol,
announced last week the closure of nine loss-making pits. This seems to be a
move showing that it is willing to undertake a efficiency measures at which
it has so far baulked.
Mr Alexander Sergeyev, head of the Independent Union of Mineworkers, said
Rosugol had no right to make the announcement and warned of a 'social
explosion' in the Kuzbass, the main coal-producing regions.
However, an analysis undertaken by the World Bank, to be the subject of
intensive discussions beginning later this week, points to a much more
radical closure programme - which would take out one-third of the industry's
capacity and reduce the workforce by over 300,000. It shows that coal
consumption in Russia has plummetted from 369m tonnes in 1990 to an
estimated 304m tonnes in 1993 and is projected to fall to 217m tonnes by
1997. During 1992, direct employment has remained stable, at 763,000 in 273
pits.
The issue is made more delicate by the fact that the miners were the
critically important group in the ascent to power of Mr Boris Yeltsin as
president of Russia - they made his programme a centrepiece of their demands
during the strike waves of the late-1980s. They have remained better
organised and more militant than workers in any other industry and have so
far forced governments at least to promise compliance with their demands,
even if in fact their wages are often delayed from three to six months.
The World Bank report, a copy of which has been obtained by the FT, was
drawn up with the participation of the government and Rosugol but is not
binding. It describes the Russian coal industry as in a 'catastrophic'
position, and calls for an extremely rapid reduction of employment and
output, to the year 2000, especially in the two large coal basins in the
Kuzbass, in Siberia, and the Pechora basin in the Komi Republic in the
Arctic Circle.
On its most radical projection, it sees a drop of employment to 287,000 in
118 pits by 1997, and on a less radical projection, to 338,000 in 138 pits.
However, it stresses that 'employment reduction . . . cannot start until
there is an adequate and fully-funded safety net in place'.
The Bank report says that coal subsidies account for 1.4 per cent of Russian
GDP, and are 'clearly unsustainable'. Nearly half of the subsidies are paid
to cover losses and for investment - 'encouraging mining companies to sell
coal at prices which are well below the marginal costs of production, which
depresses prices and profits for the low-cost, potentially profitable part
of the coal industry'.
The report recommends that:
Subsidies be reduced from 1.4 per cent to 1 per cent in 1995, 0.6 per cent
in 1996, 0.3 per cent in 1997 to reach zero in 1998;
Rosugol devolve the payment of wages and the setting of prices to the mining
companies;
The social costs now paid by the mining companies towards housing, medical
and other services be transferred to the regional and local governments;
The relatively high wage premiums paid to miners be reduced to make
employment less attractive and that 'special payments' be offered to miners
over the age of 45 to leave the industry.
The report is frank on the social upheaval entailed - saying that, to be
successful, the level of mining employment in the Kuzbass would fall from
around 300,000 now to 70,000-80,000 by the year 2000. It also says miners
have little chance of alternative work.

Spain has conceded defeat in a two-year battle to prevent a British ferry
line operating services between Spain and Nador in Morocco, writes Charles
Batchelor.
The British company, Cenargo, said it had been granted permission to operate
a service from Almeria in Spain under the name Ferrimaroc from mid-November.
Eighteen months ago Spanish gunboats prevented a Cenargo ferry, the
Scirocco, from berthing at the port.
Cenargo took its fight to the Spanish courts and also obtained a ruling from
the European Commission that it had the right, under the single-market
regulations, to operate the service.

FT  19 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Pro-democracy parties lead in Hong Kong
poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pro-democracy parties were well ahead of pro-Beijing candidates in Hong
Kong's first fully democratic election. Nearly 700,000 people turned out to
vote, undeterred by threats from Beijing to overturn the result of the poll
when China resumes sovereignty in 1997. Chris Patten (left), the colony's
governor, said the big turnout was the mark of an 'open, self-confident and
plural society'. Picture, Page 4

FT  19 SEP 94 / European ruling on Guinness questions UK fraud procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legality under European law of the UK's procedures for the investigation
and prosecution of fraud has been called into question by a European
Commission of Human Rights ruling that the Guinness trial was unfair.
The commission has upheld a complaint by Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
Guinness chairman jailed for his role in the 1986 takeover of Distillers,
that his prosecution was an abuse of the European convention on human
rights. The ruling, which is not binding, agreed his trial was unfair
because evidence given by Mr Saunders under compulsion to Department of
Trade inspectors was used against him in his trial.
The case is set to go to the European Court of Human Rights for a final
resolution. A win for Mr Saunders there would, most lawyers believe, have
wide implications for the fight against financial crime in the UK.
The main issue would be the Section 2 powers of the Serious Fraud Office,
which compel suspects to answer questions.
However, a European court judgment might also affect the government's
recently introduced policy for combating crime generally by restricting the
right to silence of all suspects.
The government is expected to fight hard to maintain the system of allowing
the limited suspension of the right to silence. It is expected government
lawyers will argue this provides an essential weapon against financial crime
where investigations are particularly difficult.
The commission's ruling, due to be published later this week, was welcomed
by defence lawyers specialising in white-collar crime.
Mr Rod Fletcher of Russell Jones &amp; Walker, a London law firm, said: 'It is
extraordinary that a minority group - of financiers or businessmen accused
of financial fraud - are discriminated against by our legal system. The
right to silence is a fundamental safeguard of anyone accused of a crime.
The onus is and should be always on the prosecution to prove guilt and there
is no basis for violation of such principles.'
The three other prominent City figures jailed for their parts in the
Guinness affair, Mr Gerald Ronson, Mr Tony Parnes and Mr Jack Lyons, are
understood to be considering the implications of Mr Saunders' success for
their own positions.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Signal workers urge union to open talks: Breakthrough vote
could herald end of dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Striking signal workers voted yesterday to urge the RMT union executive to
open talks with Railtrack in a breakthrough that could herald the end of the
three-month dispute.
The vote came at the annual conference of about 100 RMT signal workers'
delegates in Great Yarmouth, which resisted calls to step up the action.
A union official denied that the move was a climbdown, but until now the RMT
leadership has insisted on an interim pay rise for the signal workers as a
reward for past productivity gains before talks on restructuring could
begin.
The conference, which does not set policy, said it wanted parallel
negotiations on both past productivity and future restructuring. It also
recommended that any negotiated package be put to all signal workers in a
secret ballot.
The call for fresh talks will be discussed by the union's executive
committee today and could lead to a meeting with the employers before the
next one-day strike, due on Friday.
Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs the track network, said it
hoped the RMT executive would respond positively. 'We are prepared to talk
about anything on the table if this signals a change in attitude.'
Last night Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said the conference
decision was 'a serious and positive move to bring Railtrack back to real
negotiations'. The union's chief negotiator, Mr Vernon Hince, added: 'This
is a genuine attempt to get talks off the ground.'
Pressure has been mounting on the union's 21-strong executive committee to
reopen talks with Railtrack.
Yesterday's unanimous vote on a resolution was drawn up at the weekend after
the signal workers' leaders had tested the mood of the delegates.
It rapidly became apparent that there was widespread desire among union
branches for a quick return to talks and a settlement of the dispute that
has already cost each signal worker more than Pounds 700 in lost pay.
The RMT stressed last night that the signal workers' move was only 'a first
step' on the road to a settlement of Britain's longest industrial conflict
since the miners' strike 10 years ago.
When the talks resume they are likely to be protracted. Initially Railtrack
had hoped to spend about three months negotiating the restructuring package
designed to transform working practices among the signalling grades.
It is now hoped a deal can be reached by September 30 - the deadline for
agreement if the signal workers are not to lose substantial benefits when
the industry's pension fund is redistributed as part of the privatisation
process.
The signal workers' conference did not call for an end to the industrial
conflict, warning that further stoppages might be necessary if negotiations
failed. The delegates rejected arbitration as a way out of the dispute.
They also stuck to their original 11 per cent pay claim for past
productivity - the demand that led to the outbreak of the dispute.
More than half the rail network is now open for services on strike days
because of the use of managers and supervisors in signal boxes.

FT  19 SEP 94 / US invasion of Haiti halted as Carter strikes deal with
junta: Military chiefs to step down - American troops to enter peacefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US troops will enter Haiti peacefully today after former president Jimmy
Carter struck a last-minute deal with the Haitian military leaders last
night to avert a full-scale invasion.
In a televised address early today President Bill Clinton revealed that the
junta had agreed to step down only when convinced that US paratroopers were
on the way from North Carolina. Mr Clinton said he had in fact ordered the
invasion to start last night and 61 aircraft were in the air when the
agreement was clinched. The aircraft were recalled.
He said the junta would leave Haiti as soon as the Haitian parliament had
passed an amnesty agreement and in any event no later than October 15.
Mr Clinton said the agreement was 'good' for the US and for Haiti.
He paid tribute to the mission led by Mr Carter which included Senator Sam
Nunn, chairman of the armed services committee, and former General Colin
Powell the previous head of the joint chiefs of staff.
He said the US intervention was still not without risk but he was confident
that it would now succeed. The president's announcement should defuse what
has been his most difficult foreign affairs crisis. The breakthrough came,
however, in the last few hours of Mr Carter's mission to Haiti, which began
on Saturday and culminated in a six-hour session yesterday with Lt General
Raoul Cedras, the republic's military strongman.
After the last session of talks at the headquarters of the Haitian military
in Port-au-Prince, the capital, the two teams adjourned to the presidential
palace for a final session with Mr Emile Jonassaint, the de facto president
appointed some months ago by the junta.
The first sign of a possible deal occurred when Mr Carter and Gen Cedras
went from the military headquarters in Port-au-Prince to the presidential
palace for a joint visit to Mr Jonassaint.
Although Mr Jonassaint's authority has never been recognised by the US, the
development for the first time raised speculation that a constitutional
settlement might be found which would allow Gen Cedras to step down. The
Carter team, to the surprise of some Washington observers, had also met Mr
Jonassaint on Saturday.
Earlier yesterday there had been reports from the Haitian side that Gen
Cedras was demanding that Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in a
1991 coup, agree to step down as a condition for the junta's capitulation.
But senior US government officials insisted that Mr Carter's mission was
authorised only to agree the departure of the three-man junta. They had
stressed that the return of Mr Aristide was non-negotiable especially after
his agreement not to contest presidential elections scheduled for December
1995.
Other reports had said that General Philippe Biamby, the army chief of
staff, was holding out against leaving, but that Gen Cedras and Lt Col
Michel Francois, the police chief, were resigned to exile.
President Carlos Menem of Argentina yesterday said he was prepared to offer
asylum if the junta left before any invasion.
It emerged at the weekend that Mr Clinton decided to send the Carter mission
only after Thursday night's televised address in which he had demanded that
the junta leave. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said the
final decision was taken jointly by Mr Clinton and Mr Carter but he denied
that 'this last-minute effort for peace' had been opposed by some
administration members.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Archer ordered shares in prohibited period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Anglia Television were warned in writing almost two years ago
that neither they nor their spouses should ever deal in the company's shares
from the end of its financial year of December 31 to the date of publication
of its financial results, normally mid-March.
In mid-January this year Lord Archer, best selling author and Conservative
politician, whose wife is an Anglia director, placed orders to buy 50,000
Anglia shares.
The share orders have been the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry
investigation into alleged insider dealing.
The disclosure that no Anglia director or spouse should have dealt in the
first two months of any year is contained in formal rules for share dealings
by 'officers' adopted by the television company's board on September 23
1992. It explicitly prohibits share dealings by directors and their spouses
during the 'close period'.
Anglia directors were asked to inform their spouses of the new dealing
rules. One of Lady Archer's fellow directors said that she was
'punctilious', and always followed company instructions to the letter. The
rules are based partly on the London Stock Exchange's Yellow Book and partly
on company law. All directors were required to sign a copy of the rules
indicating that they would 'act in accordance with them'.
A lawyer said yesterday that the definition of 'dealing' in the context of
Anglia's rules was ambiguous. Lord Archer placed the share orders on behalf
of an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib, so in that sense he may not have 'dealt'
in the strictest sense.
However, he did have an 'interest' in the transaction, because the
stockbroking firm which received the order, Charles Stanley, was only
prepared to carry it out because of its knowledge of Lord Archer.
Charles Stanley had never before heard of Mr Saib and had no knowledge of
whether he had sufficient cash to pay the Pounds 245,000 needed to buy the
50,000 shares. It carried out the deal because it believed Lord Archer would
cover the payment. Mr David Howard, Charles Stanley's managing director,
said it is well established in contract law that as 'agent' for the deal,
Lord Archer would have been liable in this sense.
It also emerged yesterday that Charles Stanley had been advised, a few days
before the official payment date in February this year, by its solicitor not
to pay the Pounds 77,219.62 profit on the Anglia share transactions.
There was a risk, according to the solicitor, that Charles Stanley could
face a court case if the market makers who sold the shares to Mr Saib via
the broker sued on the basis that the purchaser might have benefited from
inside information. Anglia's rules also say there should be no dealings in
Anglia shares by directors, their spouses or other 'connected' persons when
the directors are 'in possession of information likely, upon publication, to
affect the market price of those securities'.

<TEXT>
Former US president Jimmy Carter yesterday entered a fourth session of talks
with Haiti's military rulers, as senior US government officials in
Washington insisted that his mission was authorised only to agree the
departure of the ruling three-man junta.
There were persistent reports from the Haitian side that Lt Gen Raoul
Cedras, the army chief, was demanding that Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
Haitian president ousted in the 1991 coup, agree to step down as a condition
for the junta's capitulation.
Other reports said that General Philippe Niamby, the army chief of staff,
was holding out against leaving, but that Lt Cedras and Lt Col Michel
Francois, the police chief, were resigned to exile. President Carlos Menem
of Argentina yesterday said he was prepared to offer asylum if the junta
left before any invasion.
As the US delegation, which also includes Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and
retired General Colin Powell, former head of the joint chiefs of staff, was
in talks at the Haitian military's headquarters in Port-au-Prince, a US
presidential jet stood ready to whisk them back to Washington.
Mr Carter briefed President Bill Clinton by telephone on Saturday night, as
did Gen Powell early yesterday. This encouraged the White House to say the
discussions were 'serious and constructive', with officials emphasising that
there was no US desire to humiliate the junta beyond their forced departure.
But Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, and Mr William Perry, defence secretary, all said in
television interviews that the junta must go. 'There is no practical way
they can stay after they step down,' Mr Perry said.
Officials stressed that the return of Mr Aristide was non-negotiable,
especially after his agreement last week not to contest presidential
elections scheduled for December 1995.
Asked if merely moving across the border to the Dominican Republic was an
option, Mr Perry replied: 'We have not yet specified which country they
could go to - but that might be under discussion right now' in
Port-au-Prince.
It emerged at the weekend that Mr Clinton decided to send the Carter mission
only after Thursday night's televised address in which he had demanded that
the junta leave.
Mr Panetta said the final decision was taken jointly by Mr Clinton and Mr
Carter but he denied that 'this last-minute effort for peace' had been
opposed by some administration members. However, the decision was
interpreted in Washington as further evidence that Mr Clinton is still
deeply ambivalent about ordering an invasion.

FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hungary plans drugs group sale
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hungarian government is preparing to sell about 36 per cent of Richter
Gedeon, the country's largest pharmaceuticals company, in which it has a
stake of 87 per cent. It is expected to be one of the country's biggest
privatisation deals this year.
In the first phase, the company will increase its capital by Ft4.4bn
(Dollars 41m) to Ft17.6bn. Part of the issue will be sold via a private
placement to international institutional investors by the end of this month,
according to Creditanstalt Securities which, together with Schroder, the UK
merchant bank, is advising on the privatisation. The balance will be sold
through a domestic public offering scheduled for October, Creditanstalt
said.
The company plans to seek listings on the Budapest and Vienna stock
exchanges and possibly the London over-the-counter market. If floated, the
company will be the largest on the Budapest exchange.
According to government figures, Richter Gedeon was one of Hungary's top
five exporters in the first half of 1994. Under current regulations, the
state holding company, AV Rt, must retain 50 per cent of the company plus
one vote but Creditanstalt said the state was considering changing the rule
to 25 per cent plus one vote.
Richter Gedeon, which was founded in 1901 and nationalised in 1948, had
turnover of Ft11.2bn in the first half of 1994 with gross profit of more
than Ft2bn. Exports accounted for USDollars 67.3m of sales.
Foreign interest in the sale is expected to be strong. The pharmaceuticals
sector is considered one of Hungary's most promising, and Chinoin and Egis,
Hungary's second and third pharmaceutical companies, have already been
privatised.
Chinoin is majority owned by Elf Sanofi, the French company, while the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a 30 per cent stake in
Egis last year.

FT  19 SEP 94 / Healthcare deals top Dollars 18bn in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than Dollars 18bn changed hands in mergers and acquisitions in the
healthcare industry in the first six months of 1994 and deal-making is
continuing at a fast pace, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the management
consultancy.
Deals worth Dollars 18.4bn (Pounds 11.9bn) were completed in the first half
of 1994. At least another Dollars 18bn worth of bids and deals have already
been struck in the second half of the year.
'The entire US healthcare system is being turned upside down,' said Mr
Robert Esposito, US national director of KPMG's biotechnology and life
sciences practice. 'New legislation is being stalled in Congress but the
healthcare industry is restructuring itself ready for a new environment.'
Of the 37 mergers and acquisitions in the first half, all but seven involved
US companies.
The two biggest deals were American Home Products' bid of almost Dollars
10bn for American Cyanamid and Roche of Switzerland's Dollars 5.3bn for
California's Syntex.
Two deals were vertical integrations - unusual for the drugs industry - as
Eli Lilly of the US and SmithKline Beecham of the UK bought drug
distributors PCS and Diversified Pharmaceutical Services respectively.
The busiest company was SmithKline which has concluded three deals - two as
buyer, one as seller - worth a total of Dollars 6.2bn.
Only one of the ten deals the merger of Akzo of the Netherlands and Nobel
Industrie of Sweden, was wholly non-US.
Mr Esposito argues that the deal-making will continue as drug companies
struggle to maintain revenues. As well as healthcare legislation, they face
patent expiries - drugs with annual revenues of Dollars 20bn a year will
lose US patent protection over the next decade.
Many drug companies are turning to the biotechnology sector, rich in
research possibilities but in need of funding, to complement their own
research programmes.
KPMG recorded more than 200 new alliances established between drug companies
and biotechnology companies in the first half of the year.

<TEXT>
The US-led invasion of Haiti is now 'a matter of days away' and, when it
comes, serious fighting will be over 'in a matter of hours', according to Mr
Warren Christopher and Mr William Perry, respectively US secretaries of
state and defence.
US president Bill Clinton, whose televised address to the nation on Thursday
night had laid out his justifications for intervention, yesterday cancelled
a political trip to California scheduled for tomorrow.
Mr Perry said US forces would be ready by the weekend and could maintain
that state for several days.
Washington was alive with rumours that one or more of the Haitian military
junta was preparing to leave the island. But Lt General Raoul Cedras, the
army chief who was interviewed live on US TV after the president had
finished, said he was prepared to die for his country.
US officials ruled out third party mediation with the junta, reported to
have been offered by Mr Edward Seaga, the former Jamaican prime minister,
and Mr Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, the dictator overthrown in 1986. Any
dealings with the regime would be handled by the US embassy in
Port-au-Prince and these would only include negotiations about the manner of
their departure.
Mr Clinton held a meeting yesterday with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian
president ousted by Lt Gen Cedras in the 1991 coup, and representatives of
more than 20 nations which are contributing to an international peacekeeping
force that will take over after the US invasion.
Mr Aristide, in a significant concession to conservative critics of his
leftwing politics and character, promised to step down when his term of
office ends late next year and to respect the result of the next
presidential elections.
Although the Haitian constitution prevents him from seeking re-election, Mr
Aristide had maintained that the clock should be stopped on his term at the
1991 coup. This would have given him, in effect, more than four years after
he is restored to power.
Mr Clinton's address appeared to reduce public opposition to invading Haiti.
One instant poll found support for sending in US troops up to 56 per cent
from 40 per cent, while another reported outright opposition to an invasion
down from 73 per cent to 60 per cent.
However, much political opinion was unmollified. Former president George
Bush said yesterday he found Mr Clinton's arguments 'mind-boggling', but he
added that if the invasion were launched 'I will support our own troops and
our own president'.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Council states terms for probe into 'Monklandsgate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monklands district council in Scotland said yesterday that legal advice on
powers and costs would determine whether a public inquiry was held into
allegations about the way it is run.
The ruling Labour group on the council agreed this week to seek an inquiry
in response to pressure which has built up over the past 2 1/2 years.
It boiled over in June during the bitter by-election campaign in the
Monklands East parliamentary constituency, which was held until his death by
John Smith, the Labour leader. It was widely believed during the campaign
that the Scottish National party had a strong chance of winning the seat.
The council has faced allegations - described locally as 'Monklandsgate' -
that it has favoured the predominantly Roman Catholic town of Coatbridge
over the largely Protestant Airdrie in the allocation of capital expenditure
and council jobs.
Earlier this year Mr Smith challenged Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, to
hold an inquiry into the allegations, which were taken up by English Tory
MPs. However, the government has said it would not be justified in holding
an inquiry.
The Labour group's decision to seek an inquiry is the result of an
initiative by Mrs Helen Liddell, who won the seat in the by-election with a
drastically reduced majority and confronted the issue during the campaign.
She says that people with claims or charges against the council should come
forward with evidence.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Minister praises model pay policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average take-home pay for an unmarried production worker in the UK is higher
than in any other European Union country except Luxembourg, Miss Ann
Widdecombe, employment minister, said yesterday.
In a speech to an International Labour Organisation seminar in London to
mark the ILO's 75th anniversary, she said that British labour market policy,
stressing flexibility and deregulation, was an example to the world. The
'diabolical trade-off' between good jobs and more jobs, which concerned Mr
Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, did not exist in the UK, she said.
'While income differences have widened in the UK, there have been real wage
increases for all groups,' she said. 'We are unlike the US in this respect.
There, real wages at the lower end have fallen. Adjusted for costs,
take-home pay for a British production worker, married with two children, is
only fractionally lower than in Germany or Belgium and higher than in France
and Italy.'
Miss Widdecombe said that a flexible labour market was compatible with
employment rights. 'Many employment rights, such as those relating to health
and safety, race and sex discrimination, trades' union membership and
maternity leave, apply to all employees regardless of hours or work or
length of service,' she said.
The minister said that more and more European countries, and the European
Commission, were coming round to the British view. 'We see something of a
sea change in the way the Commission approaches these issues,' she said.

British Steel Strip Products is closing its profiling plant at Newton
Aycliffe, County Durham with the loss of 56 jobs.
The closure is part of a rationalisation plan to be carried out over the
next few months. It follows the purchase in March of two profiling plants
from RTZ, the international mining group.
The acquisitions improved British Steel's market position but with
continuing overcapacity it wants to cut costs by closing one of its three
plants, which turn flat steel sheets into shaped products.

A US federal judge blocked the extradition of an escaped Irish Nationalist

Ireland's Maze prison in 1983, during the biggest jailbreak in British
history. US District Judge Barbara Caulfield rejected the extradition
request after finding that Smyth would be punished on the basis of his
political opinions if returned to Northern Ireland. Smyth, 40, was released
without bail. Federal prosecutors representing the British government are
expected to appeal against the decision.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Right winger wants role for army
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'My name is Eneas' is a strange political slogan, but Eneas Carneiro is no
conventional politician. Seen by most Brazilians as an unbalanced and
slightly ridiculous rightwinger with a short temper, 'Eneas' - as he is
known - attracted 300,000 votes in the 1989 election. This time he will pass
the 1m mark, according to opinion polls which give him 4 per cent of the
vote.
His Party for the Re-edification of National Order (Prona) is campaigning
for a strong and nationalist Brazil, a clampdown on corruption and the
purging of all sex from prime-time TV. Eneas, a former army heart
specialist, is said to favour a leading role for Brazil's military. When the
Financial Times requested an interview to verify these reports, an adviser
said: 'We don't need the press, especially not the foreign press.'
Eneas is a Brazilian cross between Ross Perot and Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Prona seems to have support from a small cross-section of Brazilians, some
of them profoundly disillusioned with existing politicians and the country's
corruption scandals, others who hark back to a 'golden age' of stability
under the military from 1964 to 1985. At the recent launch of the party's
programme in Sao Paulo, most of the several hundred supporters who attended
were well-dressed, young to middle-aged apparently conventional people who
queued quietly to meet their leader.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (20): A bit on the
sideboard - Investing in furniture / A look at the continuing attractions of
antiques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where have the big City bonuses of recent years gone? Many of the Pounds
250,000-plus windfalls have probably disappeared on such traditional
pleasures as a smart new home, a flash car, and perhaps a boat. But quite a
few merchant bankers and traders have spent up to Pounds 20,000 of their
surplus cash on items of antique furniture.
For many, a Georgian table and chairs, or a Regency bureau, are necessary
items of furniture which provide an intriguing conversation point at dinner
parties. But some will have caught the collecting bug. They will have heard
that good antique furniture is likely to prove a sound investment - much
more so than modern, or reproduction, furniture.
While the art market is only slowly recovering from the recession which hit
it hard in late 1990 and held its grip for almost three years, antique
furniture has retained its attraction, and prices for the finest items have
continued to rise. You can live without pictures, but everyone needs
furniture, and for the very rich antique furniture offers status, grandeur,
visual pleasure, and a steadily appreciating asset.
So in 1993-94 Christie's, which with Sotheby's dominates the world of fine
art auctions, increased its turnover in furniture by 44 per cent, and in
June and July sold furniture throughout Europe to the value of Pounds
16.6m., with 31 items selling for more than Pounds 100,000.
The seriously rich tend to buy French furniture of the period of Louis XIV
and Louis XV: showy, highly decorated,pieces with much gilding and
marquetry. Ideally the items can be confidently attributed to Boulle, the
great 17th century maker, or Riesener, his 18th century successor. Their
finest objects, designed for a royal palace, perhaps Versailles or
Fontainebleau, would cost Pounds 500,000 - or more: a bureau plat (table) by
Boulle, which recently graced the Paris home of Hubert de Givency, the
couturier, sold for almost Pounds 2m in Monaco last year.
To set off the furniture, the mega-rich would buy a French ormolu clock, and
decorative fixtures and fittings like Marie-Antionette's ormolu mounted
porcelain ewers, which sold for Pounds 1m this summer, and the Louis XV
Savonnerie carpet which made a record Pounds 1.32m.
French furniture and works of art of the late 17th and 18th century can be
found in the grandest Fifth Avenue apartments in New York, and in the houses
of the Fauborg St Germain in Paris. In the 19th century the British
aristocracy caught the habit, and much fine French furniture came to the UK
after the French Revolution. But in recent years there has been a change in
taste. The more restrained, more modestly priced, 18th century British
furniture has become widely appreciated. It is still mainly collected by the
British, and a few Americans, but it seems to suit a less flamboyant age.
The bulk of 18th and early 19th century British 'brown furniture' is rather
unexciting and has not risen much in price. But furniture which can be
attributed to an important maker, be it the designs of Chippendale, Adam or
the 19th century Bullock; or furniture which was originally ordered to fill
a great house; or which shows some originality, as in Regency or Gothick
designs, has become very collectable.
The radio and television industrialist, the late Sir Michael Sobell,
furnished his home with both British and continental furniture, but when
Christie's sold off his collection in June it was the British pieces which
did best. A pair of George III gilt lacquered and marquetry side tables sold
to the London dealers Mallett for Pounds 177,500, over three times their
estimate.
The strength of brand names was shown a few weeks later when a pair of
giltwood sofas, which Chippendale had provided for Brocket Hall, sold for
Pounds 254,500, a record for Chippendale sofas, and 12 chairs of Sheraton
design soared to a record Pounds 463,500. Buyers are becoming bolder and
more eclectic. Prices for 18th century pieces seem modest compared with the
Pounds 793,500 which secured a cabinet designed by Charles Rennie
Mackintosh, a record for any item of 20th century furniture. A chair by the
great Scottish arts and crafts stylist went for Pounds 309,500.
Even these prices are low compared with those paid for pictures, jewels, or
even antiquities: furniture has price potential. And the rich now have a
choice. In the past, their interior decorators insisted on French taste.
Then English 18th century became respectable. Now the finest objects of any
era, and of any nation, will not only look good in a suitable room setting,
but should also quietly appreciate in value.

FT  17 SEP 94 / A song for yobs and nobs: Peter Aspden on why 'Land of Hope
and Glory' makes him uneasy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listening to 'Land of Hope and Glory' always makes me fidget in my seat, not
least because of the withering looks all around me which suggest I should be
standing. It is not a sign of disrespect, more a sense of unease over the
sentiments being unleashed, and their appropriateness to the occasion.
The two versions I heard recently, both celebrating very diverse aspects of
nationhood, were rousing testaments to the real joy many people experience
singing this powerful anthem; but I could not help wondering if the two
groups were actually divided by a common call to exaltation.
The first was at Wembley Stadium last week where, as has been the practice
for a few years now, Elgar's march was blasted out by the orchestra as the
two teams came on to the pitch.
The unashamed point of the exercise is to provoke the crowd into vociferous
vocal support for the home team, to intimidate the opposition, to swell the
roar of those three lions on the shirts of what sometimes look like some
very young, skinny lads.
Nothing wrong here at all; sport is regarded as a legitimate and secure
arena for such feelings. It thrives on adrenalin, theatricality and violence
of passion. And last week's opponents, the United States, after their
improbably prosperous summer, are not unfamiliar with intensity of feeling
and big-crowd psychology.
The reservations surface a few moments later, when, as always happens, the
opposition's national anthem is played. Not that anyone can hear it very
clearly; for the crowd, now surging into a higher plane of fervour, drowns
it out, by boos, whistles, curses and simple abuse.
It is an ugly, witless display, embarrassing to share (one can never wholly
detach oneself from a crowd) and ineluctably staining any dignity which the
preceding minutes had acquired.
It was with some trepidation, then, that I watched the climax of the Last
Night of the Proms a few days later. Not only another 'Land of Hope and
Glory', but a 'Rule Britannia' and 'Jerusalem' to follow: a triple shot of
patriotic lust just in case we missed the point.
It made me feel uncomfortable, I admit, but maybe Wembley had unduly
poisoned my judgment. In fact, the Royal Albert Hall, awash with flags of
many nations, seemed a genuinely joyful place to be.
My anxieties were allayed completely when Bryn Terfel stepped up to lead
'Rule Britannia', bursting with Welsh pride (no need to do any swelling
here) but tempering the proceedings with a tightly clutched rugby ball and
flag sticking out of his back.
Here was patriotism all right, but placed firmly in inverted commas, a bit
of a laugh, perfectly pitched for an audience which above all was looking
for a good time.
Here, after all, is how the British should handle nationalism, with lashings
of irony, glancing backwards but rooted firmly in our present
less-than-auspicious circumstances.
Tolerance, wit and self-effacement are not virtues to be under-estimated;
this surely is the perfect way to celebrate them.
And yet, I continue to feel uneasy. Is it not too complacent to distinguish
so easily between the vulgar inanities of a yob culture and the cleverly
modulated coolness of a nob culture? They are, it should be remembered,
singing the same song.
On a freezing mid-winter night some years ago, England entertained Cameroon
for another friendly match.
It was a few weeks into the Gulf War, and feelings, notwithstanding the
bitter cold, were running higher than usual.
As the Cameroon stars of the 1990 World Cup lined up, a clutch of Arsenal
fans in front of me struck up a half-hearted chant which soon evaporated
into the bleak night: 'Saddam is a yiddo, Saddam is a yiddo . . .'
The perplexing irrelevance of the chant - one needs a crash course in North
London demographics to understand it - is almost funny, were it not for the
fact that this pithy slice of 'terrace humour' managed, with one bilious
brushstroke, to offend at least three religions, two continents and a clutch
of squirming liberal-pacifists who just wanted to enjoy the match.
The British are fortunate enough not to be at war at present; but one ought
to be more careful than ever with hope and glory. Neither one is in
plentiful supply right now, and the crassness of the acts committed in their
name belongs to all of us.

FT  17 SEP 94 / The last laugh for the honest joker: Politicians are so
afraid of offending that they no longer dare tell the truth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Downer is about to lose his job. No, I had not heard of him
either, but apparently Downer, 42, is the leader of Australia's opposition
Liberal Party. Downer has held down this job for only four months, so one
might be forgiven for wondering what this Tony Blair of the antipodes had
done to deserve such treatment. The answer is: he has made one joke too
many, in public.
According to the Daily Telegraph 'he has made a series of gaffes since
becoming leader, affronting women's and civil rights groups, Aborigines and
homosexuals . . .
'The most damaging incident occurred last week when he outlined to guests at
a fund-raising dinner his Liberal party's new policy document called 'The
Things That Matter'. Attempting some light-hearted banter, he caused outrage
by describing the party's policy on domestic violence as 'the things that
batter'.'
Not the best joke I have ever heard, but is it such an excruciating pun that
the man responsible should be sacked? Alas, the outrage was not at the
quality of Downer's sense of humour, but at the fact that he was prepared to
laugh at the over-seriousness of his own party workers, with their
portentous pamphlets called 'The Things That Matter'. It is a gloomy day
when a political leader of a right of centre party, in robust Australia, of
all places, is deemed unelectable because he is prepared to mock such
ghastly totems of political correctness as 'women's and civil rights groups,
Aborigines and homosexuals'.
In the mother country last week our own Jeremy Hanley, having scarcely had
time to register that he had become Conservative Party chairman, was being
declared unfit for his office because he good-humouredly described some
violent yobs as 'exuberant'. Like his contemporary, Downer, Hanley's
unforgivable crime was levity.
We are in an age when a sense of humour has been designated the eighth
deadly sin, at least as far as politicians are concerned. There can be no
doubt that Norman Lamont's announcement, two years ago this week, that he
was singing in his bath on the morning after sterling's forced exit from the
exchange rate mechanism, was responsible for most of the abuse which the
ex-chancellor subsequently received.
The paradoxical truth is that, in private, politicians tend to have an
acerbic, often tasteless, and sometimes genuinely very funny sense of
humour. Their cynical and mordant wit makes them good company. And yet they
are forced to neuter themselves in public, all for fear of offending one or
another of the growing band of one-issue pressure groups.
Blunt telling of home truths is similarly unpalatable, and must be recanted
at all costs. Michael Portillo tells some university students that they are
living in the least corrupt country in Europe, and is immediately forced to
apologise.
William Waldegrave reveals to a House of Commons select committee that
governments sometimes lie, and is henceforth considered unsuitable for
promotion.
As one politician wryly told me, in modern public discourse 'gaffe' is the
word used by journalists to describe a politician telling the truth.
I am afraid that journalists must take a large measure of blame for this.
They are as cynical a breed as the politicians they write about, but all too
often they adopt a tone of outraged surprise when a government minister
blurts out in public the truth which he will have told the same journalists
countless times in unattributable briefings. It is as if they regard the
public as children, unfit to be exposed to the murky realism which
characterises the private discourse of those who write about politics for a
living. Yet the extraordinary public success and acclaim for Alan Clark's
diaries is clear evidence that the public is capable of appreciating
political dialogue stripped bare of euphemism and mock-seriousness.
Clark, you will observe , left political life with neither a peerage nor a
knighthood. But at least he had fun. As I have had, over the past 3 1/2
years, in writing this column. Good bye, and thank you for reading to the
end.

Thank you - I've given them up.
'I have too. But I have to promote our best export product, you see, and
this is one way of eliciting interest.' He smiled benignly.
When the head of a turbulent country like the Philippines feels secure
enough to take an extended business tour of Europe, things have surely
changed.
Ramos is a large part of the reason for that change. A former enforcer for
Ferdinand Marcos, his second cousin, he led the 'people's power' revolution
against the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 and quashed seven attempted coups to
protect successor Cory Aquino before running for the presidency himself.
For the last nine days Ramos has been travelling with a large retinue
between Rome, Madrid, Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt to confirm his
democratic credentials and trumpet his country's newly-acquired stability
and economic growth.
Long famous for its poverty, civil turmoil, crony capitalism, foreign
indebtedness, tax evasion and bureaucratic corruption, the Philippines is
now being hailed as the latest addition to Asia's economic tigers.
Ramos himself is credited with pacifying or neutralising the Communist,
Moslem and far-right military rebels. He even claims to have pacified the
Catholic Church to which 85 per cent of the 66m Filipinos belong. Church
leaders - including the outspoken Cardinal Jaime Sin - attacked his
government's birth control programme as an invitation to vice and sexual
perversion.
A Methodist who keeps a statue of the Madonna in his office, Ramos on this
tour enjoyed a private audience with the Pope. They met as the Vatican was
fighting its corner at the UN conference on population control in Cairo, so
I asked Ramos if they had discussed family planning and artificial
contraception.
'To tell you frankly, the Holy Father and I have been exchanging letters
since early May. I pointed out in my letters that in the Philippines the
family is considered as the basic social unit, the very key to the survival
of the nation.'
There was no disagreement on principles, he added. 'The freedom of
conscience, we say in government, is the basic freedom which we protect.
It's up to married couples to determine what kind of life they would like to
have for themselves and for their children.'
Is the church too powerful?
'It's a matter of opinion, I guess. But if you look at the recent elections,
the Catholic Church, as far as I can see, did not try and impose its
collective authority in favour of any candidate or set of candidates.'
What are your relations with Cardinal Sin like?
'Very good. I kid him all the time because for the last seven or eight years
I have been attending his birthday parties, on his invitation. We both
belong to the class of 1928 - we were born the same year.'
Ramos's former jobs as head of the feared paramilitary police and national
police under Marcos seem to have been forgiven him as he pursues economic
success under democratic rule, a rare combination for Asia.
You grew up in an authoritarian regime, I said. How can you satisfy people
that you will not one day want to seek more power to drive your programme
through?
'I think you must understand that being in the military as a career does not
make you a dictator, per se,' he said. 'We couldn't stand the dictatorship.
That's why we got together with the people and Mrs Aquino and many other
military professionals to throw out the dictator. The record is there and
can speak for itself.
'So what are we guaranteeing to the western investor? A government that is
very stable, democratic, predictable, transparent, continuous.'
They call you 'Steady Eddie', I said. Some would say you are going too
slowly, too cautiously.
'You have to judge the performance by the result. What is important for me
is to start properly. There are some critics who think I should be charging
all over the place on a white horse, which is the usual dramatics of
Philippine politics. But I am different.
'We have seen how Philippine politics in the traditional pattern have
failed. They have not provided for the livelihood of the people. It was
basically an oligarchy and there was a mistaken idea that there must be
drama, charisma, fire and a lot of special effects taking place, forgetting
that you must first put in the fundamentals. And this is what I have done.'
He cited the end of power cuts as an example.
Ramos has never been accused of flamboyance. But on his birthday he used to
enjoy parachuting into the party - one year he descended with a crate of
beer, another with a live goat for the barbecue.
If you are calm and steady, I said, is that due to your military training,
your Methodist upbringing?
'No, it's because of me. All of those things impacted on the making of me.
But I would give credit to discipline, specially self-discipline. You don't
have to go to military school to learn that. But going through an
institution like West Point helps.' (He won a place at the tough US military
academy against 400 of his countrymen.)
'I have also seen the best and the worst in Philippine society, precisely
because this was the nature of my military career. As a military man, very
early on, I saw that poverty, injustice in the Philippines was not to be
solved by military means but by the removal of the root causes.'
Ramos, born in Pangasinan in the north of the country, describes his
background as middle-class but not wealthy. His father was a reporter who
became a congressman, ambassador and foreign secretary. His mother was a
public school teacher 'very charming, a very effective campaigner who was
loved by ordinary people because she knew how to relate to them'. A younger
sister, Letty, went into politics before him and is the country's
second-ranking senator.
The president and his wife Amelita 'Ming' Martinez have five daughters, one
of whom, on holiday from Hong Kong, was sitting among the officials in the
room as he spoke.
I forebore, therefore, to ask Ramos about the allegation in a Manila
newspaper last year - not apparently so far denied - that behind him is a
powerful mistress. When I asked a senior aide about it afterwards he smiled
ambiguously and said: 'Maybe it was a long time ago.'
The soldier-president, sometimes likened to General Eisenhower, says he has
all his life been affected by the devastation of war - first as a boy during
the second world war, then as a combat soldier in the Korean War, later as a
fighter of his own country's insurgents.
In Vietnam, he headed a non-combatant unit sent in to repair roads and
bridges and distribute medical relief. Civic action, a military form of
community help, had been an important theme of his life, he said, and his
overall responsibility as a former deputy chief of staff. Later, under Cory
Aquino, he was put in charge of relief operations for the huge earthquake of
1990.
When did you start having presidential ambitions?
'After seeing that the economic empowerment of the people had not yet been
put in place towards the end of President Aquino's term, I decided to go for
it.
'By that time I had helped Mrs Aquino overcome seven coup attempts against
her government and I felt the economic setbacks resulting from these
upheavals, and then the terrible natural disasters (the earthquake, followed
by the eruption of Mt Pinatubo and a succession of typhoons) convinced me
that someone who knew how to do it must take over.
'Another factor you might say that convinced me to go for it was the clamour
of people that were with me during the people power revolution who did not
see much improvement over the years that followed. They said I must finish
the unfinished revolution.'
In getting to the top were you lucky or clever?
'It's not because of religion, or schooling,' he repeated. 'I am saying it's
because of me. That's the way I was made.'
When I asked him what he read he mentioned Alvin Toffler, Paul Kennedy, and
John Naisbitt of 'Megatrends' fame.
'I do read a lot and I write a lot, in the sense of writing my own stuff -
speeches for instance. I'm happy to give you some samples later on.' He held
up some notes.
My time was up, but President Ramos allowed one more question. So I
mentioned the thousands of Filipino women who do menial work in Europe and
the Middle East, often to support children they have left behind, and often
exploited in the process.
Are their remittances a welcome feature of the economy, I asked, or is their
presence an embarrassment to you?
'No, we are just practical about this. The jobs are here but we are
generating jobs now in the Philippines so that we can keep many of our
nationals at home. But this will take time.' Ramos pointed to the doubling,
to more than 5 per cent, of GNP growth in the first half of this year. 'We
are optimistic that the creation of jobs will happen.'
I got up to leave and the president, who had been busily writing in a book,
handed the volume to me across the wide desk. 'You might find this
interesting, too,' he said. It was a colour magazine with a picture of a man
scuba diving among wrecks.
When I got outside among the throng of protocol and security men, the
smiling attache pointed to the caption. The scuba diver was unflamboyant
Steady Eddie himself.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (19): Somewhere special
and secure - Investing in a house / Even serious investors need homes.
Gerald Cadogan offers some suggestions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The serious investor's choice is straightforward: a smart house in London, a
smart house in the country or a sporting or farming estate - or a
combination of any or all of these.
Look after any of these blue-chip options properly, and the security of your
money is sure, because there are always others eager to buy.
For those rich enough to afford a house that all agree is special, the hunt
starts in Chelsea. The grandest house on the London market is the Old
Rectory (56 Old Church Street, SW3), for sale through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
with a guide price of Pounds 25m.
Why so much? Because it is a private palace in a garden of more than two
acres in the middle of London. It would make a fine ambassador's residence.
For a private person, it would be a triumph.
The rector of Chelsea lived in this 18th century house until about 10 years
ago. Developer TMC has now rebuilt it, making it three times as large. I
particularly like its two-storey drawing room - more at home in Paris or
Vienna than in London - which opens on to the part-formal, part-wild garden.
And the detailing of the glass-roofed swimming pool, parquet floors and
cedar drawers and shelves in the clothes cupboards is a joy.
TMC has also rebuilt the house next door, nicknamed 'The Garage', which
recently sold for a reputed Pounds 7m before coming formally to market. The
buyer is Elliott Bernerd, of property firm Chelsfield.
Hanover Lodge, in Regent's Park, NW1, is fresh on the market. The Crown
Estate is offering this villa designed by John Nash and Decimus Burton, with
alterations by Edwin Lutyens, through KFR on a 99-year lease for Pounds 6m.
Recently it has housed the French ambassador, while his house was being
restored. Now it needs a long-term incumbent, who must expect to carry out
renovations under the supervision of the Crown Estate's architect.
In outer London, the biggest surprise is another Old Rectory, in Church
Road, Wimbledon, SW19. It has the same amount of grounds as its Chelsea
counterpart, but is far older, going back to around 1500 when it had links
with the Cecil family, Archbishop Cranmer and Henry VIII.
Life was different then in Wimbledon. The king is said to have slept in the
downstairs hall not long before he died, as his 'bloated' body was too heavy
to carry upstairs.
The present owner, Basil Suleiman Faidhi, has restored the grade II* house
superbly. Its ace point is being only 100 yards from the All England Lawn
Tennis and Croquet Club (which would mean a fat rent during the
championships). The price from KFR's Sloane Street office is Pounds 4m.
A nearby alternative in the same grade is a late 17th century stylish brick
box. Petersham House, near Richmond, has views to the river Thames and 1710
wall paintings of classical myths along its grand staircase. Savills is
selling for Pounds 3.5m.
North of London, Wyddial Hall, in north Hertfordshire, is conveniently
equidistant between Cambridge and Stevenage. Bidwells asks for offers over
Pounds 550,000. It is an 18th century white stuccoed house, with park and
gardens designed by Humphry Repton in 1795-98.
For a Manchester businessman, Coggshall Hall, near Northwich, in Cheshire,
is ideal. Built around 1830 and sitting in 58 acres of park and paddocks, it
is 30 minutes' drive from the city. The hall has a smart red-brick facade
with stone porticoes, and inside fine plasterwork, plenty of marble
fireplaces and a swimming pool. Its listing particulars (grade II*) call it
'a good and complete example of a late Georgian country house', which
Jackson-Stops and Meller Braggins offer for Pounds 1.25m.
On the other side of the Pennines, Leyburn Hall is priced at an attractive
Pounds 450,000 from Jackson-Stops in Darlington, and straddles town and
country. It is just off the Market Place in Leyburn, North Yorkshire, but
its south front has a glorious open view across Wensleydale.
The house is mid-18th century, and the main with Corinthian columns is its
finest feature. It would make a good base for grouse shooting, perhaps on
the Askrigg where only the sporting rights and a keeper's cottage are for
sale. The price of Pounds 825,000 from Lowther Scott-Harden works out at
around Pounds 1,700 a brace on a five-year average of 493 brace shot.
If you wish to live right beside the grouse, the ideal must be the
Gunnerside estate in Swaledale, with some of the most exciting beats in the
country. The heather on its 26,485 acres was disappearing thanks to
overgrazing by sheep. Lord Peel, the owner, has worked hard and successfully
to regenerate it, but a new, enthusiastic owner who loved shooting would
find that there was still plenty to do. Savills is looking for substantial
offers.
Or become a farmer. Buy a farming estate and, if you farm it for two years
(which can include contract farming on your behalf), you - or rather your
heirs - now qualify for 100 per cent inheritance tax relief. For let
farmland, it is 50 per cent. But it is unclear - and will remain so until
enough owners have died to create a case law - how the Inland Revenue will
balance the big house against the farming: one must be using the land to
make a profit. Even a sporting estate, if it is not for your fun alone, may
be exempt. So the more the land, the less the Revenue can say that the
farming is a tax ploy.
An estate that fits the bill admirably is Kingerby Hall, near Market Rasen,
in Lincolnshire. Around a white-painted 18th century big house, with lake
and stables, are 1,362 acres for arable farming and pigs. Bidwells' price of
Pounds 2.4m also includes three farmhouses, five cottages and the farm
buildings. It is too large a proposition to be mere tax avoidance.
Bidwells, Cambridge 0223-841 842; Carter Jonas, York 0904- 627 436;
Jackson-Stops, Chester 0244-328 361, and Darlington 0325-489 948; Knight

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (18): Bargain hunters back
on the road - Investing in classic cars / Prices have stalled, but the
cheaper end of the market is revving up again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pain of burned fingers is still being endured by many who invested in
the classic and exotic car boom of the late 1980s.
Throughout this year some dispiriting dramas have been played out in the
salerooms of Brooks, Coys, Christies and other of the principal auction
houses through which a large percentage of the world's more valuable and
interesting cars changes hands.
Owners of many cars bought near the peak of the boom in 1989 have seen
values plummet to levels they would not have thought possible.
In 1989, the 'middle market' of collectibles, embracing a multitude of
Ferraris, Aston Martins, gull-wing Mercedes, SS Jaguars and other minor
exotica, spanned a price range of Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 700,000. Today,
those same cars will fetch between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 125,000.
The top end of the market has frequently fared little better. In 1989, Aston
Martin DBR2/2, one of the illustrious Le Mans 24-Hours racing cars of the
1950s, went under the hammer at Brooks for Pounds 2.1m. In June of this
year, at the Brooks sale during the Earl of March's festival of speed at
Goodwood, bidding on its DBR2/1 sister car - in better condition and with an
even greater racing pedigree - sputtered to a halt at Pounds 840,000. The
car remained unsold.
But it's not all bad. The cheaper end of the market - that is, up to Pounds
20,000 - has become quite active again. And, in the middle market,
bargain-hunters have already reappeared in some numbers to mop up cars
reluctantly being sold by owners no longer able to withstand pressure from
their bankers - or by the banks themselves liquidating debtors' assets.
Auction house principal Robert Brooks and his colleagues acknowledge readily
that those who came to the classic-car market in the late 1980s strictly as
speculators will never be back. Nor do they expect to experience within the
forseeable future a repetition of the late 1980s bubble - 'prices were
crazy,' acknowledges Brooks.
But what the current situation does mean is that there is now plenty of
scope for wealthy individuals to indulge an enthusiasm for classic and
exotic cars, without necessarily having to pay a financial penalty for such
enthusiasm - and with at least some prospect of long-term gain.
A well-chosen chosen 'stable' of cars, bought now, as most sectors of the
classic market continue slowly to lift off the market bottom, is certain to
sustain modest value gains over the coming years.
As an example, such a stable is quite likely to include the Jaguar E-Type,
one of the most popular classics and a public sensation when it was launched
in the early 1960s as the first fairly affordable 150mph sports car.
While the prices bubble was still growing, many E-Types had Pounds
50,000-Pounds 60,000 spent on them, to bring them up to concours condition,
in the expectation by their owners that they would achieve Pounds
100,000-plus in the auction rooms.
Such cars are typically being sold for around Pounds 30,000, and by almost
any measure must be accounted a bargain if the restoration work has been
done well.
At more exalted levels, Brooks insists there is even the prospect of
substantial gains for those prepared and financially able to invest
strategically at the very top end of the market - a commitment admittedly
requiring the expenditure of several millions at least.
'If someone is prepared to make a collection of 30-40 cars, buy only the
very, very best and take an eight-to-10 year view, then I cannot think that
an investor would lose,' he maintains.
This, however, is to view the investor once again as dispassionate
speculator. Those professionally involved with the classic and historic cars
would maintain that, for such investments to make full sense, the cars
themselves must be used and enjoyed, not stashed away in a heated
motor-house.
The auction houses that dominate this esoteric trade - only around a quarter
of sales are believed to be accounted for by private treaty - are well to
the fore in promoting their use.
Coys, the Kensington-based auction house, backs the annual International
Historic Festival of Speed at Silverstone in July, where hundreds of such
cars are raced and otherwise put through their paces.
Brooks is a backer of the Earl of March at the Goodwood festival.
Neither puts up the funding out of unalloyed enthusiam - both events provide
a showcase for simultaneous auctions, and a reason for potential buyers to
converge from all around the globe in what is now unquestionably an
international market.
But the occasions do provide the proof that many owners are indeed getting
much more out of their investment than a financial return.
The sector could have provided a more appropriate alternative for a wealthy
group of individuals who asked a US investment banker, in the late 1970s,
whether they should invest in the ill-fated DeLorean sports-car project.
Back came the reply that they should put the money into wine and women
instead - 'You'll get the same return and have a lot more fun.'
Over a decade, even the few DeLoreans made have been appreciating slowly.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sicilian sizzlers to sample - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sicily, with its delightfully obvious and unblemished reminders of Greek,
Roman, Moorish, Norman and Spanish invasions, is so bewitching that it even
managed to bewitch this determinedly greedy traveller at a time when it had
practically no wine of interest and a cuisine in complete thrall to the
tomato.
In the mid-1980s I spent 10 days on the island before finding a memorable
bottle, an early vintage of Regaleali's most serious red, Rosso del Conte, a
deep, dark, essence with such a dangerously high alcohol level it should not
have been allowed in the businessmen's lunch place in which we finally
tracked down some interesting food and wine.
The island has in recent times turned its back on its classical reputation
as a wine producer and has instead made much of its distance from Brussels.
For many years the noble and historic wine of Marsala, once the island's
pride, has been ignored at the expense of playing the lucrative European
game of subsidies and grants.
In the 1980s the island was frequently producing about 4 per cent of the
world's entire wine production, but as demand for French basic vin de table
has plummeted, so has demand for Sicilian wine to strengthen it.
Things seem to be looking up, however, to judge from a recent sampling of
some of the island's best bottlings and experimental wine styles.
My old friends at Regaleali seem to have done a bit of comparative tasting
in the intervening years and have consequently tamed the beast. Their Rosso
del Conte 1989 blend of Nero d'Avola and Perricone grapes is no less intense
but considerably less of an assault now that it is matured in new oak rather
than traditional chestnut casks. Its stated alcohol content, 13.5 per cent,
still makes it an unsuitable prelude to an important business decision, but
its savoury, concentrated character well qualify it to celebrate one.
Valvona &amp; Crolla of Edinburgh stock this famous Sicilian red at Pounds 10.89
a bottle, while its white counterpart, Nozze d'Oro 1992 is Pounds 9.89 and
should also be available at WT Palmer of Oxford.
Nozze d'Oro's label sports a family photograph of the happy couple, Giuseppe
and Franca Tasca d'Almerita, celebrating their golden wedding on the label
and is a seriously interesting, discreetly oak-aged blend of Sicily's
Inzolia grape with a local speciality, Tasca, grown at the high altitudes
which keep the island's best grapes lively.
A range of experimental wines made at the government's experimental Cantina
di Microvinificazione just outside Palermo provided further evidence that
Inzolia (sometimes called Ansonica) is one of the island's under-realised
treasures. It is full, nutty and characterful, can obviously withstand oak
ageing, and the island's winemakers have more than 30,000 acres of it to
play with.
Catarratto, another white grape, is Sicily's most planted grape variety by
far, and is the chief ingredient in the prettily packaged Terre di Ginestra.
The 1993 is still gently floral and has some nice fruit in the middle but
seems more vapid than some of its predecessors.
Nero d'Avola is clearly a great red wine resource for the island, bringing
depth, concentration and longevity to many a blend. A much less expensive
way to taste its handsome influence than the Count's heady red, is Safeway's
exclusive Nero d'Avola-dominated blend at just Pounds 3.55. This vino da
tavola started off life on the Safeway shelf somewhat mysteriously called
Don Giovanni, 1991. The next shipment will be called simply Casa di
Giovanni. Decanting is recommended.
But the two most encouraging wines in the recent tasting, as is so often the
case, are not in commercial distribution. A cask-aged wine made from last
year's Nerello Mascalese grapes by producers Castiglione was charmingly
sprightly in much the same way as a flirtatious young red burgundy, while a
Moscato di Noto, a wine type on the verge of extinction like so many of the
island's once-famous sweet wines, showed that Sicily could easily seize the
Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise market.
Time for another tour of Agrigento and Ragusa.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Rail strike blues - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having experienced a better first half of the year than anticipated - and
most restaurateurs are born optimists - the London trade suffered in July
and August. Hot weather meant many people stayed out of town and conditions
were further damaged by the rail strike, which is still hurting trade.
At the top end of the market, business is good with overseas visitors
appreciating both British chefs and the weak pound. One leading chef told me
that his restaurant was booked for dinner for the next three weeks and he
was, unfortunately, having to turn away 50 to 60 customers a day.
The competition increases with some new openings in the capital: the Gaucho
Grill for Argentine-sized steaks in Swallow Street, W1 (071-734 4040) and
the more intimate Delicious Blue, a bar with a restaurant attached in Beak
Street, W1 (071-287 1840). The Establishment has now opened at No 1
Gloucester Road, SW7 (071-589 7969) and Avenue West Eleven at 157 Notting
Hill Gate, W11 (071-221 8144). Two Soho restaurants have opened branches in
the City: The French House team has opened St John, at 26 St John Street,
EC1 (071-251 0848) and Gopal's has a second branch at 89 Great Eastern
Street, EC2 (071-729 4218).

FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Catching up with Europe - Great British Eating
/ When in Stonehenge try the rock cakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone visiting Britain after an interval of even a few years cannot help
but notice the marked change in attitudes to food: supermarket shelves
filled with bottles of virgin cold-pressed olive oil and pots of own-label
creme fraiche; food and cookery programmes on every television channel and
young British born and trained chefs at the stoves of brasseries,
restaurants and hotels.
In all of this the UK is finally catching up with the rest of Europe and if,
gastronomically, Britain is not quite the equal of France or Italy yet, the
rate of improvement is marked.
But the range of locations in which good food can be bought is now perhaps
even more striking than the quality of the meals. In the last 20 years many
castles, stately homes, lighthouses, churches, chapels and coach houses have
been adapted to serve food to the public.
There are several reasons for this. Imaginative caterers such as Michael
Milburn, Justin de Blank and Johnathan Silver saw the potential of these
locations. At the same time, the owners and governing bodies of the sites,
such as the National Trust, English Heritage or the Church of England needed
to generate extra revenue.
Caterers and site owners were helped by the growing realisation that good
food does not mean complicated cooking. It can be simple, using local
ingredients, thoughtfully prepared and courteously served. This approach has
helped to reduce many of the logistical problems that confront caterers in
these locations, particular in old buildings.
Thirty-six such venues - good examples of how this type of catering has
developed in Britain - are listed in a leaflet entitled 'Eat at Cathedrals &amp;
Churches' compiled by Lesley Bridge, catering manageress at St Albans Abbey,
Hertfordshire, AL1 1BY. (The leaflet is free but please enclose a stamped,
addressed envelope - it is also available from any British Tourist Authority
office.)
Bridge took on this role 12 years ago when the abbey's governing body
decided to try to re-establish the role of host and provider which the monks
used to fulfil in days gone by.
This has proved such a success that by last year catering, book and gift
shops earned Pounds 30,000 for the abbey, a quarter of its annual income.
This leaflet highlights the wide range of food on offer. For example, in
London, Pizza Express operates in Southwark Cathedral's chapter house
(071-378 6446) and Bill Sewell's vegetarian restaurants are at The Place
Below, St Mary-Le-Bow, EC2 (071-329 0789) and the Saint Marylebone Cafe
(071-935 6374). At one of the few locations open in the capital in the
evening, there is live music in the Cafe in the Crypt at St Martin-in-the
Fields, WC2 (071-839 4342) on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings.
Gloucester Cathedral, in contrast, offers medieval rooms for private parties
while in Hereford Cathedral you can eat in a 13th century bishop's cloister.
Catering has become a significant source of income for the National Trust
and English Heritage. Last year the National Trust's catering division
contributed Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 11m. Catering concessions at
English Heritage earned almost Pounds 200,000.
I recently spent a morning in one of English Heritage's busiest catering
operations, The Stonehenge Kitchen. This is situated in a bunker-like 32 sq
m kitchen in the underpass that leads to the standing stones on Salisbury
Plain. The site receives 700,000 visitors a year and is home to that most
unusual confectionery, the Megalithic Rock Cake.
I came away full of admiration for the staff - not so much for their
culinary prowess as for their eagerness to look after and please their
visitors, and their unabashed pride in their famous landmark.
More significant was the realisation that in rural areas such as Wiltshire,
catering is one of the few industries capable of offering new job
opportunities. When plans for the site by Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of
English Heritage, are implemented, the restaurant at Stonehenge will be on
one of the most remarkable sites in the world.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Vegetarian food 'terrorism' - Giles MacDonogh,
a committed carnivore, leafs through some veggie cookbooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A couple of years ago I received a copy of a letter sent out to secondary
school teachers by the Vegetarian Society. Its aim was to encourage teachers
to get their pupils to give up meat.
It struck me as being particularly pernicious; an attempt to set children
against their parents. I do not doubt that similar letters have been sent to
primary school teachers, who exercise considerable power when it comes to
the infantile mind.
Beside me is a pile of recently published books on vegetarian food. Two of
the authors abandoned meat-eating in infancy. Rose Elliot (The Classic
Vegetarian Cookbook, Dorling Kindersley, Pounds 14.99) saw her mother
manhandle a fish when she was three, and never ate meat again. Peter Cox
(Encyclopedia of Vegetarian Living. Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99) stopped at two.
It is hardly a sign of precocity to hate meat as a child: 'I don't like that
mummy,' is what they generally say. Left to their own devices children would
subsist on sweets and crisps. Nor are they fond of greens. Even vegetarian
parents are reduced to ruses to get their children to eat vegetables.
Carnivorous parents do the same with meat.
For Peter Cox vegetarianism has all the appearance of a particularly austere
religious order. This self-abnegation is one of its least attractive
characteristics - along with the sanctimonious tone adopted by some of its
converts.
Austere men are often dangerous: Cromwell, Robespierre, Mussolini and
Hitler, for example. The first two derived no joy from food, the last two
were vegetarians. Hitler's vegetarianism is supposed to have been influenced
by his fondness for animals. 'The only two creatures who have remained loyal
to me,' he sobbed in the Bunker, 'are Eva Braun and my (Alsatian) bitch
Blondi.' That didn't prevent him from trying out the cyanide first on Blondi
before using it on Eva and himself.
Cox and Hitler share a trait: they both believe the future belongs to
vegetarians. 'I have news for meat-eaters,' Hitler told his tablemates, 'in
the future everyone will be vegetarian.'
Cox is ready for this ugly comparison. He cites a number of vegetarian
authors who deny Hitler's membership of the order. Hitler is supposed to
have expressed a fondness for Bavarian sausages. This proves little: Hitler
always said his favourite composer was Wagner, when in reality it was the
Hungarian Lehar. He had to tend to his Germanic image and few Germans, then
or now, would have understood a hater of sausages. Cox then cites a passage
of Oswald Spengler and 'rests his case'. But Spengler hated the Nazis and
wanted nothing to do with them.
Cox agrees that vegetarianism is not a western tradition. There are plenty
of vegetarian cultures around the world. I ate a Jain meal in India and
positively enjoyed south Indian vegetarian food. But here in the west we
neither worship nor despise animals, we simply eat them. Indeed, I wondered
whether Cox loves animals as much as he says given his desire to turn cats
and dogs into vegetarians.
What vegetarians have failed to do so far is convincingly to adapt
vegetarianism to the western tradition; to create a viable gastronomy. Rose
Elliot might propose a gratin dauphinois, but for a Frenchman this is a dish
requiring some slivers of rare lamb. It is not a meal in itself.
For Judith Wills (Slim and Healthy Vegetarian, Conran Octopus, Pounds 16.99)
vegetarianism is a means to an end: slimness. By slim she means more
attractive. But giving up meat for vanity's sake is a double-edged sword:
you become more attractive only to other vegetarians. It is pretty hard to
tuck into a piece of meat with a vegetarian; it is a bit like having a drink
with a teetotaller, or lighting up in front of a reformed smoker.
Both Christine McFadden (New Vegetarian Food, Salamander, Pounds 12.99) and
Annie Bell (Evergreen, Bantam, Pounds 16.99) are refreshingly unwilling to
proselytise, and the latter laudably tells us that vegetarian food should be
'fresh, sensual and alive . . . Being a vegetarian should not automatically
mean a denial of pleasurable foods, or an acceptance of unpalatable ones.'
Sadly neither author gives us much to chew on; and Christine McFadden's
language is unpalatable. For her 'minted', 'parsleyed' and 'herbed' are
adjectives; and she confuses the adjective 'roast' with the past participle
of the verb to roast: 'roasted'.
Annie Somerville (Fields of Greens, Bantam, Pounds 17.99) reminds us that
Californian vegetarianism is still inspired by the flower-power Buddhism of
the 1960s.
Which leaves the food terrorist Peter Cox. Not for nothing are his initials
PC: vegetarianism is 'the world's healthiest, kindest and most
environmentally-sound lifestyle'. Cox looks forward to the day when 'animal
exploitation and slaughter are as obsolete as sending children up chimneys'.
We meat-eaters have little to commend us: obese and unhealthy; cruel and
insensitive, even our excrement smells nastier than vegetarian excrement. In
Cox's view of history Adam and Eve only began to eat meat once they had left
Paradise. He forgets they were expelled for eating an apple.
You might look for a long time to find anything appetising in the pages of
Cox. This is not a book about pleasure, nor does he care for the freedom of
the individual to choose his own way. He tilts directly at one of our great
claims to civilisation: the western table and the way it has evolved over
the past 300 years.
Cox suggests that as good primates we are not natural meat-eaters. But we
are not good primates, else we would still be living in trees. We are
sophisticated animals in both the good and the bad sense of the word.
Western man lives to eat. Refreshingly few of us are reduced to eating to
live.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (17): The sport of
commoners - Investing in a racehorse / Michael Thompson-Noel bought two
shares in a racing syndicate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At York racecourse on August 17, the pulsating finish to the Gimcrack Stakes
provided a textbook study of the dramas and uncertainties on which the sport
 -and business - of horse racing are based.
The Gimcrack is a race for two-year-old colts and geldings. It is a
prestigious affair: the winning owner is invited to make a speech at the
famous Gimcrack dinner later in the year. And it is well worthwhile
financially: Pounds 61,537.80 to the winner this year, Pounds 22,690.20 to
the second, Pounds 10,820.10 to the third, down to Pounds 568.65 to the
sixth.
As this year's Gimcrack boiled to a climax, the race seemed at the mercy of
the well-fancied Fallow, which cost 26,000 guineas when bought as a yearling
in Ireland last year. (At British and Irish racehorse auctions, prices are
expressed, archaically, in guineas. A guinea used to be a pound and a
shilling - Pounds 1.05 - so Fallow cost its owner IPounds 27,300 in the
auction ring).
Before the Gimcrack, Fallow had had six races, winning three of them and
amassing prizemoney earnings of Pounds 36,885. In the Gimcrack, Fallow
breezed into the lead authoritatively and appeared to have the race at his
mercy.
But then, with a burst of acceleration that the pundits found astonishing,
another runner swooped and snatched first prize. This was Chilly Billy,
which had cost 20,000 (English) guineas as a two-year-old at auction but
lined-up for the Gimcrack with an inferior record to Fallow's. Before the
Gimcrack, Chilly Billy had raced three times without winning. It had
finished third once (admittedly at Royal Ascot). Its prizemoney prior to
York: Pounds 3,245.
Not surprisingly, Fallow started as a 5-1 co-favourite while Chilly Billy
was out with the washing at 12-1. Not that Chilly Billy was totally
unfancied. In the hours before the race he had been backed to win some large
sums. Close to home, though, Chilly Billy looked squeezed for room on the
rail and incapable of storming through.
At that moment - say 150 yards from the finishing post - you might have
concluded that Fallow was a star of the future, and might have been happy to
buy him, in that split second, for Pounds 500,000 (let us say) or even more.
Chilly Billy, on the other hand, might have struck you as an unlucky sort of
horse worth (for the sake of argument) not much more than his purchase price
last year.
How wrong you would have been. A narrow gap suddenly opened for him and
Chilly Billy flew towards the finishing line with such naked speed that it
is Chilly Billy, not Fallow, that is now worth many times his purchase
price.
This often happens in racing, though it would be an unwise man who slapped
down Pounds 20,000 or more at the yearling sales in the belief that
racehorses are an everyday investment. They are a gamble. They are not an
extremely long-odds gamble, like a lottery ticket, but they cost so much to
buy, train and race that very few show a profit or come close to covering
their costs.
In Britain, annual training and racing costs vary from about Pounds 12,000
to perhaps Pounds 20,000 a year if your horse is stabled with a star
trainer, while prizemoney is low (27 per cent of prizemoney is contributed
by owners themselves, via race entry fees).
But things are improving - a little. Prizemoney in Britain has perked up a
bit recently. And - importantly for owners - VAT arrangements have been
reformed, so that owners can claim back the 17.5 per cent VAT on horse
purchases and other racing costs.
To spread their risks, more and more owners are joining partnerships or
syndicates. This lowers costs greatly, but it does not reduce the gamble.
For instance, I could never afford to buy a Fallow or a Chilly Billy. But in
the spring of 1987 I bought two shares in a syndicate called Newmarket
Thoroughbred Racing and Chasing (NTRC), at Pounds 395 each. All told, NTRC
raised Pounds 309,285 from the public. Of that, only Pounds 147,149 was
spent on buying racehorses.
From 80 races, our prizemoney was a mere Pounds 17,198. Training fees
swallowed Pounds 69,017. Other biggish sums went on management fees, horse
transport, entry fees, VAT, secretarial and office expenses, start-up and
marketing costs, legal and professional charges - what have you.
By the time NTRC was wound-up, there was very little money left. There had
been a whirlwind of activity - horses coming and going, hopes rising and
falling. Our horses had run 80 times, but none had been remotely in the
class of Fallow or Chilly Billy. At the end, I received a tiny pay-off
cheque from the syndicate's Newmarket organisers: so far as I recall, less
than Pounds 40.
Did I enjoy myself? The answer, quite inevitably, would have to be yes and
no. Perhaps more no than yes.

FT  17 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: Pick your cotton for nights of linen luxury
 -Lucia van der Post hails a growing emphasis on synthetic-free bedding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All those addicted to antique linen and who cannot pass those magic words
'antique market' without feeling compelled to start ruffling through the
shelves will fall with joy upon Francoise de Bonneville's The Book of Fine
Linen, which could easily become the addict's manual.
It is a homage to the subtle sense of luxury that crisp white sheets and
soft blankets can convey, to the sense of security that comes from having
piles of sweetly-scented, freshly-laundered linen neatly stacked in the
cupboard.
These pleasures are once again accessible to all but the most impoverished.
Habitat, for instance, sells only 100 per cent cotton bed linen. And now,
for sophisticates, there are crisply-styled absolutely plain white sheets
and duvets, there are cool checks for those who hanker for a plain-Jane New
England look and there are plain natural dye bed linen sets for those who
prefer their linen coloured. And all this comes at astonishingly reasonable
prices - double duvet covers about Pounds 65, standard pillowcases, Pounds
12.50, square pillowcases, Pounds 15.
Marks and Spencer is still, on the whole, addicted to its cotton and
polyester mixes (its customers no doubt hooked on ease of care) but in its
latest mail order brochure it does offer an absolutely plain white
embroidered set of 100 per cent cotton duvet (Pounds 43 single, Pounds 53
double) and Oxford-style pillowcases for Pounds 13 each. The very plain 100
per cent cotton Jacquard bedspread in pure white is exceedingly nice and
costs just Pounds 60.
Ikea, too, has gone for nothing but 100 per cent cotton in its bed linen
range and seems able to offer it at the best of all prices - crisp New
England blue and white checks with single duvet cover sets starting at
Pounds 14.
In the past few years, however, a number of specialist companies have sprung
up offering more exclusive ranges. Damask has been until now an entirely
mail order company (write to Units 7 &amp; 10, Sullivan Enterprise Centre,
Sullivan Road, London SW6 for a brochure, sending Pounds 2.50 which is
refundable when you spend over Pounds 25) but in mid-October it will be
opening a shop at 3-4 Broxholme House, New King's Road, London SW6.
It offers an unashamedly nostalgic look with white woven cotton bedspreads,
gentle patchworks, faded prints or crisp checks and an especially attractive
set of designs for the nursery, and nightdresses with plenty of
old-fashioned innocent charm. The full-cover brochure shows the range
beautifully and the collection can still be bought by mail. Prices are good
 -hand-quilted patchwork bedspreads cost Pounds 155 for a double size
(215cms by 240cms), woven cotton bedspreads starting at Pounds 46 for a
single size and finely embroidered duvet covers starting at Pounds 34.
Those who prefer a crisper, more contemporary look should look out for
Turquaz - in bold checks, plaids and stripes. The collection uses nothing
but 100 per cent hand-loomed cotton from India. There is, of course, the
ubiquitous selection of blue and white checks but there are yellows, browns,
greens, greys as well as colour combinations. Like most of the more
up-to-the-minute ranges, it offers square, buttoned pillow-cases as well as
the standard oblongs. Stocked by Peter Jones, Liberty and the John Lewis
stores, prices start at about Pounds 12 for a buttoned Oxford pillow case
and Pounds 50 for a single duvet cover.
Cologne &amp; Cotton which some readers may remember offers a limited but
charming and very affordable range of pure white and checked bed linen
started with a single shop in Leamington Spa but it, too, now has a London
flagship at 791 Fulham Road, London SW6.
For those looking for the ultimate in duvets I recommend a brand called
Brinkhaus. At the top of its range are finest white Hungarian goose down
filled duvets, covered in 100 per cent combed Egyptian cotton batiste, each
cover stitched in small squares to keep the filling evenly spread. These do
not come cheap - the largest size, 260cms by 220cms is Pounds 680 but it
does have a very high 12.5 tog rating (a tog is the industry measurement for
warmth).
Those who have found duvets impossibly hot this summer might like to know
that Brinkhaus does a lightweight summer silk and cotton covered version
(6.5 tog rating and the cover is again stitched into small squares) at
Pounds 210 for the largest size. The Brinkhaus range can be found at
Harrods, John Lewis, and House of Fraser stores.
The free brochure showing the full range is available from The French Linen
Company, Unit 7, The Vale Industrial Centre, Southern Road, Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire HP19 3EW.
The Book of Fine Linen, published originally by Flammarion, is distributed
in the UK by Thames &amp; Hudson. 208 pages, Pounds 30.

FT  17 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: Forever in fashion - Styles change but
fiances still give diamonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is nice to know that the ancient rite of the engagement ring, that
abiding token that He gives to Her when his intentions are honourable, is
still going strong. According to de Beers 96 per cent of brides receive an
engagement ring of some sort. (What, I wonder, happens to the other 4 per
cent and are their marriages any the worse for all that?)
Of that 96 per cent, de Beers reports that more than three quarters include
a diamond.
Of course the matter of getting engaged these days is not approached with
the same solemnity as it was in times gone by. EF Cushing summed up the
prevailing attitudes of the day in an essay he wrote in 1926 on Culture and
Good Manners in the US. 'An engagement ring is a matter for serious thought
on the part of the young man. The best that his pocket can afford is what he
desires and a ring that will please his fiancee's taste is even more
important. Either by asking her directly or from someone who knows her
preferences he finds out her desire and tries in every way to fulfil it. The
solitaire diamond as large and perfect as he could afford has for many years
been the standard engagement ring.'
The days when Richard Burton gave Elizabeth Taylor the 33 carat emerald-cut
Krupp diamond ('I've never been so left-handed in my life,' declared la
Taylor) seem to belong to a vanished world but nevertheless those who can
afford it still seem to like their diamonds large.
Claudia Schiffer, one of the jet-set breed of so-called super models is
sporting a flawless five carat brilliant-cut diamond designed by Bulgari
bought for her by her fiance, magician David Copperfield. When David Bowie
married Iman he gave her a wonderful canary yellow emerald-cut diamond with
two white triangular diamonds either side. Cindy Crawford has a diamond-set
gold band from Richard Gere.
Among the bright young things, the fad ring is Cartier's Ellipse - a thick
yellow 18 carat gold band, it costs Pounds 995 when set with semi-precious
stones and Pounds 21,200 when set with a 1.5 carat solitaire diamond. When
the engagement follows its proscribed course and ends at the altar, then a
plain thick yellow wedding ring can be added to make a matching pair.
On average, British men are really rather mean. The average price paid is
about Pounds 350. De Beers suggests that a young man these days ought to
think in terms of spending about a month's salary (in Japan the average is
about three months salary and in America two months) - after all think what
a girl spends on a wedding dress which she wears merely for half a day
whereas the ring is meant to last forever.
A collection of 60 diamond rings by some of Britain's best designers,
ranging in price from Pounds 835 to Pounds 5,000 is on display at Jess
James, 3 Newburgh Street, London W1.
The really tricky thing is what do you do when love turns sour. For those
who mind about correct behaviour the rule is: if He breaks it off, She gets
to keep it. If She breaks it off, then strictly speaking she should return
it. But you could, I suppose, always follow the advice of the inimitable Zsa
Zsa Gabor. When asked by a friend whose engagement had been broken off if
she should return the ring, she replied 'by all means give back the ring -
just make sure you keep the diamond'.
Diamond Engagement Ring Collection is on at Jess James until September 22.
It moves to Hamilton &amp; Inches in Edinburgh from September 23 to October 3
then to Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Chester, Bedford, Aberdeen,
Lichfield, Blackpool, Bath and back to London

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (16): Be sure it's the
best then wait 10 years - Investing in wine / If you know what you're doing,
it can still make sense to buy a good vintage early, pause until it's ready,
then sell half and drink the rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If you are very rich you must, on occasions, have something to celebrate,
and then your thoughts will descend to your cellar. A decent bottle of wine
is a natural accompaniment to a privileged life.
There was a period in the 1980s when wine got caught up in an investment
frenzy. Everyone was hooked on the idea that, by judicious buying, you could
drink for nothing. Just acquire the best vintages early and, by the time
they were ready for consumption, sell half the stock at a profit and drink
the rest for free.
This wonderful idea holds true - just. But you must be knowledgeable, and be
prepared to wait 10 years at least. And you must buy the best. If you bought
Mouton-Rothschild, a first growth claret and one of the most desirable of
wines, in 1982 you might have paid Pounds 500 for a case. You can sell this
wine at auction now for around Pounds 1,500 a case - if you can bear to let
it go.
Many investors paid over the odds for indifferent vintages and were caught
by the recession, which hit the wine market hard in 1991. This year, prices
have increased slowly but steadily at auction - where many serious buyers
acquire their supplies - and prospects look good for the autumn season. With
surplus cash earning little interest stuck in a bank, investing in blue-chip
wines is becoming attractive again.
Some wines have already shot ahead, especially the touted claret, Cheval
Blanc. A case of 1982 was Pounds 800 a year ago and now sells for nearer
Pounds 1,500. Christie's, which sold wine to the value of almost Pounds 9m
last season, recently offered five cases of 1947 Cheval Blanc, placing an
estimate of Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000 on the lot. It sold for Pounds
18,000.
This is exceptional, although demand for the best wines, which basically
means top growth clarets and a few select burgundies, has certainly
strengthened in the past year. In the same auction, Christie's designed a
ready-made cellar of 195 cases of the finest wines. It carried an estimate
of Pounds 200,000-Pounds 300,000 and sold for Pounds 340,000.
The wine experts are free with their advice. Serena Sutcliff, of Sotheby's,
recommends the great vintages of the 1980s, in particular 1986, 1988 and
1990. A case of Mouton Rothschild 1990 might cost up to Pounds 600 (Latour
and Margaux slightly less), but when it is ready for drinking in the early
years of the Third Millennium it should be superb, and much more costly. She
also recommends the top Sauternes of 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, which can be
acquired for around Pounds 200 a case. The finest white wine of al,l Chateau
D'Yquem, is in a different price class: Pounds 900 for a case of 1986.
Serena Sutcliff also recommends vintage ports, especially the 1977, the best
vintage since 1963. A case of Taylor only costs Pounds 150.
If you want to celebrate now, you will have to pay much more for your wine.
The market should receive a tremendous lift in October when changes in the
local laws allows, for the first time, wine auctions to be held in New York.
At its first sale, on October 8, Sotheby's is offering a bottle of 1945
Latour, a truely great wine, for around Dollars 900 (Pounds 580). If this
seems a modest outlay, try bidding for a wine produced before the Phylloxera
disease ravaged Bordeaux, a magnum of 1870 Lafite which had once been in the
cellar of Glamis Castle. It carries an estimate of up to Dollars 20,000.
A decade ago, there was great interest in exotic old wines, especially from
the Americans. But doubts about authenticity, to say nothing of the dubious
drinking qualities of most 19th century wines, hit this market hard. Few
serious drinkers will buy wines produced earlier than 1945, and for a decade
or so after then only the top clarets stay in their prime.
Along with the first and second growth clarets, Paul Bowker of Christie's
sees potential in the best burgundies. In the past Romanee-Conte dominated
the burgundies. Now a run of good vintages in the 1980s, in particular 1983,
1985, 1986, 1989, and 1990, has increased interest in, and the value, of
these wines, raising first growths to Pounds 500 a case. The fact that the
vintages of recent years have been indifferent makes the burgundy of the
1980s a good wine for trading as well as drinking.
Of course, many people think that champagne is the wine for celebrations. It
has a much shorter life span than claret, and the French reckon that after
20 years even good champagnes are past their prime. Krug, Bollinger and Dom
Perignon are the most sought-after brands, with a mature champagne of the
late 1970s costing around Pounds 600 a case. But, as in all things, buy what
you enjoy, not what you think may appreciate.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Fashion: Hooked on simple Irish elegance - Jane Mulvagh
explains how the under-stated knitwear worn by fishermen inspired a
sought-after fashion range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Informal elegance these days is elusive, especially since few now pursue the
traditional pleasures of field sports which once supplied a panoply of
appropriate off-duty ensembles. Modern leisurewear seems polarised between
the uniformity of American cotton sportswear and the horrors of the nylon
shell suit.
But, since more of our time is being spent in casual dress, even in the
workplace, perhaps we should look beyond the confines of the locker room
and, instead of posing as athletes no matter what our physical condition,
find a relaxed informality without sweaty association.
Tarlach de Blacam, the owner of Inis Meain Knitwear, offers just such an
informal elegance. His knitwear is loosely inspired by the native dress of
the Aran Islands' fishing community, some 30 miles from the Galway coast.
As long ago as 1907 JM Synge admired the islanders' natural elegance. 'The
simplicity and unity of the dress,' he wrote, 'increases in another way the
local air of beauty.' De Blacam has tapped both the sense of design and the
knitting skills of the people on Aran to create bi-annual collections of
knitwear that look as beguiling on a Wall Street banker as on a fisherman.
Banish from your mind the notion of chunky, scratchy, shapeless fishermen's
jerseys sold in roadside tourist traps.
Instead, picture butter-soft alpacas and cashmeres for winter and linen-silk
mixes for the summer piled high on the shelves of exclusive department
stores, such as Liberty in London or Bergdoff Goodman in New York. Inis
Meain Knitwear is worn by discerning men and women from Tokyo to Capri.
The colours are inspired by the dry-stone walling on the Aran Islands.
Traditionally its men wore natural colours, indigos and slate greys, its
women, madder red and navy. To this de Blacam has added the tar-black of the
curragh hulls, the infinite blues of the glittering seas, the greeny-browns
of its saline weeds, and the myriad hues of the wild and rare flowers -
those shy, pointillist specks of colour sheltering from the salty sprays
between the limestone shards: gentian-blue, cranesbill purple, stone
bramble-vermilion, sea bindweed and mayflower pinks, and the singing yellow
of biting stonecrop.
De Blacam is a practical dreamer. He has fused the romanticised notions of
traditional celtic life, passed down to him by his grandfather, with the
opportunities of Japanese computer technology and the harsh financial
realities of the fickle fashion market.
'We have enormous disadvantages operating from this place - communications,
basic financial services, such as banking are all poor,' he explains.
Initially, knitwear was rowed to the mainland on a curragh before being
jetted around the world but now de Blacam has brought an aircraft service
(1975), as well as electricity (1978) and water (1981) to serve the island's
300 inhabitants. To meet all these costs and make enough profit to keep in
business he had to target the top end of the market and go for innovative,
high-quality design and rich raw materials. 'But apart from that,' says de
Blacam, 'if we just churned out old fishing knits I'd be bored stiff after a
week and give up]'
De Blacam taps the local skills of 22 employees, mostly women, from whom he
culls endless stitches and patterns handed down through the ages. And
because he is marketing direct from Inis Meain there is a good opportunity
to exploit and romanticise the story of knitting on the Aran Islands. 'But,'
he cautions, 'although the romance is a bonus it is the quality that sells
the product. The romance is just the sizzle on the sausage.'
Initially de Blacam, now in his 40s, was seen as a madman. 'The 1980s was
the decade of whizz kids in the big cities. All they wanted was suits and
labels.
'They did not know how to dress casually. Believe me, in the 1980s it was
difficult to sell our knits. It is only now in the 1990s that people see an
alternative way and have become environmentally convinced. Ireland is now
seen as very chic. To some extent, my time has come.'
Canniness led de Blacam to target the discerning and fashion-sensitive
Italian and German markets. 'Selling into Europe is a discipline and I
always guessed that if I could sell to them I could sell anywhere. Whereas,
in the English-speaking world, because you are Irish and a knitwear
manufacturer, you are perceived as ethnic-Irish and your knitwear as
bog-standard, so I had to make my name elsewhere.'
One myth that de Blacam is keen to dispel is that there is a resistance
among these isolated peoples to working in a modern way. Because of the
numerous failures among small industries in the west of Ireland, many of
which were subsidised by the EC or the Irish government, they are now seen
as high-risk areas.
'The workforce is always blamed. But in my opinion it's the management and
the sales team who are unable to cope with working from a remote location.
The workforce, believe me, is second to none.'
De Blacam and his wife and partner, Aine, have, in 20 years, created a
company producing 20,000 units a year with an annual turnover of Pounds 1m.
In the next year they intend to employ another 15 islanders and have stemmed
the tide of emigration.
'We've given the place a sense of belonging and something to contribute to
the world.
'The islanders are not a drag on the national or the European exchequer. We
make a contribution of about Pounds 100,000 a year to the exchequer and that
gives these people great pride and means they can stay where they belong
rather than having to go off to look for work.
'This means we can keep our society here better balanced and not, like many
Irish villages, filled with just the very young and the very old.'
One of the distinguishing features of the fiercely independent islanders is
that they were always, despite their poverty, immaculately dressed. Aine, a
native islander and niece of the island's poet, says: 'If you look at the
photos of the islanders during the numerous famines of the 19th century you
see that they were always extremely well turned out compared to the
mainland. The women were self-sufficient and made their own clothes with
great care and attention. Their menfolk and children always looked well.'
Tarlach and Aine have simply tapped into that sartorial pride and, as we
pass two fishermen coming from the beach wearing their Inis Meain jerseys,
he points out their innate elegance. 'They always go for the subtle,
single-colour ones. They know that the jazzy patterns are for the tourists.'
And, in turn, these are the very styles that Yohji Yamamoto, the Japanese
designer, has chosen for his next boutique collection which will be sold
under the I M label.
All jacket and cardigans cost between Pounds 180 and Pounds 190, jerseys
between Pounds 150 and Pounds 160 and waistcoats between Pounds 110 and
Pounds 120. Stockists include:
In the UK: Liberty of Regent Street, London W1; Harrods of Knightsbridge,
London SW1; and Simpson, Piccadilly, London W1.
US: Bergdoff Goodman, Barneys and Paul Stuart in NYC; Louis in Boston.
Italy: Top Ten, Turin; Giusto, Bologna; and Cantorelli, Perugia.
Japan: Ginza boutiques in Wako, Tokyo.
France: Aberdeen in Deauville and Alain Martiniere, Paris.
Ireland: Inis Meain, Aran Islands, Co Galway and Brown Thomas, Dublin.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (15): Buy it for love not
for money - Investing in art / Antony Thorncroft warns against expecting a
cash return from paintings, and cites the Pre-Raphaelites and Impressionists
in evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who buys pictures as an investment, rather than because they love
them as works of art, is unwise.
It is easy to say that now - when prices for paintings by many of the
acknowledged modern masters, Van Gogh, Renoir, Cezanne and more - have
fallen by around 40 per cent in the past four years.
But it has always been so. Apart from acknowledged masterpieces, which are
now mainly locked away in museums, changes in taste make investing in art a
perilous business. The example of the Pre-Raphaelites, which sold very
expensively in the late 19th century and for virtually nothing 50 years
later, is a warning for all.
Five years ago, the permanent status of the Impressionists seemed
unassailable; now the trade is not so sure. Every painting carries its own
individual price, but an important work by Renoir that might have been
estimated by Sotheby's or Christie's at Pounds 10m in 1989 would now be
fortunate to carry a Pounds 6m reserve.
A great painting by Van Gogh (one, a portrait of his physician, Dr Gachet,
made Dollars 82.5m, a record for any work of art, in 1990) would probably
carry an estimate of around Pounds 15m. A Cezanne still life might be marked
down from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4m - that is, if such paintings were offered
in the saleroom.
The global recession of the early 1990s, and in particular the problems in
Japan, brought the market for the best Impressionist and modern art to a
shuddering halt. The last auctions at the peak, in New York in the summer of
1990, brought in totals of Dollars 250m-plus. By 1994, Sotheby's and
Christie's were happy with auctions totalling Dollars 50m.
The frantic Japanese buying has completely disappeared, and American and
continental collectors are also more selective. Dealers have almost entirely
vanished from the scene at the top price levels. Worst of all, unless forced
to sell by the three great Ds - death, divorce and debt - few owners of
important paintings are anxious to expose them to the current weak demand in
the auction room. Instead, pictures are traded privately, although there are
relatively few deals being clinched. Many specialists do not expect the
prices of the top Impressionists and Moderns to return to the levels of 1989
before the end of the century.
The leading auction houses brought the volatility upon themselves by
encouraging new buyers to view art as an investment. They offered the new
rich, such as the Australian Alan Bond, loans to help them buy pictures. He
acquired Van Gogh's 'Irises' for Dollars 53.9m, but failed to maintain the
debt payments on it. Fortunately for all concerned the Getty Museum, at
Malibu, California, stepped in and bought the painting.
The auction houses are now more cautious, and loans are a thing of the past.
The market is slowly growing in confidence, but the main buyers are museums
and knowledgeable collectors. For example, the top price in the saleroom
during the 1993-94 season was the Dollars 13.75m paid at Sotheby's New York
in November for a 'difficult' painting, one of Matisse's 'cut-outs', an
adventurous form of art that he experimented with during his last years.
Of course, a weak market means that prices are low, with sought-after
artists trading at the price levels of around a decade ago. There are
bargains available. Experts were surprised that one of Braque's late
'Atelier' paintings, of around 1950, failed to sell at Christies' in June,
despite a low estimate of around Pounds 3m.
In 1992, in the depth of the recession, a painting from the same series made
Pounds 4.3m. It could be an opportunity was missed, but only someone well
versed in 20th century art history would have been attracted by the sombre,
brown, painting.
There are, of course, many sectors to the picture market. Old Masters have a
revered history, having been collected for almost 500 years. Their
condition, subject matter and scarcity make them unpopular with most
new-rich collectors, and the finest examples are in museums. The chance of
buying an oil by Raphael, Leonardo or Giorgione are nil.
However, paintings by some energetic artists, like Canelleto, the Brueghels
and Rubens, appear frequently, and the patina of history should enable them
to hold their value. Dutch 17th century art, especially still-lifes, have
always been popular with north European buyers, and the best examples would
probably prove a sound investment.
Anyone acquiring art, mainly out of interest, partly for decoration, but
with the hope of a reasonable return, should always buy the best examples
available by the established names, in sectors where there is wide
international interest. Dutch Old Masters fall into this category.
In the main, the British (and a few Americans) buy paintings by British
artists, which limits the possibilities of price expansion. Americans buy
American; Latin Americans, Latin Americans; and so on. As a nation grows
richer, so the prices of its best artists rise. American 19th century art,
and the post-War New York abstract expressionists, have done well in recent
years, with many artists breaking the Dollars 1m. barrier; and some, like
Pollock, Jasper Johns, and de Kooning, topping Dollars 10m; although today
their prices have almost halved. Latin American painters like Botero have
also shot ahead.
In the past two years, it is 20th century Chinese paintings, sought by the
collectors in the increasingly affluent mainland and Hong Kong Chinese, that
have set the market alight. But westerners would find it difficult to
appreciate this oriental approach to art. The most sensible advice remains
to buy what you like, but to try to like the best.
Anyone seeking more information on the shifting prices of individual artists
or particular schools could contact Art Market Research, 86, Stoke Newington
Church Street, London N16 0AS, where the rises and falls of the last decade
are tabulated.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Wild night on the loch - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most fishing is good, unmemorable fun. But there are two other categories of
experience: the hellish, when it becomes a torment, and certain days or
nights with a blessed quality that stamps them in the memory, like a seal on
hot wax.
In general, it is fortunate that there should be a balance between the
bloody and the miraculous. Were there too many of the former, we should have
to escape and take up something safer. An excess of the latter and we (well,
I) would soon shed humility and become smug.
It is also to the good that both should be rare. So, I am a little worried
for I have had two wonderful, indelible nights this summer - and no
immersions in the Slough of Despond. I feel catastrophe is lurking every
time I pull on my waders.
The first was on the Suir, in Ireland, and I have sung that song of triumph
already. The second belonged to a little loch in Inverness-shire with a
Gaelic name - a'Ghreidlein - as romantic and wild as its setting in the
hills that rise between the glens of Affric and Moriston. Its instigator was
a man with a twinkle about him, Kyle Laidlay of Tomlch.
What you need for this loch, he told us, is a night with no wind. And even
then, he cautioned, there could be no certainty for the trout of the loch
(pronounced Uretel) were unpredictable and contrary, and the season was
late. But they were big: some up to 7lb.
The night came and there was an excitement crackling between my friend
Stevie and I as we bounced up the track into the hills that hid the loch.
Kyle was waiting for us, as were the midges. Beneath us, the surface was
glass-smooth, except for the dimples of the trout.
A pale, brilliant full moon lit the sky as we clambered aboard the boat. A
tiny wind sprang from somewhere to ruffle the surface. There was no longer
any sign of rising fish.
The method was simple: a big, hairy sedge cast out, then retrieved in steady
pulls to create a highly visible wake on the water. Stevie was bubbling with
hope and expectation; I was dubious. But on my third or fourth cast, there
was a rush at my fly and the rod tip curved. It was not a big fish -
three-quarters of a pound or so - but it was a start and I too was caught up
in the excitement of the night.
I can still feel what it felt like to be there: the darkening, receding
shore; the moonbeams lighting the ripples left by the sedge; the slow push
of the oars; Kyle's soft, laughing voice speculating on vagaries of trout -
and increasing frenzy at the other end of the boat. For Stevie was into fish
after fish, each splash and fight accompanied by an explosive commentary on
his expertise as a master angler.
He had four, the last a tremendous, big-headed, bold-spotted creature of
well over 2lb. And, all that time, although we were fishing the same water
with identical flies, I had nothing.
On the stroke of midnight, soon after Stevie had yelled that he was
hyperventilating with the strain of it, a fish took me near the reeds in
quiet, resolute fashion. It fought like a hero, belying its weight (a little
under 1 1/2 lb) with the power of its runs.
With it duly netted, the quiet of finality settled on the loch. No more
would the fish rise that night and, suddenly, we realised how cold it had
become. Back on shore, we toasted the catch and then headed down the track,
leaving a'Ghreidlein with its secrets and its fish for another night.
The loch, and a crop of others just as lovely, can be fished by arrangement
with Kyle Laidlay. Tel: 0456-415352.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Gardening: Time to dally in dahlias - September is just
heavenly for gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have just been surveying autumn as it should be, spread out before us in
central London. The great autumn flower show in the Royal Horticultural
Society halls has none of the extravagance of Chelsea; on Tuesday and
Wednesday, it drew discerning crowds who knew they could not see these
exhibits under canvas in mid-May.
September is heaven in my horticultural book, especially when it alternates
between sun and rain. The older gardening authorities skate over this
excellent month, moving from buddleias to autumn colour with only a sideways
glance at Michaelmas daisies. But, in the past 10 years or so, its
horticultural scope has broadened beyond recognition.
If you miss the autumn shows, you are the sort of gardener who starts
thinking far too early about Christmas hyacinths. You are also one of the
class who runs a mile from dahlias.
No, I would not want them in an average small-town garden; yes, the dahlia
varieties in popular offers are frightful. But if you look for the best, you
see a depth of colour and shape which will lift a rural border out of autumn
rust and mildew.
At Powis castle, on the Welsh borders, they have no qualms about dahlias;
and anyone who saw yet another prize-winning show from Ayletts of
Hertfordshire this week will have vowed to follow Powis's example next
spring. The best varieties of dahlia have such remarkably clear colour and
well-defined flowers: Dahlia Charles Taylor was a front-runner this year
with scarlet flowers like an inward-curving paeony, while Vicky Crutchfield
remains a first choice among the pinks with flowers like waterlilies.
These prize dahlias are in a different league to those balls of mauve flower
which turn up among the French marigolds in the gardens of visual vandals.
The flowers are not lost in heaps of coarse leaves and they are not
impossibly shaggy.
There are six months until the season for starting new dahlias in April; but
if you want to prolong a border in September, and double up on cut flowers
and height, you cannot ignore the first-class forms in the family. Ayletts
itself is the tops although that authoritative guide, The PlantFinder, still
omits it.
Elsewhere, the way to civilise an autumn exhibit nowadays is to pack in the
crocosmias. Many of you already grow the bright crimson varieties of these
corms, especially the Lucifer variety which has long been an FT favourite.
Exhibitors now upstage it with the clear, soft yellow Solfatare, the flowers
of which beat the other commercial forms in shades of yellow and orange and
are matched enchantingly with the blue of aster King George or the blue and
silver-grey perovskias.
Bags of Solfatares were changing hands to keen visitors, but they ought to
remember that it is not the hardiest in the family and needs to be
top-dressed with a protective layer of debris from November until April.
This protection is worth the bother because this delightful form goes so
well with white anemones, early Michaelmas daisies and the first of the
autumn crocuses.
An autumn show faces in two directions: backwards, to the best of the
season's half-hardy plants in their final phases; and forward, to bulbs,
daisies and shrubs which will not go under at the first sign of frost. Among
the season's tender pot plants, I made yet another mental mark for the white
form of mimulus called Popocatepetl; this flowers profusely in pots and
sunny borders, having earned its reputation in California. Brian Hile in
Wallington, where London's far southern suburbs meet the M25, is one of the
few suppliers so far.
These evergreen mimulus are future stars for terrace and courtyard
gardening, and he helped me to understand the cause of their only failure.
Sometimes, a stem will go brown and die back, a fault which I have
attributed (wrongly) to over-fertilising. The real reason is that its faded
flowers have not been dead-headed, and fungus enters their stem if they turn
brown and are allowed to hang around.
Ten years ago, the only familiar form was the orange variety, which was so
famous as a centrepiece in the red and orange garden at Sissinghurst, Kent.
But we now have white, pale orange, lemon yellow and shades of pink waiting
to spread in frost-free seasons from America's west coast.
Among the frost-proof permanencies, the autumn bulbs are a spectacular
sight, reminding me not to overlook them when their catalogues turn up in
the rush of next spring. The best of all are the white colchicums, like huge
crocuses with no clothes on because they flower before the leaves.
The leaves appear in spring, usually to a bad press, but I now agree with
the keen eye of expert grower Graham Thomas who values them as a foil for
yellow daffodils against grass in early spring. The best variety is
Speciosum Album, although its price is a discouragement. A few bulbs go a
long way, and there is no question of needing to plant them with the same
profusion as the crocuses of spring.
The shrub growers had the luxury in their exhibits of pretending that the
drought had never existed. The hydrangeas looked fresh and newly-watered,
whereas mine have been burnt miserably along the edges of their leaves.
As often, the most ambitious stand came from Burncoose Nurseries of Redruth,
Cornwall, which continues to proclaim its fondness for despatching by mail
order. I would have sent away for its oak-leaved hydrangea Quercifolia on
sight, but I know that it is so much better in damper and deeper soil. A
show plant is fun, but misleading. The delicate aster Pink Monster looked
more accommodating and not at all monstrous, and I wish I could combine it
with those marginally hardy relations of mimosa which the nursery shows so
well.
At a different level of hardiness, you could have rounded off with a
remarkable array of hollies put on by the unstoppable Morris Mason from his
broad private acres near King's Lynn, Norfolk. Long before the season for
berries, he had collected a superb range of shining green and
beautifully-marked varieties, reminding us that nurserymen do not have the
monopoly on major families and that gardeners are still much too slow to
exploit what this family can offer.
The extremely spiny leaves of the various hedgehog varieties are best kept
as individual specimens, but his display of variegated forms of ilex
aquifolium reminded me of the elegance which we overlook because we are all
too afraid of prickles. The fresh, golden-yellow marking of forms like
Flavescens would please anyone.
Egged on by this autumn exhibit, I intend to use them to fill out and
brighten the places which need an evergreen but which will not suit anything
of doubtful hardiness. Whatever the winter throws at us, the hollies will
come through it, an idea from the autumn shows which will still be around in
subsequent summers.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (14): A-levels are the
gauge - Investing in education / Latest analysis suggests that
independent-school pupils enjoy a dramatic advantage, certainly at
sixth-form level
</HEADLINE>

With the exception of a house, the most serious investment many people ever
make is in an education for their children.
Sellers of financial products are good at producing frightening projections
for future school fees, following a decade in which fees inflated at an
average of more than 10 per cent each year. This has slowed considerably in
the past two years.
But even if more conservative assumptions on future fees inflation are made,
school education is a big bill. According to the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis), the average fee for a term at a boarding school
in the academic year just ended was Pounds 3,261. In Greater London it was
as high as Pounds 3,716.
The average day fee at a day school is much cheaper but, at Pounds 1,262 per
term, still rather more than most people can manage to pay out of their
regular income, particularly if they have several children.
Is it worth opting out of the state sector?
People have different reasons for choosing independent schools, many of them
intensely subjective and personal, and defying quantitative analysis. Nobody
has produced a league tables of schools' ethos, for example.
However, analysis of schools' public examination results, particularly
A-levels, is fast becoming more sophisticated. As the key measure used by
universities, A-levels are arguably the most important measure of a
secondary school's performance.
The FT's ranking of independent schools' A-level results is now into its
third year, and a demonstrable 'elite' of independent schools, firmly
embedded in each year's top ten, has already emerged.
These figures do not prove much in themselves. Most of the top schools are
either big-city day schools, which are able to select rigorously from a
large number of applications, or boarding schools of such immense fame -
like Eton and Winchester - that they can be guaranteed a wide range of
quality applications.
Parents with less able children who may not be up to these schools' rigorous
academic standards might be more interested to find somewhere which can 'add
value' to their children, or help them to get better results than they would
have managed otherwise.
One of the first attempts to assess a school's 'value-added', produced by
statisticians at the Department for Education, suggests strongly that
independent schools can improve children's A-level scores. It compared the
A-level point-scores that students achieved last year with the point-score
they had obtained in their GCSE exams two years earlier.
As might be expected, children who did well at GCSE were the most likely to
get good A-level grades. But the statisticians found that, regardless of a
pupil's achievements at GCSE, they were more likely to get good A-levels in
independent schools than they were at state schools.
For example, 42 per cent of the state school pupils achieving 70 or more
GCSE points (equivalent to 10 grade As) went on to get three or more grade
As at A-level. But this feat was managed by 61 per cent of independent
school pupils with similarly strong GCSEs.
At a less exalted level, 11 per cent of independent school pupils who had
only managed between 45 and 49 GCSE points - equivalent to about eight
B-grades - went on to score three As at A-level; while 56 per cent of them
managed at least 15 A-level points, usually good enough for a university
place.
In the state sector, only 1 per cent of pupils with GCSE scores in this
range went on to achieve three As or better at A-level, while only a quarter
managed 15 A-level points.
These figures suggested a dramatic advantage for independent school pupils,
and took even the independent sector itself by surprise. It is possible that
last year's performance will prove to be a fluke once the data has been
compiled for a few more years, but as it stands, the figures provide a
powerful case for independent education, at least at sixth-form level. With
each year that passes, academic league tables should become more useful
tools for parents as statistical methods are improved.
Is it possible to limit expenditure on fees?
First you should shop around schools, and, if you are confident you have
found the right one, make contact with the bursar as early as possible.
Readers of this survey are unlikely to qualify for the bursaries which many
schools offer to low-income families, but many schools have scholarships for
children with particular skills. Block payment plans, in which schools offer
a discount in return for payment of five or six years' fees in advance, are
also worth discussing.
Once you know the likely level of fees you will be paying, it is possible to
build a financial plan. The earlier you start planning, the broader the
range of options open to you.
Traditionally, school-fees planning centres on life assurance endowment
policies, as these have the advantage of a fixed-sum guaranteed. Parents can
have some confidence that their policy will grow sufficiently to pay the
fees.
However, life policies are inflexible, and carry high expense costs, and
they also require you to pay premiums for at least 10 years - not a useful
tool for paying nursery or pre-prep school fees.
More imaginative plans for those with capital build on second-hand endowment
policies, and on zero-dividend preference shares of split-capital investment
trusts.
Both have the advantage of a fixed level of uplift over the short- to
medium-term. The gains that can be made by investing in advance while aiming
for a fixed target are startling.
For example, a plan put together by Mr Michael Thompson, of stockbrokers
Gerrard Vivian Gray, uses a portfolio of 10 zeros to fund three children
through to secondary school. The plan is timed so that one zero is due to be
redeemed each year until 2004, when the oldest daughter starts secondary
school.
Total investment in the zeros this year is Pounds 43,662. Their total
redemption value is Pounds 75,078. This secures fees of Pounds 3,110 for
next year, when it would cover one child, and Pounds 13,098 in 2004. This
would pay for three children, and makes some allowance for inflation.

The table shows the top ten schools from this year's FT-500 ranking of
independent schools' A-level performance. Ranking is according to the
average result obtained in each exam, and according to each candidate's
total A-level score. The FT score shows how a school's A-level
performance compares with the average independent school, with an
average school scoring 1.00. Where two schools have the same score, the
difference between their A-level performance is very marginal.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Property: Auctions: the simple way to buy and sell - They
are quick, efficient, and offer freedom from gazumping. Gerald Cadogan
explains what to do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property auctioneer issues his challenge: 'It's against you, sir.' What
does he mean? And what is 'sir' to do?
In fact, the auctioneer is saying that another bid has topped yours - so you
must decide whether to carry on bidding or forego the property you are
seeking. At such times, the adrenalin surges - but you need to stay cool.
If you like brinkmanship, you could wait until he says: 'Going for the first
time, going for the second time . . .' You then slip in a bid just before he
has time to say: 'Going for the third time, and sold' (with a bang of the
hammer). Sometimes, this ploy offers the chance for a bargain; after all,
you would not expect frivolous bidders at this stage.
Sometimes, though, it never goes to the third call; the auctioneer stops to
say: 'I am sorry. The property has not met the reserve.' If you remain
interested, that is the moment to approach the saleroom management and try
to arrange a private deal.
Auctions are the quick and efficient way of buying and selling property,
provided you know what you want and can afford. You have the security of
knowing there is no gazumping - that is, acceptance of a higher offer from
someone else after the deal has been agreed - once the hammer is down.
A saleroom assistant takes your name and a cheque for 10 per cent of the
price (which the auction house will present next morning for special
clearance), and you exchange contracts before you leave. Just 28 days later,
the place is yours.
Sellers usually pay around 2.5 per cent, plus advertising charges. For this,
they get far greater publicity than almost any private treaty sale.
Property auctions split into two types. First, there are small country sales
of a single property or group of properties, often held in the local pub or
village hall.
Then, there are large sales of many properties, held at hotels in London and
other centres. These provide potential buyers with up to 700 homes a month
from which to choose, says Gary Murphy of Allsop, a leading auction firm
which sold 1,574 residential properties (93 per cent of those offered) for
Pounds 61m in 1993. About 60 to 70 per cent are repossessions.
Murphy points to a growing trend for auctions to be used as a first resort
rather than the last, as they used to be until quite recently. Part of the
reason undoubtedly is that buyers are sure of a fixed price  - and sellers
of getting their money without purchasers pulling out because the chain of
which they are part breaks down.
If you are selling, you must decide with the auctioneer on a reserve price.
This will not be more than the published guide price, which is intended as a
realistic estimate and is often exceeded, anyway.
The seller must also give the auctioneer copies of all the relevant papers.
For a Pounds 10 fee, these can be passed to a potential buyer or his
solicitor, together with any special conditions of sale.
It is important to remember that all parties must do their legal homework,
as auction sales are binding contracts and are not offers subject to
contract and survey, as in a private treaty sale.
Once you have found something you like, decide if you want a survey done
(this should produce an independent valuation). Then, contact your mortgage
provider and tell your solicitor, who might want to get in touch with the
vendor's lawyer. Your financing, and everything else, must be in order
before you go into the saleroom.
If you do not want to bid before the sale, check carefully - and often  -
that the property has not been withdrawn or 'sold prior'; auctioneers will
provide an addendum that details any last-minute changes. On the day itself,
arrive in good time. Listen to what the auctioneer says in his general
remarks - they may affect the lot in which you are interested.
If you can, take your solicitor or surveyor to bid for you; they will not be
carried away. If you bid yourself, pay attention and keep your limit firmly
in mind. Do not rush to enter the bidding; it can help you if it is slow.
(There is an alternative ploy to which I once fell victim when trying to bid
for a semi-derelict farmhouse. The survey had been done and I had decided on
what seemed a sensible limit of Pounds 30,000.
As the auctioneer looked for starting bids, a voice from the back boomed
'Pounds 30,000' - and blew away any competition on the spot.)
Finally, never bid for a property you have not seen personally, as some
dealers do.
Country auctions are excellent for properties that agents find hard to
assess (which often means they are in need of considerable attention). This
summer, for instance, Carter Jonas sold a Georgian old rectory at Moulsoe in
Buckinghamshire for Pounds 220,000 (guide price: Pounds 150,000).
The property was in a terrible state - its last serious redecoration was in
the 1920s. But Margaret Whitmore, of Carter Jonas, explains: 'We held the
sale in front of the house. Everybody knew what was on offer.'
Meanwhile, more than 100 people attended Henry Adams' auction (in Goodwood
House) of the derelict Seven Points on the Goodwood estate in West Sussex.
With a guide price of Pounds 125,000, it went for Pounds 137,000.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (13): Tax-deals for
enterprising risk-takers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke showed himself to be on the side of the angels last November,
when his first Budget introduced the Enterprise Investment Scheme - a means
of encouraging direct equity investment in small unquoted companies by
offering tax incentives, writes Bethan Hutton.
The EIS has many similarities with the defunct Business Expansion Scheme,
but lacks the loopholes which allowed the BES to be used as a way of
obtaining 40 per cent tax relief on investments in bank-guaranteed
residential property schemes, or schemes where you could borrow your money
back after six months. The tax perks of the EIS are only available for
investing in genuinely risky small trading companies.
The up-front tax relief has also been reduced, so that fewer people will be
tempted to invest for tax reasons alone. It may be some consolation that it
will be possible to offset losses against income or capital gains tax,
another innovation.
Also, in an angel-friendly move, the BES prohibition on investors becoming
paid directors of the companies they invest in has been removed. This only
applies if the investor has no previous connection with the company.
The department of trade and industry (DTI) expects the EIS to be used mainly
by companies making small private equity issues. With a fund-raising limit
of Pounds 1m per company per year, the glitzy publicity campaigns given to
many BES launches will not be cost-effective. However, a few public EIS
schemes have already been launched, ranging from a shipping company, to a
film, to a chain of pubs.
The main elements of the EIS are:
To participate, companies must be unquoted trading companies, and may raise
up to Pounds 1m a year.
No property-related or financial businesses qualify, and companies may not
make a binding commitment to buy back investors' shares.
Individuals may invest up to Pounds 100,000 in EIS schemes each year, with a
minimum investment of Pounds 500 in any one company.
Tax relief of 20 per cent tax relief is available on the initial investment.
Gains from the investment are tax-free if it is held for at least five
years. If the company collapses, or the investment is realised at a loss,
total or partial losses can be offset against income tax or CGT.
The department of trade and industry has published a free guide to the EIS
for investors and businesses. Copies can be obtained from: DTI Small Firms

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (12): A slice of the cake
 -Business angels / Many can offer past experience, but they will expect
much in return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business angels are wealthy individuals who appear in answer to the prayers
of small businesses, bearing large amounts of money to invest and expertise
to help the business expand.
They may sound heaven-sent, but most expect rewards in distinctly earthly
form - an annual return of 20 per cent or more on their investment, and, in
some cases, a job.
Small companies, particularly in the start-up phase, are notoriously risky
investments. Many fail in the first few years, and even the survivors often
struggle to break even. But there are a few roses among the thorns - and
investors hope that the business they pick will be one of the few which
thrive and grow, possibly blossoming into a stock market-quoted company.
The unique attraction of angel-style investment is the opportunity to take a
hands-on role in the company - many angels have run their own businesses and
want to put their experience to good use - but there are also those who
contribute more as sleeping partners.
The UK is thought to lag far behind the US in terms of business-angel
activity, but a recent study by a PhD student at Oxford concluded that the
business-angel market in the UK might be larger than previous estimates
suggested. The angels were also richer - a third of those surveyed had a net
worth of more than Pounds 1m - and on average invested more than previously
thought.
Patrick Coveney carried out the study in collaboration with Hamish
Stevenson, of Venture Capital Report, a monthly publication which aims to
match would-be angels with suitable projects. The survey gathered material
from more than 500 experienced or potential angels.
The researchers identified six distinct types of business angel:
Virgin angels: individuals with funds available, who have yet to find a
suitable proposal;
Latent angels: rich individuals who have made angel investments, but not in
the last three years;
Wealth-maximising angels: rich individuals and experienced businessmen who
invest in several businesses, to try to better the returns of the stock
market;
Entrepreneur angels: very rich, very entrepreneurial people who back a
number of businesses for both the fun of it and as a better option than the
stock market;
Career-seeking angels: less well-off individuals who invest in a business to
generate an income or job for themselves; and
Corporate angels: companies which make numerous large Angel-type
investments.
Virgin angels formed more than a third of the survey, pointing to the need
for more help in taking the plunge with the first investment.
Until now, two things have hampered the development of a thriving
business-angel sector: the difficulty businesses and potential angels face
in finding suitable partners, and the lack of tax incentives. Progress is
now being made on both these fronts, with the tax incentives of the
Enterprise Investment Scheme (see below) and the launch of a growing number
of business introduction services *.
The latest arrival on the scene is the high-tech 'computer dating' approach
of Enterprise Adventure, with its VentureList national database. Others
include specialist agencies, divisions of training and enterprise councils
(Tecs), and accountancy firms with a history of making introductions.
The cost to investors of using the different services varies, from Pounds
300 for an annual subscription to Venture Capital Report or Pounds 500 for a
year's access to Venturelist; to less than Pounds 50 for membership of a
smaller agency, or free access to some services. Most also charge a success
fee when a deal is arranged.

introduction services. For a free copy, telephone 071 240-3846. Other

FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Great courses: a great curse - Golf / Resorts and
designers are setting ordinary players too much of a challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often you play a course on holiday and then get the chance a
couple of weeks later to ask the architect what he thought he was doing.
The course is situated on the beautiful Hawaiian island of Kauai. Hanalei
Bay curves behind it. The imposing Mt Makana, or Bali Hai, as it was known
in South Pacific, which was filmed there, rises above.
The Prince course is usually said to be the best in Hawaii, and it is not
hard to see why. There are some breathtaking holes. The par four first is
surrounded by the Anini stream. The par five second requires a carry of at
least 100 yards across a hazard. The fourth has water all down the right
hand side. They are the easy holes.
By the time you have reached the 12th you are in a tropical jungle and on no
account should your drive stray from the straight and narrow by more than 20
yards. The last three holes are among the hardest. It was, unquestionably,
one of most daunting, and exhilarating courses that I have ever played. And
that was the problem.
I am a seven handicap player, who once played off one, and by the end it had
proved too tough for me, even on a day when I had played reasonably well.
Now it is not being immodest to say that if this course was too tough for
me, then 90 per cent of the people who venture on to it will not be able to
cope.
When I played, the course became clogged with people hitting shots into
bushes or streams. As they lost balls and spent ages in the process, the
better players lost patience and the result was a masterpiece of a course
that hardly anyone enjoyed playing. Two of the three people with whom I was
playing abandoned their rounds in spite of having paid the high fee.
Such difficulties may be encountered on many of the world's great golf
courses. They result from the owners' desire to create a notable golf
course, which will attract favourable press comment and so bring in
fee-paying customers. But putting a 28 handicap golfer on the Prince course
is like asking an apprentice to play for Manchester United's first team.
One of the great things about golf is supposed to be that anyone can walk in
the footsteps of the top players, and play the shots from where they played
them, and marvel at their skills. But half these courses are either very
private or very expensive; and the other half are so full of golfers without
the skills to play them that the round becomes very long and tedious. So,
when I asked the architect of the Prince course, Robert Trent Jones jnr, why
he made it so difficult, I knew what he would offer as an opening gambit:
'Well, first you have to remember that I design courses to a client's
instructions. The Princeville resort, where the Prince course is situated,
already has one, what you might term, playable golf course, and what they
wanted was an alternative, more challenging layout. Which is what I built.'
Jones is an amiable, intelligent man who loves golf and has designed many
such courses. He was aware of the question's implication: 'I agree, it is a
great problem,' he said.
Why not introduce a handicap limit: limiting the more challenging courses to
players with a proven handicap of 18?
'In America? The owners would be swamped with lawsuits before the first day
was out. But I think there is a way of alleviating the difficulty. The
solution would be to make sure that for the first couple of hours of each
day, the better players get a chance to go out, and so set the pace of play
for the day.'
'But the trouble with many resort courses is that they need the money from
the green fees, and that is of more importance to them than any question
about the pace of play.'
This, to a great extent, is what happened in Spain in the late 1980s, as the
courses became flooded with people and the prices went up and many British
golfers, tired of five hour rounds and exorbitant prices, went in search of
new pastures, such as South Carolina and Florida. Spain has tried hard to
make up for past mistakes.
What about forward tees, you might ask? Surely the more modest players could
play off these tees and so play a shorter course? True, but it still would
not help them overcome the intimidating factor of trying to carry water
hazards or ravines, or drive down an avenue with jungle on either side.
As Jones said, the game has a problem. Suggestions, please, to all the
world's great resort courses.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Motoring: Saab increases the cylinder count - Stuart
Marshall tests a new range of executive models designed to satisfy the
engine snobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the business car pecking order, Saab has always occupied a niche
somewhere above Ford and Vauxhall (Opel to mainland Europeans) but just
below BMW and Mercedes. Saab's niche-fellows have been sporty, individual
cars such as Alfa Romeo and Lancia.
So, why has a significant minority of business users in Britain, with
freedom to choose any car, gone for Saabs? Perhaps because they are so
enjoyable to drive that you feel the company's managers must be enthusiastic
motorists, not corporate bean-counters obsessed with cutting costs and
raising margins.
Second, Saabs are produced by an offshoot of Sweden's only aircraft-maker.
Knowing this evokes the right responses on technical merit, safety,
durability and environmental acceptability. And, third, Saab's badge has
never been put at a disadvantage by being seen on small, cheap cars such as
Fiestas and Corsas.
As a low volume car-maker - under 100,000 a year - Saab could never afford
the luxury of a range of engines. For two decades, it had just one; a
four-cylinder conceived in the early 1970s by Triumph at Coventry, in the
English midlands.
Over the years, it has been modified extensively and turbo-charged, fitted
with highly sophisticated ignition systems and, ultimately, enlarged to a
2.3-litre with twin balancing shafts.
Driving a turbo-charged and inter-cooled Saab 900 or 9000 has always been
one of motoring's better experiences. The cars exude integrity; their
engines are flexible at low speeds, exceedingly vigorous when needed, and
run smoothly at all times. But they have only four cylinders. Many
status-conscious business drivers dream of at least eight cylinders,
although most have to settle for six.
Now, they will no longer need to reject a Saab 9000 because it has too few
cylinders. Two flagship models will be in the showrooms next month powered
by a three-litre V6. (I have not forgotten the 900 V6, which has been around
for some months. What I am talking about are big cars for senior managers.)
Heart of the latest, range-topping Saab 9000 Griffin saloon, and the
slightly less elaborate 9000CSE V6 five-door, is a General Motors engine.
This 215 horsepower unit is also used in the Vauxhall (Opel) Omega, just as
the Saab 900's 2.5-litre, 170hp V6 is shared with both Omega and up-market
versions of Vauxhall (Opel) models such as the Cavalier (Vectra) and
Calibra. GM rode to Saab's financial rescue three years ago but is keeping
the Saab marque quite separate from its mass sellers.
Smaller capacity, four-cylinder 9000s continue to be available. Most potent
of them all is still the turbo-charged and inter-cooled 2.3-litre, 230hp
Aero, which more than matches the V6's pulling power (torque) and, on paper,
offers slightly better fuel economy.
Yet, when I drove them in northern France last week, I thought the V6 9000s,
if a mite less fiery, had all the performance for which any business
motorist could reasonably ask. Their ride is excellent, their handling
nimble and reassuringly secure. Automatic transmission is standard.
At Pounds 31,995 list, the 9000 Griffin - and, to a lesser extent, the
Pounds 29,995 9000CSE V6 - will face fierce competition, including the
Vauxhall Omega Elite (Pounds 27,385). This has the same power train and
similarly lavish equipment.
Saab, however, is banking on charisma and exclusiveness to persuade buyers
to get behind the wheel of a Griffin rather than the poshest Omega or Ford
Scorpio.

Foster watches a familiar scene with an unexpected twist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On a dust-red football pitch an hour from Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo,
the daily training regime begins promptly at 10am. It follows a familiar
pattern of running, passing and ball control practice. This is a scene
played out thousands of times throughout the country of the World Cup
winners. It is a scene that would barely catch the attention of a passing
villager, tempted to break the monotony of the day.
But this is no ordinary practice session, and certainly no ordinary team.
The trainer's barked orders induce uncomfortable giggles among local
children who have come to watch. The players, all teenagers, have the same
taut and agile bodies of Brazilian footballers. But their faces are very
different.
Jin Zhengmin, manager of the Chinese National Youth Football Team, steps
forward to explain why he, two trainers, a teacher and China's 22 most
promising young footballers are living on the other side of the world in
Brazil.
'We are preparing for the 2000 Olympics. These players will return to China
in five years. We have other programmes under way in China, but we hope
these players will be the best,' said Jin, who played for his country in the
1960s and was a big fan of Bobby Charlton.
China is a newcomer to the footballing tradition. The game only recently
became popular through television and the 1986 and 1990 World Cups. In some
regions the former England captain Gary Lineker overtook Margaret Thatcher
as the most famous Briton.
Impressed by this growing popularity, and football's suitability as a cheap
team sport for developing countries, bureaucrats in Beijing agreed the
country's football infrastructure needed an overhaul. China was making a
concerted push to enter the top levels of international sport, a campaign
which led to outstanding results - as well as accusations of foul play - in
swimming and athletics.
Two years ago, when China was still favourite to host the 2000 Olympics
ahead of Sydney, a nationwide championship was held to select the country's
60 most promising footballers. Following further trials in Beijing, the best
prospects, aged between 14 and 17, were sent to Brazil to spend five years
learning the game.
They arrived last November and the team is playing in championships and cups
around the country and may soon hire a Brazilian coach. Jin also hopes that
his most promising players will join local clubs, although Brazil's rules on
employing foreigners are tight.
According to Li Fei, one of the squad's two trainers and a former
professional player in Germany, China still has much to do before its
football reaches international standards. 'Compared to other countries,
these boys' level is poor. But for China, it is very high,' he said.
China supports the programme but all finance has been provided by a drink
company from China's southern province of Guangdong.
Brazil seems an odd place to send China's sporting prodigies. The country's
football is unquestionably often brilliant. Yet it is equally often erratic,
and stresses an individualism which would shock many a Chinese mandarin.
Jin, a likeable, earnest man, explains: 'The Brazilian physique is the same
as the Chinese, both strong and agile but slight. This is better for our
young people who have difficulty playing against young Europeans, who are
bigger.'
The young Chinese are quickly adopting Brazilian habits. One training
exercise involved practising the back flick perfected by the retired star
Socrates. At the end of the session, the players huddled arm in arm singing
a football song learned from Sao Paulo football club, and shouting 'China'
in Portuguese.
The squad's indoor training school, a wooden barn, was transformed into a
party hall for the Carnival celebrations. According to Jin, the squad is
employing a Brazilian to teach it to dance the samba.
Some of the players say they miss Chinese food, but Jin is adamant.
'Brazil's food is better for football training because of the high meat and
carbohydrate content,' he said.
Asian habits rule when it comes to punishment. Culprits run between two
lines of players and receive violent slaps on the back from everyone.
Following a two-hour session, the boys return to their training camp in a
bus hired from the local municipal council. The Olympic rings have been
painted on the dormitory building's wall. There is also a huge Chinese flag
and map in the dining room, and a video recorder and some popular Chinese
films.
Otherwise, there seems little to occupy China's future footballing stars.
Many of their countrymen would no doubt envy them and their bright sporting
futures. But five years seems a long time to spend on a farm in the middle
of the Brazilian countryside.
One of the boys, with short hair and bad acne, seemed unconcerned. 'There's
many things to do to relax. We can play football, sometimes there's football
on TV and there's lots of videos of football matches,' he said.

Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip
After 250 days (500 vertical miles) of skiing, the toll is beginning to tell
 -on both skis and skins, if not the inner us. 'Your skis are just about
blown out, mate,' says Alex Herbert at Fleet's ski repair shop in Thredbo,
one of the leading resorts in the Australian Alps of southern New South
Wales.
Thankfully, a new pair of Salomons is winging its way towards me, courtesy
of Snow + Rock and friends who are paying a flying visit to ski with us.
They are also bearing all kinds of potions from Clarins to restore our
faces, seared by the scorching NSW sun.
At nearby Perisher Valley, they - like many resorts - keep a list of daft
questions people ask. 'What time does the chairlift go?' is one. 'Will it
snow at night or during the day?' is another.
Perisher got its name when two cattlemen, trying to round up their herd
before winter set in, rode into a blizzard. One of them wrote later: 'We
rode out to the west face of the mountain to look down along the Snowy River
to see if the cattle were there.
'The frozen snow was beating into our faces, Jim Spencer's beard was white
with snow and turning to me he said: 'This is a perisher.''
In those days, snow was bad news; but now people sometimes travel for days
just to see it. Dennis Bullen - originally from Barnet, London - drove for
three days from Brisbane to reach Falls Creek in Victoria and enjoyed skiing
in the rain so much that he is determined to return to Max and Rosemary
Aitken's Feathertop Lodge next winter.
Bullen's wife Margaret, who had never seen snow before, was less
enthusiastic. 'The snow was wet and cold,' she said. 'I was hoping it would
be a bit fluffier.'
Max Aitken is another Englishman who only took up skiing once he had
emigrated to Australia. He broke his leg playing rugby for Widnes, came to
Australia to recuperate, married, and is now a part-time ski instructor.
Driving long distances is not uncommon in Australia. One skier at the
Barrakee Lodge, Perisher, knows two farmers from Nelson's Plains (a couple
of buildings 18km north-west of Newcastle in NSW) who wanted to run-in their
new car and drove to Perth, 3,000km away, for a hamburger. It took them four
days.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Motoring: Get tough on uninsured drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 1m British motorists are known not to tax or insure their cars.
They weigh the slight risk of being caught against the money they save and
reckon breaking the law makes good financial sense.
Last October in this column, I suggested that tougher law enforcement was
long overdue. If driving uninsured - or, worse, uninsured and disqualified -
were the seriously anti-social offences the courts once thought them to be,
perhaps it was time to seize and sell guilty drivers' cars.
I lost count of the number of readers who wrote in support. Since then, the
government has announced administrative action to chase motorists who do not
tax (and, by inference, do not insure) their cars.
The problem persists, though. This week, the Guild of Experienced Motorists
echoed my thoughts. It asked the government to introduce legislation giving
courts the power to confiscate uninsured vehicles.
John Newman, the guild's chairman and chief executive, noted that the
maximum penalty for driving uninsured was Pounds 5,000 - but that the fine
recommended by the Magistrates' Association was only Pounds 540. It seemed a
small price for a crime that could leave innocent victims disabled with
little chance of compensation.
Newman said the guild believed confiscating the vehicle and jailing the
driver would be a severe deterrent. It also wanted cars to carry an
insurance disc alongside their tax disc. I am sure that most readers of this
column would agree.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Outnumbered by 30 to one - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complaining about the umpire or referee is one of sport's most enduring
traditions. In whatever game, at whatever level, the man charged with the
duty of judgment finds himself the scapegoat for everyone else's rage and
disappointment.
On the village green, the opening bat stares with theatrical disbelief at
the man in the white coat who has had the nerve to give him out lbw, then
stalks off, muttering and expostulating. I have seen a ref who disallowed a
goal in a Slough Industrial League Division Three soccer match knocked to
the ground for his troubles. At Wimbledon, a tennis official in a panama hat
is expected to smile politely on his stool while some oafish super-ego
swears at him over a foot fault.
But in no game, I would suggest, is the lot of the referee more difficult
than in rugby union. He has to put up with all the abuse and unpleasantness
which law enforcement provokes in any game. But in addition, the
interpretation of laws and the detection of infringement is particularly
difficult in rugby.
I know because I have done it, twice. Of the second occasion I can remember
little, except that it was disfigured by one of those ludicrous brawls which
are a time-honoured characteristic of coarse rugby. I brought it to an end -
rather brilliantly, I thought by lifting one of the protagonists off the
ground by his collar.
The first, though, was a fiasco from start to finish. I was somewhat
handicapped because I had left my spectacles in the changing room, which
meant that everything happening more than 20 yards from me was little more
than a blur. But the chief problem was that, even when I was on hand for
ruck or maul or scrum, I could not work out what was going on.
Amid the churning mass of bodies, the ball was sometimes visible, sometimes
not. At any moment, it seemed that almost everyone was committing some kind
of offence. This presented me with a choice between non-stop whistle-blowing
 -necessitating an instant choice of whose illegality was the grossest - and
quiescent inactivity.
I varied erratically between these two courses, and thus fell into
disrepute. Whatever I did was wrong, and the entire match unfolded to the
accompaniment of an incessant chorus of complaint. Bereft of authority, I
became disillusioned and a sad hate-figure on a dank Sunday afternoon. At
the end, my own team secured ignoble victory with a try which came - so my
own chums cheerfully confided to me afterwards - from a pass which was a
good yard-and-a-half forward.
I did not know the rules, of course. Nor was I in a minority at the lowly
level at which I played. We may have had a vague apprehension of the guiding
principles which informed the code. But of the detail we were appallingly
ignorant. And even when we did know a particular rule, we had no inhibition
about breaking it, nor about protesting long and loud if we were detected.
Now the laws are even more complicated than they were then, and the game is
afflicted more than ever by this combination of ignorance and wilful
lawlessness. And who gets the blame for the resulting shambles? Is it the
players, who trample on the rules, or the lawmakers who dreamt them up? No,
it is the man charged with enforcing them.
Thus we had the preposterous spectacle of the players from Bath and Wasps
excoriating the referee for ruining what should have been one of the
showpieces of the last league season. His crime was that he had had the
nerve to whistle up for a mere 48 out of the uncountable offences committed
during 80 minutes of ill-natured anarchy.
Pity the poor ref. It is not his fault that the game should have sunk into a
grey swamp of well-intentioned but unenforceable regulations; nor that
players at all levels should have become so expert in exploiting the
vulnerability of his position. The miracle is that rugby union should still
be capable of producing moments of clean, incomparable exhilaration. The
almost hysterical ecstasy which greeted Underwood's try against Wales,
Geoghehan's against England, Quinnell's against France in the last batch of
home internationals, is dire evidence of their rarity and the unhappy pass
this great game has got itself into.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (10): Has money, lives
humbly - What makes a serious investor / For them, making money is a way of
keeping score, says Gillian O'Connor, as she looks into serious investment
mythology, and asks whether mere mortals can learn from the gods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Investor is the antithesis of the Punter. Not for him a quick
flutter on the back of a golf club tip. He regards investment as a vocation,
and all his risks are calculated.
Making money is his way of keeping score, so he probably makes a lot; but he
often lives comparatively humbly.
He spent several years working in investment management before branching out
on his own, and now usually has a rather scathing view of most professional
investment managers. He is probably American.
The father of investment analysis was Benjamin Graham, born in London 100
years ago this year, but a Wall Streeter all his life. Co-author of the
influential Security Analysis, a book more cited than read, he later wrote a
popular and comprehensible manual, The Intelligent Investor. This is still
in print today and well worth reading.
Best known as the proponent of Value Investing, Graham actually outlined two
distinct approaches to investment management: one for the defensive
investor, the man who was not very interested and not prepared to take much
risk; another for the enterprising investor.
Defensive investment
His portfolio for defensive investors was based on a bond/equity split with
the equities spread among 10-30 sound blue chips. Update his thinking to
take in the worldwide switch into equities, because of their greater
resistance to inflation, and you have the kind of portfolio most
professional investment managers recommend today. The basic concept is of a
team whose members' qualities are complementary.
Modern portfolio managers will, for instance, look for investments which
normally move in opposite directions, in order to reduce the overall risk of
the portfolio. The defensive investor's heirs are mainly found among 'top
down' managers - ones who create an identikit portfolio and then go out to
look for stocks to put in it.
Aggressive investment
The enterprising investor is a dedicated stockpicker, who pays scant
attention to portfolio theory. What he is looking for is shares which will
do significantly better than the overall market. He is quite prepared to run
a lumpy portfolio as long as all the lumps are of good quality.
Graham identified two types of share which fit the enterprising investors
needs:
Growth shares - companies whose businesses and profits were expanding both
rapidly and reliably, and whose shares were cheap in view of their
potential; and
'Bargain issues' - companies whose current worth made their shares cheap on
strictly mathematical criteria.
Being a cautious man, Graham chose to concentrate exclusively on the latter.
His criterion was that the share should be selling at not more than two
thirds of net current assets per share, ie, assets excluding all fixed
assets such as factories. Thus you count stock any cash or liquid
investments, but knock off debts to suppliers, customers and any other
creditors. You buy all shares selling at or below two thirds of net current
assets per share, and sell once the share price reaches net current asset
value. It is a purely objective mathematical system.
Graham's most famous disciple is now the world's best known investor, Warren
Buffett, the sage of Omaha and America's second richest man. All his wealth
 -Pounds 5.5bn at the last count - comes from his own investments. He began
by running an investment partnership, and now runs a public company called
Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports have long been
collector's items, and the company has recently taken to charging for them.
The Buffett way
Buffett has adopted but modified Graham's belief in bargain issues. Like
Graham, he will only buy companies whose shares offer fundamental value.
But, unlike Graham, he also has subjective criteria: he will only buy good
businesses with good management and good long-term prospects. And once he
has found such a company he will continue to hold its shares until it loses
the characteristics which first attracted him. Such businesses are too rare
to be discarded lightly.
He says he buys shares as if he were buying the whole business, his criteria
being:
A business he can understand;
with favourable long-term prospects;
operated by honest and competent people;
available at a very attractive price.
The basis of this investment cocktail remains value, but there is more than
a hint of growth there as well. Other successful stockpickers blend the
ingredients in other ways. But their recipes have common elements.
Most serious investors find a method that suits them and stick to it; most
do not attempt to predict short-term stock market movements; most do much of
their own research and like finding shares that no one else thinks worth
buying; all of them are fascinated by the business of investment.
Copying the masters
Is there any way that the personal investor can emulate men such as Graham
and Buffett? The biggest obstacle is getting first-hand experience of the
markets. Many of the masters operate far away from financial centres, but
all had extensive practical experience first.
But the personal investor has the enormous advantage that he is answerable
only to himself, and so can take a longer-term view. He can retreat into
cash if he wants to, he can stick with a company going through a difficult
patch, and he need never buy unless he is really convinced that he has found
a winner.

THE CROSSING by Cormac McCarthy Picador Pounds 14.99, 426 pages
RUSHING TO PARADISE JG Ballard Flamingo Pounds 14.99, 239 pages
EVERYTHING AND MORE Geoff Nicholson Gollancz Pounds 15.99, 251 pages
Categorising Cormac McCarthy as a writer of westerns is like calling Herman
Melville a writer of fishing stories. A dark poetic evocation of the
American West, The Crossing is the second volume of McCarthy's The Border
Trilogy. Set in New Mexico and northern Mexico, it moves on from his
previous book, All the Pretty Horses, to the years leading up to, and
including, the second world war. Juxtaposing an older world of outlaws,
vaqueros and Indians with one dominated by cars and aeroplanes, The Crossing
investigates the loss of innocence and the relationship between history and
narrative.
For teenager Billy Parham, crossing the border into Mexico is to journey
into unknown territory. Impulsive yet impassive, Billy begins his initial
sojourn in the middle of the night, pursuing a wolf that has attacked local
cattle. lntending to accompany the animal to the Mexican mountains, it is a
year and a lifetime before Billy returns to New Mexico. He arrives to find
his family have been murdered and their horses stolen. Only Boyd, his
younger brother, survives.
Here everyone - Indians, revolutionaries, bandits and gypsies - has a story.
Some are true, but most are fiction. As Billy is told, 'things separate from
their story have no meaning.'
It would be equally misleading to describe JG Ballard as simply a science
fiction writer. More concerned with the imagination than science, Ballard's
writing can be mesmerising and poetic. He is sometimes almost perversely
radical but he can also be oddly primitive.
A return to form, though a long way from Ballard's best work, such as High
Rise and Crash, Rushing to Paradise focuses on campaigner Dr Barbara
Rafferty and her attempt to save an albatross population threatened by the
construction of an airstrip on a small French Pacific island.
Eventually Rafferty, appalled by the commerciality of the venture, severs
links with the outside world, and declares the island a sanctuary for women:
'The biggest problem the world faces is not that there are too few whales or
pandas, but too many men . . .' In this fiction, men are victims rather than
oppressors. Packaged within a voyeuristic narrative, Ballard's sexual
paranoia makes Rushing to Paradise compulsive reading.
The work of British writer Geoff Nicholson could be categorised as
speculative satire. Locating cultural fault-lines, Everything and More - the
slogan of Hadon Brothers department store - examines the relationship
between work, consumerism and terrorism and takes place in a gargantuan
building with a surreal facade, secret rooms and hidden passages. With its
non unionised staff intent on sabotage, loyal employee, Vita Carlisle holds
her reclusive and randy employer, Arnold, hostage.
Meanwhile, protagonist Charlie Mayhew, reluctantly working as a furniture
porter, searches for an art form and finds signification in objects and
linguistic tics, such as the term menswear: 'Did it mean 'men's ware', as in
hardware, or was it a portmanteau word telling the public that men in those
areas were given to bad language?' When an author appears on the wrong day
for a booksigning, the staff ask questions worthy of post-modern
deconstructionists.
Influenced by the literary extravagances of Huysman and George Perec,
Everything and More might, in comparison, be lightweight, but it is
subversive enough to parody its voyeuristic tendencies. Combining
speculation and accusation, Nicholson, no less than McCarthy and Ballard,
delights in defying categories.

GERRY ADAMS: SELECTED WRITINGS Brandon Pounds 7.95, 316 pages
There is something enigmatic - many people would use a stronger word - about
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. What is really going on behind that
well-trimmed beard? Most of us have forgotten Adams's voice, too, since
British law demanded that his broadcast words be dubbed. Instead we have -
quite possibly to Adams's advantage - the soothing sounds of professional
actors.
Although most of them have appeared elsewhere, these reminiscences, short
stories and political essays could not be more timely. Anyone remotely
gripped by the possibility of peace in Northern Ireland following the IRA
ceasefire of August 31 should read these pages, if not for their exculpatory
logic then for the tone of voice beneath.
Adams writes fluently and observantly, even if in his scenes of
working-class Catholic life the dialogue sometimes strikes the reader as
artificially rehashed. He displays a hard-edged compassion for the silent
poor, the old and the down-and-out.
Occasionally sentimental, these are quite clearly moral tales - and the
moral is usually political. An old woman is told by a keen young parish
priest to choose between her politics and her religion; an unmarried brother
and sister fall out over the rightness of armed resistance. Yet there is
also a portrait of a 'good' Orangeman. The unionists could do with so gifted
an apologist.
In the polemical pieces - particularly those explaining his political views
and justifying the IRA's terrorism - the less humane voice of Gerry Adams
comes through. It is the hectoring sound of 1960s-inspired revolutionary
socialism and class struggle. Northern Ireland is a 'colonial statelet'; it
is a police state practising South African apartheid; bombing and murder are
'physical force politics'.
Adams says he deeply regrets the deaths and injuries caused by The Troubles.
He talks about 'considerable moral problems in relation to armed struggle.'
No doubt he means it, as he means the rest. But has he a clue how this
sounds to people outside?
The last essay, written this year, manages to be both uncompromising and
ambivalent: 'It is desirable in practice that the consent, or assent, of as
many unionists as possible should be obtained to the steps that would be
practically required to bring about the ending of partition and establishing
a united Ireland.' No wonder Westminster cannot read him.
Are Gerry Adams and his followers now ready to settle for something short of
the unification of Ireland? Here you may read and judge for yourself.

REVOLUTION IN THE HEAD: THE BEATLES' RECORDS AND THE SIXTIES by Ian
MacDonald Fourth Estate Pounds 15, 373 pages
FAITHFULL by Marianne Faithfull with David Dalton Michael Joseph Pounds
15.99, 333 pages
X-RAY: THE UNAUTHORISED AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Ray Davies Viking Pounds 17.50, 419
pages
It is the summer of 1966 and London, as pronounced by no less than Time
magazine, is the city of the decade. Frank Sinatra is fighting a brave
rearguard action in the singles' charts with 'Strangers in the Night', but
his nocturnal ramblings belong to a different age. The talk everywhere is of
light, sun, hope and glory. The lazy shuffle of the Kinks' 'Sunny Afternoon'
knocks the mocking exuberance of the Beatles' 'Paperback Writer' off the top
of the hit parade in the very week that Bobby Moore receives the glistening
Jules Rimet Trophy from the Queen. The vibe spreads; in the US, 8,000
Vietnam protestors encircle the Pentagon in an attempt to levitate it.
Nothing seems impossible.
The Beatles take their demotion with good grace; they are preparing for the
release of Revolver, an album so packed with ideas and innovation that they
can afford to be magnanimous. Ian MacDonald, in his loving and
superbly-argued analysis of the group's recorded legacy, is unoriginal in
seeing this splendid moment as a cultural peak from which we have gradually
been descending into mass-produced banality; his success is to show in the
finest detail just what went into the seemingly effortless succession of
masterpieces, and how the whole thing - the Beatles and the Sixties - came
apart.
The book's meticulous track-by-track examination is a fund of fresh insights
into very familiar territory. To take just one example, MacDonald reveals
that 'Michelle', commonly considered an irritatingly cloying piece of
McCartney-esque whimsy, was in fact co-written by John Lennon, who stole a
line from Nina Simone's 'I Put a Spell on You' for its middle section.
Playfully ironic throughout ('I want you, I want you, I want you; I think
you know by now'), the refined finishing touch was applied by McCartney's
pain-staking bass line, which he described as 'a kind of Bizet thing'
(referring to the habanera from Carmen). This was no throwaway nursery
rhyme, yet what was envisaged as an album filler was good enough to take The
Overlanders to number one for three weeks.
The relationship between Lennon and McCartney unsurprisingly forms the human
core of MacDonald's musings. Again, the story is hardly unfamiliar: the two
friends who initially channel their competitiveness into their work, only to
get bogged down in jealousy, rancour and law suits. But MacDonald reverses
some of the more obvious stereotypes, emphasising Lennon's capacity for
sentimental balladeering ('This Boy', 'If I Fell', 'Yes It Is') and
McCartney's penchant for biting sarcasm (asked for a sleeve-note for Lennon
and Yoko Ono's Two Virgins, he responded with: 'When two great Saints meet,
it is a humbling experience').
By the time of Abbey Road, both the Beatles and the decade were falling into
disrepute. MacDonald takes the bold step of identifying one song, Lennon's
'Come Together', as a turning point, 'embodying a pivotal moment when the
free world's coming generation rejected established wisdom, knowledge,
ethics and behaviour for a drug-inspired relativism which has since
undermined the intellectual foundations of western culture.'
Not that Marianne Faithfull would have noticed. Indeed, bearing in mind her
aristocratic Austro-Hungarian heritage, it could be argued that decadence,
gloom and deathliness coursed through her veins long before the various
substances which she injected in celebration of and escape from sixties
counter-culture. Just check out the references in her first chapter
('Childhood'): Sartre, Kafka, Virgil, Coltrane, Beethoven, Jung, Nietzsche;
Faithfull had little to learn from a bunch of blues-loving upstarts like the
Rolling Stones, but she managed to prostrate herself before their relentless
ambition just the same.
Faithfull is a humorous, self-effacing and eerily dispassionate account of a
life lived in near-constant psycho-pharmaceutical turmoil, punctuated with
sharp observations (describing 'As Tears Go By' as 'slightly existential,
but with a dash of San Remo song festival') and sprinkled with a bewildering
variety of sex, drugs and rock and roll stories.
It is a winning autobiography - it is difficult to dislike a woman who, on
hearing of Mick Jagger's wedding to Bianca, instantly fills herself with
Valium, downs three vodka Martinis, lurches into an Indian restaurant, falls
into a curry, spends the night in Paddington police station, signs
autographs for the officers and, on leaving, quotes De Quincey to the grey
London skies.
Early in her musical career, Faithfull shared a tour with the Kinks, whom
she found to be 'very gothic, creepy and silent'. Indeed, Ray Davies's
'unauthorised autobiography' (in which a fictitious 'journalist' gets Davies
to open up to him) is much more down-beat than Faithfull's fruity epic, but
then again Muswell Hill was no fin-de-siecle Vienna. The problem is that
Davies, not having been semi-comatose for three-quarters of his life,
experienced much more acutely the pains which fame inflicted on him,
particularly the break-up of his marriage and the inevitable legal wrangles
with his management. It is unlikely that the Kinks will represent more than
a footnote to the great sixties saga, but Davies could certainly write a
mean pop song.
Which brings us back to MacDonald and his decline-of- civilisation thesis,
expounded in a couple of essays which sandwich the main part of his book.
This is a line of argument, of course, which more commonly comes from those
who would date the 'turning point' at Elvis's first televised pelvic thrust,
at the birth of rock and roll. MacDonald uses the Beatles' material to
convince us otherwise. Is there any piece of music in this century which can
match the joy and optimism of 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', or 'Eight Days a
Week', or 'Penny Lane'? Today's pop music, sampled, flattened and
homogenised or today's rock music, pompous and ponderous, provide plentiful
evidence for MacDonald's conclusion, that 'something in the soul of Western
culture began to die during the late Sixties'.

THE MARRIED MAN: A LIFE OF DH LAWRENCE by Brenda Maddox Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 20, 631 pages
FRIEDA LAWRENCE by Rosie Jackson Pandora Pounds 14.99, 240 pages
Lady Ida Sitwell describes a Chiantishire luncheon to her son Osbert in
1926: 'A Mr DH Lawrence came over the other day, a funny little petit-maitre
of a man with flat features and a beard. He is a writer, and seems to know
of you. His wife is a large German . . .'
Lawrence would be dead within four years, Frieda in 30. It was - though Lady
Ida would never know - one of the most extraordinary and extravagant
marriages in the history of literature. Brenda Maddox has written a most
readable account, not so much of Lawrence as of his marriage - 'a mismatch
made in heaven', as she puts it.
She starts from her response to 'a likeable Lawrence: a devastating mimic,
an inspired teacher, a handy householder, a hard-working journalist, a loyal
brother and generous uncle, a good cook, an eager traveller and brilliant
travel writer, a dogged, dreadful painter, an ecological visionary and,
above all - as he saw himself - a married man'.
That said, she does not ignore the rest of the portrait: the appalling
tensions within the marriage, the alarming anti-democratic political
instincts, the sexual problems which were evaded with sodomy, the cruel
selfishness which denied Frieda her children. 'Lawrence's real vices were
ambivalence, grandiloquence and irascibility' says Maddox, and later, in
compensation, quotes Edward Garnett on the man's 'lovableness, cheekiness,
intensity and pride'.
Unlike the host of earlier books about Lawrence, this one is extremely brisk
about the childhood; even Jessie Chambers scarcely figures. After Lawrence's
euthanasia-killing of his beloved mother, the focus is on Frieda Weekley.
Born a Von Richthoven, she was a member of a liberated and intellectual
German family - Maddox is good on pre-war Munich where Frieda's most
influential lover, Otto Gross, was a disciple of Freud and a morphine
addict.
Frieda, after 13 years in a boring Nottingham marriage, did not hesitate to
appoint herself the 27-year-old writer's erotic muse, a role which, with the
exception of the war years, would keep them out of Britain: 'In their
contempt for the stupefying hypocrisy of England, with its concern for
appearances and its deep shame about the body, they were as one, and in
their odd alliance they were refusing to collaborate in it any longer'.
This is a literary biography which does not make the common mistake of
under-esteeming the literature (Maddox is interesting, for instance, on St
Mawr, and on the curious parallels between a Lawrence story The Shadow in
the Rose Garden and Joyce's earlier The Dead), but a book about a marriage
has to tackle the detail of that relationship. It was, we are assured, a
sexually ill-matched association: 'Anal sex seems to have been the
Lawrences' resolution to the conflict between them'.
Then there was the matter of Lawrence's possible homosexual leanings -
'Lawrence was not like Forster, a suppressed homosexual who did not have the
courage of his desires . . . He was a hypersensitive man unable to bring
together the male and female components of his personality, and in the grip
of a terror of losing the boundaries of self'. There may have been one
homosexual episode in 1917 with a farmer friend, just as there was one known
adultery, with Rosalind Baynes; after that there would be impotence - guess
who was the model for Sir Clifford Chatterley]
None of which damages Lawrence's importance to all of us. 'My great religion
is a belief in the blood, the flesh, as being wiser than the intellect. We
can go wrong in our minds. But what our blood feels and believes and says,
is always true', wrote Lawrence in a famous - notorious - remark. We can
deny it, we can be rude about him and, if we wish, his fat German wife, but
we cannot pretend to be beyond his influence.
There is of course much else of interest and value in this long,
deeply-researched history. New Mexico, Mexico, Australia (Kangaroo as 'the
most under-appreciated and biographically provocative of any of his
novels'), the supreme travel writing (Sea and Sardinia after an eight-day
visit]), Lady Chatterley ('God forbid that I should be taken as urging loose
sex activity' wrote Lawrence to Lady Ottoline Morrell - too late, of
course).
My only regret is that we do not have more letters, which Maddox rightly
explains is what makes her like him. Consider, for instance, a 1922 letter
to Forster, not mentioned here - 'I think you made a nearly deadly mistake
in glorifying those business people in Howards End. Business is no good'.
Isn't that the best ever comment on Mr Wilcox?
Rosie Jackson's Frieda Lawrence, with the same jacket photograph as the
Maddox, is misleading. It turns out to be a hundred pages in defence of
Frieda - answering in particular the tittle-tattle about Frieda's
promiscuity and pointing out that she spent only 18 of her 77 years with
Lawrence - and a reprint of Frieda's own autobiography, Not I, But The Wind,
which dates from 1935 and is economic with some of the actualite, yet has
its own compulsion. A rather odd volume, but valuable to addicts.

FIEFS AND VASSALS by Susan Reynolds Oxford University Press Pounds 20, 544
pages
Aristocratic society in the middle ages was held together by the bond
between lord and vassal. This bond was personally entered into, symbolically
enacted, and rewarded by the property or fief, in virtue of which the vassal
owed military service, attendance at court and other payments and duties to
his lord. Political obligation and legal right rested on this principle,
established in the 9th century and comprehensively applied to the exercise
of power at every level of society in the 11th and 12th. The entire
political and legal structure of western Europe in the middle ages was
founded on it.
So the story runs. The artificiality of the idea of a 'feudal system' has
been well recognised at least since Maitland remarked that it was introduced
into England by Sir Henry Spelman in 1631, but that has not prevented the
principles associated with it (in this non-marxist sense) from dominating
our conceptions of medieval society. The great medievalists of every
European nation - Sir Frank Stenton, Heinrich Mitteis, Marc Bloch, F. L.
Ganshof - have written their greatest books on its origins, nature,
operation and consequences.
Susan Reynolds has had the poor taste and staggering endurance to go looking
for the evidence. Having assiduously searched a mountain of the most obscure
and rebarbative texts the middle ages have to offer she reports that most of
it is not there, and that what there is fails on examination to support the
mighty edifice that has been built upon it.
A mighty edifice indeed there was, but the builders were not 9th- and
10th-century magnates appropriating the remains of public authority to
enlarge their own estates and fortunes, as the old story had it, but 12th-
and 13th-century lawyers and officials eager to expand the incomes and
extend the prerogatives of their royal and princely masters over the mainly
inherited property of their free subjects. It was they who began to speak of
land being held of the lord - ultimately, of the king - and to use words
like vassus and feodum, with the overtones of honourable subjection and
obligation from which their 16th and 17th-century successors could abstract
a complex conceptual system.
What we have taken for the elementary structures of European society are
really the products of something more like bureaucracy than feudalism:
products, in fact, of the transformation which made government something
exercised through the written word rather than by force, and therefore
placed it in the hands of those who knew how to manipulate words.
Twelfth- and 13th-century bureaucrats, like other bureaucrats, needed
precedents for what they decided to do. It was the lawyers' business to find
them. In doing so they described a world which we have mistaken for a real
historical past. Susan Reynolds conducts her campaign with considerable
learning and technical skill across a wide stretch of European history.
Since a great deal of it attempts to prove a negative  - what the sources do
not say - there is inevitably plenty of scope for defenders of the old
order.
Nevertheless, the conclusions of Fiefs and Vassals fit very well with those
of much recent discussion both of early medieval societies and about the
depth and scale of the transformation of Europe after the year 1000. Reading
the sources forward from the beginning instead of backwards through
13th-century eyes reveals a society much less precisely stratified than it
then became, in which free men inherited and owned land quite independently
of the duties which they owed to the king 'not because they were his
vassals, but because they were his subjects.'
The real makers of the European middle ages were the scholars, lawyers and
administrators of the 12th and 13th centuries who, sometimes consciously and
sometimes not, constructed accounts of their various pasts to add a veneer
of venerable authority and tradition to their highly innovative and
aggressive approach to the pressing problems of learning, law and
government. Here they have been well and truly caught in the act.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (9): Keep an ear to the
boardroom door - Directors' dealings / A look at the legal way of getting
what amounts to an inside tip from those in the know - the people who run
the company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR

<TEXT>
Fuzzy thinking and compromise are the enemy of successful investment. You
should either take a hands-on approach or leave it to someone else. But
inevitably people search for foolproof systems which allow them to make
successful investment decisions without putting in much preliminary work.
Some of these are based on yield, such as the Investors Chronicle High Yield
System and the O'Higgins system. The former picks the highest yielding
shares which satisfy certain other criteria designed to prevent you from
backing out and out losers. The latter is based on high yield shares with
low share prices. Other systems rely on technical analysis: studying past
price patterns in order to predict future price movements.
One investment system which often appeals to stock market newcomers is
tracking directors' share dealings. There is something irresistibly
appealing about the idea of getting what amounts to an inside tip from those
in the know - the people who run the company.
In the United States, publications tracking share dealings by company
directors are common; and they have caught on in this country during the
past 10 years.
All companies have to report all dealings by directors to the Stock Exchange
within five working days. These deals are then made available to the
screen-based information services, and published. The Financial Times
regularly gives details of all the latest directors' dealings in its Weekend
section.
The difference between insider dealing, which is illegal, and ordinary
sharedealing by directors, which is quite acceptable, is puzzling to many
people. Essentially, inside information about a company is knowledge of
facts which would be likely to influence its share price if generally known.
A person becomes an insider if he obtains this information by virtue of his
job: for example, if he works for the company or its auditors or bankers, or
if he gets his information from someone whom he knows to be an insider.
Insider dealing occurs when an insider takes advantage of this privileged
information to buy or sell shares.
Directors' deals which fall into this category are as illegal as any others.
And the stock exchange has tried to help honest directors to avoid falling
into this trap by setting out some guidelines. The catch-all rule is that
directors may not deal when in possession of 'unpublished price-sensitive
information'. Imminent bids are the classic example, but buying shortly
before your company landed an important order would be equally
objectionable. And since company results often influence the price of its
shares, directors are banned from dealing for two months before the results
are due to be announced.
The trouble, of course, is that it is not really possible to draw a firm
line between insider dealing by directors and their other dealings. They are
a continuum. Directors are always - one hopes - more informed about the
affairs of their companies than most outsiders. So even their acceptable
dealings have an inside flavour to them.
Investors who follow directors' sharedealings are relying on this fact. And
what they are looking for are those dealings which rely heavily on the
director's knowledge of the company's affairs. Selectivity is crucial.
Share purchases are generally more significant than sales. Nobody buys
shares if he thinks they are likely to go down in the near future, but there
are many reasons why a director might need to sell shares - divorce, school
fees or a new yacht, for example. But some of the most significant deals are
sales.
Directus, a firm which sells information on published dealings to both
professional and private investors, and also supplies the lists published in
the FT, has these suggestions for its customers:
look for purchases which are meaningful in relation to existing
shareholdings. As a rule of thumb, transactions involving more than 10 per
cent of a director's total holding are worth examining.
When several directors deal together, it is usually a worthwhile indicator.
But beware of new directors buying the shares they need to qualify for their
boardroom seats.
Substantial sales at the top of the market, followed by small purchases
later, can be misleading. The sales are usually more worth following than
the subsequent purchases.
Be particularly wary if a single director appears to be buying when the
whole of the market is selling. He may be trying to support the price.
If directors fail to take up their rights issue entitlements, it hardly
suggests confidence in the company's future. It is probably sensible to
follow their example.
Look hard at any dealings shortly before the close season ahead of the
company's results. It is directors' last chance to take advantage of their
inside knowledge without being classified as insiders.
Look out for companies where individual directors have a record of timing
their dealing well. Such men are worth following.
You can probably add to this list for yourself. For example, beware of
buying a new issue where all the money raised is going to its directors
rather than to the business.
It is also worth finding out as much about the company as you can, when
weighing up the significance of the deals. It is usually more significant
when a dominant entrepreneurial founder/director buys or sells. And in such
cases it often pays to ignore his explanations.
For example, when Alan Sugar sold Pounds 35m of Amstrad shares in March 1991
(and three of his co-directors also sold), he said that he needed the money
for some property investments. But within four months, the shares had lost
half their value.
When Hollinger, a company controlled by Telegraph chairman Conrad Black,
sold Pounds 73m of Telegraph shares in May this year, the newspaper's
management had not yet decided to cut its price in its battle against the
Times. But Telegraph shareholders who followed Hollinger must have blessed
themselves as the share price plunged more than by 40 per cent once the
newspaper price cut was announced.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Well tuned in Perigord - Martin Hoyle visits the
festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While France's most internationally famous festival flounders into financial
and administrative troubles at Aix, the smaller Festival du Perigord Noir
has just completed its 12th flourishing season. Set on the edge of the
Dordogne, the musical junket in the territory of pate, confit and truffle
profits from both compactness of vision and flexibility of lay-out.
The six-week festival is sub-divided into themes under the general division
of Baroque and Romantic. Different series of concerts overlap; venues
include the region's Romanesque churches and at least one massive chateau;
and the organisation is flexible enough to relocate at short notice a
concert from a cultural centre to a medieval cathedral in the event (as on
my first evening) of the heat causing both performers and strings to wilt.
Of notable interest to English readers is the festival's British presence.
This year the Tallis Scholars prompted no nervous thoughts of that famous
murderous ledge on the cliff-face of Roque St-Christophe's troglodyte
city-fortress, still gleefully pointed out as the Englishman's leap. More
Anglo-Gallic cordiality from the master-classes with a resident chamber
ensemble under the benign tutelage of Martin Lovett, from our own Amadeus
Quartet of revered memory. A performance of the Schubert String Quintet
revealed that rare thing, a young French ensemble actually devoted to the
idea of chamber music, not merely a collection of soloists manques, with a
young first violin of potentially international standard.
The ability to cut the festive coat according to the financial cloth which,
according to the ebullient artistic director Jean-Luc Soule, distinguishes
Perigord from the top-heavy and over-ambitious Aix, was seen in this year's
operatic offering. While previous festivals have seen Haydn productions with
orchestra, this year modestly fielded a three-hander by Adolphe Adam, Le
Toreador, which proved enchanting. Best known in this country for his ballet
music (Giselle), Adam's bubbling score for this little descendant of the
vaudeville chugs tunefully somewhere between Rossini and Offenbach, though
unexpected modulations and a typically French vein of drowsily chromatic
sensuality look forward to Poulenc and Satie - underlined by the happily
minimal rescoring of the accompaniment for flute and piano.
The frothy plot of amorous intrigue, misunderstanding and bluff unfolded
against Michel Ronvaux's wittily ingenious designs: black and white panels
that could be reversed or blossom out in the manner of pop-up picture books.
As the young flautist whose knee-trembling impact on another man's wife
resembles Alfred's tenorial terrorising of Rosalinde in Fledermaus, Yves
Coudray deployed a graceful lyric tenor that may be heard at Wexford next
year. Edwige Bourdy's soprano leggiero in the Mady Mesple mode did justice
to the sweetly tootling variations on 'Ah] Vous dirai-je, Maman' that form
the basis of a charming trio. The enthusiasm, high spirits and stylishness
of Mireille Larroche's staging illustrated the French gift of weaving
elegance out of the slenderest resources.
The bat that had dive-bombed the opera in the courtyard of the Chateau de
Hautefort brought his mate for next evening's indoor song recital. Edda
Moser froze in mid-Brahms with a look that combined outraged majesty and
hurt little-girl bewilderment, drawing all eyes to the frisking
chauve-souris above our heads. 'I go, I come back,' she muttered, sweeping
off the stage. Much waving of arms, opening of windows and one waggish cry
of 'Die Fledermaus]' from the audience before order and the diva were
restored.
Moser's soprano has lost colour and richness in the lower register. She now
excels in characterisation and dramatic declamation. Her final Strauss group
showed why she now sings Salome. Moser remains an opera star, gestures and
expressions slightly too large for the concert platform; can Elektra be far
away? Dinner in the courtyard afterwards, with a lightning storm
illuminating the dark panoramic sweep of the countryside as seen from the
castle's hilltop eyrie; and the French gift of catering to both high art and
the inner man had never seemed more admirable.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: The age of masked balls and hedonism - William Packer
delights in 'The Glory of Venice' at the Royal Academy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in May/ Balls and
masks begun at midnight, burning ever to mid-day . . .?
Browning's ironical lament was written when the snuffing out of The Most
Serene Republic by Napoleon was still, if only just, a living memory, and
Venice herself at her lowest ebb under the Austrian heel. To look back to
the 18th century, the period of this exhibition, was then indeed to look
back to a golden age, albeit the impalpable gold of a setting sun.
The Glory of Venice? In turning to the second and last extraordinary
creative flourish in the history of that constantly remarkable city, the
Royal Academy completes a double begun 11 years ago with The Genius of
Venice, which was that of her artists of the 16th century, from Bellini to
Titian and Veronese. By the time of the birth of Gianbattista Tiepolo in
1696, a full century on from the death of Tintoretto, the days of Venice as
one of Europe's great powers had long gone, yet her social authority and
creative energies, at least, were undiminished. Here she was at the turn of
that last great century with churches and palazzi still to build, and the
world to entertain.
With such artists as Sebastiano Ricci and Piazzetta at hand, and Francesco
Guardi, Canaletto and his nephew, Bellotto, and Canova and the younger
Tiepolo, Domenico, all to come, here surely was a team that only the century
of Titian itself could outplay. Above all, there was the great Tiepolo,
Gianbattista, bestriding his times as Titian bestrode his.
Given such evident accomplishment - and there are moments when the
pyrotechnical magnificence of it all, whether of the regattas and festivals
of Carlevaris and Canaletto, the castles of Bellotto or the soaring
compositions of Tiepolo, quite takes the breath away - what then had
changed? For here we have the sacred and the profane in subject-matter, just
as we had with Titian and Veronese, and certainly, with Tiepolo and
Piazzetta, two of the last great exponents of the great religious machine.
Yet suddenly how worldly it has become. But, you might say, was there not a
certain splendid worldliness in Veronese, for example? Yes, indeed: but that
quality now, in the 18th century, seems to take on more openly hedonistic an
aspect, flippant at times and even cynical. And what is cynicism but a kind
of civilised despair. How flightily Sebastiano Ricci's angel kicks its heels
at its visitation of St Peter. With what wicked a toss of the head
Piazzetta's angel flirts with its assorted saints - none of these artists
stands any of that nonsense of the sexlessness of angels.
How well-seen and physical in the modelling, how womanly, is Tiepolo's
Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, and how easily he slips into the
franker if still discreet eroticism of the delicious Armida with Rinaldo in
her garden. 'Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,/ On
her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed,/ O'er the
breast's superb abundance where a man might base his head.' And if we can
take our eyes off what is going on, we find the painted surface no less
physical, folds and foliage alike handled with a bravura freedom and
sophistication that are unsurpassable.
And of course life itself goes on, to be celebrated as much in the mundane
commerce of the city as in its festivals. With Carlevaris it is the state
procession on the Grand Canal: Canaletto gives us both the fun of the
Regatta and the teeming wharves of the Bacino: Guardi takes us into the
masked gaming halls of the Ridotto. We follow Longhi through the incidental
social round and go al fresco with Domenico Tiepolo to one of the most
humorously delightful parties in the show, with his masked dancers prancing
so neatly, footing it featly.
It is one of the many strengths of the exhibition that artists hitherto
under-played, such as Domenico Tiepolo, Carlevaris and Longhi, even Bellotto
and Piazzetta, now come into their own. The three Bellotto paintings, of
Verona, Dresden and the castle at Konigstein, are spectacular together, and
suddenly prefigure the northern realist schools of the next century, and the
work of such artists as Kobke and Eckersberg. The drawings of heads by
Piazzetta, too, of young men and women flirting together, is a revelation,
and it is the greatest pity that more was not made of the drawings of
Longhi, here represented by but two indifferent examples.
It is altogether a magnificent show, and 'Glory' is indeed the right word
for it, if only we are worldly and uncensorious enough to accept that
essential, insistent worldliness. 'And what of Venice and her people, merely
born to bloom and drop,/ Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and
folly were the crop: / What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had
to stop.' Did she, la Serenissima, foresee that end? Perhaps: but she also
knew, for the moment, that it had not stopped yet. It is that last great,
sad, wonderful interval that we now celebrate with her again.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: The bile of Berkoff - Alastair Macaulay on a double
bill of decadance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are many awful things about the world in which we live, and the
actor/author/director Steven Berkoff is right to hate them. But you know
what? The way he hates them only makes the world worse.
In his current double bill at the Riverside Studios, Berkoff unleashes his
usual vein of satiric hatred on the following: misogyny, lust without love,
greed, narcissism, over-emotionalism, sensationalism, homophobia, fattism,
brutality, and more. And, as usual, his method is to depict these things in
sustained satire. He wants to lampoon the decadence of the society we know.
The trouble, alas, is that his method is itself decadent.
The first, and shorter, of his two new offerings, Sturm und Drang, is about
three upper-middle-class sophisticates. The starting-point is two men airing
in private their contrasting views of women. Plainly modelled on the
sustained dialogues to be found in Moliere's plays, and on the rhyming
iambic pentameters into which Moliere is usually translated into English, it
also means to show us the awful shallowness and selfishness with which
polished modern men discuss women. ('My friend, it's really quite obscene./
To get your rocks off needn't cost a bean.') Then a woman joins them, and
her talk introduces us to other kinds of awful shallowness and selfishness.
Everything is shaped by Berkoff's relish for flashy but hollow dialogue. You
are encouraged to laugh at what his characters say and to despise them at
the same time. He should be scripting the 'Great Bores of Today' cartoon in
Private Eye.
Here, however, he is, clutching at any rhyme and any metre that will help
him out. The pentameters turn into heptameters and hexameters, the iambs
sometimes turn into anapaests, the rhymes become desperate ('horrid' with
'vomit') or just vanish entirely. 'Also I'm a bit pre-menstrual and my fax
has broken down' is one of the better verse lines here: no kidding.
I would be less bothered if Berkoff and his co-actors performed in a less
facile and flashy method. He likes his pieces to be performed with maximum
show-off. Technical bravura abounds.
Thus Berkoff, Timothy Walker and Katy Carmichael zoom from fortissimo to
pianissimo, run two or more sentences together in a single breath,
demonstrate florid gestures (the wrist-to-forehead classic is recurrent),
and so forth; and yet they also frequently chop up verse lines into separate
staccati. Were it anyone else but Berkoff who spoke the line 'Her. Satin.
Legs. Uncross. Like. Sighs.', I would speak of unstylish delivery; but this
pause-laden technique is widespread here.
There follows Brighton Beach Scumbags, in which Berkoff applies his scathing
satire to four sunbathers from Chingford. The play later includes two gay
men; Berkoff is sufficiently pc not to satirise them, and so we have the
weird experience of seeing one of Berkoff's typically overblown cartoon
sketches suddenly deflate, after an hour or so, into flat, mimsy, but
uncaricatured conversation for gays.
Berkoff's big point here - he wields it like a cosh - is that all these
people suffer from unnecessary paranoia. The fat lady thinks that the gays
are laughing at her; the gays think she is objecting to them.
As a pathologist of our social ills, Berkoff is of sophomoric level; but
those of you who like theatre to preach important messages should rush
along. Unfortunately, you will have to put up with Berkoff's stale parody of
Essex Person. There is the endless which-motorway-did-you-take conversation,
something Berkoff handles with none of Alan Ayckbourn's skill; there is the
poofs-are-just-women-in-male-bodies line (uttered more wittily in Jonathan
Harvey's current Babies at the Royal Court).
The terrible unoriginality of Berkoff's mind is made worse by his cartoon
method. Derek, Dave, Dinah, and Doreen are all mere types, and there is only
one fleeting moment when Berkoff has the humanity to turn one of them into a
real individual with specific peculiarities. This moment occurs late on,
when Derek mends a quarrel with Dinah by suddenly lying face-down on her lap
so that she can scratch his back: a moment so particular, and surprising,
that it has a freshness like nothing else I have ever seen in Berkoff's
work. (It doesn't lead anywhere here, but never mind; it gives me hope.)
This moment apart, there is no transparency to Berkoff's art. It is designed
not to draw attention to its subject matter but to the way in which that
subject matter is scripted and delivered.
This constant display of technique and method, this refusal ever to submerge
the ego into another character and into the larger world beyond Berkoff, is
the prime reason I call Berkoff a decadent artist.
If a thing is worth doing, Berkoff seems to be saying, it is worth doing
noisily, strenuously and frequently.
Sturm und Drang and Brighton Beach Scumbags are at the Riverside Studios,
Hammersmith, W6.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (8): 'For the brave and
knowledgeable' - Derivatives / Futures and options offer high rewards,
balanced by high risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial derivatives, such as futures, options or warrants, can offer
higher potential rewards than underlying cash securities, say bonds or
stocks. However, unless investors really know that they are doing, they may
often be better off leaving derivatives trading to the professionals.
'You can do it, but you have got to be disciplined, market-aware, have a
natural interest and understand the risks, have time and a gut feel for the
market,' warns Mr Hugh Morshead, director of marketing at brokers GNI. 'This
is something for the brave and the knowledgeable,' he says, adding that
investors must also have the financial resources to match their trading
activities.
The intrepid hands-on investor can trade derivatives directly through a
futures broker. In the UK, most derivatives are traded on the London
International Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe), which lists futures and
options contracts on interest-rate products, equities and stock indices.
Beginners might want to start with options contracts.
'I'd prefer to see anyone who gets involved in derivatives starting off by
buying options,' says Mr Trevor Robinson, head of derivatives at Fidelity
International. 'When buying options, you know exactly what you can lose.'
A buyer of an option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell
particular shares at a fixed price at any time up to a specific expiry date.
On Liffe, 'calls' (the right to buy shares) and 'puts' (the right to sell
them) are available in 70 different companies and on the FT-SE 100 index.
The buying of options involves a limited risk, as the maximum loss is the
price paid (premium) for the option, which is known from the outset.
Compared with buying a share, which can rise and fall, this is a low-risk
strategy.
Writing options, on the other hand, entails higher risks and should not be
undertaken without a thorough understanding of the product. 'Investors
should make sure they have cover of some sort. Writing, for instance, an ICI
option without owning the stock would be very foolhardy,' cautions Mr
Robinson.
Liffe is promoting the use of options by retail investors. 'Equity options
are highly suitable for individual investors,' says Ms Karin Forseke,
Liffe's director of equity products.
They may be used in a number of different ways, she says: as a form of
insurance against a fall in the price of a share an investor already owns (a
hedge); as a way of generating income from an existing shareholding (writing
options against it); or quite simply for straightforward speculation.
While private-client use of options on the US Chicago Board Options Exchange
amounts to some 70 per cent of total volume, private investors in the UK
remain shy of the product.
'It's largely due to a lack of education,' both of investors and the
investment intermediaries, Ms Forseke says. 'We get a large number of
requests for information from retail investors who tell us: my broker
doesn't want me to do this.'
'The industry hasn't succeeded as well as it should have in educating the
intermediaries,' agrees Mr Robinson. 'However, they should be given some
credit for being sensibly prudent by not letting clients do what they may
not understand.'
Liffe officials hope that equity options' popularity among among retail
investors will be boosted by the recent introduction of rolling settlement
on the London Stock Exchange.
Under the old system of account trading, investors could buy and sell shares
for a quick profit, without having to put up any money or take physical
possession of them. Now, each deal has to be settled 10 business days later.
Thus, options offer a fairly low-cost way for investors to take advantage of
short-term price movements without having to fund the whole position.
'Some private equity business will probably move to the options market' as a
result of rolling settlement, says Ms Forseke.
For more adventurous investors, futures can offer higher rewards - but also
higher risks, since the contracts have unlimited downside as well as upside.
Investors should be clear about whether they are dealing in futures
contracts to hedge existing cash positions - a conservative strategy aimed
at safeguarding the value of the portfolio - or whether they are driven by
speculative ambition.
'People who get involved in these markets directly have to understand
they're trading, not investing,' warns GNI's Mr Morshead. 'Small-time
traders aren't necessarily very good at trading leveraged markets. They
often lack the trading discipline required to know what to do when things go
badly.'
'If you want to speculate in the futures market, you need to have to have a
screen nearby and watch it all day, as these markets can move very quickly,'
says Mr Robinson, of Fidelity.
If all this sounds too daunting, private investors can place their money in
investment funds specialising in derivatives.
There is a vast array of offshore funds which invest in derivatives,
including commodity, currency, interest-rate, and energy markets. UK
investors can buy off-shore funds, although they are not always easy to come
by since they are subject to severe marketing restrictions in the UK.
Onshore, the closest thing to derivatives funds are Futures and Options
Funds (Fofs) and Geared Futures and Options Funds (Gfofs). They effectively
replicate the performance of stock indices, such as the FT-SE 100 Index,
Japan's Nikkei or the Hang Seng, which is why they are generally called
tracker funds. There are some bond and currency tracker funds, but the
majority are linked to equity markets.
'More and more wealthy private investors buy index trackers - it allows them
to know where they are, rather than handing their money over to a fund
manager and taking the risk that they may underperform the index,' says Mr
Peter Cotgrove, managing director of John Govett Unit Management, which runs
18 tracker funds. In recent years, index funds have become increasingly
widely used in portfolio construction, for tactical asset allocation,
hedging and efficient portfolio management, he explains.
Many tracker funds provide investors with the opportunity to benefit from
rising, as well as falling, markets by offering bull and bear funds. Both
the management fees and the costs of switching in and out of these funds are
extremely low compared with some conventional unit trusts.

<TEXT>
This portrait of Marlene Dietrich by Cornel Lucas is on show at the Saatchi
Gallery in north London until September 30, but will be sold at Sotheby's on
October 5 with an estimate of Pounds 300-Pounds 600.
It is part of Positive View, a major exhibition of over 200 photographs,
many of which were donated by their creators and most of which will be sold
at the auction to benefit two charities favoured by the Princess of Wales,
DEBRA and Chicken Shed Theatre.
Among the photographers represented are Bill Brandt, Irving Penn and Annie
Leibovitz, and among the striking images are the last taken of Marilyn
Monroe, by Bert Stern; Naomi Campbell captured in 1990 by Herb Ritts; and
Gilbert &amp; George has seen in 1974 by Cecil Beaton.
Another opportunity to acquire a work of art and help a good cause at the
same time is available at Christie's until September 21. The Royal Academy
Schools want to establish a scholarship to commemorate a distinguished RA,
the late Peter Greenham.
Many artists, mainly RAs, have donated works to help raise Pounds 150,000.
You can buy paintings by Patrick Caulfield, Carel Weight, John Hoyland,
Peter Blake, Terry Frost and more at very reasonable prices. But hurry: they
are going fast.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Much ado about opera in Cardiff - 'Beatrice and
Benedict'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From some of the media reports this week one would think that every opera
company in Britain is looking for a new building. What has happened is
rather that the opera companies have shown themselves to be the best
prepared at putting their case for money from the national lottery.
The position at the beginning of the week was that two - the Royal Opera
House and English National Opera - had drawn up plans for improving the
sites they already have. To these we can now add the major development
outlined by Welsh National Opera on Thursday. Alone of the opera companies,
it is proposing a wholly new building. An international competition was set
in motion late in 1993 to find a suitable design and this week the Cardiff
Bay Opera House Trust announced its choice.
From eight finalists the assessors selected Zaha Hadid, born in Iraq, but
based in London. Her glass necklace building enclosing a central auditorium
looks an ambitious and striking choice. The cost is estimated at Pounds 43m,
which compares well with the Royal Opera's far larger sum. Whether those
dispensing the largesse from the National Lottery will see fit to hand out
money to each of these rival operatic schemes must be a delicately balanced
political question.
In a way it will be a shame to say goodbye to the New Theatre, Cardiff,
which is currently WNO's home. The theatre may be cramped, but it has
intimacy on its side. Perhaps the company is aware of what it will be losing
and has decided to schedule some favourite small-scale operas in the
interim: Berlioz's Beatrice and Benedict, which opened in a new production
on Thursday, might almost have been written for the theatre.
Given the popular success of Kenneth Branagh's film version of Much Ado
about Nothing, it is surprising that Berlioz's adaptation of Shakespeare has
not been the talk of the opera companies' newly-powerful marketing
departments. What we get at WNO comes close to being the opera of the film.
Elijah Moshinsky's thoroughly enjoyable new production manages to conjure
just as poetic a vision of Italy on stage as the film's camera crew did
actually on location.
A warm evening light plays on the golden stone colonnades of a Sicilian
villa. In the distance are blue skies over the rooftops of a small village;
nearer to hand family and guests are preparing the evening meal, tonight's
menu being generous helpings of pasta. The scene is wonderfully airy and
convivial, like the opera itself. Moshinsky has devised a beautiful,
naturalistic production with help from his designers, Michael Yeargan
(sets), Dona Granata (costumes) and Howard Harrison (lighting).
It is a mark of his care that the performers move so easily from Shakespeare
to Berlioz and back again without dropping a stitch as they knit together
their characterisations. Sara Fulgoni makes a spirited Beatrice with curly
red hair and reading glasses, clearly a girl with a will of her own. It
helps that she has an individual voice, a shade bigger, more biting and more
boldly coloured than usual. Nor does Donald Kaasch's laid-back, shabby
soldier of a Benedict have any less personal magnetism.
Rebecca Evans as Hero and Patricia Bardon as Ursula join Fulgoni for
Berlioz's delectable duets and trios, carefully disguising the very
different qualities of their voices. It is not their fault that Donald
Maxwell's comic Somarone with a disparaging dislike for tenors and
viola-players came close to stealing the show, though Moshinsky might tone
him down a notch or two. Indeed, the same might be said of the orchestra
under John Nelson, an experienced Berlioz interpreter who sometimes
overestimated the volume necessary in this small theatre.
Berlioz described the opera as 'a caprice written with the point of a
needle', which really is possible here. With seats for 800 more people the
new opera-house will demand a bigger repertoire to match, but then that is
the project's very aim. Welsh National Opera is not a company that has ever
been short of ambitions.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: A prima donna gets her show on the road - As the
Romanian opera plans its trip to Britain, Martin Hoyle visits the company in
Bucharest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Men bow to her, female employees back nervously away, voices drop to an
awe-struck whisper as Madame sweeps majestically into the room. For just
over a year now the director of the Romanian National Opera in Bucharest has
been Eugenia Moldoveanu. Much as Barbara Jefford epitomised the diva in
Fellini's And the Ship Sails On, so this beautiful and imperious ex-soprano
(she sang at Covent Garden under Colin Davis) has 'prima donna' emblazoned
on her as if by Central Casting.
She has a hard task. It is not pre-empting my musical colleagues to note
that, as in many ex-eastern bloc countries, the current operatic production
style is less Cecil B. de Mille than DW Griffiths, despite such nods to chic
as a faintly ridiculous ballet (Nabucco) and hints of lesbianism (Samson et
Dalila, where Delilah's enjoyment of her handmaidens' caresses explains much
of her attitude towards Samson).
Nabucco and Samson will be touring Britain from this month with Madama
Butterfly. The Verdi was seen for a single performance in an outdoor
performance at Rochester Castle last year, when robust attack garnered an
unexpected crop of favourable reviews. The English promoter has been
disconcerted by new touches in the design and choreography. Long and bitter
arguments have ensued on the artistic front with the state-subsidised agency
Artexim.
This organisation illustrates the difficulties of a new mixed economy.
Rumour has it that some of the old regime's placemen have made a comeback,
even in the corridors of the ministry of culture. Pressures of another sort
are exerted by the private sponsors now vital to state enterprise; for
Romania too has its multi-millionaires, white-suited, open-necked, jewelled
crucifixes on bare chests, boasting Italian connections and not to be
questioned too closely on the source of their new wealth.
Because private sponsorship is a recent phenomenon, patrons are not quite
sure of their function. The news that the tour of a 200-strong tour, from
Bristol to Edinburgh, entails a certain risk and might not accrue a jackpot
profit, has taken some time to sink in. Allied to continual pressure from
officialdom, the resultant hiccups in negotiation have resulted in
brinkmanship up to the moment the trucks began to load the scenery for their
ten-day journey across Europe.
But at last the company is trundling towards an unsuspecting Bristol where
the tour opens. Financially things are patched up, politically there are a
few bruises. Musically the company shows the symptoms of the new freedom.
The outstanding Butterfly, between engagements in Vienna and Paris, has
stipulated no more than a handful of appearances. The company fields three
Cio-Cio-Sans. I heard the third in Bucharest: movingly acted, intensely
projected, even turning strained higher and lower registers to advantage
with dramatic use of words, she enjoyed the most integrated production of
the three works on offer. In Butterfly the dead hand of tradition has been
broken and a sacrosanct 40-year-old production has been conceded
'refreshment' by a young director and designer, possibly because the
octogenarian director is in no position to object - unlike the begetter of
the Nabucco and Samson stagings, officially replaced but still a potent
power in the wings.
The young Stefan Neagrau, only recently elevated to artistic directorship,
has a background in film and ambitious ideas that align him with such
internationally known Romanian directors as Serban and Pintile. His previous
productions, including an Elisir d'amore with Dulcamara dispensing
prohibition-era whisky and Nemorino signing on not for the army but the
secret police, marks him as a member of the 'producer's opera' era.
Of course, there are some who prefer the old style, in art as in politics.
The Romanian National Opera is at the crossroads. It must fight free of both
Loadsamoney philistinism and bureaucratic politicking. But then the same
might be said of Romania.
The Romanian National Opera opens in Bristol on Sept 20, visiting Oxford,
Sunderland, Edinburgh and Canterbury. A concert performance of Nabucco will
be given at the Albert Hall on Oct 17.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (7): Not a basket for all
of your eggs - Hedge funds / A look at the place of an instrument that has
disturbed world markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedge funds, which have been widely publicised both for contributing to the
turmoil in the financial markets in the first half of the year and for
offering potentially high returns, are limited not just to the serious
investor, but to the seriously-rich investor, because minimum investments
are high.
Most investors in hedge funds are high net worth individuals - although some
funds are also trying to attract institutional money. But even the very
wealthy should not think of placing all their eggs in the hedge-fund basket.
Investment in hedge funds only makes sense as part of a diversified
portfolio of investments.
According to International Advisory Group (IAG), a company based in
Nashville, Tennessee, which conducts research into US and offshore hedge
funds, a typical fund has a minimum investment of Dollars 375,000 and assets
of Dollars 15m, and has been running for four years. The manager himself
usually has more than Dollars 500,000 of his own money invested in the fund,
and management fees are relatively low at about 1 per cent, while
performance fees are around 20 per cent.
But what is a hedge fund? The term no longer has a specific and generally
accepted definition. Originally, hedge funds were US equity funds which
'hedged' against market declines by holding short, as well as long,
positions.
However, in order to enhance returns, some funds started to make use of
leverage - exaggerating potential gains and losses - and also to take large
bets on the direction of markets. These techniques are used by some of the
largest and best-known funds, such as George Soros' Quantum fund, which has
Dollars 10bn under management. They are generally known as 'macro' funds,
because investment decisions are based on macro-economic considerations.
Such funds came into vogue partly because fund managers found that, in order
to make substantial returns in highly liquid markets such as the foreign
exchange market and the bond markets, leveraged positions were needed. The
techniques they use were developed on the proprietary trading desks of Wall
Street banks and brokerages, which take positions in the markets with their
own capital. Without funds, individual investors would not be able to take a
view on markets such as the oil market or the currency markets.
But the techniques used by funds which place themselves in the hedge-fund
category are quite diverse. For example, while the so-called 'macro' funds
take leveraged positions in the world's bond and currency markets, others
concentrate on areas such as stock-picking, emerging markets and distressed
securities.
Further complicating the scene are futures funds, which have a different
history but often use similar techniques to hedge funds. Futures funds,
which started in the US commodity futures markets, are defined by their use
of derivative contracts. Some, but not all, argue that futures constitute a
separate asset class, the performance of which is not correlated with other
markets.
Futures funds, sometimes called derivative funds, also use a variety of
different techniques, and may concentrate on a specific market or use
'quantitative' techniques to invest in a wide range of markets.
Both hedge and futures funds are usually structured as off-shore funds,
which means that they cannot be marketed directly to UK investors. However,
there has been a trend to list funds on overseas exchanges such as
Luxembourg or Dublin.
Nevertheless, for UK individual investors who do want to put their money
into hedge or future funds, deciding which fund to choose is a tricky
business.
With other investments, such as investment trusts, investors typically make
choices based on the reputation of the company involved, which is usually
long-established. This is much more difficult with hedge funds, not only
because of their much shorter history, but also because they are often based
on the trading prowess of an individual.
In reality, UK investors who do buy such funds usually do so because of a
friend's or acquaintance's recommendation. While 'marketing' is forbidden,
funds in practice rely on word of mouth to do their marketing for them.
The problem is that an excellent record of, say, several years is no
guarantee of future performance, particularly in this field where gains and
losses tend to be exaggerated. In addition, 'the investment management
community here is geared up to provide a product which follows a market,
such as a UK equities growth fund,' according to Mr Adam Parkin, managing
director of LCF Edmond de Rothschild Fund Management, which runs two funds -
Integral Managed Futures (with Dollars 9m under management) and Integral
Hedged Assets (Dollars 13m).
The option taken by many investors is to buy multi-manager funds - that is,
funds which are invested with, say, half a dozen hedge-fund managers
pursuing different strategies. Some companies set themselves up solely to
choose fund managers on behalf of clients, often giving themselves titles
such as 'manager of managers'. They argue that the process of choosing
managers in this specialised area is similar to the demands of stock-picking
in the equities market, requiring extensive research and analysis.
While the fees charged for such services are often considered to be high,
the approach does offer clear advantages, given the volatility of earnings
of hedge funds and futures funds.
'We are big proponents of the multi-manager funds, because they do spread
the risk,' said Mr Dixon Boardman, managing general partner of Optima Funds,
which have about Dollars 600m under management. 'You will never be the top
of the pops, but you will never be the bottom either.'
For example, Optima's macro multi-manager fund, investing in the currency
markets, is down 5 per cent this year, which, while not impressive, is not
the disaster seen by other funds either.
According to research by IAG, macro funds have posted the best average
returns over the past five years, with an average of 30.6 per cent,
substantially higher than for other types of fund such as market-neutral at
around 12 1/2 per cent or aggressive-growth (often concentrating on smaller
cap companies expected to grow rapidly) at around 18.3 per cent.
However, in the difficult first six months of this year, macro hedge funds
lost an average of more than 10 per cent.
But over the past five years, perhaps surprisingly, IAG found the average
risk of loss for the macro funds was among the lowest, at 5.3 per cent,
compared with 5.5 per cent for market-neutral arbitrage funds and 13.3 per
cent for aggressive-growth funds. However, the risk of loss does not
necessarily provide an accurate pointer for future performance.
'Hedge funds have inherent in them an element of risk that is not present to
the same degree in many other investments,' IAG points out. 'That risk is
the future use of bad judgment by the fund manager, relating to highly
concentrated portfolio positions and/or leverage.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: Mexico's version of Hallowe'en - Bernard Simon joins
a colourful and intense celebration of death in the south-western state of
Oaxaca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 2am, and Atzompa cemetery is coming to life. A brass band has struck
up just inside the arched entrance. Family groups, their faces illuminated
by hundreds of candles, are crouched around the graves, arranging the
marigolds, loaves of bread, skull-shaped sweets and ornaments which festoon
each mound of earth. More families, laden with decorations, are streaming in
along a dusty, moonlit path from the nearby village.
The night of October 31 marks the official start of the Dias de los Muertos
(Days of the Dead) festival, when Mexicans celebrate death in a fusion - and
profusion - of Christian rites and pre-Columbian traditions.
The festival, which reaches its climax on November 2, All Souls' Day, is
observed in many parts of Mexico. But it is at its most colourful and
intense in villages like Atzompa, in the south-western state of Oaxaca,
where the pre-Columbian Zapotec culture flourishes.
There is nothing morbid or macabre about the Days of the Dead, but Mexico's
version of Hallowe'en has more serious overtones than North American
trick-or-treating. It is a serene, even a joyous, occasion when the living
are reunited with the spirits of their dead relatives, while contemplating
the transience of their own existence.
No effort is spared to welcome the returning spirits. Senor Velasquez,
affable proprietor of the charming Las Golondrinas (The Swallows) Hotel in
Oaxaca city, sets aside an entire room for the elaborate altar which is the
centrepiece of every family's celebration.
The Oaxaca municipal authorities sponsor a competition for the best altar.
Las Golondrinas has yet to win, but the certificates hanging in the guest
lounge attest to its efforts.
The celebration is not confined to homes and cemeteries. Oaxaca's street
markets are stocked with altar and grave decorations in the days leading up
to the Dias de los Muertos. Most conspicuous are the round loaves of
slightly sweet bread, known as pan de los muertos. The loaves come in many
sizes, but each one is decorated with an angel face or skull painted on a
small flour-paste decal.
Activities around the tree-lined main square include a fireworks display,
live music and parades. Unfortunately, a North American twist has started to
creep in. Urchins shouting 'Hallowe'en, Hallowe'en' try to prise a few pesos
from patrons at the outdoor cafes lining the square.
Our excursion to the cemeteries started just before 11pm on October 31. It
was a chilly night, but Alberto, our guide, had brought along a few bottles
of mezcal - fire-water made from cactus juice. We were also each given a
taper candle, decorated with strips of coloured foil.
Atzompa was our first stop, but the work of decorating graves had barely
begun at 11.30. We resolved to return later. Things were busier at two
cemeteries in Xoxocotlan, another barrio on the outskirts of Oaxaca. A
vendor of 'hot dogs exquisitos' was doing a brisk business at the entrance
to one. At the other, some youngsters, presumably bored with decorating
graves, had gathered around a ghetto-blaster.
Activity was both quieter and more intense around the graves. Women did most
of the work. At one grave, coloured sand had been arranged to form an
elaborate, life-sized white skeleton adorned with an over-sized green and
yellow head-dress, also fashioned from sand. Dozens of votive candles
circled the family's work of art. The head of the grave was a mass of
brilliant red gladioli, mixed with orange marigolds.
Most families stay up all night. They need to complete their grave and altar
decorations by 4am when, according to Zapotec legend, the spirits of dead
children return to earth. The spirits depart again for the netherworld about
four hours later, when the tiny candles which commemorate them are snuffed
out.
The adult spirits supposedly arrive during the afternoon of November 1, when
the coloured strips on the candles are replaced with black ones, and depart
early on the morning of All Souls' Day.
But we returned to our hotel in Oaxaca even before the younger spirits had
made an appearance. Our minds and bodies had succumbed to the mezcal.
Oaxaca is 400km, or a 50-minute flight, south of Mexico City. There is also
a luxury bus service, which takes about eight hours. The most comfortable
hotel in Oaxaca is the stone-walled Stouffer Presidente, converted in the
1970s from the 16th century convent of Santa Catalina. More
moderately-priced hotels include Las Golondrinas, which has 18 rooms facing
lushly-planted courtyards; and the Hotel Trebol, which is close to the
square and the Benito Juarez market.
Other attractions around Oaxaca include the ruins of the ancient Zapotec
mountain-top capital of Monte Alban; the Mixtec and Zapotec settlement at
Mitla; the weavers' village of Teotitlan del Valle; and teeming markets
selling everything from green-glazed pottery to fried grasshoppers.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: Where only the Buddhas grow fat - Visitors to Burma
must live with the knowledge that tourism provides currency to sustain its
regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mandalay, Rudyard Kipling's fabled city, has retained its drawing power. Its
lyrical name, its status as Burma's last royal capital and its isolation
from the rest of the world give it a tenacious hold over the traveller's
imagination.
But as the visitor jolts down the pot-holed road to the sprawling, dusty
city, the enigmatic image gives way to something more sinister.
'Tatmadaw (the Burmese army) and the people crush the enemies of the union,'
screams the slogan on the fort that was once the site of Mandalay's royal
palace and now serves as the army's headquarters. It is an absurd but
depressing reminder of the mentality of Burma's ruling junta, the State Law
and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC.
Having earned world opprobrium for a catalogue of human rights abuses and
for repression of the democratic movement in the late 1980s, SLORC is
sensitive about its image. Tour guides sign declarations that they will not
talk about the government - a stricture enforced by government informers.
Severe restrictions are imposed on tourists' freedom of movement.
For all that, only the most blinkered tourist would fail to notice evidence
of the people's suffering. For example, any visitor would be struck by the
peculiarity of the Burmese currency, which is chiefly denominated in 45 and
90-kyat notes. The 50 and 100-kyat notes were abolished, without any
warning, by the government a few years ago. This attempt to damage the black
economy cost many people their life savings.
The signs of government repression are noticeable even in sparsely-populated
parts of Burma such as Pagan, an eerily beautiful, pagoda-studded city which
has been largely deserted since it was sacked by the army of Kublai Khan in
1287. Its crumbling remains of over 2,000 temples and pagodas, which were
erected by Burma's rulers 900 years ago, form one of the most remarkable
historical sites in Asia.
Until four years ago, the village of Pagan was situated by the main temples
on the plain. But at the time of the elections in 1990, the villagers were
ordered - without warning - to leave their village and move five miles down
the road. 'We lost everything,' said one villager, gesticulating at the
flimsy wooden shack he now calls home.
This was not an isolated incident. In recent years, the government has
evicted hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and moved them into
shanty towns. The government's motive in these apparently pointless
clearances is generally regarded to be revenge on areas which opposed it.
Travelling around the country, tourists become acutely aware of the Burmese
people's appetite for even the most basic consumer goods. They are besieged
with offers to trade old lipsticks, cigarette lighters and even the shirts
off their backs for opium weights and hand-crafted lacquer-ware.
Further evidence of the hardship of the life of the Burmese people is
provided by visiting the markets which generally offer a meagre showing of
rice, dried fish, fly-blown meat, chillies, peppers and fermented fish
paste. The poverty of the people is evidence of the mismanagement of a
country which has sunk from being one of the richest countries in Asia to
being one of its poorest - in spite of its natural wealth of rice, rubies,
teak and oil.
Burma's lack of development creates a sense of being in a time warp.
Transport in Burma is largely confined to ox-carts, pony traps, bicycles and
Jeeps left over from the second world war. Older British makes of motor
vehicles, such as Hillman and Triumph, are spoken of with the enthusiasm
usually reserved for the latest model. 'British cars are the best-made cars
in the world,' said a tour guide solemnly.
To the tourist, however, Burma's backwardness and isolation undoubtedly
contribute to its beauty and charm. Travelling in Burma leaves indelible
impressions of faded colonial grandeur, of gilded temples, of golden rivers
snaking through paddy fields and of haughty cheroot-smoking women who
pattern their faces with pale yellow make-up made from ground bark.
Also striking is the exuberance of the people's religion. Burma is one of
the world's most devoutly Buddhist countries, where nearly all men become
monks for some part of their lives and most people donate a large proportion
of their income to the temples.
People's generosity is such that Buddhas grow fat with ever-increasing
layers of gold leaf, while the temples' exteriors are kept glistening with
gold and jewels. Burma's most important temple, the Shwedagon Pagoda in
Rangoon, is plated with 8,688 solid gold slabs, with a tip set with 5,448
diamonds, 2,317 rubies, sapphires and topaz and topped with a huge emerald.
However seriously religion is taken, it remains a noisy, fun affair. The
atmosphere of the temples sometimes resembles that of fairgrounds, with
disco-like neon lights dotted around the Buddha images, loudspeakers noisily
demanding donations and a variety of astrologers, fortune-tellers and games
of the sort that promise good luck if the player succeeds in throwing coins
into bowls.
Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of Burmese religion is the emphasis on
spirit-worship. Burma has 37 of these spirits, which boast names like the
Lady Bandy Legs, or the Lord of Five Elephants. Temple grounds often have an
array of statues of these spirits, which are worshipped with an enthusiasm
that stems from a belief that they will do mischief to those who do not pay
them sufficient respect.
The country's backwardness makes travelling around the country something of
an ordeal. Rat-infested, mildewed hotel rooms and erratic, accident-prone
airplanes are part of most tours.
In some respects, travel in Burma is now easier than it has been for some
years. The country is relaxing some of the restrictions it imposed after the
pro-democracy demonstrations of 1988. After several years of restricting
visits to a maximum of seven days, visas are now valid for 14 days.
But visitors still have to contend with the exorbitant cost of visiting
Burma. The official exchange rate is arbitrarily set at a level so high that
buying a beer costs more than Dollars 10. Many tourists prefer to take the
risk of exchanging dollars or selling whisky on the black market, which
makes their money go 15 times as far. But the value of such ruses is
limited: it is hard to avoid paying hard currency for large items, such as
travel and hotels.
Visitors must live with the knowledge that tourism provides much of the hard
currency that sustains the regime. But those whose curiosity overcomes their
scruples are likely to be enthralled by a country which, as Kipling said, is
'quite unlike any land you know about'.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: Paddleboat pampering on Big Muddy - Christina Lamb
cruised part of the Mississippi on the Delta Queen, an historic steamboat
fitted out like a floating palace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes just one blow of a steamboat whistle on the quay at New Orleans to
find yourself transported into the storybook past of the Mississippi
paddleboats. Like multi-tiered wedding cakes, they churned the muddy waters
with their giant wheels, transporting men in Sunday suits and women in
be-ribboned bonnets towards their dreams.
The Delta Queen is about to set off. The great red wheel starts churning and
a top-hatted man on deck taps out a reedy version of 'Toot toot tootsie,
goodbye' on the calliope (or steam organ), sending puffs of smoke out of its
shining brass pipes.
In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain wrote that it was every boy's
ambition to be a steamboat man. Generations of children brought up on his
books have fantasised about running away from home and following in
Huckleberry Finn's footsteps along the great, brown river.
For a not entirely modest sum, the Delta Queen Steamboat Company offers the
chance to slip away from modern-day stresses and live out that fantasy on
one of its two paddle-wheel steamboats. Some people prefer the Mississippi
Queen with such modern amenities as cinema and pool. But, for romantics,
there is no choice but its elderly relative, the Delta Queen.
Now in its 68th year of operations, the Delta Queen is the oldest steamboat
in the world offering cruises, and has been declared a US national historic
landmark. It is like a floating palace with teak-panelled state-rooms, brass
fittings and Tiffany-style stained glass. As a result, it is easy to imagine
the days when silk-clad ladies sat doing embroidery while the men played
poker in the for'ard bar.
The Delta Queen runs tours of between three and 12 days through America's
heartland. Wanting to do things properly, I opted for one called 'The Old
South', which promised to 'recapture the ambience and history of this
gracious way of life'.
The scenery on the 682-mile round trip from New Orleans to Vicksburg, on the
lower Mississippi, is disappointing. Known as the chemical corridor, the
banks are lined with refineries and petro-chemical plants spewing out yellow
smoke and thick oily globules. But you do not take a trip like this for the
sights.
Nor for the excitement. Progress is so stately that the boat is often
overtaken by cyclists. Fellow passengers tend to be over 65 and like wearing
name tags. For those who do not relish playing bingo or dressing up for
floozie parades, day-time activities consist of reading the daily
Steamboatin' Times and flying kites (which usually end up tangled in the
wheel).
Nights in the bar are spent listening to the quavery crooning of the
ever-smiling Charlotte Champagne or dancing in the Orleans room, where
tireless Bob Schad is a whizz on the banjo. But even the most energetic soon
settle into the slow rhythm on-board, punctuated by occasional sightseeing
stops and frequent large meals of local delicacies such as alligator and
catfish.
The main pastime is river-watching from one of the rocking chairs on deck.
TS Eliot called the Mississippi 'a great brown god', and it captivates
quickly. On waking in the mornings, we could see it at its most mysterious,
swathed in a low mist from which the tops of submerged trees poked through.
At night, under the silvery glow of a full harvest moon, it was almost
beautiful. But it was at its most soulful during the day, the Delta Queen
nosing through thick, chocolate-brown water which even the US Army Corps of
Engineers cannot control as, flush with spring rains, it changes course and
bursts banks to show that it is not to be messed with.
Known as Big Muddy, the Mississippi is the longest river in the US, draining
all or part of 31 states on its winding, 2,500-mile journey from the hills
of Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. It is also America's hardest-working
waterway, carrying 500m tons of cargo each year in enormous, snaking lines
of connected barges. These, as long as five football fields, tend to take up
the whole river as they round bends.
There is so much traffic that the Delta Queen's jovial Captain John Davitt
compares the river to 'driving on an interstate highway'. But while motorway
drivers may go faster than 7mph, they do not have sandbanks and floating
logs to contend with. Avoiding these obstacles, and the barges, requires
great skill from the river pilots who drive the steamboats. And becoming a
pilot is not easy: the licence is granted in 20-mile segments and those
applying have to draw, from memory, every turn of the river, sandbar, bridge
and buoy in that stretch.
The Delta Queen's stops are orchestrated to shield passengers from contact
with the 1990s, although it is hard to avoid the tin-roofed slums and
proliferation of riverboat casinos (to which many of the crew slip off).
On our first morning we moored at Oak Alley, a Greek revival-style,
antebellum plantation house painted candy pink and reached through a grass
alley of 300-year-old oaks so gnarled that the branches touch the floor and
meet overhead to make an archway. Inside the drawing room, a painted wooden
screen stands in front of the fire; it used to prevent beeswax make-up,
layered on to cover smallpox scars, melting into the ladies' laps.
Our next stops were St Francisville, a pretty town under a veil of Spanish
moss, and Natchez, home to more than half the country's millionaires in the
1850s. Louisiana was the centre of the plantation economy and the lower
Mississippi area is dotted with large, colonnaded houses, built mostly
between the late 18th century and the civil war to show off the wealth
generated by cotton, indigo, rice and sugar.
Every year, during March, many of these private mansions are opened to the
public to show off opulent (and often tasteless) interiors, plus gardens
resplendent with magnolia and dog rose blossoms. Their lavish settings, and
names like Rosedown or Nottoway, inspire romantic images of crinolined
belles and dashing beaux with waxed moustaches.
Finally, we came to Vicksburg, which is positioned on a steep bluff
overlooking the river. During the civil war it was a Confederate stronghold
defending the whole of the lower Mississippi. In May 1863, General Grant's
army marched on the town; when the Confederates refused to surrender, he
ordered his army to starve them out. The bloody siege lasted 47 days. Now,
in the immaculately-kept Battleground Park, the old cannons still point at
each other while red and blue markers show where the Yankee and rebel troops
fought.
Each stop we made was marked by a huge puff of steam and a frenzy of
calliope-playing. Locals or camera-toting tourists gathered on shore to wave
us off, recalling the 'Steamboat a' comin]' days of last century when
paddle-wheelers like this used to rule the river.
The Delta Queen was built in a Glasgow shipyard in the 1920s for the
Californian Transportation Co. Its owners poured Dollars 875,000 into
creating a four-tiered, balustraded beauty. Used initially as an overnight
dinner cruiser between Sacramento and San Francisco, the depression forced
its withdrawal from service until Pearl Harbour. Then, it was requisitioned
by the navy, painted grey and used as a troop transporter.
Since then, the Delta Queen has passed through various owners and overhauls.
It even survived congressional legislation passed to prevent the operation
of wooden boats after a tragic fire on a cruise-liner.
The most spectacular part of the boat is the engine room. Passengers are
welcome to see the pistons driving a 40ft-long Pitman arm connected to a
crankshaft which turns the 44-ton paddle wheel.
Every so often on steamboats, pressure from the boilers gets so high that it
has to be relieved through a safety valve - the origin of the expression
'letting off steam'. After a week being pampered on the Delta Queen, I can
think of no better place to do that.
Christina Lamb travelled with the Delta Queen Steamboat Co of 30 Robin
Street Wharf, New Orleans. Information: tel (800)-543 1949.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (6): Get started with a
Pep - Tax planning / The annual maximum may not seem much, but a married
couple could have sheltered Pounds 110,400 by now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
Tax planning for the very wealthy is far broader in scope than for those
with more modest means.
Although all the basic tax-planning steps of maximising personal allowances
and using tax-efficient investments still apply, wealthier investors will
find it worthwhile to engage in other tax-efficient devices, such as setting
up a trust or taking advice about offshore investments.
Tax-efficient investments
If you already have a stockbroker managing a discretionary portfolio, he is
likely, as a matter of course, to protect the portfolio against capital
gains and income tax through the use of a personal equity plan (Pep), into
which an annual maximum of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 into a general plan
and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep) can be invested annually.
This may not seem a large amount, but a married couple who have made use of
Peps since they first came into existence in 1987 (and who had already used
up their 1994-95 tax-year allowance), would have sheltered Pounds 110,400 by
now.
More exotic and riskier tax-efficient investments include the new Enterprise
Investment Scheme (see page 16 of this survey) and enterprise zones. The
latter give tax relief on most of the cost of an investment in designated
commercial property, and on the interest on borrowings to fund the
investment. It is, in principle, a 10-year investment; and, since it is
potentially risky, anyone considering the investment should take
professional advice.
CGT and IHT planning
Everyone has an annual capital gains tax exemption of Pounds 5,800, which
can be used up by 'bed-and-breakfasting' shares - by selling them one day
and buying them back the next - or by realising gains in the same year as
losses.
It is also possible to delay paying CGT by reinvesting the gain in shares in
an unquoted trading company. There are other CGT mitigation measures
available to those who own their own business but, since this is a
complicated area, it is best to consult your tax adviser.
For many people wanting to protect their wealth from inheritance tax, the
use of a trust will be essential. A trust is a legal arrangement between the
person providing the funds (the settlor) and the person holding them (the
trustee) for a beneficiary.
If you want to pass money on to your adult children, an
interest-in-possession trust, confines tax made on capital gains in the
trust to be taxed at 25 per cent, rather than 40 per cent. The tax on income
will be at your children's rate of tax, rather than your own; and, provided
you survive 7 years after drafting making the trust, it can reduce an
inheritance tax bill from 40 per cent to nothing.
Trusts can also be used to protect money against the unexpected. If the
trust has been drawn up correctly and the trustees chosen wisely, your money
will be managed in accordance with your wishes, even if you fall prey to
mental illness, and after your death will prevent your wealth being eaten up
by avaricious relatives or future creditors.
Those worried that a future government might put up direct taxes or reduce a
rapidly-diminishing set of loopholes, can use existing legislation to set up
a trust.
Caroline Garnham, tax and trusts specialist at the City firm of Simmons &amp;
Simmons, says: 'The existing taxation of wealth is not riddled with
loopholes; it merely happens to be exceedingly generous. Under a Labour
government, this will undoubtedly stop. A trust is an extremely convenient
way of passing wealth to the next generation now, and so taking advantage of
the existing tax rules without losing control over the investment and
management decisions.'
Traditionally, any prospect of a Labour government has sent millions of
pounds offshore, to avoid the reimposition of exchange controls. This
process, even if the funds are held in trust, according to Garnham, is only
tax-efficient for those who are non-UK domiciled but UK resident. Otherwise,
the funds remain chargeable to income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance
tax if either the settlor or their family can benefit from it during the
settlor's lifetime.
However, the offshore trust can be used as a tax-efficient way of passing
money on to beneficiaries. As with an onshore trust, there is no CGT to pay
on death; but in an offshore trust, tax on subsequent capital gains will be
deferred until a capital payment is made to a beneficiary.
Does tax mitigation, using trusts, always involve benefiting others at your
expense or waiting until after your death before it becomes tax-effective?
Not necessarily, says Garnham. 'But in most cases if you want to have your
cake and eat it, the scheme will be based on flaws in the legislation, of
which there are now precious few.'
You can set up an offshore structure to defer CGT future gains during your
lifetime, but 'these schemes are highly complex. They are only really
appropriate for those prepared to fight if needs be,' warns Garnham.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: A moss bed under a blue night sky - Nicholas
Woodsworth enjoys the simple beauty of Finland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four or five hour's drive out of Helsinki, in one of those modern Finnish
towns that pop out of the endless forest with no warning, I stopped and
bought a few cassettes for the car.
Back on the road, I turned up the volume and let Sibelius's dark, brooding
spirit crash and swell and roll out of the windows into the wilderness. When
travelling in Nordic countries, one should always be well stocked with
melancholia.
The odd thing on this trip, though, was that through all the great outdoors
there was no corresponding echo to the composer's cry of angst. I had taken
other trips when the whole Nordic world - dull, leaden, gloomy - had seemed
to me to want nothing more than to slit its collective wrist. But this was a
perfect early summer's day, as light, carefree and guiltless as the breeze
dancing through the pines.
Savo, the vast Finnish lakeland that stretches along the Russian border,
sparkled in the sunshine. So complete is the meeting of earth and water here
that I was happily confused, not knowing whether I was driving through
forest sprinkled with 1,000 lakes or across an inland sea sown with 1,000
islands.
It was a perfect time of year, too late for spring snowstorms, too early for
mosquitoes or tourists. Along the roadside, stands of silver birch fluttered
in tender green leaf. New rye sprouted in fields where, here and there, the
thick walls of the forest had been hacked back. Wooden barns, freshly
painted, glinted bright, brazen red. The world seemed young and hopeful.
Most extraordinary of all, contrary to everything we have ever learned about
the fleeting nature of sunny summer days, this was a sunny summer day that
was not going to end, at least not for many weeks. Savo lies just below the
Arctic Circle.
In high summer locals forget the soul-chilling winter that devours months
whole and stuffs them into its long black maw - around the mid-summer
solstice, when the sun barely dips below the horizon, the darkness of night
is unknown. For gloomy Finns, shut up in obscurity for most of the year,
this is a short, zany time, a period of incandescent exuberance.
Following small roads that wound about between lakeshore and forest, I drove
to Savonlinna, a town built on a little chain of islands set in a channel
between two great lakes, Haapavesi and Pihlajavesi - as Finnish names go,
they are among the more pronounceable.
In the 1920s, Savonlinna was a busy centre for the steamship companies that
provided transportation - when the water was not frozen solid - through the
lakeland area. Today, small lake freighters, barges and passenger boats
still chug through the narrows past the town.
But the big lure of the place now is an event shorter even than summer
itself - in July, Savonlinna is transformed from a sleepy little northern
town into a tourist attraction as, night after sunny night for a month,
Olavinlinna Castle plays host to one of the world's northern-most opera
festivals.
Who, for heaven's sake, would build a medieval castle lost in the forests of
the far north, I wondered? But Olavinlinna, an island-fortress of brick
towers and stone walls rising from the waters of the channel, is as
substantial and imposing as any castle in Britain or Spain.
It was built more than 500 years ago by the powerful Swedish empire as an
outpost on their Russian frontier, I read as I settled down by the water
with my guidebook. I was so used to the idea of Swedes as gentle makers of
diet crackers and givers of peace prizes that I had never considered the
possibility of a vast and aggressive Swedish empire.
I read on. The Great Wrath, the Lesser Wrath, endless invasions and famines,
cedings and border changes, 200 years of domination by Russia - Finland, it
seems, has spent most of its existence being batted about between one
northern power and another.
I read late into the night under a bright sky. By the time I looked up,
hours had gone by, and I decided to wander along and see how small-town
Finland coped with the midnight sun.
As in small towns everywhere, there is not a great deal for young people in
Savonlinna to do, so they have devised their own solution. They drink.
Perhaps it was because it was a Friday night, or because school holidays had
started. Perhaps it was the pressures of Finnish history, or the manic phase
the short summer season brings on. Whatever the reason, the young men and
women of Savonlinna, as most Finns seem to be, are heroic tipplers. At
midnight they were out on the streets in force and weaving about like
bingeing sailors.
Many Finns drink outside because the bars are impossibly expensive, and that
is fine by me. But somehow, armies of drunks throwing up in bushes and
peeing off bridges are a little hard to take in the full light of day. On
the other hand, if I spent nine months a year in a deep-freeze with the
lights out, I am not sure I might not celebrate summer with a drink or two
as well.
The whole town was still sleeping it off when, early next morning, I placed
a heavy rock in the bow of my rented canoe and paddled away from Savonlinna
and out into an endless world of lakes and islands. Attractive when seen
from the shore, Savo is spectacularly beautiful from the water.
The Finns are a curious lot, moody and inward-looking. If they have a wild
aspect to their character, they are also profoundly attached to the subtle
and secret world of nature that surrounds them. There is nothing more
important for urban Finns than to quit the city occasionally and find their
roots again in the great outdoors. Most have a cabin somewhere on a lake, a
river or deep in the bush and, in summer especially, a return to such
peaceful places is a ritual.
Bright mauve lilac bushes, neatly-trimmed lawns running down to the water,
white-painted flag-poles flying long pennants of the Finnish colours, boats
rubbing against wooden docks, busy elderly ladies in gardening hats - at
first the shoreline that I paddled past was a version of suburbia.
But as I began to lose myself in an archipelago of rocky pine-covered
islands, the properties became less frequent and cruder. A small cabin set
back in the trees, a boat pulled up on the rocks, a weathered sauna beside
the water - Finns like to be close to nature.
There is a northern beauty that is like no other beauty: nothing but wood,
water and stone covers the face of the earth. It is a simplification that
brings great peacefulness. At the same time the extreme harshness of the
climate can produce intricate designs: twisted and writhing branches,
sculpted cones, the finest covering of needles.
I travelled for hours, the canoe gliding between islands over clear dark
water laced with a skein of yellow pollen from the pine forests. Once I was
startled when a vast, naked Finn charged out of his sauna and with a great
yaaaaagh] hurled himself down a long wooden dock and into the lake.
Otherwise, calm reigned. There was the regular lift and fall of my paddle,
the call of birds from banks of sedge, the occasional faint thok of wood
being split beside a distant cabin. When evening came, I stopped at an
uninhabited island. Tired, I lay down in moss as thick and soft as any
mattress, and under a bright blue sky that refused to go away, fell asleep.
As well as Savonlinna there are towns nearby offering hotel, farm and simple
cabin accommodation. A good way to experience Savo is through a
canoe/camping expedition. Niskanen Harri of Savonlinna (tel: 949-673 055;
fax 957-273 101) rents canoes, houseboats and sailing boats.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Truth of the Matter: Golden serials for tea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday afternoon is when it strikes. You have unloaded the shopping. You
have grappled with all 12 sections of the newspaper, and won. The dishwasher
chuckles comfortingly. The dogs are in their baskets and the kids glued to
their computer terminals. But then there is the terrible feeling of
something missing in the day.
Where is the classic serial?
Like a shot of guilt, or irredeemable nostalgia, you register this absence.
Once it was always there, as regular as vespers. It might be Louis
Stevenson, it might be E. Nesbit or, best of all, a triple-decker Dickens
with Arthur Lowe (of Dad's Army fame) playing Mr Micawber.
For about an hour, everything was right with the world with a giant pot of
tea, pyramids of buttered toast and the television (for once) serving as a
genuine focus - a place where families might huddle and coalesce: a
flickering, gladdening, substitute hearth.
It was, of course, Lord Reith's BBC, or the vestiges of it; and everyone
knows that Reith, on record as regarding television as 'a social menace of
the first degree', brought the full weight of Scottish Presbyterianism to
Sunday broadcasting. Until 1957, in fact, Reith created a break in
transmission early in the evening in order not to distract church-goers.
Before the break, there would be a play for children, perhaps a Shakespeare
adaptation; afterwards, something contemporary (say, JB Priestley) or
'classic' (Chekhov, Shaw, O'Casey and many others): the range was
formidable.
That this aspect of Reith's Sabbath has disappeared will be defended
aggressively by the present BBC and its director-general, John Birt. Back at
the birth of television (it will argue), we were accused of depriving
children of the delights of reading novels by themselves. Now, you beg us to
adapt those novels for the screen and, at the same time (to preserve your
weekend lie-in), to wean those children on the same bland pabulum of morning
cartoons as the commercial stations.
On those grounds, the disinclination of Birt's BBC to follow Reith's pattern
of edifying Sundays is just about pardonable. What is less comprehensible
are the complaints voiced at the Edinburgh television festival recently by
Greg Dyke, erstwhile head of London Weekend Television.
His concerns are twofold: first, that 'in commercial broadcasting, the
delicate balance of being both a business and a broadcaster is in danger of
being too dominated by business'; and, second, that 'the relationship
between government and broadcasters is becoming a dependent one.'
The logic of this double grudge is odd. He wants the BBC's transmission
system to be privatised ('to take it out of the political arena'); and he
wants it 'to be told that it is not the role of the BBC to get involved in
the commercial marketplace'. Otherwise, he claims, the raison d'etre of the
licence fee is gone.
For a patent example of television's vulnerability to state paternalism, one
has only to look across at Silvio Berlusconi's Italy where the viewing
public has, effectively, become one politician's audience.
The politics of the licence fee, however, are secondary to what one might
call its ethics, or even its aesthetics. Vested interests always will
intimidate the production of probing documentaries: but what has happened to
that old article of faith in the BBC: that television is Britain's only
truly 'national theatre'?
Lamenting the loss of the classic Sunday serial might seem about as
fogeyistic as bemoaning the lack of woodcuts in the Radio Times, and equally
futile. And deploring Birt's commercialism is too commonplace to repeat
here.
Yet, it remains frustrating to know that the BBC has, via the licence fee,
the capacity (witness Middlemarch) and the power to create television that
is not only culturally magnetic but also gets an entire family gathered
around it. A measure of paternalistic intervention is absolutely what we
need.
To pray for the blessing of the good Lord Reith on our Sundays might be in
vain - but I, for one, shall do so devoutly.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Articulated truck v articulate Arthur: Kieran Cooke returns
to old Dublin haunts and has a close encounter with a master raconteur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese have a quaint habit of proclaiming various venerable personages
living treasures - to be cared for and looked after much in the same way as
the British list their buildings or the Americans preserve their redwoods.
If Ireland were to adopt the Japanese system - instead of waiting until
anyone is well and truly dead before proclaiming him or her 'a great
character and a credit to the nation' - my friend Arthur McCoy would be a
prime candidate.
Nothing like settling back in the warm seat of a Dublin bar after a long
absence from the country and listening to Arthur ('The Real') wind himself
up to tell a story.
Arthur is to the meat trade what Coco Chanel was to fashion or Henry Ford to
the motor car. Arthur knows every meat mart and abattoir in Europe. He knows
the trade's every wrinkle. Arthur was once hired as a meat detective,
tracking down container loads of beef that had gone missing under mysterious
circumstances.
'Once I saw a wagon going the wrong way on the Autobahn in Germany. Instead
of heading for Syria it was going to Finland. When I finally caught up with
it there was one rump steak left in it. Driver had met up with a girl in
Hamburg and done a runner.
'I had to go down to his mother's house in Kerry looking for him. She starts
crying saying she didn't for the life of her know what had happened to her
Shane. I says to her that while I sympathised with her I didn't know what
had happened to my container load of meat either.'
As every raconteur knows, it is not just the story, it's the way of telling
it. Arthur had a serious car accident recently.
He stands to tell the tale, a large vodka and red lemonade in one hand, a
cigarette in the other - waved round like a conductor's baton at moments of
particular emphasis.
'Wait till I tell you now,' he says in that Dublin growl similar to
sandpaper being scraped across the bottom of a bird cage.
Your knee is tapped to ensure full attention. Arthur clears his throat and
casts a masterly eye over his audience in an effort to achieve some degree
of quiet.
'The first thing I admit was that I was stupid. There I was happily belting
along the motorway in Northern Ireland, not a care in the world. Next thing
I know the car is entered for the 3.30 at Cheltenham and is leaping up over
the barrier, doing a somersault.
'Out through the front window I go and I'm sliding along the other side of
the road. Now while all this is going on I'm thinking that I'm going to ruin
my suit. Funny what comes to mind at such times.'
A gulp of the drink followed by a deep puff of cigarette - removed from the
lips with all the flourish of Pavarotti using his handkerchief.
'An articulated truck is coming the other way. I can hear the tsuk, tsuk of
the brakes.' (Arthur is bent down, imitating a container truck. He is
pulling on handles and pressing brakes. The vodka red tosses about in the
glass but not a drop is spilled.)
'I see the smoke coming from the tyres and the radiator with the word Volvo
getting bigger all the time . . . next thing I know I'm in an ambulance with
an Ulsterman asking am I all right. For a second there I wondered which
place I was in. I introduce myself and say that I never felt better.'
'Anyway,' (another tap on the knee just in case your attention is not
entirely on the matter at hand) 'they have me up in court. Now I was cute
about it.' (A knowing wink and slight inclination of the head here.)
'I used my full name - Arthur Lesley McCoy. You see the Lesley is very
important in Northern Ireland. It shows them I have a foot in both camps so
to speak. They can't really decide whether I'm one of them or one of us.'
(Coughs, choking laughter. Drinks all round.)
'Come here while I tell you. The magistrate asks what I have to say for
myself.'
'Well, your worship, sir, nothing.'
'Nothing Mr McCoy?' says he, raising a quizzical eye over his half glasses.
'Well, your lordship, I'm guilty. You have me fair and square. Carelessness.
Foolishness. I was going too fast. Daydreaming. Lost control and over she
went. I'm very sorry.
'The magistrate takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.'
Arthur, taking a gulp of his drink, does the same, massaging his palm round
a couple of bloodshot sockets.
'Mr McCoy,' says your man. 'By all accounts you had a very close shave with
death.
'I would describe it as more like a photo finish your honour,' says I.
'With that the whole place was laughing. A Pounds 100 fine and I was out.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / Escape from the Himalayas: a family's ordeal - Stefan
Wagstyl advises travellers to India to be prepared for surprises after his
adventures in the mountains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL

<TEXT>
The soldier poked around in the boot and asked: 'Have you got any bombs or
guns?' 'No,' replied our driver. 'Well, be on your way,' said the guard,
slinging an ancient Lee Enfield rifle on his shoulder and wrapping his cloak
around him to keep out the icy early morning wind.
The Drass Valley, in the Himalayas in the north Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir, is the second coldest inhabited place on earth after Siberia. The
towering mountains keep out the sun so effectively that even in summer in
the narrowest parts of the valley, the snow and ice never thaw.
The valley is also full of soldiers, being less than three miles in places
from the disputed border with Pakistan.
I had never had the slightest intention of visiting this remote and hostile
territory, particularly not with my wife and three small children. But
travellers in India have to allow for even the most unlikely surprises.
Our adventures began with a five-day holiday in the mountain kingdom of
Ladakh, lying just inside India's border with China. Most of Ladakh lies
north of the Himalayas; the mountains block the rains and snows so Ladakh
gets as little water as the Sahara. But there is a wild beauty about its
rocky landscapes and about the bright green oases which flourish around
streams and rivers, including the Indus, which flows through the heart of
the region. At 11,000ft and more, the thin air is so clear that everything
seems closer than it really is, making the landscapes unbelievably vivid.
The first Ladakhis were Tibetan nomads who brought with them Tibetan
Buddhism and a language which is closer to Tibetan than to any Indian
tongue. Their white-painted monasteries cling to the mountains and their
stupas and prayer stones dot the valleys like the relics of some prehistoric
civilisation. Even though Leh, the Ladakhi capital, has been turned into a
military base by Indian troops guarding the disputed frontiers with Pakistan
and China, Ladakhi people have managed to preserve their gentle and
spiritual culture.
But, despite its other-worldliness, Ladakh is remarkably accessible - being
only a one-hour flight from Delhi. So, a trip to Ladakh is a good way to
spend a long weekend - but only if the weather is kind. For us, it was not.
The sun shone from a cloudless sky for the first four days, ideal conditions
for aircraft at Leh airport. But on our last day the clouds came down and
showed no sign of lifting. Even though the air force keeps the airport
running all year round, there is nothing it can do about the cloud. After
waiting for three hours, we heard the flight was cancelled. The airport
manager said the aircraft could come the next day or the next week. 'You are
lucky. In winter we are sometimes closed for a month,' he added helpfully.
Our hearts sank. The idea of an indefinite wait did not appeal, particularly
as this was the beginning of September and the temperatures were already
dropping fast from their brief summer highs. The children had already seen
as many yaks as they wanted and moaned at the thought of more days in the
terrestrial equivalent of outer space.
The only alternative to flying was the road. A two-day trip - either west to
Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, or south to Kulu, a hill station on the
southern side of the mountains. Srinagar, with its political troubles did
not appeal in the slightest. But the airport at Kulu is also frequently
closed by bad weather. So, anxiouslywe opted for Srinagar.
We stocked up with apples and chocolate and with bread and cakes from Leh's
German Bakery, which is capable of turning out wonderful apple cheesecake in
the most unlikely surroundings.
A car was found - one of India's venerable fleet of Ambassadors, the Morris
Oxford lookalikes. Regzin, the driver, promised he did not drink and had
never had an accident. With considerable trepidation, we set off.
The road started by winding across the long valley of central Ladakh. The
clouds grew thicker and the winds blew grit and sand in all directions. We
saw bedraggled-looking sheep and goats, and, at one point, a couple of
foreign trekkers, huddled together under a sign proclaiming the virtues of
Himanuk, the corps of army engineers who built the road.
The plateau ended abruptly and the road snaked down to the Indus, through
the first of many sets of hairpins we would see. No crash barriers, here or
anywhere else. We winced at the sight of a truck lying upside down on the
rocks below.
The road is open for only six months of the year. It is closed in winter and
spring when the waters released by the thaw wash away chunks of asphalt. We
saw gangs of workmen repairing the roads, digging holes and breaking rocks,
their faces blackened with the tar they heat on open fires.
They were not Ladakhis or Kashmiris, but migrant labourers from the plains
of Bihar, India's poorest state. About 1,000 miles from home, they seemed
more out-of-place than we did.
The Ladakhi villages we passed looked surprisingly prosperous. With their
yaks, sheep and goats, their fields of barley and orchards of apples and
apricots, they seemed to have learned to live well in the harsh terrain.
By the afternoon of the first day, we reached the Fortula Pass, at 13,500ft,
the highest point between Leh and Srinagar. The mountains here fold into
even stranger and wilder formations than around Leh.
There are walls of brown and yellow like those of the Grand Canyon,
Dolomite-like spires of grey and black, and purple craters which might
belong better on another planet. 'The moonscape viewing point,' said a sign,
pointing out the obvious.
Below the pass, the landscape gradually became greener and the villages
larger. Among them was Mulbekh, site of a 2,000-year-old statue of Buddha
carved out of a single rocky outcrop standing by the road. We stopped to
stare at its enormous bulk. The priest stared back at our children, perhaps
the first white children he had seen.
Exhausted, we reached Kargil, the only town between Leh and Srinagar and our
halt for the night. The Caravan Serai Hotel was about to close for the
season. But the owner, Mr Iqbal prepared two bedrooms and a supper of
lentils, rice, boiled potatoes and cauliflower.
He apologised for the service, explaining that things had been better
'before the militancy'. It was the first reference we had heard to the
insurgency which has left at least 10,000 dead in Kashmir since it broke out
in earnest in 1989.
The following day, evidence of the fighting multiplied as we crawled closer
to Srinagar. Leaving Kargil, the last outpost of Buddhism, we drove into the
heartland of the troubled Moslem region of Kashmir. The landscape was as
spectacular as the day before, but less barren, with grass and trees on the
lower slopes of the Drass Valley and the Zojila Pass, the only gateway
between the heart of Kashmir and Ladakh.
Our impressions were dominated by the presence of the army, which controls
the route. Soldiers with machine guns man outposts along the single track
road. The traffic is one-way - in the morning and early afternoon traffic it
moves from Kargil to Srinagar; then the other way around.
An army convoy heads the queue in each direction, spewing diesel fumes and
stopping frequently to make sure that even the oldest vehicles do not get
left behind. Then come taxis, buses and lorries. We drove just behind the
army, staring for much of the way at the machine guns of three soldiers
sitting in the last jeep. The soldiers became nervous as they reached closer
to the top at the pass, scene of one of the few pitched battles of the
insurgency.
But even here, nature demanded as much respect as the militants. The army
trucks stopped one by one for the drivers to worship at a small Hindu
shrine, a memorial to dead sappers. Since the road at this point clung to
the face of a 3,000ft cliff, it was, I felt, an appropriate time for prayer.
Even the children were quiet for a while, awed by enormous slabs of rock,
guarding this, the entrance to the Himalayas.
Below the Zojila the road was easy, winding down a gentle valley to
Srinagar. But the army became more and more intrusive. In 50 miles, we were
stopped six times at sand-bagged checkpoints.
As foreigners we were treated reasonably well, unlike the Kashmiris, who
hate the soldiers as much as the soldiers seem to hate them. We saw about 20
men standing in line along the road, while soldiers searched their bus,
throwing the luggage out into a roadside ditch.
In the late afternoon we finally reached the lovely green lakes of Srinagar
and the comfortable houseboats of Mr Ghulam Butt.
After the rigours of our journey, I immediately knew what a Mughal poet
meant when he said of Srinagar: 'If there is paradise on earth, it is here,
it is here, it is here.' The houseboats were moored by flower-filled
gardens. Kingfishers perched on the decks. Ramzan, the bearer, brought tea
and home-made scones.
But even here, the effects of the fighting were visible - in the empty pages
of Mr Butt's visitors' book and in the rotting timbers of the boats he could
no longer afford to maintain. The boatman mournfully looked at our children
and said: 'Yours are the first white children I have seen in five years.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (5): Keeping it almost in
the family - Investment trusts / The open markets offers a tax-efficient
route
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Family trusts are usually very private things, handled discreetly by the old
family solicitor and stockbroker. But a handful of wealthy families have
taken the unusual step of using investment trusts, listed on the London
stock exchange, as vehicles for their personal investment portfolios. The
option is only open to seriously rich investors, but it does carry tax
advantages.
Three of the very small number of trusts run along these lines are managed
by partners in the same firm - Cazenove &amp; Co. The trusts involved are
Updown, Capital Gearing, and the tiny Hotspur. Anyone is free to buy shares
in the trusts on the open market, but they all have a core of long-term
investors belonging to the different families and their associates, who are
represented on the board, and can influence the investment policy.
Updown is connected to the Wills family, of tobacco fame; Hotspur is the
family trust for the Duke of Northumberland; and Capital Gearing has always
had ties with the Harding family of Northern Ireland.
Similarly, the Finsbury Trust, managed by Finsbury Asset Management, is
still half owned by the family of the late Sir Walter Salomon, the founder
of the trust.
Harry Henderson, the Cazenove partner who manages Updown and Hotspur,
believes that other families could benefit from using a similar structure.
The main advantage of using an investment trust is that investments can be
bought and sold within the trust without incurring capital gains tax. This
makes it ideal for families with substantial portfolios dedicated to
investment for long-term growth, who do not want the managers to be
restricted in their investment decisions by tax considerations. Of course,
capital gains tax may be due when shares in the trust are eventually sold or
the trust is wound up.
Having an investment trust to call your own also means that its portfolio
can be tailored to meet your precise needs - income or growth, low or high
risk, or any particular enthusiasms. Managers benefit from having a body of
loyal shareholders who will stick through the bad years as well as the good.
The easiest way to create a 'family' investment trust is to acquire an
existing trust, rather than start from scratch. The would-be owners and
their advisers look for a suitably sized trust nearing the end of its
scheduled life, or which has run into difficulties with a very wide
discount. They then make a bid for the trust. Once the new owners are in
control, they can restructure the trust as necessary and dispose of the
existing portfolio to meet the new requirements.
For example, Cazenove bought into an existing trust called Updown, on behalf
of the Wills family in 1978, after liquidating the previous family
investment trust - Malton - largely for tax reasons. Hotspur was formed from
the British Kidney Patients trust, which had been due to be wound up in
1990.
Naturally, there are some drawbacks to using the investment-trust route. The
set-up costs can be quite high, because of legal and professional fees
incurred in selecting, acquiring and restructuring a suitable existing
trust, as well as the actual cost of buying it. You need to make a long-term
commitment to the trust for it to be worthwhile.
And it is only practicable if your family has a few million to invest: the
smaller an investment trust is, the more burdensome the fixed administration
costs become. Hotspur, at less than Pounds 3m, is one of the very smallest
trusts around.
Also, an investment trust cannot be a purely family affair - by law they
cannot be 'close companies', defined as companies where less than 35 per
cent of the voting shares are held by the general public. In the case of the
three Cazenove trusts, about half of each trust's shares are held by family
members and directors, with the rest held by the public.
The charm of family investment trusts is that they can reflect not only
their beneficiaries' investment needs, but also their character. Take
Hotspur, for instance. The name means 'reckless and rash' - not a reference
to the trust's investment strategy, but to an ancestor of the Northumberland
family. The trust was named after the son of the first Earl of
Northumberland, Sir Henry Percy, who appeared in two Shakespeare plays under
his nickname Harry Hotspur.
Capital Gearing's name, on the other hand, reflects its investment policy:
buying shares principally in split-capital investment trusts with the aim of
maximising capital growth.
The fund was launched by Major GWC Harding, a member of the family it still
benefits, when he was working at stockbrokers Sir RW Carden, later taken
over by Capel Cure Myers. Major Harding still sits on the board, together
with another Harding family member.
Capital Gearing is a small trust - it has assets of about Pounds 13m - and
its shares are very tightly held. Its record has shown the perils of buying
into a small, illiquid trust: when only small numbers of shares can be
bought in the open market, even tiny fluctuations in demand can have a
serious impact on the share price.
A few years ago, Capital Gearing's performance put it at the top of the
comparative tables, so demand for the shares rocketed. The share price was
driven to a crazy premium to net asset value - a premium of more than 90 per
cent at one stage. Typically, investment trusts trade at a discount to net
assets of about 10 per cent, or a premium of a few points for the most
successful funds.
Not surprisingly, the anomaly in Capital Gearing's share price was soon
eliminated, and the share price came back down to earth. Therefore, in share
price terms, the fund's performance over certain recent periods has not been
impressive, but the underlying assets have been growing at a steady rate.
Long-term shareholders will have been unaffected by the market antics, but
anyone who bought at a large premium will have suffered. However, the
trust's board has announced its intention of providing outside shareholders
with an exit opportunity at about asset value in 1998.

FT  17 SEP 94 / As They Say in Europe: A French youth, free of innocence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suppose Edward Heath, the British prime minister from 1970 to 1974, had been
mixed up with Oswald Moseley's fascist movement in the 1930s and had helped
draw up a list of undesirables to help an eventual occupying power.
Even in secretive Britain it might have emerged that he was not, perhaps, a
wholly suitable potential leader. At the very least the cabinet secretary
would have been tipped off by the head of MI5: 'Ted hasn't got 20 shillings
for the pound,' or some such argot would have scuppered him.
In France, things are different. A bit of fascist collusion for a man of
Francois Mitterrand's generation was not exceptional. Then a bit of light
work on the other side and one could emerge from the cocoon of collaboration
as a butterfly of the resistance. But Mitterrand, at a time of his own
choosing, has co-operated in revealing the truth about his past. Admittedly
the French president did wait until the last days of his presidency and
maybe his life, to come clean, but come clean he did in backing the now
well-known book by Pierre Pean, Une jeunesse francaise.
That, and the serious worries about his health, led to a long television
interview on Monday. There, Mitterrand argued that he had not done much that
was wrong. He had been a bit late in changing sides. He had befriended the
man who had been the Nazis' manager of the Holocaust in France, Rene
Bousquet. But Bousquet had been publicly cleared, even though his associates
had left nobody in any doubt as to his central role in the matter.
The newspapers reacted diversely. Liberation said that anyone looking for a
mea culpa when it came to Bousquet might well have spared themselves the
trouble. One provincial paper thought the president could end his term with
a clear conscience.
There was alarm about the role of the press in France, but even that took
different forms. Le Figaro said the press had turned on Mitterrand as it had
turned on other presidents at the end of their reign. But, as is usual with
Le Figaro, the reality is different. Most facts about Mitterrand, it seems,
were, by and large, in or near the public domain. It would not have taken
much to show he was on the fringes of the nastier xenophobic groups in the
1930s and that he dined with Bousquet in the 1980s. After all, he put a
wreath on the tomb of the Vichy leader, Marshall Petain, annually until
public opinion forced a change a few years ago.
So the question is, why was it that the truth did not come out until
Mitterrand licensed it? Only Le Monde has taken this question to heart. Its
in-house ombudsman, Andre Laurens, wrote a 5,000 word piece headed:
'Francois Mitterrand under the eye of Le Monde.' He explained how the paper
had played a vital role in exposing the many scandals of his reign and got
into trouble as a result: 'The irony is that the paper is reproached on the
one hand for not having told what it did not and could not know, and on the
other for not having believed the statements of public figures.'
Those who expose unpleasant secrets in France do get into trouble. But the
problem of Mitterrand runs deeper than that. The French cannot resolve it.
They like to think Charles de Gaulle was the presidential incarnation of
France, but of course the truth is that Mitterrand is the mirror of the
nation. He is the two Frances, the nation of the enlightenment, the
revolution and liberty. And of xenophobia, anti-republicanism and
intolerance.
Mitterrand symbolises the contradictory aspects of France's recent past  -
the ideological opportunism and the unique nature of French collaboration
with the Nazis, the myths of the resistance, the creation of a successful
modern state and the continuity of pointless minorities on the far left and
far right.
The National Front leapt to his defence. Its weekly, National-Hebdo, ran the
headline, 'Nothing to get excited about' and reported that anybody who had
read the far-right press would have been familiar with all Mitterrand's
transactions with the Vichy regime and he had done nothing wrong anyway.
The curious fact is that France's great figures, unlike Mitterrand, always
emerge from some glorious national salon des refuses. They are outsiders -
Henri IV and Napoleon, or rejects and rebels - Voltaire, Lavoisier, Victor
Hugo and de Gaulle.
In Britain, by contrast, all national heroes - Elizabeth I, Shakespeare,
Adam Smith - were heroes to their contemporaries. Sometimes that is a fluke
of history. No British leader could have faced the choices that confronted
Mitterrand: none could have supplied appropriately damaging material for a
sensational political biography called 'A Youth of an Englishman'. So no
Englishman can master the arcane intellectual skills that come so easily to
the French. He has no need of them.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Flying solo in turbulent air -
Simon Walsh meets a City escapee whose dream has taken some nightmarish
twists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'I can remember arriving back at work on Monday morning after a weekend's
parachuting, going back to jump that evening, jumping again on the Tuesday
morning and still being back behind my desk by 9am.'
Erstwhile foreign exchange dealer David Parker recalls how in 1976 he found
that life on the Square Mile was good, but not good enough.
'I was getting by in the foreign exchange market and I was enjoying it, but
I didn't feel I was going anywhere, and I didn't fancy spending the rest of
my life as a passed over foreign exchange dealer rattling into Bank tube
station five days a week.
'The obvious solution was to set up in sport parachuting. At that time most
clubs were informal groups getting together and pooling re-sources.
'I thought there would be room for a seven-day-a-week sport parachuting
centre, working as a fully commercial operation.
'I wrote to 30 such groups asking if they liked the idea of going full time
on a commercial basis.'
Among the groups to respond was one based on Headcorn Aerodrome in Kent. He
liked the location: 'Probably one of the most densely populated areas in the
UK, with Greater London and the South East for a catchment area; and at that
time there was little competition.'
The Headcorn Parachute Club began trading in 1979 on capital of Pounds
5,000. There was no shortage of weekend adventurers willing to hand over
good money to let go of a Cessna 206 at 2,000ft.
The problem was how to make a profit from the cost-intensive business of
flying an aircraft, and hiring a space at the airfield while keeping prices
within reach of the market.
'It's an equation which is really quite difficult to unravel. We would lose
quite significantly on experienced jumpers going to altitude - 10,000ft or
over, while we would make money on the loads of students jumping from
2,000ft, as they would be paying more money for less time in the aircraft.
'The mainstay of our revenue has always been the student jumps and it still
is. However we do not now make the losses that we used to make, even on a
percentage basis - because we have bigger aircraft, have become more
efficient, and prices have caught up somewhat.
'The cost of running our Britain Islander Aircraft is Pounds 250 per hour at
break even. We charge Pounds 14 a head for an altitude lift of nine people
so that generates an income of Pounds 126. We can do two of those in an
hour.
'If we put seven students in, each paying Pounds 20 we have an income of
Pounds 175 and it only takes 15 minutes, so you have a potential to earn
Pounds 700 per hour, which is a good profit.
'However, if you have winds under 10mph, you will be taking up students.
Over 10mph and you can take only experienced jumpers.
'You cannot run an exclusively student-oriented operation because you would
never have enough instructors, and if you did you would never progress into
a fully-fledged parachute centre.'
David formed two further companies, Slipstream Adventures to provide
'Accelerated Freefall', an advanced form of training that allows beginners
to experience freefall on their first jump, and the Kit Store to market
parachutes and related equipment.
The Kit Store, says David, has a steady turnover of Pounds 120,000 a year.
'Most of the profit goes in management fees. But the income I do get is
income I don't have to work for at all, and there's not a lot of capital
tied up in it. It's just set up, and more or less runs itself.'
In April of 1988 David invested in a turbo prop aircraft, expensive to buy,
but cheaper to run, and with a much longer working life.
In March of 1989 the aircraft was taxying when a parachutist, in the final
stages of descent, collided with one of the propellers and was killed. The
parachutist was Tania Pond, David's fiancee.
'It was the most devastating experience of my life. It took me a long time
before I could come back here and fulfil any useful role. I would just come
in, sign the cheques and go away again.
'I certainly started drinking a lot. But I am not aware of it having left
any long term scars.
'Of course it's always there and always will be there, but time is a great
healer, life must go on, and you cannot go on in grief for the rest of your
life.'
He lost the aircraft, and what was to follow would lend precious little
comfort.
'I borrowed Pounds 190,000 from a finance company in 1988 to purchase the
Turbine Islander.
'When we had the accident it left us with a repair bill in excess of Pounds
100,000. which we took out of cashflow. Then the Aircraft hull insurers
refused to pay up, as did the parachutist's third party insurers.
'The net result of that was having put Pounds 100,000 into repairing the
aircraft, I could no longer afford to maintain it.
'I asked the finance company to repossess the aircraft. They repossessed it,
but have done nothing with it, it's just been left sitting here.
'They're now saying they've lent this money and want it back with interest.
I'm saying the aircraft was worth at least Pounds 200,000 when they
repossessed it, but is now a rusting hulk, and that they should have sold it
when they took possession, used it constructively, or at least looked after
it properly.
'Up till now we were just writing letters to each other, but I found out
recently that now they are going to sue my companies and me personally. We
will obviously fight it with everything we've got.'
Last year, figures for two of the three companies dipped. Headcorn Parachute
Club lost Pounds 31,000 on turnover of Pounds 286,000 against a 1992 profit
of Pounds 65,000 on turnover of Pounds 337,000 in 1992. Slipstream made just
Pounds 800 on turnover of Pounds 59,000, down from Pounds 15,000 profit on
Pounds 88,000 turnover the year before. Parker expects Headcorn to move back
into profit this year. He says he refuses to be beaten.
'Running a full-time parachute centre is not so much a business venture,
more a vocation requiring business acumen. You are working without respite,
no break whatsoever. What brings you through is your love of the sport.
'Yes, we are riding some extremely rough waters right now, but no, we are
not on the rocks.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (4): Pick your City chap
with care - Private-client stockbrokers / Empathy is vital, writes Anthony
Bailey. Avoid any broker who doesn't ask enough questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are heir to even a modest fortune, you are likely to inherit a number
of accessories that go with it. One part of the package could be the family
broker, representing a firm which has been passed down through several
generations along with the family silver.
This is very convenient for those who do come into money and for whom the
City of London is alien territory. If some chap there can carry on as before
and provide one with a private income, why disturb the arrangement?
Indeed, he may work for the private-client department of a blue-chip broking
house or merchant bank. You cannot do better than that, you might think, so
long as you have the required Pounds 1m or Pounds 2m minimum portfolio size.
Such an understandable attitude would not win the approval of Justin
Urquhart-Stewart, the energetic promoter of Barclays Stockbrokers:
'A number of events, including Big Bang, have opened up the stockbroking
world. There is now considerable competition. Many high net worth people
want to make use of execution-only services, perhaps having only part of
their capital managed for them.' The key to finding the most suitable broker
is to draw up a shopping list, he adds - advice echoed by Geoffrey Turner,
of the stockbrokers' trade body Apcims (*Association of Private Client
Investment Managers and Stockbrokers), who points out:
'We represent 95 per cent of private-client brokers, who have some 300
branches between them. Half of the branches are outside London, but they can
give as good a service as those based in the City.'
Empathy between you and your broker can play an important part in
establishing a successful relationship, says Mr Turner. That could mean that
you need to interview several brokers. Most will be prepared to have an
exploratory face-to-face chat.
Establishing what level of service you want, your income and growth needs,
particular financial planning requirements and the level of risk that you
can live with is essential. Give the cold shoulder to any broker who does
not ask enough probing questions.
You should also try to get an idea of investment performance, whether you
want a full portfolio management service or intend to take your own
decisions with advice. Many brokers run their own unit trusts. Their
relative performance against the appropriate benchmark indices should give
some indication of investment ability, even if you do not intend to make use
of them.
The quality of advice and portfolio management will depend in part on the
depth of research and analysis. Ask a broker how he makes his buy and sell
recommendations, and what research he has to back them up. You should also
check on how many companies the firm follows. FT-SE stocks will be the
bread-and-butter of most firms; but does a broker have any specialist
knowledge of small, local firms or investment trusts, for example?
Then consider any extra services you may need. Not all brokers deal in, for
example, traded options. Yet active and more sophisticated investors will
want to make use of this investment route, more so now that account trading
has been curtailed by rolling settlement.
Another tool to replace account trading is margin trading, where you put up
only a portion of a purchase price. The rest of the money is borrowed, and
you can close your position without ever putting up the full price. Again,
margin trading is still a service offered by only a minority of private
client brokers, though more are likely to offer it in the future.
Similarly, not all brokers have the facility or expertise to deal in US or
European stocks. But an increasing number of investors want access to these
markets through direct equity holding rather than managed funds.
Cash management facilities and control of stock through nominee accounts are
other matters to sort out. Brokers are restructuring their services to cope
with the five-day rolling settlement timetable due next year. Find out how
any deposit account linked to your broker works, and in particular check
that it promises a competitive rate of interest on any balances.
When it comes to nominee accounts, you should look at the charges carefully,
but find out whether you can continue to hold share certificates if you wish
to. Many brokers prefer their clients to use nominees. Some insist on it.
Perhaps one of the enticing aspects of becoming a well-loved client is the
chance to participate in placings. This is where companies come to the
market for the first time and place some of the new shares with, among
others, private-client brokers.
'We keep our own list of clients who are interested in this. But placings
are only available to genuine clients, and not to people who contact us
because they have read we are involved in a particular issue,' says Peter
Green, of Henry Cooke Lumsden.
Share placings can, in any case, prove to be a mixed blessing. 'We don't do
placings. By their nature they are smaller companies and higher-risk. There
is always too little stock to go round if they are any good, and nobody
wants the bad ones,' says David Chapman, of Capel-Cure Myers.
Many new issues have risen rapidly to mouth-watering premiums, and it is an
ongoing gripe that private investors have not had a fair look in. Yet many
new, unknown companies have come to the market and nose-dived.
The existing system is unfair, but it simply makes it more likely that the
best new-comers will find their way to institutions. By all means establish
whether a broker gets involved in this activity, or whether he can keep you
aware of all new issues, but it should not be one of the main items on the
shopping list.
Finally, whether you are looking for an execution-only service or full
discretionary management, get a detailed breakdown of charges. Charges may
seem like little more than loose-change to the serious investor. That is
precisely why brokers can get away with high fees. But competitive prices
can be found without sacrificing quality of service.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No tax on this sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A British lady now aged 71, previously resident and domiciled in England,
emigrated to South Africa four years ago. As her son lives there, she has no
intention of returning to live permanently in the British Isles.
She still owns the house which was her main residence and her principal
private residence in the UK. It is let, and she is not considering selling
it.
She has been told, however, that if she did sell the house now, she would be
liable to pay capital gains tax. Is this advice correct?
What she has been told is nonsense (so far as we can deduce the relevant
facts).
You can ease her mind by sending her three free pamphlets which are
obtainable from local tax offices: CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses), CGT14
(Capital gains tax: an introduction) and IR20 (Residents and non-residents:
liability to tax in the UK).
Her UK solicitor, who presumably has acted for her in buying the house, can
guide her through the tax labyrinth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I own our house. Since we have no children, it (or the proceeds
thereof) will go to relatives when we die.
Since most of our income has gone into the house, we are looking for a way
to get its value (Pounds 60,000) for ourselves, but without having to resort
to any debt.
Is it possible for us to sell the house to, say, a finance or insurance
company but continue to live there until we die? Or is there any other type
of scheme that we could opt for?
You should approach the idea of selling your house to a finance or other
company with extreme caution.
There are, however, arrangements which may well be mutually profitable in
your situation and, therefore, we suggest you contact Age Concern at Astral
House, 1268 London Road, London SW16 4ER (tel: 081-679 8000).
Ask for a copy of its book, Using Your Home as Capital (price Pounds 4.50)
and its free fact sheet number 12. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal
Asset Management).

FT  17 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When nil is not negligible
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, when an
asset has become of negligible value, what is the advantage of claiming that
the asset has been sold and re-acquired at the specified value?
Can't it be claimed simply that it has a negligible value? Is negligible
value the same as 'nil' value for CGT purposes?
Section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'If, on a
claim by the owner of an asset, the inspector is satisfied that the value of
an asset has become negligible, he may allow the claim; and, thereupon, this
act shall have effect as if the claimant had sold, and immediately
re-acquired, the asset for consideration of an amount equal to the value
specified in the claim.'
As you will see, the claimant has to specify his estimate of the asset's
present value in the claim.
No, 'negligible' does not mean 'nil': there is a contrast between the phrase
'the value . . . has become negligible', in section 24(2), and the phrase
'becomes valueless' in section 146(2). Both phrases originated in the
Finance Act 1965, so parliament's intention to distinguish between
negligible values and zero value is beyond question.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest single transaction of the week was at Iceland, the frozen
food-maker and retailer. Peter Hinchcliffe, deputy chairman and joint
managing director, sold 1.5m shares although he still holds almost 3 per
cent of the company.
The eponymous chief executive of Michael Page Group, the recruitment
company, is due to retire in 1995. Before he goes, he has been realising
some of the growth the shares have accrued over the past few years. Most
recently, he sold 2m at 105p each - but he retains more than 1.6m.
In recent weeks, there has been a growing amount of selling from the big
financial houses. Now, two directors of M&amp;G Group, Anthony Shearer and
Ashley Gordon, have sold stock at prices between 1047p and 1055p. The sales
account for a sizeable proportion of their holdings.
Peter Wood was responsible for setting up the hugely successful Direct Line
Insurance. When it was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland, he received a
considerable amount of equity. His recent sale of more than 600,000 shares
leaves him with over 2.4m. Some of the money raised was for his pension
fund.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: A season for tempting trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Autumn is here - the season for investment managers to dust off their
marketing plans for new trusts to tempt investors, writes Bethan Hutton.
Fidelity is launching Special Values, an investment trust to be run in
parallel to Fidelity's Special Situations unit trust and under the same
manager, Anthony Bolton. The idea of special situations is to find
under-valued companies which have recovery or growth potential, are
potential takeover targets, operate in niche markets, are being restructured
or are under-researched.
The other new offering is from BZW Investment Management and Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull. It is an unusual concept: an investment trust
specialising in companies which will benefit from development of the
information infrastructure in the emerging economies of Asia, Europe and
Latin America. This includes advertising, broadcasting, electronic hardware
and software, newspapers and telecommunications.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Get the best while paying less -
There is more than one way to tap the expertise of top investment managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The myth that unit trusts are a boring, cloth cap investment may linger in
the golf clubs of the land but it is not a view held by the largest
investment management firms. Eight of the 10 investment managers profiled
recently in the Weekend FT offer a degree of portfolio management based on
collective investments. All insist that the investors who use these services
benefit from their expertise just as surely as wealthy investors with
bespoke equity portfolios.
Peter Rees, marketing director of Rothschild Asset Management, says: 'The
similarities between Libra (the RAM unit trust management service) and what
we provide for high net worth individuals are remarkably close. The groups
that decide our asset allocation for clients are the same, whether you are
coming through Libra or through the private client service or as a large
institution.'
Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts, makes
the same point. 'The asset allocation of our unit and investment trust
service will be determined to a large extent by the investment committee,
and it will be a reflection of our views.'
The largest fund management firms tend to offer three basic collective fund
services. Some manage a specific unit trust, a core fund designed to
replicate the portfolios of their wealthiest private clients, and a select
few bolt on additional private client services. Others run portfolio
services which provide clients with a managed basket of collective funds.
Schroders is a passionate advocate of unit trusts, arguing that they provide
a spread of risk which only the seriously wealthy can achieve from a direct
exposure to equities; that they streamline administration; and that they
offer considerable financial advantages.
John Henderson, the managing director of Schroder Personal Investment
Management, says: 'l could wax lyrical all day about the tax benefits of
unit trusts.' He points out that they are exempt from capital gains tax and
that, if the annual fee is taken from the fund's income, then investors
effectively are getting income tax relief on it. Moreover, annual fees are
not subject to value added tax, unlike the charges for managing
directly-invested portfolios.
The Schroder World fund is the one used for private clients whose main
investment objective is long-term capital growth. 'Provided the clients'
objectives match the objectives of the trust, the World fund is appropriate
for all UK taxpayers,' says Henderson.
Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, but investors with Pounds 100,000-plus
are offered many elements of the firm's private client service. They have
two named investment managers and a stream of information throughout the
year. Schroder also will liaise on bed and breakfasting units, so clients
can mop up their CGT allowance, and will arrange for them to convert part of
their holding each year into a personal equity plan.
Mercury's answer is the Portfolio unit trust. Richard Royds, managing
director of Mercury Fund Managers, describes it as 'a unit trust designed
for the private clients we used to have to turn away. It simply follows the
strategy that the private clients get. It is not a white-knuckle ride. It is
a safe and sound approach that has done very well.' Mercury has now launched
a complementary Income Portfolio fund.
The firm's minimum investment is Pounds 10,000, but this sum opens the door
to some private client services. Two portfolio advisers are available to
investors and they get quarterly reports, with the fund's portfolio listed
as if it were their own.
Royds says: 'There are some great advantages with a unit trust because one
of the problems you get with a private client portfolio is that you are
constrained by tax from trading. We have a few people who have invested more
than Pounds 1m in the Portfolio trust because they like the CGT structure so
much.'
The Cazenove Portfolio unit trust (minimum investment Pounds 5,000) does not
offer extra private client services but it, too, provides a mirror image of
a wealthy private client portfolio.
Harry Henderson, managing director of Cazenove Unit Trust Management, says:
'The fund absolutely adopts the Cazenove asset allocation and sector
allocation. If CGT is not a consideration, this is the way we think a
private client portfolio would perform.'
Similar claims are made on behalf of the Credit Suisse Investment Portfolio
fund (minimum Pounds 5,000), and the Baring Portfolio fund (minimum Pounds
500). Baring also joins Rothschild, James Capel and Kleinwort Benson in
offering a collective funds portfolio management service with trusts chosen
from the whole marketplace. In contrast, the unit trust management service
that Schroder offers to investors with more than Pounds 500,000 is confined
to the firm's funds.
The minimum investment for the Baring service is Pounds 20,000; at Capel, it
is Pounds 25,000. Investors must have Pounds 50,000 for Rothschild's Libra
service and Pounds 75,000 for Kleinwort's unit and investment trust
portfolio management. Fees are 1 per cent at Baring and Rothschild, a
minimum Pounds 200 a year at Capel and a minimum Pounds 250 at Kleinwort.
Clearly, the message is: do not be intimidated by the investment figure
required by leading private client fund managers before they will provide a
bespoke portfolio. There is more than one way to secure their asset
allocation and stock-picking skills.

 -------------------------------------------------------------
The table shows the minimum sum needed to access the private
client expertise of some of the leading investment managers.
This minimum figure secures entry to a unit trust that mirrors
the portfolio of a wealthy private client, or to a unit trust
that does this and adds additional private client services.
Alternatively, it buys a managed fund portfolio service.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: How to make your bank really listen
 -A look at ways to complain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most banks admit, unofficially, that some of their less affluent private
customers are more trouble than they are worth. But all want to keep the
ones with large balances who are suitable targets for other financial
services. Measures to retain them range from cash incentives to promises of
a better service.
Earlier this year, Abbey National halved its authorised overdraft rate,
while Midland bank promised to pay customers Pounds 10 for each failure to
meet certain standards of service in transferring a current account from
another bank.
Barclays bank has just announced that it is improving its complaints system.
It was the subject of bad publicity earlier this year after a customer
committed suicide.
'The way we handle complaints is a vital part of our efforts to improve
customer service,' said Chris Lendrum, deputy managing director of UK
banking services. 'Handled badly, a customer may understandably take his
business elsewhere.'
One frequent complaint by readers is that branch staff sometimes are unable
to provide even such simple information as how to complain. Here, then, are
the complaints procedures for some of the UK's largest banks. They sound
good - but let us know if theory differs from practice.
Barclays
The bank is setting up a National Complaints Initiative in branches to
handle both personal and business complaints. Staff will complete an 'action
form' for customers who complain in person and who will be given a copy for
reference. Telephone and written complaints will receive a response within
24 hours. 'In complex cases, this may initially take the form of a holding
letter,' says Barclays.
Bank of Scotland
It has a three-stage process. First, make the complaint (in person, by
letter or telephone) to the senior manager of the branch where the problem
arose. If you are unhappy with the reply, ask the branch for the name and
address of the regional manager responsible for the branch and write to him.
If the complaint remains unresolved, take it to the relevant general
manager.
Midland
Go first to the branch manager. The complaint will be answered within two
working days, or an acknowledgement sent stating how long the matter is
likely to take.
If you want to take it further, write to Derek Stafford, Customer Relations
Manager, Midland Bank plc, Head Office, Poultry, London EC2P 2BX (the letter
will be acknowledged within two working days) or telephone the bank's
customer service centre on 0345-707 070.
Calls are charged at local rates and are recorded 'to provide conclusive
evidence in cases of dispute'.
Lloyds
Complain first to the branch (if you telephone outside working hours, leave
a message on the answering machine and your call will be returned the next
working day). If the matter is not resolved, either write to the regional
executive director (the branch will provide the name and address) or
telephone customer services at head office on Freephone 0800-147 789.
Complaints about credit cards are handled by the Senior Manager, Card
Services, Essex House, Southchurch Avenue, Southend-on-Sea, Essex SS99 3PP.
The local branch will deal with complaints about a Lloyds' payment card.
National Westminster
Branch-based complaints are handled 'immediately' by the branch but, in
complex cases, it will take a maximum of two days. If you want to take the
matter further, write to head office, which will acknowledge the letter
within 24 hours. There is also a Freephone customer serviceline (0800-505
050) which handles queries, suggestions and complaints.
Royal Bank of Scotland
Once again, the complaint should be addressed to the branch at which it
originated. If you remain unhappy, write to the Head of Service Quality
Department, Royal Bank of Scotland, Freepost, PO Box 31, Edinburgh EH2 0DG.
An acknowledgment will be sent within two working days and a full response
within 10.
In all cases, if you have completed the internal complaints process and
still feel aggrieved, write to the Banking Ombudsman, 70 Gray's Inn Road,
London WC1X 8NB (tel: 071-404 9944).

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Bupa's long view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bupa, the UK's largest private health insurer, is moving into the market for
long-term health-related insurance. In the past, it sold insurance to cover
only the direct cost of private medical treatment - not the impact of
ill-health on financial circumstances.
Now, it has added three new types of policy:
Disability income insurance, which provides a replacement income if you
cannot work through ill-health.
Critical illness cover, which pays a substantial lump sum if you suffer one
of a defined list of serious health problems, such as cancer, heart attack
or stroke.
Recovery cash, which pays a smaller lump sum if you need surgery, whether
privately or on the NHS.
One pertinent aspect of the disability income cover is that unlike similar
products - usually known as permanent health insurance, or PHI  - cover does
not stop at retirement age. Instead, it changes into a type of long-term
insurance to help with the cost of care if you become unable to carry out
such 'activities of daily living' as washing, going to the lavatory, and
eating unaided.
Claims before retirement are decided on whether your illness or disability
stops you carrying out your normal occupation. So, a condition that allows
you to claim then will not necessarily entitle you to post-retirement
benefits.
One drawback is that the policy must be taken out at least five years before
your scheduled retirement date. This means that long-term care cover will
not be available to those most likely to consider buying it: people on the
verge of retirement or who have just retired.
Another potential problem is that the maximum level of cover is only 50 per
cent of your gross salary (most insurers offer cover of up to two-thirds).
Since nursing homes are expensive - up to Pounds 20,000 a year - you could
cover long-term care costs fully only if you were earning about Pounds
40,000 a year before retiring.
The market for medical insurance, PHI and critical illness cover is large
and competitive, so it is worth getting quotes for all the different
elements from a range of insurers before signing up for a single insurer's
package.
At the same time, Bupa has simplified its range of private medical policies
to reduce confusion over what is covered and make it easier for people to
switch between different types of insurance when their circumstances change.
Its new, customer-friendly approach includes a local-rate telephone
help-line for customers, open from 8am to 8pm on weekdays. Another
innovation is a range of voluntary excesses on all medical policies. This
gives subscribers the choice of cutting premiums by up to 40 per cent by
agreeing to pay the first Pounds 100 to Pounds 500 of every claim.
This will appeal to people who find comprehensive premiums costly and are
happy to have minor conditions treated on the NHS (or pay themselves) but
still want cover for serious illness. Several other insurers offer voluntary
excesses already.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (3): It's the services
that make them different - Private banking / The emphasis is on financial
planning, rather than current accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within the UK, the term 'private banking' conjures up images of smart
cheques rather than 'smart' cards; discreet offices in Knightsbridge not the
high street; and the bank manager as old family retainer.
The reality is both less entertaining and more useful. The emphasis is on
financial planning rather than forelock-tugging. And despite the term, the
service provided by a private bank may not involve basic banking facilities
at all.
Even those private banks that offer a current account and cheque-book admit
that there is only a limited amount of extra service they can bring to a
relatively straightforward account.
James Cooper is head of private banking at the Lloyds Bank group, which is
among the banks offering a current account and the use of a branch network.
'We look at the whole financial situation. The core is investment, not the
current account,' he explains.
At Coutts - a long-established name in private banking, which is now part of
National Westminster Bank - Michael Maslinski, head of business development,
says that most of its personal customers do have a cheque account. The
service is more expensive than for a current account at an ordinary high
street bank, with free banking only if your average credit is at least
Pounds 3,000.
'If somebody never has any cause to phone their bank, and simply has a
salary going into an account and about six standing orders coming out, the
amount of added value must be questionable,' Maslinski says.
There must be some demand among private banking clients for this facility,
or else Hill Samuel would not be thinking of extending its service to
include cash dispensers run by the TSB, of which it is a part. But there is,
of course, no need to go to a private bank if you want a basic current
account.
There is some evidence that high street banks are trying to provide better
services to all their customers. It is also clear that they are trying to
improve their relationships with high net worth individuals - if only to be
in a better position to sell other financial products.
So if you are the sort of person who might be a private banking client, you
are also the sort of customer that high street banks desperately want to
please.
The question then is whether you believe there is much to be gained from the
more personalised service that a private banking arm would give you,
especially if you feel that decision-taking in the high street branch is
increasingly being centralised.
Beyond the current account lies the bulk of private banking services.
According to Paul Cattermull, head of Hill Samuel private banking, these
fall into five broad categories: other banking facilities; investment
management and stockbroking; accountancy and tax; legal advice; and
financial planning.
Private banks themselves are divided about why a customer should go to them
for these services rather than to the range of other professionals queueing
up to advise the wealthy.
Some argue that, quite apart from providing a good quality of service, they
are also able uniquely to offer the convenience of one-stop finance.
They say that this avoids the risk of not getting consistent financial
planning, and saves customers' time by enabling them to put their affairs in
the hands of one set of advisers.
'The more you get to know customers' circumstances, the more you get to
understand them better, and the better the ideas you come up with,' says
Maslinski.
Others, however, argue that customers who end up getting all their financial
advice from one organisation may be getting advice in areas where the
organisation does not have such specialist expertise.
George Alford, head of private banking at Kleinwort Benson, is among those
who are somewhat sceptical of the 'one-stop finance' line of argument. 'Lots
of people have a deposit account they don't tell their main adviser about,'
he says. 'The number of people who truly use only one adviser for everything
is very small.'
On investment management, there is more agreement. Although banks are
reluctant to be tied down to a figure for the minimum investment that they
will handle for a private client, there is general agreement that it does
not make much sense to have managed services for less than Pounds 75,000,
and some would put the floor on investments at around Pounds 100,000.
Charges for investment management are likely to be within the 0.75 per cent
to 1.5 per cent range. They may be negotiable, but this is not a part of the
market which is very price-sensitive. Insofar as price is important, it is
more likely to come through in private banks making sure they provide added
value, rather than cutting their costs.
Below those amounts, a private bank would offer unit or investment trusts -
either their own, in the case of Kleinwort Benson, for example, or on the
basis of independent advice.
So leaving aside the argument about using only a single source of advice,
where is the advantage in private banking over getting advice from a good
independent financial adviser?
The banks themselves underline two elements in particular. The first is the
international dimension. This can make them particularly well-suited in
areas such as handling complex currency transactions, identifying
opportunities in overseas markets, and arranging affairs for people moving
to the UK from elsewhere.
The other aspect that they all emphasise is continuity of the bond with the
customer. 'We're selling relationships, not products,' says Cooper. So if
you're thinking of choosing a private bank, along with questions about
investment performance, charging structures, and the range of services
available, it may well be worth also asking about staff turnover.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Crunch nears on BT3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in BT3 will get a letter next week asking them to pay the final
120p instalment on their shares. The first two payments totalled 290p
against a market price now of around 264p. Dealing in the partly-paid shares
will end on September 30.
Cheques must be received by October 6 in order to meet the payment deadline
of October 11. But some brokers and share shops are asking for the money
well before the end of September.
If a shareholder fails to pay up in time, the Treasury will take back the
shares and sell them. The shareholder stands to get back a maximum of 290p
less costs but, in practice, the amount paid is likely to be less: the
market price less costs.
If you want to pay the final instalment, just send off your cheque together
with the call notice asking for the instalment in time. If you want to sell
without paying the final instalment, then the sooner you do so, the better:
many brokers have a selling deadline well before the end of September. But
wait until you have got your call notice.
If you want to keep a stake in BT but cannot afford to make the extra
payment, you need to sell some of your partly-paid shares in order to make
the additional payment on the others: an operation known in the trade as
cannibalisation. Personal equity plan-holders should check they have cash
available.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Lenders take flight - Interest rate
rise hits fixed mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-rate mortgage offers were withdrawn by the score this week as lenders
reacted to the 0.5 per cent increase to the base rate announced on Monday by
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new base rate is 5.75
per cent.
Fixed mortgages guarantee that rates will not go up or down for a specified
period and are, therefore, particularly attractive for borrowers who need to
keep careful control over the family budget.
Independent mortgage advisers say borrowers should act quickly to take
advantage of the remaining good deals. 'But watch out for the small print,'
warns Ian McKenna, a consultant with mortgage and pensions adviser Blyth
McKenna. 'Some of the cheapest fixed rates are offered on the condition the
borrower takes out expensive buildings and contents insurance.'
Borrowers considering a fixed rate should treat with caution any scheme that
imposes a deadline by which the deal must go through. McKenna says: 'Several
of the largest building societies do this, and it creates severe problems
for borrowers stuck in a chain who are not able to complete in time.'
You should bear in mind, also, the early redemption penalties associated
with fixed rates - usually worth three to six months' payments. But Ian
Darby, marketing director at mortgage adviser John Charcol, points out that
redemption penalties are a standard feature of most mortgage products - with
the exception of variable rates.
'The main reason for getting out of a fixed rate would be if rates fell
dramatically,' he says. 'We believe that the mortgage market has bottomed
out and that rates will rise, not fall.'
Owners who want to sell should not delay in the hope of price rises. Darby
says: 'House prices will remain static apart from a few pockets of movement
where demand outstrips supply.
'Now is a good time to move - mortgage rates are very competitive, and the
ratio of income to house prices is at an all-time low.'
Fixed rates in detail. The Royal Bank of Scotland has put up all of its
fixed rate schemes. Its three-year fixed has gone from 7.95 per cent to
8.49, and the five-year fixed from 8.89 per cent to 9.24 per cent, according
to Moneyfacts.
National &amp; Provincial has put up some of its fixed-rate offers by 0.4 per
cent to 0.6 per cent but has cut its one-year fixed rate for first-time
buyers by 0.1 per cent to 1.75 per cent. The lender says this reduction is
not at the expense of any changes in the mortgage's terms and conditions.
N&amp;P also announced a new four-year fixed at 8.45 per cent for borrowers who
have a minimum deposit of 10 per cent.
Meanwhile, ScotLife Home Loans and the West Bromwich have launched jointly a
6.99 per cent fixed available through independent advisers.
Providers to withdraw their fixed-rate offers include First Direct,
Confederation Bank, Ipswich building society, First National building
society, Mansfield building society, Household Mortgage Corporation, Bank of
Ireland (Northern Ireland), Bank of Scotland and Centre Bank. TSB has
withdrawn some - but not all - of its offers.
Few lenders announced changes to their variable-rate mortgages - most are
sitting on the fence until the Halifax rates come out next week. Of the
providers that did, the average rise was 0.4 per cent, taking the typical
figure to 8.14 per cent (see table 2).
In practice, advisers tend to regard these rates purely as a benchmark. With
so many good fixed-rate and discount schemes remaining on offer, borrowers
who shop around see little attraction in an undiscounted variable rate.
Elsewhere in the savings and investment market, there were few signs of
movement. Banks and building societies said they would wait for Abbey
National and the Halifax to go public on savings accounts before adjusting
their own rates.
The exceptions included Barclays and Northern Rock, which increased interest
rates by between 0.1 and 0.35 per cent.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Better viewing at MAI - The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: MAI, the money broker and television group, is expected to reveal
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 88m and Pounds 109m for the year to June,
against Pounds 80.2m last time.
It will be the first period including results from Anglia Television. The
tax charge is set to rise from 37 to 44 per cent, causing a fall in earnings
per share.
The dividend is likely to rise from 6.9p to between 7.25p and 8p.
TUESDAY: A spread of businesses which includes retail and industrial
logistics, business mail and chemical distribution makes Hays, the business
services group, a good indicator of the pace of economic recovery.
It is expected to report annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 66.6m to
about Pounds 86m, helped by a strong rebound in performance from its network
of personnel recruitment agencies.
TUESDAY: Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer, is expected to
announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 247m (from
Pounds 235m last year), adjusting for new depreciation policies and before
Pounds 4m property losses.
Some recovery in margins is expected but uncertainty about the extent of
this, and over the fortunes of the Catteau chain in France, is reflected in
the wide range of forecasts - from Pounds 240m to Pounds 252m.
WEDNESDAY: Half-year figures for British Aerospace will show a dramatic
turn-round from last year. But much of the headline improvement will come
from the one-off profit on the sale of the Rover car group to BMW. This is
estimated by some analysts to be in the region of Pounds 250m.
Underlying profits are likely to be in the region of Pounds 70m, up from
Pounds 20m in the first half of last year. A strong performance from the
defence operations will be held back once again by losses in BAe's
turbo-prop commercial aircraft subsidiary.
The dividend might also be increased from an interim 3.3p last time to
around 3.75p.
THURSDAY: Wm Morrison, the regional grocery superstore group, is forecast to
announce an 18 per cent increase in half-year, pre-tax profits from Pounds
38.2m about Pounds 45m. Analysts believe the group has had strong sales
growth, with some improvement in margins.
THURSDAY: Guinness, the brewing and spirits group, is expected to report
pre-tax profits of around Pounds 320m for the first half. Last year's
result, published at Pounds 320m, will be re-stated at Pounds 305m to allow
for an increase in pension contributions.
Operating profits from both spirits and brewing are expected to be fairly
flat, but interest charges will be lower following last year's cash inflow.
The City will also be be watching for any announcement on a new managing
director for United Distillers to replace Crispin Davis, who resigned almost
a year ago.
THURSDAY: RMC, the world's biggest concrete company, reports half-year
figures which are expected to show a sharp rise in UK profits. The market,
however, will be more interested to hear if the heady pace of German growth
has slowed.
Latest forecasts suggest that pre-tax profits could be just over Pounds 90m,
compared with Pounds 61.6m in the first half of 1993.
FRIDAY: Hepworth, the clay pipes and refractories group, is expected to
report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 35.5m in the first half of 1994,
compared with Pounds 27.5m.
Analysts will be looking for the effects of stiff eastern German
competition, while the group also could reveal weakness in the clay pipes
market. The dividend is likely to be unchanged at 5.5p.

It might have been a bad day for their company's shares, but directors at
DRS Data Research Services spotted a golden opportunity when prices in the
scanning equipment producer plunged by 58 per cent.
On Tuesday, the shares fell 56p to 40p after the Milton Keynes-based company
warned that uncertainty in education, its biggest market, had led to lower
than expected sales. But after coming to market at 110p in a placing in May,
the company's shares represented good value to at least two DRS directors.
The following day, Stuart Henderson bought 50,000 at 40p, a holding of 0.14
per cent, through Jasmine Trustees, a trust of which he is the sole
beneficiary. Amanda Croker, the wife of director Patrick Croker, acquired
46,000 at 43p to increase her holding to 51,400.
By coincidence, the same day saw managing director Malcolm Brighton make a
gift of 353,751 shares to the Milton Keynes Community Trust, which offers
grants to local charities. He added that he would soon be buying more shares
at what he called the 'silly low prices' to add to his 38 per cent holding
of 13.5m.
DRS supplies scanners to capture hand-written data, such as ticks on
multiple choice forms, for processing by computers. Turnover for the 28
weeks to July 15 fell from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 5.76m as sales to schools,
which account for 70 per cent of turnover, dropped by 14 per cent.

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (2): Made to measure -
Investment management / Fees are high, because Savile Row portfolio
treatment does not come at Marks &amp; Spencer's off-the-peg prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Their highly desirable City offices may suggest ivory towers, but the
blue-chip investment houses know that they can no longer rely on the cachet
of their name, or on 'old' money and personal recommendations, to attract
new private clients.
Competitive pressures mean that they regularly present their case to
prospective clients at 'beauty parades', and many have been converted to the
need for selective marketing and the raising of some hitherto discreet
profiles.
Even today, however, no leading investment management firm professes to
provide a private-client service for Everyman. Few, if any, will consider
managing a portfolio of equities for a client with less than Pounds 100,000
of free assets, and many require considerably larger sums. At Kleinwort
Benson the minimum is around Pounds 200,000, for example; at BZW, Pounds
250,000; at Mercury, Pounds 300,000; and at Schroders, a cool Pounds 2m.
Even when minima are not cast in stone, the annual management fee may
dictate the minimum acceptable sum. For instance, Barings' minimum fee is
Pounds 10,000 a year. Performance, therefore, would have to be red-hot for
the merchant bank to provide value to a client with less than Pounds 1m.
Clearly, Savile Row investment management does not come at Marks and
Spencer's off-the-peg prices. Most investment managers charge
percentage-based annual fees, and the minimum annual charge can vary from
the relatively modest to the very expensive. For example, the minimum fee at
Schroders is Pounds 20,000 a year.
Cazenove is among those that have retained a commission-charging structure
for private clients, however; and there are others who charge a combination
of commissions and management fees. Flemings allows its private clients to
choose.
Despite their size and their institutional clout, the best known investment
managers argue that they provide a highly personalised service for their
private clients. The common view is that no two clients are the same, and
that portfolios must be created to suit the individual, rather than to fit
in with a preconceived set of guidelines. Every private client has a bespoke
portfolio, reflecting their own particular circumstances.
There is frequent contact with clients, starting with an initial meeting to
establish their investment aims and their tolerance to risk; and great care
is taken when allocating clients to their named manager. Nicholas Bowater,
head of private clients at Credit Suisse Asset Management, says: 'We go
through a selection process, to ensure that the manager matches the client.'
Much stress is placed on empathy. As a senior partner at Cazenove has said:
'You should never be seduced by the amount of money on offer. It is much
more important to feel that we can get on with the client.'
It is certainly not unknown for an investment house to turn down a
prospective client. After all, there is little point in choosing a highly
disciplined and conservative house such as Rothschilds or Schroders if one
wishes to pursue a markedly adventurous investment strategy.
Michael Chamberlayne, chairman of Barings' private client division in
London, comments: 'Clients do come in with an inflated view of what is
possible, and I am never prepared to answer the question 'what return are
you going for?'. It is a complete non-starter.'
A considerable selling point for the leading investment houses is that both
their institutional and their private clients benefit from their depth of
research capability and their often vast global investment resources.
The managers argue that this global perspective enables them to deliver
services that are denied to the clients of smaller investment management
firms. For example, they can provide private clients with expertise in
overseas and emerging markets and international bond markets, and protect
their portfolios with derivatives and with hedging techniques.
The asset allocation in each private-client portfolio is likely to reflect
the current thinking of the investment house's experts, judiciously adjusted
for individual private-client circumstances; and the stocks will largely be
those that have passed the scrutiny of a team of analysts and researchers.
This should both add value and reduce risk. For example, no Mercury private
clients held a Polly Peck or British and Commonwealth share when these
companies ran into difficulties.
Collective investment vehicles are widely used to provide clients with
exposure in specialist and overseas markets, however. Most managers argue
that a portfolio needs to be very substantial indeed before a manager can
introduce individual overseas stocks. Cazenove puts the figure at Pounds 1m.
There is no consensus on the use, or avoidance, of in-house unit trusts,
however. Some managers stick to the firm's funds; others, such as James
Capel and Rothschilds, devote considerable research resources to analysing
all the available collective funds.
Similarly, there is no unanimity about the type of investment anagement
offered. Some firms will accept new private clients only on a discretionary
basis - Schroders, Mercury, Cazenove, Barings and Rothschild fall into this
category - while others, including Flemings, Credit Suisse, Kleinwort
Benson, James Capel and BZW, welcome both discretionary and advisory
clients.
Clearly, the bottom line for private clients is the performance the top
investment managers achieve on their behalf, and it is not easy for a
prospective client to assess this. However, a number of the biggest
investment management firms now run unit trusts that replicate the portfolio
of a wealthy private client, and these are useful shop windows on their
overall performance. Managers running these funds include Mercury,
Schroders, Cazenove, Barings and Credit Suisse.
The one thing none of the leading investment managers professes to provide
is an all-singing, all-dancing financial supermarket. They will work with a
private client's accountant and solicitor; and they may act as honest broker
if a client wants to invest in something like agricultural land. But they do
not sell life assurance or indeed general financial planning services.
The fundamental brief of virtually every private client division of a top
investment management firm is, in fact, unambiguous. It is to preserve the
real value of a private client's wealth through the management of a
carefully weighted portfolio of UK and overseas equities, domestic and
international bonds, and cash.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: The Jordans' experience
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth and Dilys Jordan discovered, to their dismay, that even where you
follow the complaints procedure to the letter, things may not go smoothly.
Their complaint, against retirement investment adviser Knight Williams, is
still under consideration after two years.
In February this year, the Jordans set up the Knight Williams investors'
action group and face the latest in a series of meeting with regulators when
they meet SIB, the chief watchdog, on Thursday. Jordan says: 'The process of
complaint is daunting in the extreme, and few have the energy or resources
to pursue the matter.'
He talks calmly about verbal complaints and written complaints to the local
adviser's office, then the same details repeated to the company's
headquarters, followed by endless rounds with Fimbra and its arbitration
system.
'Persistence may convince Fimbra that there is a case for arbitration, in
which case they send a leaflet explaining that the complainant has to submit
two copies of all relevant documentation,' says Jordan.
He adds: 'In some cases, this might involve searching through documentation
as thick as a telephone directory and selecting what one feels is apposite,
without any assistance.'
Dilys Jordan feels that retired investors often do not have the resources
and experience to present a businesslike case - hence the reason for the
action group.

 -So you think you've had a raw deal but don't know what to do. Debbie

If you think you have a problem about an investment, pension or life
assurance product, you need first to find out to whom - or what - you should
complain. Unfortunately this is no easy task during the present regulatory
shake-out.
The Personal Investment Authority (PIA) has taken over from Fimbra, the
regulatory body for advisers, and Lautro, which regulated life offices and
unit trust groups. During the transition, you could end up dealing with any
of them.
Complaints about company pensions are tackled by the Occupational Pensions
Advisory Service (Opas), but several ombudsmen continue to squabble over
territorial rights for personal pensions. The box below provides contact
details and telephone helplines for bemused investors.
Second, you should consider if your grievances are justified or simply a
case of bad luck. The following common complaints received by regulators and
ombudsmen will help you assess the merits of your case.
1. I don't know which product to choose. Nor do the regulators and
ombudsman. Their job is to correct mistakes and deliberate mis-selling - not
to give investment advice.
2. The benefits are abysmal. Provided you knew what they were at the start,
and the provider or trustees were/are acting in accordance with the scheme
or plan rules, there is nothing you can do about it (but see point 4).
3. The investment returns are poor. The likely response to this is 'tough',
assuming you understood the nature of the risks when you took out the plan.
If you did not, see point 4. If you think your fund was miscalculated, see
point 6.
4. The investment is unsuitable. You are on better ground here. Salesmen
must examine your financial circumstances and requirements before
recommending an investment product. They must also ensure you understand its
nature and associated risks. If your adviser failed to do this, you should
complain.
Moreover, you should not lose out by abandoning an existing arrangement in
favour of a new product. An adviser almost certainly is mis-selling if, for
example, he recommends a pension transfer plan to replace a good company
pension scheme.
5. The charges are outrageous. Find out what they are before you sign up.
Until January 1995, providers are not obliged to reveal their true charges,
but good advisers are doing so now. Ask how much commission the adviser will
make on the sale, since this will eat into your fund in the early years.
6. The sums do not add up. Always query a significant shortfall, since this
might be a simple miscalculation. Early retirement pensions are classic
cases. But the final pay-out on a unit-linked or with-profits endowment, for
example, might be less than expected if the markets have performed poorly in
the period between your last statement and the date the plan matures. The
provider/adviser should have explained the risks at the outset (see point
3).
7. Something fishy is going on. Fraud and malpractice do occur - for
instance, where the salesman or adviser has not passed on your premiums to
the provider, or where the employer has deducted your pension contributions
from your pay cheque but has not sent them to the pension scheme. If you
suspect this is happening, contact the regulators immediately.
8. I've only just found out . . . and the complaint relates to an event five
years ago. You could be out of luck here. The pensions ombudsman, for
example, usually slaps a three-year time limit on eligible cases so, if you
suspect skulduggery or plain incompetence, act quickly. The PIA handles only
cases that arose after April 29 1988.
9. The matter is confidential. You might be saving for early retirement and
do not want your employer to know - or saving for divorce and don't want
your spouse to know. Whatever the circumstances, your case stays
confidential.
10. My friend has a problem . . . but he is too nervous/ill/old to complain
himself. You can act on behalf of relatives and friends provided you explain
the position clearly to the regulator or ombudsman.
You should check whetheryour investment is covered. If you are not sure, use
one of the enquiry numbers in 'Where to go' on this page. The PIA handles
life assurance (including endowment policies), personal pensions, unit
trusts, personal equity plans, guaranteed income bonds, investment trust
savings schemes, offshore funds (eg, gilt and bond funds), share dealing,
portfolio management, broker funds, business expansion and enterprise
investment schemes, and traded options
In some cases, you could be referred to the investment ombudsman via the
Investment Managers' Regulatory Organisation (Imro), the overseer for
investment managers, or to one of the other regulators. Company pensions and
certain aspects of personal pensions are covered by Opas and the pensions
ombudsman.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Your complaint stands a much greater chance of being taken seriously if you
have prepared your case well and can show you have done all you can.
The regulators and ombudsmen suggest the following tips:
Write first to the compliance officer at the company that sold the product
(in the case of an investment product) or to the trustees (for a company
pension scheme).
State clearly the nature of the complaint.
Give clear contact details, including daytime telephone number.
Provide the name of the investment or product, the date you took it out, and
the name of the salesman (if relevant).
Quote all relevant policy and reference numbers.
Photocopy letters and supporting material.
Impose a deadline for the reply. You should receive an acknowledgement of
your letter within seven days, but allow two months for the actual
investigation before proceeding to the regulator or ombudsman.
Check to see if there is a consumer action group that is co-ordinating
complaints. (See The Jordans' experience).

FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (1): When style obscures
substance - Introduction / The seriously rich can afford to pay somebody
else to do most of their worrying for them, says Barry Riley. But do they
get good value?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
The seriously wealthy are by and large a discreet bunch, preferring to keep
their money out of the jealous gaze of the public and of the tax man.
Occasionally, however, publications with a vulgar inclination insist on
publishing speculative league tables of the multi-millionaires.
Although we do not have accurate statistical information on the wealth of
the rich, it does look as though serious money has become more diversified.
Once, it was mostly confined to property and family businesses, and was
directed through channels which were largely determined by tax loopholes and
exchange controls.
The legacy of those extreme distortions can still be seen in the continuing
agonies of the Lloyd's insurance market, which expanded rapidly in the
postwar period when it could be marketed as the ideal bolthole for the
seriously rich.
In their attempt to escape from heavy taxes and exchange controls, Lloyd's
Names accepted high risks which were largely overlooked but which have now
come tragically home to roost in many cases. In fact, the wealthier you are,
the fewer the risks you need to take. Only the middling rich are seriously
concerned with growth. The really wealthy are focused upon capital
preservation.
Swiss banks have made a speciality of serving the preoccupation of the
global rich with discretion and security. In this respect, Switzerland tops
the list of private investment centres, offering a powerful combination of
confidentiality, security and top-class service. But it is expensive, and
there is a pecking order of centres beneath it.
Luxembourg, for instance, has grown rapidly as the European centre for the
middling rich, cunningly combining an 'offshore' status with its membership
of the European Union. Other centres, such as Jersey and Guernsey, have
developed their own niches, in their cases in the English-speaking market.
There is big, big money in the hands of wealthy private investors. Last
year, Chase Manhattan Private Bank estimated that the offshore market alone
was worth some Dollars 2,100bn. About half of this was sourced in Europe and
the Middle East, but the much more rapidly expanding half originated in the
Far East and in Latin America. This leaves out of account, of course, the
further vast sums held onshore, especially in the US and Japan.
Of the Dollars 2,100bn, incidentally, Chase estimated 35 per cent was
managed in Switzerland. The UK, long a haven for rich Arabs, Swedes and
others, came next with 15 per cent. Luxembourg and the Channel Islands had 6
per cent each, and the Caribbean centres, which primarily hold wealth from
the US and Latin America, had 10 per cent.
The base currency is highly influential in determining investment
strategies. UK-based investors select their strategies in the context of a
historically weak currency and a higher inflation rate than has been
experienced in most countries on the continent of Europe (and slightly
higher than in the US).
The British government and the Bank of England are, it is true, proclaiming
that they have adopted a low-inflation strategy. Indeed, for the past couple
of years inflation has been higher in Germany and the US than in the UK. But
it will take years before UK investors - who can vividly remember Black
Wednesday and the collapse in sterling only two years ago - are convinced
that anything fundamental has changed.
British investors are therefore hooked on equities rather than
fixed-interest investments. Cantrade Investment Management, a private-client
fund manager in London (which happens to be an offshoot of a Swiss bank) has
devised a benchmark which it says is typical of a sizeable private client
portfolio.
The benchmark return is based on a portfolio containing 50 per cent in UK
equities, 20 per cent in overseas equities and 30 per cent in 'defensive
assets'. The last would include index-linked gilts, overseas bonds and
liquid deposits.
Investors with portfolios constructed on these lines have had a rather dull
1994 so far, with a negative return of about 8 per cent in the first six
months. However, in 1993 the return was an impressive 26 per cent, so few
investors will have been seriously worried by the latest setback.
A penalty of being merely comfortably off is that you worry about your
money. An advantage of being seriously rich is that you can afford to pay
somebody else to do most of the worrying for you. Many advisory firms in
London and elsewhere in the UK are positioning themselves to attract the
business of the financially well-endowed.
Whare should you go? The mystique of the City of London continues to attract
many British investors. Merchant banks and stockbrokers still cluster in the
Square Mile, although as far as investment management business is concerned
the practical benefits of being there are slight.
The West End and areas like Kensington are also important for private-client
business, particularly for foreigners who are familiar with this part of
London but would probably not be able to find their way from Throgmorton
Street to Threadneedle Street.
Style rather than substance dominates the advisory business. Investment
performance is rarely a sensitive factor, because clients are so
ill-informed about the results obtained by other managers (although to some
extent Cantrade may have set the cat amongst the pigeons here).
Levels of service and marketing styles are usually more important. Clients
normally like to talk to an account director who is reasonably close to
their own age, and they value continuity of relationships. At the top end of
the market, elegant addresses and butler-with-silver-tray styles are
regarded as essential.
If you are entertained to an elegant lunch at your private bank, you can be
sure that, although you will never receive a bill, it will be costing you a
small fortune. But if you have a large fortune you will be able to regard it
all as a vital part of the service.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Dow wobbles on its erratic flightpath - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a poor start to the week. Just before 2am on Monday morning, a small
red and white Cessna 150, apparently on a suicide mission, glided through
the sky towards the White House in Washington DC, bounced off the South
Lawn, crashed through the branches of a magnolia tree, and came to rest in a
crumpled heap beneath President Clinton's bedroom window.
As it happened, Bill Clinton was not at home. But if the United States of
America could not protect the bedroom of its president from airborne attacks
by deranged Maryland truck drivers, investors might have felt entitled to
ask, what chance did it stand of successfully managing the economy?
Just the Friday before, Wall Street's late summer rally had been abruptly
halted by the publication of figures showing a bigger-than-expected rise in
the producer prices index. The inference drawn was that, in spite of five
increases in interest rates in the last seven months, the Federal Reserve
had failed in its efforts to nip inflation in the bud. Stocks plunged on
fears that more increases in interest rates would be needed to put the
economy back on track, so dampening economic growth, and with it, company
profits.
Traders were therefore in a jittery mood when the market opened this week.
Up till the previous Friday, most economists had thought the Fed would wait
until at least November before contemplating any further credit tightenings.
Now, they feared the next increase in interest rates could be bigger and
earlier.
Not even the announcement of yet another mega-merger - a Dollars 2bn bid by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, for Borden, the
struggling US food group - was enough to raise investors' spirits, and
prices drifted lower as the market waited in nervous anticipation of more
bad news on inflation from Tuesday's release of the consumer price data for
August.
The bad news, however, failed to arrive. In fact, when the figures for
consumer prices came out, the index was up by only 0.3 per cent, a figure
that compared favourably with the consensus forecast: and as investors
breathed a collective sigh of relief, the Dow Jones industrial average
performed a smart about-turn, rising more than 19 points.
The same thing happened on Wednesday, when figures showing a
lower-than-expected increase in August retail sales further damped inflation
fears and lifted the Dow Jones index 15 points. And on Thursday, when a
survey of business conditions from a regional Federal Reserve Bank brought
more good news on inflation, the optimism turned rampant, sending the Dow
index up nearly 60 points to its highest since February 3.
But it was too good to last. Market sentiment is these days so fragile that
it only takes a little bad news to trigger a wave of selling.
On Friday morning, that news came in the form of stronger-than-expected
figures for August industrial production and capacity utilisation. Suddenly,
the market was in flight again: by midday yesterday, as this column went to
press, the Dow was down 33.98 at 3919.9.
Such fickleness continues to leave investors without any clear lead on the
market's direction. Some would like to believe that the US economy has now
reached an ideal state in which growth is strong enough to support profit
increases but not so strong as to trigger a pick-up in inflation.
Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank, calls this the Goldilocks
economy - one in which the bears are kept at bay - but in the same breath
dismisses the scenario as a fairy tale, warning that the market is
overvalued and set to plunge by 10-12 per cent.
Why the gloom? Salomon points out that, in spite of recent hiccups, the
market is now as high as it was at the beginning of the year - yet interest
rates are already higher than they were in January, and are set to go higher
still. And although the current wave of merger mania in the US may be
bullish for stock prices, surges in merger activity have historically been
associated with market tops, not market bottoms: witness the late 1920s,
late 1960s and mid 1980s.
If that were not bearish enough, it also emerged this week that former
football star and television personality OJ Simpson had quietly been cashing
in more than Dollars 500,000 worth of his shareholdings.
Simpson may stand accused of the gory double murder of his former wife,
Nicole Brown, and her friend, Ronald Goodman, and probably needs the money
for his legal expenses: but it is an ill omen when one of the best-known
figures in US popular culture starts pulling out of the stock market.
Investors can only hope that his function as a role model is somewhat less
than it was.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Traps that investors cannot understand - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment is an art masquerading as a science. The City is packed with
analysts trying to crunch numbers into smaller pieces than their
competitors. But personal investors hoping that a single key statistic can
open the door to stock market riches are set for disillusionment. Most
investment decisions are complex and still have a strong subjective element
to them.
What is more, many of the numbers themselves are surprisingly open to
question. This week, for example, a new study examined one puzzle: why was
the price/earnings ratio on the FT-SE-A All-Share index in August more than
3 percentage points higher than stockbrokers' p/e estimates?
Most of the discrepancy was explained by differences in the ways the two
groups calculate the figures. Especially interesting, though, was why their
chosen methods varied. They were trying to measure slightly different things
for very different purposes.
The FT indices are intended to measure what actually happened, in the most
objective way possible. They look back and aim to provide a yardstick of
historical performance. Their p/e ratios are based on the latest 12 months'
earnings (that is, the two latest half-years added together). And they make
relatively few adjustments to companies' reported figures.
Stockbrokers' p/e ratios are based on the forecasts by their analysts of the
earnings companies will report in the present year. They relate to a later
time period than the FT's. And since this period is in the future, the
earnings figures are, necessarily, subjective estimates.
What is more, the analysts' main interest is not so much what profits
companies will report but their underlying profitability. So, if company
accounts contain unusual items depressing or inflating the reported profits
and earnings, the analysts tend to remove them.
This is because their job is to tell their clients which shares look cheap
or expensive - and a company's future earnings potential is one of the major
considerations in share assessment.
Thus a company which appears as an actual loss-maker to the FT's recording
angel can be turned into a magnificent recovery stock at the flick of an
analyst's calculator.
Which approach is right? Both are - on their own terms. And both can be
useful to the intelligent investor if he understands their function.
Problems arise when investors expect too much, or misunderstand the raison
d'etre, of any statistic (and all professionals agree that even
forward-looking p/e ratios are only one factor to consider in valuing a
share). Such problems can be expensive, particularly when a historic
measurement is deemed to have some predictive power.
Consider unit trust performance measurement. Analysts agree that
conventional performance tables are no use in predicting which trusts will
do well in future.
The two main UK fund measurement services, Micropal and HSW, are both now
calculating volatility figures as well: these tell you not just where a fund
got to over a certain period, but how erratic its progress was. They are
designed to measure risk.
Both firms also produce figures which combine risk rating with performance
measurement to give a risk-adjusted rate of return: a common enough
statistic. A fund with an outstanding performance, which is also very
volatile, might score the same as a less volatile fund with a worse
performance.
Micropal goes one step further, though: it ranks funds within a particular
sector and awards them star ratings of one to five according to their risk
adjusted performance. This is where its service starts to get contentious.
Experience suggests that investors presented with five-star funds and
one-star funds will tend to buy the former because they expect them to do
better in future.
Micropal makes no such claims, and is at pains to point out that investors
need to look at all the figures rather than home in on the star rating. But
at least some professional investors in the UK worry that risk-adjusted
figures are positively misleading if used as a guide to future performance -
and that making them the basis of a star system is to invite misuse.
In the US, the best known fund rating service, Morningstar, has its own
system for awarding star ratings. Earlier this year, a study showed that
funds rated five-star by Morningstar performed indifferently thereafter. But
stars glitter - particularly in the eyes of marketing men . . .
Wiseheads will mutter 'caveat emptor'. But how can the ordinary investor be
expected to avoid a trap he cannot understand?
The call for the final instalment of BT3 (see page V) raises one crucial
question: is BT itself worth holding?
The outlook for the telecommunications giant should be better than its
recent past suggests. The shares have done substantially worse than the
stock market as a whole since late 1993. In part, this is because analysts
have been impressed too much by its domestic competitors, and too little by
BT's existing strength, resilience at home and international potential.
BT is a riskier investment than it used to be, but the shares look fair
value.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Clarke's move leaves dealers guessing - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Well, he finally did it. The half-percentage-point increase in bank base
rates to 5.75 per cent announced on Monday by Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, was the first rise in UK interest rates for nearly five years.
This assumes, of course, that memory casts a discreet veil over the two
panic increases in base rates announced almost exactly two years ago, on
September 16 - the day Britain was pushed out of the European exchange rate
mechanism by the weight of international speculation against the pound.
On that fateful Wednesday - Black or White now, according to personal taste
 -rates were pushed up from 10 per cent to first 12 and then 15 per cent,
before Clarke's predecessor, Norman Lamont, admitted defeat.
The fall in interest rates to 6 per cent over the following four months, and
the substantial devaluation of sterling, fuelled a 1,200-point rally in the
FT-SE 100 which only peaked February this year, when the index touched
3,491.5.
This week's confirmation that the UK interest rate cycle has finally turned
upwards received a much more muted and uncertain response from the equity
market than Britain's escape from the deflationary shackles of the ERM.
Partly this was because Clarke wrong-footed traders. When the previous
week's meeting between the chancellor and Eddie George, Governor of the Bank
of England, passed off without an announcement, the City assumed that base
rates would not increase before next month at the earliest.
Clarke said he had decided to raise rates 'to take no risks with inflation'
at a time of strong economic growth. No one can remember when a UK
government last tightened monetary conditions while retail price inflation
is subdued. Underlying inflation, at 2.2 per cent in July, was at a 27-year
low.
The chancellor said he was looking 12 to 18 months ahead and was determined
to keep the recovery healthy and lasting. This was well received on Monday
and the FT-SE 100 made up more than half an early 25-point loss to finish
10.5 points down at 3,128.8.
The chancellor's move lost some its shine on Wednesday. A jump in August's
inflation figures and an unexpectedly sharp drop in unemployment raised
suspicions that the base rate cut was not nearly as far-sighted and
pre-emptive as Clarke had suggested. The prospect of the need for further
base rate increases prompted a sharp decline in share and bond prices, with
the FT-SE 100 falling 41.6 points to close the day at 3,079.8.
The market recovered 32.9 points on Thursday, when news of a drop in retail
sales last month allayed concerns that another base rate increase would soon
be necessary. But the FT-SE 100 again lost ground yesterday when a surge in
US production and capacity utilisation figures triggered talk of an imminent
increase in US interest rates.
One reason for investors' erratic response is growing unease about the
relative valuation of equities, compared with gilts. The ratio of bond to
equity yields in the UK is at a historically high 2.3 times. That can be
justified only so long as companies deliver strong growth in earnings and
dividends, which may become more difficult now that Clarke has started to
apply the brakes to the economic recovery - however gently.
Few industrialists think a half-percentage-point increase will make a
crucial difference in the long run, but the effect on sentiment could be
significant. The 0.3 per cent drop in retail sales between July and August
shows that consumer confidence remains fragile. The chart illustrates one
reason: the increase in average earnings, adjusted for increased taxes and
prices, has been lagging behind the growth in retail sales since early 1993.
One of the UK's largest retail groups, Kingfisher - which includes B &amp; Q,
Comet, Superdrug and Woolworths - this week reported a 7.4 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits but admitted the results were less than satisfactory. Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, said he remained cautious about UK retail
markets.
Alan Smith, chief executive, said Kingfisher's priorities were to improve
ranges, value for money and service. Cost-cutting would continue and some
job losses would result. He said it would take time to implement
Kingfisher's Everyday Low Pricing strategy - permanently lower prices,
leading to higher sales and profits - throughout the group.
Such an approach may bode well for the inflation outlook, but it is not an
easy environment for companies to make money in. APV, the food processing
equipment specialist, said the threat to profits margins been increased by
the pressure which retailers in Europe and the US are putting on the group's
main customers, the leading food processors.
The chancellor is clearly determined to avoid having to choke off an
overheating economy in the run-up to the next election. He has therefore
signalled his intention to keep control of inflation - even if that entails
some risk of slowing the recovery.
With the peak of the interim reporting season passed, analysts will have
fewer indications of how companies are coping in this new world of rising
raw material prices, reluctant consumers and squeezed profit margins.
Yesterday's concern over a possible increase in US interest rates took the
FT-SE 100 down 47.6 points to close the week 3,065.1.
Some analysts are still sticking with year-end forecasts of up to 3,500, but
those now look extremely ambitious. Brokers still expect strong dividend
growth over the next couple of years, but equities are unlikely to advance
much until the turbulence in the international bonds market calms.

Holders of warrants in Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (Temit)
have less than two weeks to sell or exercise their warrants before they
expire. The warrants, carrying the right to buy Temit shares at Pounds 1.27
by September 30 this year, were issued in a March 1990 rights issue, as part
of a package of five shares and 2.19 warrants, priced at Pounds 6.33 for the
package. The shares were trading this week at Pounds 4.185, and the warrants
at Pounds 2.93, making a total of Pounds 27.34 for the original package.
If warrant holders do not act before September 30, the warrants will be
exercised on their behalf, the resulting shares sold, and the proceeds
returned to the warrant holders, less costs. If holders do not exercise the
warrants themselves, they will miss out on a bonus issue of new shares and

<TEXT>
Kingfisher, the UK retailing group which includes BQ, Comet, Superdrug,
Woolworths, and France's Darty, this week disappointed the market in spite
of announcing a 7.4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
82m to Pounds 88.1m.
The increase - at the bottom end of forecasts - was more than accounted for
by a rise from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 35.7m in profits contribution from
Darty, acquired by Kingfisher only two months before the end of the first
half last year. Excluding Darty from both years, retail operating profits
fell from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 47.7m.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Chancellor raises base rates by half
a point - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, moved to nip inflation in the bud this week
by raising base rates by half a point to 5.75 per cent. The last rate change
before that was a quarter-point cut to 5.25 per cent in February.
Clarke said he decided to raise rates on Monday 'to take no risks with
inflation' at a time of strong economic growth. Some business organisations
criticised the move, but the market's initial reaction was relatively
favourable.
However, the announcement on Thursday that retail sales had fallen in August
prompted questions over whether the chancellor had acted prematurely. For
mortgage rates, see Page V.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Property shares lost in space - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property shares outperformed the wider equity market by almost 50 per cent
last year, so the sector was due to catch its breath. Its slight
underperformance in the first half of the year appeared to be just such a
pause. Yet the sector's 6 per cent slide over the last two weeks - bringing
its underperformance since the middle of July to around 10 per cent - looks
like a more serious loss of wind.
The key to this sudden disillusionment lies with the split personality of
commercial property as a financial asset. When rents are rising property has
a lot in common with equities. Rising rental income drives capital values
higher, just as dividend growth drives share prices, making property an
effective hedge against inflation.
Thanks to the practice of long-term leases with upwards-only rent reviews,
though, property provides its owners with a fixed income even when rents are
falling. Under these circumstances it has much more in common with bonds.
The bond-like nature of property worked to its advantage last year. Property
yields fell in line with bond yields, which meant that values rose even
though rents were still falling.
But for property values to detach from bonds investors have to believe that
rents are going to rise. Optimism on this score was enough to keep values
stable through the first half of this year in spite of turmoil in the bond
markets.
The snag is that optimism about rental growth now looks misplaced. In
January most stockbrokers assumed that rents would be rising across all
types of commercial property by the end of the year. Yet up to the end of
August rents were either falling or flat.
The upturn in rents looks unlikely to come until the middle of next year.
Against that background the property market looks becalmed.
If bond yields are reasonably stable there is no reason why commercial
property values should actually fall. Rents are bound to rise as economic
recovery takes hold and businesses start to expand. But that prospect is too
far distant to justify pushing values higher.
Property company shares have suffered twice over. Net asset values (the
amount which could, in theory, be raised if the company was broken up and
its assets sold) were forecast to rise by anything up to 15 per cent both
this year and next. The outcome this year looks likely to be more like 8 per
cent. Forecasts for 1995 now range from 6 per cent to 12 per cent.
Moreover, shares were already expensive when measured against the value of
their underlying assets. Before the recent slide the sector stood at a
discount of 7 per cent per cent to net assets. With no immediate prospect of
rising rents and property prices, that rating became impossible to justify.
Even now the sector is hardly cheap. The discount to net assets has widened
to around 13 per cent, but that compares to a long-term average of 20 per
cent. Since the upswing of the property cycle is still in its early stages,
shares might be expected to trade at a narrower discount than the average.
But they will have to fall further before bargain-hunters step in.
'The outlook for capital and rental growth has got a lot duller over the
summer,' said Chris Turner, analyst at BZW. 'Under those circumstances the
shares are just not cheap enough to encourage buyers.'
Even when rents start to rise the benefits will not be spread evenly across
all types of commercial property. Modern office space is already in short
supply and should perform well. Yet there is an overhang of older offices
which could take years to let. Retail warehouses are in demand but there are
plenty of empty high street shops.
Property companies which own new portfolios and manage their assets
energetically are most likely to flourish. The stock market has already
realised as much. Even now Pillar and Argent, two of the sector favourites,
trade at around net asset value.
Alec Pelmore, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'If the property markets is
not helping, it is the ability of management to add value to their assets
which really counts.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / The Long View: Clarke's pre-emptive strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new chapter of interest rate mythology was created this week with the
first moderate, apparently unforced rise in sterling interest rates, after a
period of stability, that anyone can remember. Kenneth Clarke, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, strutted the stage on Monday, perfecting his
heroic role as the far-sighted finance minister making a pre-emptive strike
against the still distant but increasingly discernable ogre of rising
inflation. Interest rate changes are still an excuse for drama - although
the Government Broker no longer stands on a bench in the stock exchange and
rings a bell.
Only ghosts from the past threatened to spoil things. We are presently
cursed (or blessed?) by ex-chancellors with nothing very much to do and no
cabinet confidentiality to inhibit them. Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson
promptly seized their chance to burst into the newspapers with warnings that
rates would soon have to be raised further.
Certainly, the circumstances of the increase were a whole lot more dignified
than those of the typical rises in the past when chancellors were often
forced into action by bond market collapses and foreign exchange panics.
Broken, too, has been the rule of asymmetry that rates rise in whole
percentage points - even two, sometimes - but decline gently in halves and
quarters.
Is that break with tradition a good thing? Lying behind the old rule was the
wisdom that finance ministers have to be forced into taking politically
unpleasant steps. Not that rises in interest rates ought necessarily be
unpopular politically. Pensioners with a pile of building society passbooks
in their cupboards positively love them. Rising interest rates should be
viewed as the normal and uncontroversial consequence of a strong economy.
But the view from Westminster, under pressure from the industrial and
housing lobbies, is different.
Hence the worry that anything that chancellors do voluntarily on interest
rates is unlikely to be sufficient. So, we must look critically at the
Treasury's suggestion that, in conditions of strong economic growth, a
half-point rise in interest rates is adequate to ensure that 'we take no
risks with inflation'.
For the British public, the domestic emphasis here is, no doubt, well-judged
politically. It is more logical, however, to fit the increase into a global
pattern in which US dollar interest rates have been rising for some time and
some rates in Europe - in Sweden and Italy, for instance - have gone up
already.
Sterling's exchange rate has been easing gently this year on a
trade-weighted basis. Meanwhile, it costs the British government much more
than those of the US and Germany to borrow through the bond markets (by a
margin of up to 1 1/2 percentage points) even though inflation in the UK has
been lower than in those countries for the past two years and is quite
likely to remain lower - certainly than in the US and possibly than in
Germany, where monetary growth has been excessive. Britain's inflationary
past still imposes a price; so there was a need to send out a message of
prudence.
In itself, though, a half-point rise in rates is trivial, apart from its
impact on sentiment. In this connection, the Halifax building society was
extremely unwise to be so hostile to the threatened rise a week ago. It
should have said that a moderate increase, in the context of a strong
economy, would pose no threat to house prices. As it is, some buyers may now
be discouraged unnecessarily. In the 1980s, however, mortgage rates were
often much higher than they are now, without plunging the housing market
into decline. The housing market has problems, but the cost of mortgages is
not yet one of them.
Will sterling benefit? A strong currency reduces imported inflation from
rising commodity prices. Sterling has indeed risen a little this week. But
the Italian and Swedish currencies have lost much of what they gained from
the August interest rate increases. And consider the impact of the collapse
this year of the gap between US and German short-term interest rates from
over 3 per cent to about  1/4 per cent.
Such a relative shift, which was expected widely, was supposed to make the
dollar attractive at the beginning of the year, according to widespread
opinion in the markets. That has turned out to be quite wrong: in fact, the
D-Mark has risen by 13 per cent against the dollar so far in 1994. Two of
this year's strongest currencies, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, have
the lowest interest rates. You cannot strengthen the currency by raising
short-term interest rates; but if you have a strong currency, you can cut
them.
If this sounds odd, remember that much of the money flowing around the world
today travels through the securities markets: we have long-term hot money,
if that is not an oxymoron, rather than the overwhelmingly short-term money
market flows of the 1960s and 1970s. Note that the bond market interest rate
differential has actually shifted in Germany's favour this year by nearly
1/2 per cent, the opposite to what has happened in the short-term markets.
As for the UK, the sterling 10-year bond interest rate has jumped by 2 1/2
percentage points this year but there have been no newspaper headlines and
no industrial lobbyists have besieged the Treasury on the subject. Clarke
does not pretend to set the bond yield as he pretends to set the short-term
interest rate.
So, are short-term interest rates irrelevant? Not quite, but it took very
large rises late in the 1980s to choke off the boom. Lawson added a cool 6
1/2 points in under a year and his successor, John Major, one more point on
top for luck. The rises burst the housing market bubble and deflated the
consumer boom. The Halifax certainly had reason to be worried then.
As the Chinese say, and Lawson knows, the longest journey begins with a
single step. But, so far, this is just a gentle stroll.

FT  17 SEP 94 / The long road back to planet Earth: Battered and bewildered,
Albania is slowly emerging from 50 years of isolation and dictatorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tirana airport is not the best introduction to the changes which have rocked
post-communist Albania in the past two years. Armed guards lounge around the
perimeter under makeshift sunshades, and pill-boxes lurk sinisterly in the
tall grass. The runway is bumpy, the terminal tatty.
As we drive out, I see a woman washing clothes in a ditch. The fields,
parched by the sun, are enclosed by the mountains which Albania used to shut
out the outside world for 50 years.
Closer to Tirana, though, signs of change multiply. Battered, but
recognisably western, vehicles begin to proliferate and a huge Coca-Cola
plant looms on our left. As we enter the city, the side of the road becomes
a teeming bazaar of people selling car parts and piles of imported household
knick-knacks. Every few yards, little kiosks with plastic tables and chairs
dispense coffee.
The air is thick with dust and heat. At a roundabout, the traffic, now dense
with buses and lorries, barges its way forward with much hooting and revving
of smoky engines. The buses, I notice, have 'Region de Bruxelles' written on
the side: Albania already has a reputation as Europe's 'last-hand' market
for anything on wheels.
The roads are lined with uniform rows of cheaply built apartment blocks. At
ground floor level are shops, but many have been abandoned: they served a
planned economy which no longer exists. Business has shifted to the footpath
kiosks or the new shops which people seem to erect wherever they like.
Our hotel, the Diplomat, is small but brand new, run up with Italian money.
My room has all mod cons including a refrigerator, all of them working. I
had been told that the water gets turned off several times a day in Tirana,
but the hotel manages to maintain a steady supply.
We meet in the hotel cafe for a drink. A tall young waiter takes our order.
He speaks perfect English with barely a trace of accent. He learnt it all at
school, he informs us; he has never set foot outside Albania. (In later
meetings, I was to see further evidence of the astonishingly high
educational attainments of the Albanians - one positive legacy, at least, of
the despised communists.)
We learn more about the previous regime on the way to our first official
appointment at the industry ministry. The car ride takes us up the huge
eight-lane boulevard which Enver Hoxha, the former dictator, built for a
country with no private cars. It runs past the pyramid-shaped mausoleum
which he erected for himself; this now contains government offices.
The ministry occupies a large but faded Italianate building with the
shutters hanging off. In a spacious, lemon-painted room with a long veneered
table, Premier Consolidated Oilfields of the UK and Albpetrol, the Albanian
state-owned oil company, sign a contract while crowds of Albanian reporters
and television crews record the scene. Abdyl Xhaja, the industry minister,
is handed a personal letter from Michael Heseltine, his British opposite
number, and proclaims Albania's eagerness for foreign investment.
That evening, the Albanians come for a reception at the Diplomat; over
canapes and French champagne, I learn more about the recent past of this
country of 3.2m people, about the same size as Birmingham, squashed on the
edge of the Adriatic between Yugoslavia and Greece.
It is only 2 1/2 years since students triggered the uprisings which finally
finished off the communists. In 1992, the new Democratic party, headed by Dr
Sali Berisha, was swept to power with a plan to transform Albania into a
market economy. There are now more than two dozen political parties.
Information, once a state monopoly, swirls around the country: satellite
dishes are sprouting all over the place. I am shown a picture of a man
taking one home on a mule.
The legacy of communism cannot be eradicated that easily, however. The
die-hards are still around. So are the people who ran the neighbourhood spy
networks which infiltrated the lives of every Albanian. Many of them got
rich on the old system and have managed to preserve their wealth. They are
now accused of fomenting unrest including, it is alleged, a recent
demonstration by political prisoners of the communists who want more
compensation. One of the big questions is whether they are still powerful
enough to derail the reform process.
On the economic front, land, housing, small businesses and the entire
bread-baking industry have been transferred to private hands; heavy industry
will follow as soon as possible. There is unemployment and inflation, but
not on the scale of Russia.
During the overthrow of communism, the crowds destroyed much of the
productive economy: factories, shops, greenhouses, even trees. These
shattered relics now litter the towns and countryside - a cost that
Albania's tiny economy could have been spared. They even smashed the
breweries and ripped up the vineyards; Albania now has to import beer and
wine.
Before dawn the following morning, we set off by car to visit Albania's
oilfields, 100 miles south of Tirana. The rising sun reveals a bleached
landscape which might have belonged to the 19th century. Farmers travel to
the fields with horses and carts; women tend the crops with hand tools;
barefooted children scamper along the roads. Bulging haystacks stand in the
farmyards.
My companion tells me that, two years ago, the plain we are passing was one
huge field owned by the state farm: today, it is dozens of tiny strips.
Agricultural output in Albania is rising at an official 14 per cent a year
but, unofficially, it is many times that. For the first time in the
country's recorded history, the peasants really own the land, not the state
or the big landlords.
Everywhere there are pill-boxes, erected by the paranoid communists: little
ones in clusters, big ones at strategic points, all built with the best
concrete available. They drained the economy and are now abandoned - but
indestructible. There are said to be more than 1m of them, one for every
hectare in the nation. At one point, we pass along the coast: miles of sand
and waving pines, utterly unspoilt except for even more pill-boxes.
Progress on our journey is slow: horse-drawn carts congest the road, which
is too narrow for easy overtaking. Many large lorries are broken down on the
verge. Frustrated drivers overtake recklessly. We pass through several towns
with dusty streets and raw concrete buildings. Many have brand new mosques
and churches: religion is returning.
Finally, we come over the brow of a hill: there before us, stretching as far
as the eye can see, is a forest of oil derricks. Greasy pools and rusting
equipment defile the landscape and sheep graze in between the wells. British
Petroleum discovered this field in the 1920s, the largest onshore field in
Europe which, literally, sticks out of the ground in oily, sandstone
outcrops.
The communists exploited it for all it was worth, but lack of know-how and
spare parts brought production gradually down to a trickle. Of the 2,000
wells, only 800 are producing, some as little as a couple of barrels a day;
indeed, no one is quite sure how much the field actually produces. But the
good news is that the communists managed to extract only 4 per cent of the
reserves. Premier Consolidated will now help Albpetrol suck out as much as
possible of the rest.
We hurry back to Tirana for a meeting with Berisha. His office is in a
spacious building on Hoxha's eight-lane boulevard; the new deep-red flag
with black eagle is fluttering outside. Armed guards salute as we swing into
the drive, and a man in a bright green shiny suit ushers us into a waiting
room. The furniture, the doors, almost everything is covered in shiny
veneer.
But Berisha's office is quite different: it is small and furnished
comfortably. The president himself turns out to be a pleasant, middle-aged
man with a fruity voice and a pale, lightweight suit. A cardiologist by
profession, he came only lately into politics and still lives in his
third-floor flat at the other end of town. He also speaks fluent English,
which was self-taught. It made a considerable impact when he visited London
recently and was received at Buckingham Palace.
Berisha is a passionate man, and he speaks with a directness and conviction
that moves audiences. Another of his skills, apparently, is an ability to
make snap decisions - acquired as a doctor.
'The communists' greatest crime,' he tells us, 'was to isolate us from the
world. This made Albania a third world country, the only one in Europe.' The
remedy is the free market, foreign investment, privatisation and a stock
exchange. All this is to be done as quickly as possible, says the president,
who has dispatched teams to the UK to study its privatisation experience.
'When we tried to privatise the bread industry, people said: how can you do
that? But, in the old days, we had bread only three or five days a week. We
had to import wheat and transport it around the country to meet shortages.
Today, our warehouses are full.' He relays with pride the results of a
Europe-wide Gallup poll which showed that 72 per cent of Albanians approved
of privatisation, the highest in any country.
Berisha is particularly keen to dispel the image of Albania as a land
hostile to outsiders (it was a crime under communism to speak to foreigners
or accept foreign finance). 'The attitude of Albanians has completely
changed,' he explains. 'They understand the importance of foreign
investment.' There is huge scope for outside investment: apart from oil,
Albania has copper, chromium and considerable tourism potential.
The president is delighted that foreign capital has begun to trickle in,
even though Albania lives under 'the shadow of war' in Bosnia and has
difficult relations with all its immediate neighbours. The recent
imprisonment of five members of the Greek minority on espionage charges has
put a severe strain on ties with Athens, and reinforced the argument that
less has changed in Albania than the government would have people believe.
The Greeks have blocked a proposed aid programme from the European
Community. Berisha shrugs: 'We are realistic. We will have to wait.'
Back at the airport, there is evidence for his optimism. Two flights,
Alitalia and Austrian Airlines, have landed and are disgorging dozens of
people with suits and briefcases. There are now daily flights to several
European cities, and most are full.
On the flight back to London, I am sitting beside Pavli Qesku, the Albanian
ambassador to the UK. A lightly-built man with lively, dark eyes and a shock
of silver hair, he tells me about his own past. A lexicographer, he has just
completed the first comprehensive Albanian-English dictionary.
I ask him what characterises Albania and its people, with their unique
Illyrian origins. 'The Albanian language survived 500 years of Roman
occupation, and then 500 years under the Turks and the constant threat of
Slav invasion,' he replies.
'But the first book was not published until 1555, and the first Albanian
language school did not open until 1879. The survival gene is very strong.'
I had to agree.

FT  17 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices for finer Merinos rose even more rapidly in the earlier Australian
sale days this week, with broader types also rising if more gradually. The
Eastern states market indicator ended at 829c/kg, compared with 780c/kg a
week before. The Western states indicator rose strongly at the first
Fremantle sale but the market was a little erratic at the close, 5 cents
down on the day if still 25 cents higher than at the end of last week. With
prices at least double those a year ago, and for finer Merinos much more
than that, ther is resistance among wool textile manufactures and
particularly UK home market retailers, but a rising market does involve
small-scale but steady support even during the unhappier times.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Watchdog critical over Pounds 3m pay-offs to NHS staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Health authorities may have exceeded their powers by spending nearly Pounds
3m on termination payments for employees, it was revealed yesterday by Sir
John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general.
He qualified his opinion on National Health Service accounts for 1992-93 in
view of 'considerable doubt' over whether the health authorities were
empowered to make all the payments concerned.
The report brought renewed criticism of financial controls in the NHS from
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary. He said it provided 'yet more
evidence' of how public money was used in an unaccountable health service.
'By packing health authorities with Tory supporters, the government has
ensured that decisions about pay-offs and relocation payments are being made
without public scrutiny,' he said.
Sir John found that regional and district health authorities made employment
termination settlements totalling Pounds 2,638,000 over four years which may
not have been within their powers, while family health authorities paid
another Pounds 348,000. Most of the settlements were compensation for loss
of office following organisational change and, says the report, largely
represented unexpired portions of contracts - the longest period being two
years nine months.
Senior NHS managers say they are considering what proportion of the payments
was properly due, and will then discuss with the Treasury whether any
remaining sums can be approved retrospectively on value for money grounds.
Sir John says the Treasury has refused to approve a Pounds 78,000
termination settlement paid by Wessex regional health authority to a member
of staff, but the authority believed that 'pursuing recovery of the payment
would not be cost-effective'.
The report finds two health authorities spent a further Pounds 465,000 on
relocation pay for five members of staff, Pounds 202,000 of which was
outside their powers.
Severance payments are a sensitive issue in the NHS. MPs on the Commons
public accounts committee investigating cases of mismanagement have
criticised payments to staff who, they believe, should have been summarily
dismissed.
Sir John finds that 84 per cent of NHS trusts broke even in 1992-93, while
81 per cent stayed within their external financing limits set by the
government.
Mr Gerald Malone, health minister, said the government had issued guidance
on severance payments and would be sending out advice on removal expenses
shortly.

FT  17 SEP 94 / German move boosts Brussels efforts to control trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has been given a boost in its efforts to control the
European Union's international trade policy, under a proposed compromise
drawn up by the German presidency of the Council of Ministers.
The draft compromise is intended to help resolve a complex legal battle
between the Commission and member states. The dispute threatens to delay EU
ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round
world trade deal, due to come into effect at the start of 1995.
However, the proposal is still likely to be resisted by some of the 12
member states, particularly the UK and France, which must approve it
unanimously if the row is to be defused.
Most EU governments object that the Commission is over-stepping its
authority by insisting the round can be ratified by giving the Commission
sole power to negotiate trade agreements.
The governments argue that this authority does not cover agreements in areas
such as services and intellectual property. They say ratification of these
aspects, and the Commission's authority to negotiate on them in the planned
World Trade Organisation, requires additional legislation.
However, a draft of the German presidency's proposed compromise goes a long
way to satisfying the Commission's demands. It says: 'The commission will
speak and negotiate on behalf of the community and the member states in the
WTO.'
The draft adds that member states' freedom to speak out individually in the
WTO would be subject to a code of conduct which would leave them little
scope for action.
The code of conduct is also likely to anger the European Parliament. The
parliament says it has a right of consultation on the procedure that the
code - which makes no reference to the parliament whatsoever - tries to
circumvent.
Positions taken in trade matters should 'result from a common decision
arrived at wherever possible on the basis of a Commission proposal', the
code states. When that proves impossible, it may be decided 'at an
appropriate level by consensus that each member state will be free to
present its own position'.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Russia set to decide on most risky reform stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is poised to decide on the next and most dangerous
step in its three-year-old reform process. Going ahead would mean launching
a full attack on inflation, closing many obsolete factories and starting to
create a working social security system - with the aid of up to Dollars 18bn
(Pounds 11.6bn) provided through the International Monetary Fund.
The scale of the transformation now being debated in the government and with
IMF experts would be larger than anything yet attempted and would risk
creating social unrest and political instability.
However, it could also reduce Russian inflation - which was running at 4 per
cent in August - to west European levels and provide the basis for sustained
growth for the first time in more than a decade.
The government's ambitions are partly revealed in an article in today's
Sevodnya newspaper by Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the Russian director on the
Fund's board. Mr Kagalovsky, whose article was approved by Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, lays out requests the government is
already making to the IMF and other western institutions or plans to make at
the annual IMF meeting in Madrid early next month.
Though Mr Kagalovsky does not total them, they would amount to Dollars
15bn-Dollars 20bn. If agreed, it would be a massive commitment to one
country and to a government's agreement to reform.
It would also increase criticism that the Fund is already relaxing its
criteria too much in order to accommodate Russia. Earlier this week, Mr
Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, warned that the IMF
risked 'financial and moral ruin' if it continued to waive its normally
strict conditions.
The Russian government wants to increase its 'stand-by' borrowing facility
from Dollars 4bn to more than Dollars 5bn by raising the percentage of the
Dollars 6bn quota it can borrow from 68 per cent to to 90 per cent.
It also wants to increase by up to Dollars 2bn what it can borrow under the
so called 'systemic transformation facility'.
This is a lending medium with fewer conditions than normal, under which
Russia has already borrowed Dollars 3bn in the past 12 months - also by
raising the quota limits.
The Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn from the stand-by and the systemic
transformation facility loans would be used, says Mr Kagalovsky, to:
fund the budget deficit and provide for the 'pressing needs' of industry,
the farming sector, health and social provision;
put up a fund to stabilise the rouble by paying an estimated Dollars 6bn and
Dollars 8bn to the Russian Central Bank, and giving it enough reserves to
protect the Russian currency once it is made fully convertible. Mr
Kagalovsky says that the money must be paid over to Russia rather than held
in reserve by the Fund;
give Russia membership of the Paris Club of creditor nations - because of
the huge debts owing to Russia, which Mr Kagalovsky estimates at Dollars
147bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At one level it scarcely matters to Swedish financial markets who wins
tomorrow's election. With government debt already yielding 8 percentage
points more than the inflation rate the market has already priced in a good
measure of scepticism over the country's ability to contain its government
deficit. National debt threatens to exceed gross domestic product next year.
High interest charges on that debt mean Sweden will find it harder than
other countries to grow out of its deficit problem. The stage is coming when
a government of whatever hue must take action to curb welfare spending.
Doubtless, victory for Mr Carl Bildt's centre-right coalition would come as
a pleasant surprise for markets. The Social Democrats look more likely to
win, albeit not outright. Their plans for reducing the deficit are
strikingly modest by comparison with those of the government, but a
coalition partner might force them into tougher action. High-profile
warnings about the state of government finances from private sector
businessmen have at least drawn public attention to the issue.
The question for financial markets will be how long it takes for the Social
Democrats to revise their plans. Anything more than a short delay could
provoke a further bout of weakness for both bonds and the krona, and a fresh
rise in short-term interest rates. Bold investors might see that as a buying
opportunity on the grounds that financial market alarm would concentrate
minds on the fiscal problem. But the ride could become very rough indeed if
the markets conclude that the government does not have the stomach for the
task. That would prompt more general worries about the ability of industrial
democracies to fund their public spending.

FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Banks' fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Are financial advisers fleecing their most vulnerable corporate clients? The
question has been raised twice this week. In the first instance, Lasmo
revealed it had paid financial advisers Pounds 16m to fend off a hostile
Pounds 1.6bn bid from rival oil explorer Enterprise. In the second, Queens
Moat Houses, the struggling hotel group, announced that provisions for
restructuring its Pounds 1.3bn in debt had been raised to Pounds 42m. Some
of that has been earmarked to pay fees for a new borrowing facility.
In Queens Moat's case, the scope for exploitation is clear. Its bankers were
in a position to dictate terms for the borrowing facility. If Queens Moat
did not like them, the banks could have forced it into receivership. The
Lasmo case is less clear-cut. Theoretically, it could have shopped around to
find a cheaper set of advisers. But in practice, managers on the receiving
end of a hostile bid rarely concentrate on negotiating lower fees. Their
priority is to beat off the predator.
Of course, just because there is scope for exploitation does not mean it has
actually occurred in either case. The sums look high, but it is possible
advisers have provided value for money by rescuing Lasmo from takeover and
Queens Moat from receivership. The only way to know would be if much greater
detail was disclosed by companies in such vulnerable situations about their
contracts with bankers. Ideally, this should happen in good time for
shareholder objections to be aired. Bankers might still seek multi-million
pound fees but they would have to justify them in public.

FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Next
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next is an undeserved prisoner of its past. Investors remember the
punishment which followed their love-affair with the company in the 1980s,
and live in fear of a repeat performance - even though Next's successes are
now based on more solid foundations. How much more solid was emphasised by
yesterday's stellar set of interim results, which perversely served to
trigger a 5 per cent fall in the share price.
Admittedly the chairman was cautious on the outlook for sales growth, but
the slowdown from the current 13 per cent does not mean growth is set to
peter out. On the contrary, Next is increasing its retail and catalogue
sales faster than its competitors. The City consensus suggests high
operational gearing will take pre-tax profits to more than Pounds 100m this
year - close to the 1980s high point - and to more than Pounds 120m in 1995.
Plans for expansion are reassuringly modest. The tentative four-store
experiment in the US does not suggest Next is about to rush into trouble in
the tricky north American market.
The current management's performance has been honoured by a nineteen-fold
increase in the share price since its 1991 low point, a performance that
obviously cannot be maintained. It is, however, quixotic that the shares
should be on a sub-sector rating, when the earnings outlook is better than
for the sector as a whole.

FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Tied down by bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity market has again fallen foul of events in bonds. Yesterday's
47-point fall in London was the product first of disappointing public sector
borrowing figures for August and later of the sharp rise in US industrial
production which raises fears of further increases in transatlantic interest
rates. That equities should react badly to signs of economic growth always
suggests valuations are stretched. But this week has shown them again in
thrall to bonds, where the outlook is not particularly promising.
There is no particular need to worry about one month's poor borrowing
figures. The cumulative trend in government spending this year still
suggests the PSBR will undershoot the government's Pounds 36bn target. But
the positive response to Monday's higher base rates has quickly evaporated
and the government funding programme is no longer as comfortably ahead as it
was at the start of the year.
For the time being, the authorities seem to be playing safe. The September
auction will be of 10-year paper which is usually attractive to
international investors and deliverable into the futures contract. With a
stronger sterling and a yield premium of 150 basis points over German
government bonds, it may meet reasonable demand. But the German market is
spooked by the realisation that the government is behind with its financing
while the interest rate cycle has turned. Against that background, there is
not much relief in sight.

FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers half of its
early losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retrenched yesterday after troubling economic data triggered a
sharp sell-off in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.53 lower at 3,933.35, having
recovered about half of a 41-point downturn at mid-morning. Though the
index's decline was not particularly deep, the NYSE's downturn was broad in
scope. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advances by a two-to-one
margin, pushing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 down 3.62 to 471.19.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite managed to add 0.12 to
459.86, while the Nasdaq composite was off a scant 0.75 at 777.91.
The fresh turbulence surfaced on a most inconvenient day, with futures
contracts and options on individual stocks and indices set to expire. During
such 'triple witching' sessions, the reinvestment activity typically
generates crushing volume and volatile trading conditions. Yesterday was no
exception, with 390m shares exchanged on the NYSE, compared with 280m the
previous session.
The opening brought a striking shift in sentiment from the previous day,
when the Dow surged by 58 points. The catalyst was the Commerce Department's
announcement that capacity utilisation, a keenly watched barometer of
producer prices, had climbed to its highest level since 1989.
The news, which contradicted Thursday's evidence of moderating economic
conditions, set off a stampede of sellers in the inflation-sensitive
Treasury market. By late afternoon, the yield on the benchmark 30-year
government security was up to 7.70 per cent, a fresh high on the year.
But the reaction among equity investors was more measured even during the
bleak early hours. The Dow industrials finished at mixed levels, as
program-guided trades buffeted share prices in both directions.
Among the winners, IBM advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 and Alcoa
climbed Dollars 1 1/8 . Offsetting the gains, Caterpillar dropped Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 , General Tire Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 and
American Express Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 5/8 .
The oil sector took a beating, with Atlantic Richfield the hardest hit of
the lot. The stock sunk Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 103 3/4 , while Mobil
dropped Dollars 1 1/2 and Chevron, a Dow component, lost Dollars 1 to
Dollars 42 1/4 .
Elsewhere, ITT added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 82 after confirming earlier
reports that it planned to sell some financial services operations as part
as a strategic shift.
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft appreciated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 7/8 , while
Applied Materials added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51.
Canada
Toronto stocks edged higher despite renewed fears of inflation in the US.
The TSE-300 composite index was up 18.39 points, or 0.42 per cent, to
4,403.85, with gaining issues outnumbering losing issues 389 to 329. Volume
of 70.91m and value of CDollars 1.1bn were up from Thursday's 65.84m and
CDollars 923.2m.
The TSE opened lower but regained ground throughout the afternoon on the
strength of gold, metal and utilities stocks.
Brazil
Sao Paulo shares closed up 0.1 per cent as concerns about the financial
health of some state and small banks, combined with nervousness ahead of the
presidential elections, trimmed most of the day's gains.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended up 62 at 52,937 points.
Turnover was high at RDollars 482m.
Analysts fear more small banks could be facing liquidity difficulties
following liquidation of Brasbanco bank and its underwriting house.

FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Portugal capitalises on potential for
growth - Prospects for equities in Lisbon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal is the only European market where the main stock exchange indices
are currently higher than at the start of the year. That is the good news.
Even better is the fact that the motor for growth has shifted from liquidity
to economic and corporate fundamentals.
Funds flowing into equities because of the sharp drop in government debt
rates pushed the BTA index up by nearly 60 per cent in 1993 and to a
two-year high of 3,226.6 in February. The market fell back following that
peak on turbulence in the currency markets, to hit a year's low of 2,612 in
late June.
But from then on the index gained ground - 1.9 per cent in July and a
further 6.3 per cent in August as the escudo stabilised and economic and
corporate performance confirmed forecasts of a recovery. The index closed
yesterday at 2,936, up 7.7 per cent since the start of the year.
Trading volume for the first eight months of 1994 was also very strong,
rising by 77 per cent in escudo terms over the same period last year, which
itself followed a rise of 97 per cent in 1993.
A partial explanation of the market's growth over the past two years can be
put down to a process of catching-up with the other European bourses after a
long period of virtual stagnation. But prospects for strong,
non-inflationary economic growth and the expected benefits of corporate
restructuring are beginning to take over from less stable factors as the
drive behind the market. Analysts are unanimously buoyant about Portuguese
equities, and the most optimistic are forecasting a further 15 per cent rise
by the end of the year.
'Portugal has the advantages of an emerging market in terms of high
potential growth, without the economic and political risks associated with
markets in Latin America and Asia,' says Mr Trevenen Morris-Grantham of
Carnegie Portugal.
The economy is thought to have begun emerging from recession in the second
quarter of 1994. The government is forecasting economic growth of between 1
to 2 per cent this year, based mainly on increased export and tourism
earnings. Next year's budget is being prepared on an estimate of 2.5 to 3.5
per cent growth in 1995.
Unlike most of Europe, the return to growth is being accompanied by a steady
fall in inflation: year-on-year figures fell from 6.3 per cent in January to
4.8 per cent in August.
The government is forecasting an average annual inflation rate of 4.5 to 5.5
per cent this year, down from 6.5 per cent in 1993. But the 1995 goal of 3.5
to 4.5 per cent may be over optimistic, especially as a general election is
due in October 1995.
Financial market tensions have also eased considerably in recent months:
since the last speculative attack on the escudo in May, the currency has
appreciated from a low of Es104.5 to the D-Mark to Es101.7 at present.
'Although improving fundamentals partly explain the turnaround, perhaps the
more crucial factor has been the markets' acceptance that they cannot beat a
central bank that persists in suspending official money-market rates at the
first sign of trouble,' says Ms Sally Wilkinson, southern Europe economist
with Union Bank of Switzerland.
A stable escudo and falling inflation have enabled the central bank to begin
a cautious lowering of interest rates - the intervention rate has been cut
in gradual steps from 11 to 9.25 per cent since July, two months after the
currency crisis.
With the liquidity injection rate remaining suspended the monetary
authorities have continued to lend through a variable rate repo system,
which has been cut from 9.72 to 9.5 per cent over the past few days. The
central bank's decision to lower the compulsory cash reserve requirement for
banks from 17 per cent of customer liabilities to two per cent from November
1 will also help create a fresh climate for interest rate reductions.
And there is ample room for more cuts. Portugal's short-term rates are more
than 200 basis points higher than Spain's, although inflation in the two
country's is almost identical. But analysts expect the central bank to halt
rate cuts as soon as there is any indication of renewed attacks on the
escudo.
The recession in 1993 has given Portuguese companies the incentive and
opportunity to streamline and refocus. 'Companies are now in a much better
position to take advantage of a resumption in economic growth and produce
higher profits,' says Ms Mari Vargas of Dillon Read.
Two half-yearly results announced last week reflect this confidence. Sonae,
Portugal's largest private-sector industrial and distribution conglomerate,
reported a 110 per cent increase in net consolidated profits, while
Corticeira Amorim, the world's largest cork producer, showed a 269 per cent
increase.
Half-yearly bank results were also better than expected. Some analysts are
now forecasting a recovery for the banking sector, which accounts for more
than half the market turnover, by the end of 1995. Banco Comercial
Portugues' bid for control of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, although vetoed
by the government, has shown that there is a drive towards rationalisation
and cost-cutting in banking as in other areas of the economy.

FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Shares and bonds suffer severe
punishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mixed performance in the European morning turned into a painful erosion of
equity values yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
Domestic bond markets took severe punishment as US data showed industrial
production and capacity utilisation at levels higher than expected.
PARIS took the full force of the European selling wave. Having enjoyed a
moderately good morning, after a strong overnight rise in the Dow, the CAC
fell away sharply throughout the afternoon.
Almost mirroring last Friday's performance, when the 40 share index closed
down 2.2 per cent, the market ended the day with a loss of 2.6 per cent,
down 52.71 at 1,924.59, bringing its accumulated loss on the week to 1.2 per
cent.
Turnover was FFr3.8bn.
One or two bright spots were in evidence. St Gobain, for instance, picked up
FFr13 to FFr655 following its greatly improved first half results, which
exceeded analysts' expectations.
Total, initially, was another gainer, rising to an intraday high of FFr338
before succumbing to the afternoon sell-off and closing the session down a
modest 60 centimes at FFr331.60. The oil group, which rose 4 per cent on
Thursday, has been benefiting from renewed overseas interest.
FRANKFURT was pulled well off its highs during the official session by weak
bonds, and it lost more ground in the post bourse as the December bund
future hita contract low, and then fell further.
The Dax index registered an early high of 2,138.65 but closed the session at
2,118.73, up 4.75 on the day and down 3 per cent on the week. After hours,
it slid to 2,097.45, a fraction above its worst for the day.
There were encouraging moves on the session. Veba closed up DM4.10 at
DM541.50 on plans for a stake in the satellite telecommunications company,
Iridium; and Preussag rose DM4 to DM459.50 after it said it was buying from
Metallgesellschaft a 65 per cent stake in the transport group, LMT.
Metallgesellschaft hit a new 1994 low of DM167.20 before closing DM6 lower
at DM169, and defying the post-bourse slump with a token recovery to DM171
in the afternoon.
MILAN received a boost from news of Montedison's return to first half
pre-tax profit, before the US news raised worries about higher inflation and
interest rates. The Comit index put on 17.15 or 2.6 per cent to 678.49 for a
2.4 per cent rise over the week.
Mr Michele Pacitti at James Capel said that renewed buying was being seen in
anticipation of positive news from forthcoming half year corporate reports.
Montedison climbed L44 or 3.2 per cent to L1,423, after a high of L1,452,
while Ferruzzi, the parent company, put on L68 to L1,637. The mood spilled
over to other industrials, taking Fiat L90 ahead to L6,574.
Insurers continued to do well on hopes that they will benefit from pension
reform. Generali rose L825 or 2.1 per cent to L39,310 as it launched its
one-for-10 rights issue.
Against the trend, Olivetti gave up L20 to L2,060 ahead of first half
operating results next Thursday which, some analysts have forecast, could
include losses on its bond portfolio of at least L1bn.
ZURICH came under pressure from lower US bonds and the weaker dollar, and
the SMI index fell 25.3 to 2,603.3, down 1.5 per cent on the week.
Roche certificates, under pressure on Thursday after Goldman Sachs removed
them from its European recommended for purchase list, fell another SFr90 to
SFr5,960, in spite of news that BZW had confirmed its 'strong buy'
recommendation yesterday.
Nestle fell SFr16 to SFr1,200 in response to Thursday's smaller than
expected first half profit rise, although analysts remained optimistic for
the full year result.
AMSTERDAM breached the 410 support level as the repercussions of US data
made themselves felt and the AEX index declined 4.03 to 407.58. After a
see-saw week's trading the index closed a net 1.3 per cent lower, with
options expiry also adding to the day's gloom.
Brokers reported that the next support level was at 405.
MADRID's focus on bond markets took banks lower again, the sector leading
the way down with construction and building materials stocks as the general
index fell 3.23 to 301.21, 1.3 per cent down on the week.
In construction, FCC, Huarte and Uralita dropped Pta530 to Pta12,360, Pta60
to Pta1,580 and Pta50 to Pta1,535 respectively. In banks, up on Thursday on
rumours of more relaxed rules on provisions for bond market losses,
Argentaria lost Pta150 at Pta5,310 and BBV Pta80 at Pta3,145. Ironically,
the Bank of Spain was reported to be moving on the provisioning initiative
after the market closed.

FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region revives as Nikkei
gains are eroded
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-taking and arbitrage selling depressed share prices in low volume
after Thursday's holiday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index closed down 123.12 at 19,796.26 after a high of
19,972.59 and a low of 19,795.26, for a week's loss of 0.5 per cent. The
index rose in the morning session on index-linked buying prompted by the
stronger dollar against the yen and the sharp rise in US stock prices on
Thursday.
However, position adjustments ahead of the weekend and profit-taking by
corporate investors eroded the gains.
Volume was 251m shares against 265m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks declined 7.75 to 1,576.21, and the Nikkei 300 lost 1.29 to 287.95.
Declines outnumbered advances by 700 to 267, with 199 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 0.20 to 1,288.29.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to
Y743 on selling by overseas investors. Other large capital issues were also
actively traded with Nippon Steel down Y1 to Y376 and NKK down Y4 to Y275.
Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y20 to Y1,600 on worries about
oversupply. The company is expected to raise some Y200bn in convertible
bonds next month.
Other high-tech stocks were also weak in spite of the rise in the dollar.
Hitachi fell Y8 to Y956 and NEC lost Y30 to Y1,170.
Speculative favourites were higher. Hanwa, the steel trader, rose Y24 to
Y434 and Sanrio added Y40 to Y1,470. Tsumura, the pharmaceutical company
which previously lost ground on reports of lower profits, gained Y40 to Y327
on active buying.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 154.04 to 22,000.57 in volume of 58.1m
shares.
Roundup
The region's equity markets, flat to middling on Thursday. mostly revived
following overnight gains on Wall Street.
KUALA LUMPUR saw heavy speculative buying and some institutional demand in
key blue chips, and the KLSE index rose 9.21 to a new, eight-month closing
high of 1,185.27, a fraction higher on the week.
Volume rose from 450m shares to 506m. Idris Hydraulic, a speculative
favourite, climbed 35 cents to MDollars 5.75 in 21.5m shares.
SEOUL closed above the 1,000 mark for the first time this year as blue chips
staged a technical rebound. The composite index rose 12.05 to 1,000.80, up
1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover eased from Won883.4bn to Won733.1bn.
Brokers said that the government appeared to scale down selling intervention
in later trading, resulting in upbeat buying interest in blue chips like
Kepco and Korean Air; both went limit-up, rising Won1,300 to Won35,800, and
by Won1,000 to Won26,600.
HONG KONG was revived by late buying which left the Hang Seng index 105.88
higher at 9,968.52, down 1.7 per cent on the week, as turnover rose from
HKDollars 3.44bn to a provisional HKDollars 3.92bn.
Jardine Matheson was active, gaining 25 cents to HKDollars 74.50 in turnover
of nearly HKDollars 296m; but its subsidiary, Dairy Farm, which late on
Thursday announced higher profits and said it would cancel its Hong Kong
listing, fell 80 cents to HKDollars 11.60.
WELLINGTON was led higher by Fletcher and other blue chips, the NZSE-40
index ending 18.67 higher at 2,111.67, 2.2 per cent lower on the week.
Fletcher rose 12 cents to NZDollars 4.41 in 5.3m shares
SINGAPORE was steered higher by last minute buying of two key index-linked
stocks, Cycle &amp; Carriage and Keppel, which left the Straits Times Industrial
index up 16.34 at 2,297.18, virtually flat on the week. Cycle and Carriage
jumped 80 cents to SDollars 13.30, and Keppel 40 cents to SDollars 11.70.
BANGKOK was unable to break resistance at 1,550, the SET index rising 12.20
to 1,546.24, 2.5 per cent higher on the week in turnover of Bt10.4bn. Trade
focused on blue-chip telecommunications, finance and banking stocks.
SYDNEY failed to maintain an early rally as anxiety over pending US capacity
utilisation figures dogged the market. The All Ordinaries index ended only
8.2 higher at 2,059.0, 0.6 per cent lower on the week.

FT  17 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: US data prompt setback in bonds and
shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A heavy setback in global bond markets, prompted by unexpectedly strong data
on the US economy, sparked off another slide in the London equity market
yesterday afternoon. Towards the close of business, when UK government bonds
were more than 1 1/2 points down and stock index futures at a substantial
discount to the FT-SE 100 Index, share prices virtually collapsed.
The FT-SE 100 index ended the day at 3,065.1, a net 47.6 down in its largest
daily fall since mid-June. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to
futures selling, held its loss to 32.8 for a final reading of 3,616.1.
Market strategists were significantly less pessimistic than the fall in the
Footsie suggested, and pointed out that liquidity is notoriously thin on
Friday afternoons. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull described the outcome
of the equity session as 'a great buying opportunity'.
The more serious blows fell on the bond markets, where UK gilts began to
fall sharply following the announcement at mid-morning of an August Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement well outside market estimates.
Both short and long-dated gilts were already sharply off when US bonds began
to shy away as New York awaited two key sets of economic data. News that in
August, US capacity utilisation had jumped to 84.7 per cent and industrial
production had gained 0.7 per cent brought a wide-ranging fall in bond
markets.
The slide in UK gilts quickly gathered pace, with some analysts warning that
the Federal Reserve might raise rates very soon. Concern focused around
prospects for the auction of a new UK gilt on Wednesday, the Bank of England
confirming market expectations by announcing yesterday that it would be a
conventional bond maturing in the 2004-2006 range. Some pessimists whispered
that the Bank had argued for a full point rise in base rates this week.
The FT-SE 100 Index has fallen by nearly 2.4 per cent this week as the first
rise in base rates for nearly five years has left the UK bond markets still
vulnerable to shocks from overseas. Weakness in German bonds yesterday was
seen as a further threat to gilt-edged securities.
Early trading saw equities, as expected, driven by pressures from the expiry
of the September contract in the stock index futures market - although this
passed off without incident. The Footsie was 20 points up at first, and then
7 points down as the futures-related blue chips swayed with the September
contract expiry. But these technical factors in equities were quickly
forgotten when bond prices began to fall.
Few sectors were spared in the general shake-out. Dollar-orientated shares
took further presure when the US currency weakened. The blue chip oil shares
no longer provided the positive lead of the past few sessions. Retail,
consumer and store shares took further punishment from fears that the
interest rate cycle was about to turn upwards much sooner than expected.
Banks gave back a few early gains as the rout spread across the market.
Many analysts remained bullish, maintaining that the US data confirmed that
the economy is recovering strongly. By this yardstick, the falls in bond
markets were to be expected, but equities should benefit over the medium
term. Bond/equity market ratings are believed to be less stretched in London
than in the US, and the spread between London and New York equity markets is
also regarded as favourable to the UK.
However, little genuine and lasting upturn in UK equities is thought likely
until the gilt-edged market can at least stabilise and then make some
recovery from its losses.

FT  17 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters wanted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Water stocks continued to recapture some of their former gloss, with the
sector said to have been given a strong push by James Capel and other
brokers after a period of relative stagnation.
Dealers said the institutions were still keen on the defensive, high
yielding areas of the market.
The best individual performance in waters, albeit in light turnover, came
from Southern which closed 10 higher at 573p, after 575p, closely followed
by Thames, up 6 at 509p and Severn Trent, the same amount up at 545p.
Norweb continued its share buy-back programme, acquiring a further 1.5m
shares at 795p and boosting the stock price 4 to 790p. South Wales bought in
400,000 shares at 817p with the price easing 2 to 813p and Manweb edged up a
penny to 833p after picking up 1m shares at 835p.
Northern Ireland Electricity returned to favour, closing 8 higher at 370p.
PowerGen celebrated moving into its closed period by sliding 15 to 539p.
The oil majors suffered a double hit, reacting to the weakness of the dollar
against sterling and to a feeling that the sector had been over-hyped before
and after the much-heralded exploration presentations by BP in London and
New York and the double-digit dividend increased announced by Shell on
Thursday.
BP dipped 7 to 413 1/2 p, on turnover of 10m and Shell 12 to 710 1/2 p on
2.6m traded. Enterprise fell 11 to 395p. Calor put on another good showing,
the shares edging up 2 more to 299p, still reflecting the good results
announced earlier in the week.
Betterware, the group which sells domestic products direct to householders,
was one of the market's biggest casualties, the shares plummeting 23 to 50p,
after 49p, in the wake of the latest profits warning. The group warned that
profits for the first half would not exceed Pounds 4m, compared with Pounds
7.6m in the same period last year. Betterware shares peaked at 278p just
over a year ago.
News that summer 1995 holiday bookings are up 42 per cent on last year's
figures, after a month's trading, gave a strong boost to Owners Abroad
shares which jumped 7 to 119p.
The news was delivered at a egm at which shareholders agreed a change of
name, to First Choice Holiday.
Aggressive price cutting on trans-Atlantic routes by Continental Airlines of
the US cast a cloud over British Airways, pushing the shares down 6 1/2 to
382 1/2 p. Trading volume was a massive 7m shares.
Most brokers stand by their profit forecasts for this year. But the US
market is clearly a key route for BA and analysts will be watching US
airline price reactions like a hawk.
Tiphook provided the only other big transport feature, easing a further 2 to
35p on confirmation that a bankruptcy petition had been served against chief
executive Mr Robert Montague.
The stock market fears that Mr Montague's personal stake in the company -
possibly around 3 per cent - could now be overhanging a share price that has
tumbled this year from a peak of 79p.
British Aerospace shed 12 to 473p in nervous trading ahead of next week's
interim results. The decision by Raytheon to switch to the US production of
the corporate jet business brought from BAe last year added to
uncertainties.
BAe has less than two years left of a three year agreement to supply parts
to Ratheon. With production moving away from the UK there are serious stock
market doubts that BAe will be able to renew the business in 1996.
Siebe continued to gain ground, rising 7 against the general trend to 557p
with the backing of a buy recommendation from Warburg Securities.
Heavyweight pharmaceutical shares came in for markedly heavy selling with
Wellcome tumbling 23 to 657p as the bid speculation that has hovered over
the company since April showed signs of rapidly evaporating.
Waning takeover hopes also hit Zeneca although analysts pointed to the
company's strong operating fundamentals as helping to limit the downside
shift to 19 1/2 to 810 1/2 0p.
Its huge US market interest could only exacerbate the slide at Glaxo which
tumbled 17 to 584p. There was heavy turnover in the stock options.
Among smaller shares, British Biotech moved up strongly by 15 to 520p on the
back of a buy recommendation from Lehman Bros.
The major chemicals groups got caught up in the dismal trend. Having opened
higher at 852p, ICI quickly lost ground to close 10 1/2 lower at 833 1/2 p.
Among motor distributors, Kwik-Fit rose a further 6 to 160p as the market
digested Thursday's good interim results and consequent securities house
profit upgrades.
Schroders left the rest of the merchant banking sector far behind,
responding to talk of broker upgrades. The ordinary shares moved up 24 to
1574p. Other merchant banks, however, mostly suffered from the recent
turbulence in bonds and equities, which could have triggered losses among
the big trading houses.
Midland Independent Newspapers were sold down to their March flotation price
with the shares falling 14 to 140p on the back of a cautious interim
statement. The recovery in advertising flows remains very patchy.
Some analysts have been downgrading their profits projections for the full
year, notably Smith New Court which has clawed back from Pounds 17m pre-tax
to Pounds 15.6m. United Newspapers, down 10 to 505p, put out their interim
results next week.

A series of profits downgrades and a steep fall in the share price hit Next,
the fashion retailers, despite better than expected profits and a much
higher than expected interim dividend.
The stock price dropped 15 to 243p - its lowest level since July - on
turnover of 13m shares, the heaviest daily volume for more than three years
and the highest on the stockmarket list yesterday.
The downgrades, mostly down to around the Pounds 95m to Pounds 97m level,
from previous levels of around Pounds 100, followed a cautious statement
from the company on second half sales. It pointed out that sales in the last
quarter of last year were particularly good.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed US inflation fears yesterday prompted a sharp fall in the dollar on
foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith.
A jump in the August capacity utilisation figures caused bonds to plummet,
and the dollar followed suit. It closed in London at DM1.5376, down from
DM1.55 earlier in the day, and at Y98.855, down from Y99.20.
Sterling was a beneficiary of the dollar's weakness, touching a sixteen
month high of Dollars 1.5870 before slipping back below Dollars 1.58 in late
trade. It was also stronger against the D-Mark, spiking above DM2.44 in late
trade, compared to Thursday's close of DM2.4183. The trade weighted index
finished at 79.8, from 79.2.
The D-Mark was generally weaker in Europe. It finished at L1,011 against the
lira, from L1,012. Against the French franc it closed at FFr3.418, from
FFr3.422. The Swiss franc also considered its upward progress, closing at
SFr0.821 from SFr0.83.
Although the dollar is only about one pfennig, and two yen, above its July
lows, some analysts were impressed at its resilience. Mr David Cocker,
economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'The dollar has performed rather well
today considering the way the bond market has performed.'
In recent weeks the market has been less keen to sell the dollar, leading
some analysts to hint at a possible change in sentiment.
The dollar, however, still faces some serious short-term obstacles. One is
the markets' fear that the US Federal Reserve is 'behind the game' in
combatting inflation. The dollar is unlikely to recover against this
background.
The other problem is politics. The Haiti issue, and the US-Japan trade
talks, which reach an end of month deadline, both have the potential to
cause dollar selling.
Against an environment of generalised D-Mark weakness, the Swiss franc
continued to strengthen.
Two factors supporting it were the Haiti invasion talk - 'If you have a safe
haven, it is the Swiss franc,' commented one analyst - and the traditional
strength in the franc ahead of German elections.
Sterling was also a notable beneficiary of the D-Mark's weakness, but
analysts said there was also an element of independent strength.
'The psychology of the market was transformed by Mr Clarke's decision to
raise interest rates. The prospects for sterling have improved
dramatically,' said Mr Cocker.
He said that rates had been raised two months ahead of market expectations.
'It is not known in the UK for chancellors to do that. It could be seen as a
radical change in UK monetary management.'
The larger than expected August PSBR figure, and the downturn in the gilts
market hit short sterling. All the 1995/1996 contracts lost about 15 basis
points.
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
Pounds 270m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 100m assistance,
at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 500m shortage.
Euromark contracts also lost ground, with rumours in the market that
interest rate hawks on the Bundesbank council were beginning to flex their
muscles.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium returns to 1991
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium started the week determined to burst through Dollars 1,600 a tonne
on the London Metal Exchange, a price not seen since January 1991 and a
level at which nearly every smelter in the world is profitable.
It took time, but yesterday, aluminium for delivery in three months broke
through resistance and closed last night at Dollars 1,608.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 32 on the day and Dollars 21.75 from Friday's close last week.
Sentiment yesterday was helped by another substantial fall in LME warehouse
stocks. Since stocks peaked at a record 2.65m tonnes in June this year, they
have fallen by 270,000 tonnes or nearly 10 per cent.
Earlier in the week, the market paused for breath after an unexpected rise
in producer stocks was reported by the International Primary Aluminium
Institute.
Traders are now looking for aluminium to reach Dollars 1,650 a tonne.
However, there were words of caution from some observers. Mr Angus
MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the price was
getting ahead of itself. 'There are still huge stocks overhanding the market
 -about 14 weeks of consumption - and eventually the market will realise
this and settle down to sideways trading. Things are often overdone in the
early stages of a recovery and the first-quarter rise in (aluminium) prices
is not sustainable to the year-end.'
The output cuts made by aluminium producers so far this year were 'having an
impact beyond their wildest dreams'. As long as the producers stuck to their
guns, there would be a supply deficit of about 400,000 tonnes this year and
one of 1m tonnes in 1995, he said. Consequently, Mr MacMillan is forecasting
aluminium prices averaging 65 cents a lb this year (Dollars 1,433 a tonne)
and 75 cents (Dollars 1,653) in 1995.
Meanwhile, the coffee market this week was dogged by uncertainty about the
Brazilian government's plans for auctioning off its stockpile. After a
dramatic rise a week ago on news that the auction would be cancelled,
traders believed the government could be close to changing its mind.
Rainfall forecasts for the coffee-growing regions of Brazil also affected
prices. The frost-damaged trees have been suffering from a shortage of
rainfall, but need a heavy downpour to do them any benefit. Light rain which
was forecast for mid-week could be worse than none at all as it could
encourage the trees to produce flowers which would later die.
The big drop in the market occurred on Wednesday when prices lost Dollars
153 a tonne - declining at one stage by more than Dollars 200 a tonne - on
news that Brazilian coffee growers were trying to persuade the government to
restart the auctions. The price of the November futures contract at the
London Commodity Exchange dropped from Dollars 3,993 a tonne to Dollars
3,840 a tonne.
But the confusion was cleared up again on Thursday when Brasilia announced
that, for the time being, the auctions remain off. With 5m bags of coffee
still to sell in its stockpile, this could keep international supplies
tight.
However, the market reaction was modest with prices rising only Dollars 37 a
tonne in quiet trading. The market remained quiet yesterday, although prices
gained ground in late trading as dealers expressed concern over weather
conditions in Brazil at the weekend. The London market closed Dollars 53
higher at Dollars 3,931 a tonne.

Despite virtual stagnation in the underlying market for ceramic tiles, Fired

Turnover was up slightly from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 2.52m.
Earnings per share were 0.78p (1.25p losses).
Mr Nicholas Kneale, the chairman, said that lower costs and the 'gathering

helped the company move back into the black.

FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Korean groups set to list on
NYSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) and Korea Electric Power (Kepco) are expected
next month to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the ministry of
finance said yesterday. It is the first move by South Korean companies to
seek listings on international markets.
The two state-controlled companies, which have tentative approval from the
US Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE for the listings, will
each issue Dollars 300m in depositary receipts.
Posco is the world's second largest steelmaker, with net profits of Won295bn
(Dollars 368.7m) in 1993. Kepco, meanwhile, is Korea's electricity monopoly
and the largest capitalised company on the Seoul bourse, with net profits of
Won419bn last year.
The Korean government recently announced it would allow Korean companies to
list their shares on the New York, London and Tokyo bourses. It is also
considering allowing foreign companies to be listed on the Seoul exchange
from next year, as part of its financial liberalisation programme.
At least nine other Korean companies are considering listing their shares on
foreign exchanges from next year. They include Samsung Electronics and its
electronics rival Goldstar, Hyundai Motor, Daewoo Corporation, Samsung Heavy
Industry, the Lucky and Yukong petrochemical companies, Ssangyong Oil
Refining and Ssangyong Cement.
The ministry of finance had initially wanted to delay the listing of Posco
and Kepco on the New York exchange at least until the end of this year, for
fear that a record amount of overseas issues of equity-linked bonds by
Korean companies would increase inflationary pressure, as they brought the
funds into the country.
The ministry recently banned overseas bond issues for the fourth quarter
after this year's ceiling of Dollars 1.25bn was reached. However, it has now
raised the ceiling to Dollars 1.28bn to accommodate the Posco listing. It
has also allowed Kepco to replace a planned Dollars 300m bond issue with the
depository receipts, so it could acquire the New York listing.

FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: HK hotels group shows strong
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mandarin Oriental International, the hotel group controlled by Jardine
Matheson, yesterday announced a 16 per cent rise in first-half 1994 net
earnings, to USDollars 22.6m, from Dollars 19.5m the previous year. Results
were boosted by enhanced contributions from the group's two Hong Kong
hotels, Mandarin Oriental and The Excelsior.
The Hong Kong hotel sector is enjoying a return to better times as visitor
arrivals to the colony increase and hotels are pulled down to make way for
office blocks, dampening supply. However, increasing competition in other
markets - such as Manila and Jakarta - eroded revenues.
In May, Mandarin Oriental took over management of The Ritz hotel in London,
the group's first presence in Europe. Next year it opens its first hotel in
Mexico City. In 1998 a deluxe hotel in Kuala Lumpur is due to open, in which
the group is to take a 25 per cent interest.
Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 3.32 US cents from 2.87 US cents. An
interim of 1.55 US cents a share is recommended against last year's 1.41 US
cents.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US advance helps Keller to Pounds 3.01m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keller, the international ground engineering company, reported a 40 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 after strong sales in
North America.
Profits rose from Pounds 2.15m to Pounds 3.01m in its first results since
flotation in April, when shares were priced at 130p giving a market
capitalisation of Pounds 72.8m. Yesterday the shares closed up 3p at 129p.
Turnover was Pounds 89.1m (Pounds 69.5m), including Pounds 10.5m from
acquisitions, and operating profit rose 28 per cent to Pounds 3.64m (Pounds
2.83m) after a Pounds 400,000 contribution from Case International, the
Chicago-based foundation engineer acquired in January.
Mr Michael West, chief executive, said: 'Our order books at the half-year
were well ahead of the same time last year, and that stronger order book was
still in place at the end of August.'
In North America sales increased from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 28m, helped by
the Case purchase, for profits of Pounds 1.33m, compared with Pounds
789,000.
In Germany trading volumes remained high although the group, a former
engineering offshoot of GKN, warned of tightening margins in western Germany
where market conditions were increasingly competitive. Continental Europe
contributed profits of Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 1.79m) on turnover of Pounds
47.2m (Pounds 43.5m).
UK turnover was Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 12.7m) and profits more than trebled to
Pounds 345,000 (Pounds 101,000), reflecting improved trading conditions and
the start of infrastructure projects on the Jubilee underground line and
Heathrow Airport rail link.
Group net interest costs fell to Pounds 631,000 (Pounds 689,000). Net
borrowings at the period end were Pounds 4.4m for gearing which would
reduced to 14 per cent.
An interim foreign income dividend of 0.5p is being paid from earnings per
share up at 4.5p (2.4p).

FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Montedison back to the black
with L289bn pre-tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Montedison, the Italian industrial company recovering from near-collapse
last year, has returned to pre-tax profits for the first time since 1991.
It unexpectedly released its half-year results yesterday, showing profits
before tax and minority interests of L289bn (Dollars 184.6m) for the six
months to June, compared with a loss of L369bn in the first half of 1993.
About 30 per cent of Montedison is controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin).
Unusually for Italian companies, which normally publish results after the
market closes, the announcement was made at lunchtime. The share price
immediately rose by more than 5 per cent to a high of L1,452, before falling
back to close at L1,390, up L11.
The results demonstrate the benefits of the drastic restructuring and
cost-cutting carried out by the current management since last summer.
So far, Montedison has raised some L1,100bn by hiving off non-strategic
businesses to concentrate on the principal activities of agro-industry,
energy and chemicals.
In the first six months of the year, with the help of a capital increase,
the group's debt fell L4,416bn to L11,425bn, and financial charges in the
first half of 1994 were L264bn lower than in the equivalent period.
Profits in the first six months of last year were also undermined by the
need to write off extraordinary losses of L353bn, following revelations at a
dramatic shareholder meeting in June 1993 that group losses were 35 per cent
higher than originally announced.
The current board, headed by Mr Guido Rossi, took over immediately after
that meeting, spawning a series of lawsuits and counter-suits in its
attempts to recover damages from its predecessors, the Ferruzzi family, and
the group's former auditor Price Waterhouse.
The group's gross operating profit rose to L1,385bn in the first half of
this year, from L1,296bn in the same period last year. The figure for last
year was restated because of changes in accounting rules. Net operating
profits grew by 10 per cent to L812bn from L739bn. Turnover was almost
unchanged at L10,248bn.
Montedison's parent company cut its losses to L349bn before tax in the first
half, against a loss of L1,085bn last time.

FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sonae shrugs off falling prices
and demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sonae, Portugal's largest distribution and industrial conglomerate, reported
a 109.7 per cent increase in net consolidated profits, to Es6.5bn (Dollars
41.2m) for the first half, in spite of falling private consumption and
higher raw material costs.
Sonae's Continente hypermarket and Modelo supermarket chains, which account
for about 80 per cent of group turnover, registered a 28.9 per cent rise in
retail sales, to Es95bn.
However, a high level of investment and internal reorganisation costs
weakened results. Continente's net profit fell 4.2 per cent to Es2.3bn.
Modelo's net profit slid 79.2 per cent to Es1.1bn, largely due to the sale
of a smaller supermarket chain.
Sonae's industrial arm, focused on wood-based products, reduced its net loss
to Es100m from Es1.7bn for the first half of last year.
In spite of strong price and volume performance, margins were hit by rising
raw material costs.
Extraordinary profits for the group rose to Es4.7bn from Es4.2bn for the
same period last year.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson sale attracts MEPC - Australian
property portfolio could be worth up to ADollars 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, has joined a large number of
property investors negotiating the purchase of Hammerson's Australian
property portfolio. The portfolio was valued at Pounds 175.9m in December,
but could fetch as much as ADollars 500m (Pounds 238m).
Under the guidance of Mr Ron Spinney, who took over as chief executive 15
months ago, Hammerson has been looking to realign its portfolio,
concentrating on the UK and continental Europe.
It has received approaches from up to seven investment groups, and has
indicated that it plans to sell its entire portfolio, assuming sufficiently
attractive prices.
The main asset in the portfolio is the 1.05m sq ft Warringah Mall shopping
centre, the second largest in the country, which is situated on Sydney's
north shore. The centre is fully let, and Hammerson has planning permission
for an extension.
MEPC Australia has confirmed that it is interested in the portfolio, as has
AMP Investment, the investment arm of the Australian insurance group.
MEPC recently raised ADollars 1bn in debt to fund Australian acquisitions.
Other interested parties are understood to include Lend Lease, Bankers Trust
and Schroders.
Hammerson has made it clear that it is in no hurry to dispose of these
assets, which were marked down by close to 30 per cent in the previous two
years.
However, Australian property values have surged this year and analysts
estimate that by the year end the Hammerson portfolio could have appreciated
in value by up to 10 per cent, with stronger growth to come in 1995.
The bulk of the portfolio was acquired during the early 1970's, although the
Warringah Mall development was started in 1963.
Investors' attention has been focused on the retail development. At the year
end Communications House and 500 Collins Street, both Melbourne office
properties, had occupancy rates of only 14.7 per cent and 68.5 per cent
respectively. The portfolio had a 1993 rental income of Pounds 16.3m.
Hammerson has gearing of about 60 per cent and is expected to have year-end
net debt of about Pounds 750m. The sale could cut its debt by close to
one-third and save the group about Pounds 1m a year in administration costs.
Analysts said Hammerson would have to find attractive pricing to justify the
Australian sale, as the portfolio currently offers a yield of about 9 per
cent.

FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: ITT looks to expand through
asset sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US financial, leisure and manufacturing conglomerate, yesterday
confirmed it was seeking buyers for its ITT Financial subsidiary, a
middle-ranking US finance company, in a sale that could fetch between
Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn.
ITT said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes, but it
is understood the group wants to use at least some of the funds to pay for a
big expansion of its leisure and entertainment business. This could even
include a bid for General Electric's NBC television network. Goldman Sachs
was yesterday appointed advisers to the sale.
Mr Rand Araskog, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday ITT was
selling ITT Financial because it wanted a greater balance between its
financial service, manufacturing and hotel and entertainment businesses.
At present, the financial side dominates the other two divisions. Apart from
ITT Financial, it includes the Hartford insurance business, one of the
biggest operations of its type in the US. Hartford is not being sold.
Although ITT's existing leisure and entertainment interests include the
Sheraton hotel group, they rank behind the manufacturing side in terms of
turnover and profit. The manufacturing arm includes a big auto parts unit
making anti-lock braking systems.
ITT Financial offers a range of services to businesses and individuals,
including commercial equipment and real estate loans, small business loans,
home mortgages, consumer loans, and related insurance products. Last year it
made net profits of Dollars 205m on revenues of Dollars 1.44bn.
Possible buyers would include other finance companies in similar business
areas. One candidate is GE Capital, part of General Electric.
ITT's reported interest in acquiring the NBC television network from General
Electric raises the possibility of a part exchange. However, General
Electric's favoured buyer for NBC is believed to be Time Warner, the US
media and entertainment group. ITT has been sidelined pending an outcome of
talks between the other two parties.
ITT's interest in NBC follows its acquisition last month of Madison Square
Garden sports and entertainment complex for Dollars 1.1bn, in partnership
with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television company. ITT is also in the
process of taking over Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Advance of 18% comes as no surprise to
James Crean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company which had a IPounds
62m rights issue in April, lifted pre-tax profits 18 per cent to IPounds
9.05m (Pounds 8.91m) in the first half of 1994.
Mr Brian Molloy, chief operating officer, said the results were in line with
expectations.
However, in the food and beverages division, which operates mostly in the US
but includes the sole distributor of Mars confectionery in Ireland, there
were flat operating profits of IPounds 6m on turnover up 19 per cent at
IPounds 78.1m (IPounds 65.1m).
Mr Molloy said two-thirds of the sales growth derived from two product
launches in the US frozen foods market, involving the one-off payment of
'slotting costs' to supermarkets to make shelf space.
Inishtech, the paper and packaging company of which Crean holds 71 per cent,
also had flat profits - at IPounds 4m on turnover of IPounds 29.8m (IPounds
27m). This, Mr Molloy said, was due to softness in the label business and
the loss of a customer which accounted for 10 per cent of sales.
Electrical wholesaling lifted profits to IPounds 1.1m (IPounds 800,000) on
turnover of IPounds 23.1m (IPounds 19.7m) as UK markets emerged from
recession. Office products made IPounds 1.2m (IPounds 800,000) on sales of
IPounds 10.6m (IPounds 10.1m).
Crean is hoping to buy the balance of Inishtech, probably in a share swap.
Beyond that, the rights issue, which reduced borrowings to IPounds 18.8m for
gearing of 15 per cent, should fund acquisitions across the group.
Group turnover totalled IPounds 128.3m (IPounds 120.9m, including IPounds
12.9m from discontinued operations). Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to
13.5p (12.2p) and the interim dividend is lifted 5 per cent to 5.925p.

<TEXT>
Zurich Insurance, one of the world's largest insurers, said its gross
premium income rose 1.4 per cent in the first half, to SFr14.2bn (Dollars
11.1bn). All three business areas - life, non-life and reinsurance - grew at
roughly the same rate.
Losses resulting from natural catastrophes were considerably higher than in
the comparable period in 1993. The group said insurance and assumed
reinsurance claims arising from the California earthquake earlier this year
would reach between Dollars 85m and Dollars 90m.
The life insurance division made a greater contribution to growth than in
recent years.
The group published no profit figure for the first half, but said it
expected a 'good overall result' in the full year, provided there were no
extraordinary developments on the claims, foreign exchange or financial
fronts.
The strength of the Swiss franc restrained premium growth rate in the first
half.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Montague told of loan plans says Royal Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Scotland claims it held lengthy discussions over its
Pounds 2.3m loan to Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's founder and chief
executive, and gave him one week's notice before issuing its bankruptcy
petition.
The bankruptcy proceedings were revealed to Mr Montague by a shareholder's
representative at Thursday's annual meeting, where he had been attacked for
his excessive remuneration.
Mr Montague appeared shaken by the news. He is adamant that he is not in
financial difficulties, and had no forewarning of the bank's move.
He has retained the support of Tiphook's own bankers and Mr Ian Clubb, its
newly-appointed chairman. Both confirmed that their commitment to the group
was unaffected by Mr Montague's personal financial position.
However, if he were to be declared bankrupt, he would have to step down from
the board which has declared that he is key to its survival.
The loan is understood to be linked to Mr Montague's farming businesses in
Oxfordshire. It appears that changes in the terms of the loan had been under
negotiation for some time.
Mr Montague has sold his Highland cattle breeding activities due to high
costs. But with homes in Oxfordshire and Knightsbridge, London and a
notoriously-high salary, he was always considered a man of substantial
means.
The petition was announced by Mr Paul Snook, an accountant with Buchler
Phillips, who said he was acting as proxy for Lehman Brothers, and had
learnt of the moves through standard enquiries.
It appears that Mr Snook also held a proxy on behalf of Ms Carole Ritchie,
as a representative of Pickering Kenyon solicitors, who are retained legal
advisers to the plaintiffs in the US class action against Tiphook.
Mr Montague has six weeks to resolve his differences.

Hornby Group, the USM-quoted maker of toys and model products, reduced
pre-tax losses slightly from Pounds 791,000 to Pounds 733,000 in the first
half of 1994.
Turnover rose from Pounds 8.12m to Pounds 8.54m with demand for both
Scalextric and Hornby Railways ahead.
Mr Malcolm Thomas, the chairman, said there were signs of a recovery in
consumer spending, albeit slow, but the all-important Christmas trading
period was difficult to predict.
The Clever Cook toy oven was proving popular and the Gladiator range, based
on the television programme, continued to sell well, he said.
Losses per share were 5.4p (5.9p).

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Market placing puts Ryland at Pounds 22.72m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ryland Group, the family-owned vehicle distributor coming to the
market through a placing, were priced at 80p yesterday, valuing the company
as Pounds 22.72m.
Following the placing of 10.94m shares, which will raise a net Pounds 7.48m,
there will be 28.4m shares in issue.
The Midlands-based group has 30 franchised operations based primarily in the
West Midlands, the North West and northern Ireland. It has distribution
agreements with BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Vauxhall, Toyota, Honda and Renault.
Mr Peter Whale, chairman and chief executive, said he believed the
underlying demand for new and used cars was improving and that strong
regional trends were emerging. Ryland would be looking for acquisitions to
increase its franchise spread but remain geographically focused.
'If we remain geographically tight we can achieve some synergies,' he said.
After the placing the directors and their families will hold 39.5 per cent
of the enlarged share capital.
Ryland was established in 1951 by Mr Whale's grandfather, Mr Harry Whale,
who started the business by selling trucks in Birmingham.
Ryland reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 773,000) in the year
to April 30 on turnover ahead at Pounds 189.6m (Pounds 156.6m). Unit sales
for the year stood at 7.6m against 3.73m.
The shares are expected to begin trading next Thursday. The placing has been
sponsored by Albert E. Sharp &amp; Co.

with 9.6% advance

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm,
yesterday reported a 9.6 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to USDollars
181.9m for the first six months of the year. The figure compares with
USDollars 165.9m in the first half of 1993.
Following the lead set by Dairy Farm, Jardine's retail business, both
Hongkong Land and sister company Mandarin Oriental, the hotel group,
accompanied their results with the date of their exit from the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.
Both will de-list on March 31, three months after Jardine Matheson and
Jardine Strategic. All five departing Jardine companies are constituent
stocks on the Hang Seng Index.
Hongkong Land's results were on the low side of market expectations.
Earnings per share rose 9.6 per cent to 6.95 US cents from 6.34 US cents,
while the dividend improved 11 per cent to 3.50 US cents from 3.15 US cents.
Profits were boosted by a significant jump in office rents. Hongkong Land is
the colony's biggest commercial landlord, and its portfolio is virtually
fully let.
However, Hong Kong analysts were disappointed by the modest contribution
from Trafalgar House, in which the group holds a 25.6 per cent stake. Crosby
Securities put the Trafalgar House contribution at USDollars 7.6m, sharply
below its forecasts.
The group continues to seek additional property investment opportunities in
China and elsewhere in Asia. Its 63,000 sq ft office block in Hanoi,
Vietnam, is scheduled for completion late next year.
Hongkong Land has diversified into the infrastructure sector by taking the
biggest single stake in the Tsing Yi consortium to build Container Terminal
9 - a project now fraught with political overtones as Beijing, upon whose
approval the project is dependent, seeks to eject Jardine Matheson.
Yesterday's results statement noted that 'commencement of the project
remains dependent upon agreement between the British and Chinese
governments'.

joint venture
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Time Warner, the US media and entertainment group, is forming a joint
venture with RPG Enterprises, one of India's largest industrial houses, to
set up a pan-Asian satellite-based six-channel television network in India.
The entertainment-based network will cost Dollars 1bn to establish, and the
joint venture will have an equity base of almost Dollars 50m. The channels
will seek to cater to different Asian language groups.
The companies are awaiting the approval of the government's Foreign
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) before divulging details on the project.
A cabinet committee on broadcasting, headed by Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the
home minister, has recommended that the Indian private sector be allowed to
set up extra-terrestrial television stations. However, it does not favour
the entry of foreign television companies into India.
Analysts say the government is unlikely to approve the Time Warner-RPG
project, the first foreign-equity proposal in the Indian electronic media,
until it formulates policy on the entry of foreign media groups into India.
According to some reports, Time Warner is also keen to extend its
entertainment empire to India, by setting up video parlours, movie halls,
fast food outlets and shopping complexes.
The new project, if it is cleared, will challenge the near-monopoly of Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Star TV in the region. India accounts for nearly 40 per
cent of Star's 1.2bn viewers in Asia, and a host of Indian and international
companies are keen to enter the growing market.
Star, which has a 49.9 per cent stake in Zee, the popular Hindi language
channel, and has recently bought a 49 per cent stake in United Television, a
Bombay-based software company, is launching India's first pay-TV channel on
October 1, to screen international films.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tropical storm disrupts Geest's banana
supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banana supplies to Geest, whose shares fell sharply early in the year
following disease on its Costa Rican plantations, have been hit by a
tropical storm in the Windward Islands.
Shares in the group fell 30p to 211p, almost half the year's high of 375p.
Tropical Storm Debbie hit the islands a week ago, causing extensive flooding
around St Lucia and damage to roads and bridges. Geest, which is under
contract to ship all the islands' bananas, estimates that output will be 40
per cent down.
It expects to load only 2,400 tonnes a week, compared with a normal load of
4,000 tonnes. The islands, which usually provide more than half the group's
total banana volume, are not expected to return to full production until the
end of next year.
The EC's Banana Management Committee, which meets next Wednesday, will
consider how the disaster should be treated under the banana import regime.
Mr David Sugden, Geest's chief executive, said the group was lobbying the
European Commission to allow it to buy bananas from other sources to make up
the shortfall, and import them into the UK at the same tariff.
He attacked the political uncertainty still surrounding the regime, as it is
unclear whether the commission has the power to determine the tariff on
alternative supplies. 'It is a nonsense that, a year into the regime, we are

foreseeable.'
He is expecting some support from the French as the banana industry in
Martinique also suffered from the storm.
Geest will announce its interim results next Thursday. The City is expecting
about Pounds 12m, against Pounds 3.5m, following improved banana prices.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Seeking support from a competitor - A look
at the background to Newton Investment's expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Newton Investment Management, arguably the most successful
independent pension fund manager in the UK, to take over the assets of a
much weaker competitor is a sign of the times.
The move is surprising, however, because Newton has made much of its desire
to slow its expansion, closing its doors to new clients for a two-year
period in mid-1992.
While fund management companies concentrated furiously on building up their
roster of blue-chip pension scheme clients in the 1980s, retail services at
most houses faded to the background.
But now, with pension fund regulatory reform on the horizon, and a growing
recognition of the fickle quality of pension fund business, fund management
companies are re-thinking their mix of business.
Recently, several leading fund managers, including Mercury Asset Management,
the largest in the UK, have decided to concentrate on building up their
retail businesses for fear of becoming too vulnerable to a downturn in the
pension fund market.
'From Newton's point of view, we have a lot of dependency on one area of the
business. We want to diversify,' said Mr Jonathan Powell, marketing
director.
About four-fifths of Newton's existing Pounds 5bn in assets under management
are those of pension schemes, with the balance split between private client
funds and retail products such as unit trusts and Personal Equity Plans.
'Private clients will stick with you through thick and thin as long as you
make profits for them over time,' Mr Powell said. 'Pension funds are
volatile and will sack you immediately.'
Newton has calculated that it needs a mix of businesses if it is to be able
to count on long-term growth. The movement of pension funds into the hands
of fund managers is largely determined by a handful of pension consultants.
If Newton should lose favour with these, its future would be in doubt, Mr
Powell said.
The mix of business at Capital House Investment Management, the subsidiary
of Royal Bank of Scotland, with which Newton is merging, is almost a mirror
image. Capital House has only one big pension fund client, Royal Bank's own
pension scheme with about Pounds 1bn in assets. The remainder of its Pounds
3bn is in retail funds and private client assets.
Their performances also contrast greatly. Data from Combined Actuarial
Performance Services show that in 1993, Newton's median segregated pension
fund returned 37.4 per cent against an industry median of 29.2 per cent.
By contrast, the RBS Pension scheme earned returns 5 percentage points below
the CAPS median in 1993.
However perhaps the most significant reason for Newton was the access the
merger would give it to a distribution outlet for its retail funds.
'The big growth in the retail area is through bancassurance,' Mr Powell
said. 'We are the only independent fund manager with access to a
bancassurance outlet.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: RBC sells fund investment activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland has reached a tentative agreement to merge, Capital
House Investment Management, its fund management subsidiary, with Newton
Investment Management. RBS would take a one-third stake for Pounds 25m in
the combined entity, writes Norma Cohen.
The move creates a new institution with about Pounds 8bn under management.
RBS said last spring it was holding talks with Newton, one of the most
successful UK managers of institutional pension fund assets. It has about
Pounds 5bn of assets under management of which Pounds 4bn are those of
pension schemes.
The move stunned the industry. Newton has a policy of limiting the pace of
its expansion, saying it will never take on more new assets than it can
successfully manage.
Mr Jonathan Powell, marketing director at Newton, said the privately-held
group agreed to the transaction because it would greatly expand its
non-pension fund investment activities. Two-thirds of Capital House's assets
are those of private clients, unit trusts and Personal Equity Plans.
In addition RBS would market Newton-managed unit trusts exclusively through
its 750-branch network.
Under the terms RBS will transfer all of Capital Houses's share capital to
Newton. It will then take a 33.16 per cent stake in the combined equity of
the new company for Pounds 25m.
The deal, which is expected to be concluded before November 30, allows some
of the partners to be paid in long-term notes which can be exercised at a
time when it will be tax advantageous for them to do so.
It has also been agreed in principle that Newton will have the right to
require Royal Bank to subscribe for up to Pounds 10m of cumulative
redeemable preference shares.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Midland Independent doubles after listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
yesterday published its first results since listing on the London Stock
exchange, with pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 4.8m for the six
months to the end of June.
Pro-forma profits, stripping out the effects of interest on debt left over
from a management buy-out, saw a rise of 28 per cent to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds
6m).
Mr Chris Oakley, chief executive of MIN, which also publishes specialist
magazines, said: 'Prospects for regional newspapers are good and we have
identified opportunities for expansion by a number of newspaper launches.'
Talks are under way about possible acquisitions.
He emphasised that the group was successfully countering the national
newspaper price-cutting war and that the circulations of the Birmingham
Post, the Coventry Evening Telegraph and the Sunday Mercury had actually
increased. There had been extra costs owing to 'unprecedented levels of
sales promotion'.
Mr Oakley said the fact that the Birmingham Post had increased circulation
demonstrated 'the strength of regional newspapers'.
The results came the day after MIN announced that it had teamed up with
Mirror Group to develop cable television programming. Mirror plans a 24-hour
cable channel and MIN will produce local programmes for the Birmingham area.
Mr Oakley believes the local Birmingham segments could begin at two to three
hours a day and increase to five to six hours a day.
The company's free newspapers in Birmingham, which have been loss-makers in
the first half of 1993, have now come into profit. The profit margin on the
group's newspaper publishing operations is slightly down at 20.3 per cent,
reflecting the impact of a full half year's contribution from lower margin
free weeklies in the East Midlands.
Following the March public offer, which raised Pounds 96m net of expenses at
the end of June, MIN's net borrowings stood at Pounds 37.8m, down from
Pounds 134.8m at the end of December.
Operating profits were up 15 per cent to Pounds 9m (Pounds 7.8m) on turnover
that rose from Pounds 37.7m to Pounds 45m. Earnings per share were up at
3.81p (2.59p) - pro forma an increase of 22 per cent to 5.14p (4.21p). The
interim dividend is 1.1p.
Sir Norman Fowler, chairman, said although total advertising revenue grew
there were wide variations across categories. Recruitment advertising showed
strong growth while cars and property had yet to show significant
improvement.
Pre-tax profits for the full year are expected to be Pounds 15m to Pounds
16m. The share price closed 14p down at 140p.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: 44% rise in malt sales helps
Macallan-Glenlivet to Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in sales of Macallan single malt whisky helped Macallan-Glenlivet
lift interim pre-tax profits by almost one-fifth from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds
2.58m.
In a Scotch market that remains sluggish after the recession, Macallan
single malt sales rose 44 per cent overall with the UK and US showing gains
of more than 30 per cent.
'This is some kind of realisation of all the work we've done over the
years,' said Mr William Phillips, managing director. All of its more than 25
export markets were profitable.
Several analysts, surprised by the jump, attributed some of the rise to
restocking by Macallan's distributors and the effect of new distribution
agreements made in recent years. Sales to drinkers were thought to have
risen more slowly.
The second-half advance would be more moderate, Mr Phillips added, but the
trend was to a 'significantly higher level of growth' than in the past.
On turnover of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 6.49m) for the six months to June 30,
operating profits rose 25 per cent from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 2.34m thanks
to increased volume and cost savings. Net interest received slipped from
Pounds 279,00 to Pounds 233,000.
The interim dividend is increased to 0.41p (0.36p) from earnings per share
of 1.57p (1.37p).
New fillings, purchases by blenders of Macallan's newly distilled spirits,
fell by 30 per cent from a year earlier. The decline, which began several
years ago, should bottom out this year, Mr Phillips said. Sales could begin
to recover next year but would certainly do so in 1996.
Confident of growth, Macallan's has stepped up its whisky stocks and is
finishing off the fitting out of a 35m litre warehouse built in 1989.

<TEXT>
Quebecor, the Canadian publishing and forestry group, has ended its
discussions with Hunterprint, the lossmaking UK printer.
The Montreal-based newspaper publisher and commercial printer, announced
last month that it was considering making an offer for debt-laden
Hunterprint.
In a brief statement yesterday Hunterprint's board said it understood
Quebecor had decided not to proceed, 'as a result of a change in its
strategic plans.'
The statement added that Hunterprint was trading in line with the
projections it had supplied to its bankers when it sold Hardy Printers, its
only active subsidiary, to a management buy-out team for Pounds 1.85m in
early August.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Harrods prepares Kurt Geiger for market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrods Holdings, the group owned by the Fayed brothers which includes the
famous London department store, is preparing Kurt Geiger, its upmarket shoe
retailing subsidiary, for a stock exchange flotation next year.
The group has confirmed Mr James Walsh, who has been acting chief executive
of Kurt Geiger for several months, in the role and said it was the beginning
of a process 'intended to lead to flotation as a public company next year'.
That would include the appointment of a non-executive chairman.
Mr Walsh, 45, was previously group finance director. His successor in that
role is Mr Omar Bayoumi, 39, recruited from SG Warburg, the merchant bank,
where he played a prominent part in the Fayeds' Pounds 413m flotation of the
House of Fraser department store chain. Mr Bayoumi will also be chief
financial officer of Harrods department store.
Kurt Geiger is one of several businesses, including Turnbull &amp; Asser, the
shirt maker, and the Carlton Highland Hotel in Edinburgh, that remained with
Harrods when House of Fraser was floated.
It has two trading names, Kurt Geiger and Carvela, with 110 outlets in the
UK, including standalone stores in London's Bond Street and Sloane Street,
and many concessions in department stores - particularly in House of Fraser.
It is the biggest shoe retailer in London stores.
It made operating profits last year of Pounds 4m on sales of Pounds 52.8m.
Analysts said those figures suggested a flotation might value the business
at about Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m.
Harrods said Kurt Geiger stood 'an extremely good chance of trading
successfully as an independent company'.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Another warning from Betterware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betterware, the direct selling group, lost more than a third of its market
value yesterday as it issued its third profits warning in five months.
The company's shares fell by 23p to 50p, having plummeted over the last 14
months from a peak of 278p. Analysts pulled back full-year forecasts from
Pounds 11m to about Pounds 9m.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said first half operating profits were not
expected to be more than Pounds 4m, compared with Pounds 7m last year.
The decline was blamed on difficulties recruiting people to distribute
catalogues in the UK, stock delivery problems arising from the move to a new
distribution centre, and increased investment in international expansion.
Betterware has committed to provide up to Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) over time
in a joint venture, also announced yesterday, with Avon, the world's largest
direct seller of beauty products, to sell household products in North and
South America.
Mr Cohen said the cash-rich Betterware was not in any serious difficulty, in
spite of the market's reaction. 'We have an exemplary record on past
performance, we make full disclosure, comply with Cadbury. We have never
failed to do something we said we would do. The one thing we have failed to
do is meet analysts' expectations,' he said.
The group issued a caution on trading in May with its annual results and
again in July.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Next advances 60% to Pounds 37m - Shares
shed 15p on cautious statement about second half trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cautious statements on future trading led to a 15p fall in the share price
of Next, the fashion retailer, to 243p, in spite of a 60 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 23m to Pounds 36.9m.
The profits exceeded forecasts of between Pounds 32m and Pounds 35m, and the
interim dividend is raised 83 per cent from 1.5p to 2.75p - beating the
highest forecasts of 2.5p.
Next also said sales were currently running 13 per cent ahead of last year.
However, the market seized upon a warning from Mr David Jones, chief
executive, that Next would come up against 'more demanding' comparative
sales figures in the months before Christmas, which might make it difficult
to maintain the same percentage growth.
He said sales at this stage last year were running 10 per cent ahead of
1992, but by Christmas the total increase had reached 18 per cent.
His caution led to fears that Next's recovery since the early 1990s was
largely complete and that future growth would be slower.
'They made it quite clear it is going to be difficult to get much more out
of the business,' said Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
Next is trying out four stores in the US, but said it would not decide
whether to expand there until next year. US trading losses and start-up
costs were Pounds 900,000, down from Pounds 1.1m last year.
The group is also launching the natural cosmetics chain Bath &amp; Body Works in
the UK, in a 50:50 joint venture with The Limited, the chain's US parent. It
expects to have five stores trading by Christ-mas.
Group sales in the six months to July 31 increased from Pounds 233.2m to
Pounds 274.5m, and operating profits from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 32.9m.
That represented an increase in operating margin from 8.6 per cent to almost
12 per cent.
Mr Jones said there was little inflation in selling prices, and the
amalgamation of Next's high street and mail order ranges had enabled it to
get better buying terms from suppliers.
Sales in Next's 302 stores increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 191.6m (Pounds
160.9m), with operating profits up from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 19.1m. Mr
Jones said Next would continue to try to increase the size of some of its
stores.
Turnover in Next Directory, the mail order division, also rose by 19 per
cent, from Pounds 46.5m to Pounds 55.3m, and operating profits from Pounds
3.5m to Pounds 5.9m.
Total profits from the Club 24 credit management business were unchanged at
Pounds 5.9m.
Profits from other activities, including property and the Callscan software
business, were Pounds 2.9m.
Net interest receivable was Pounds 4m (Pounds 2.9m).
After tax of Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 2.6m) earnings per share worked through at
7.3p compared with 5.5p.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pearson ups Recoletos stake to 47%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media and entertainment group, has increased its stake in
Recoletos, the Spanish publishing group, to 47 per cent.
The additional stake of 8 per cent cost about Pounds 12.4m, valuing the
company, which publishes Expansion, the business and financial daily, at
about Pounds 155m.
Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, bought a small stake in
Recoletos more than five years ago when he was chief executive of the
Financial Times. It was part of a policy of taking stakes in publishers of
business and financial titles around the world. Since then Pearson has been
building its stake in the group with the consent of the Spanish
shareholders.
It seems likely that Pearson will eventually take control of the group,
which also publishes Marca, Spain's top seven-days-a-week sports paper.
The Recoletos titles also include Telva, a women's magazine, and Diario
Medico, a daily medical paper.

FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bruntcliffe jumps and sells lossmaker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bruntcliffe Aggregates, the quarry and quarry products group, reported
pre-tax profits sharply up from Pounds 132,000 to Pounds 792,000 in the six
months to end-June.
Despite 'unusually severe weather conditions during the first quarter' in
Scotland and the US, volumes in the aggregates business recovered well, the
directors said, and profitability in the division had exceeded budget.
The performance of Lorasen Coal in the US continued to be disappointing with
losses of Pounds 374,000. It is being sold to Lorasen Inc, a subsidiary of
Mineral &amp; General Investments, for Dollars 2.42m (Pounds 1.56m).
Turnover totalled Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 305,000) with Pounds 2.06m from
acquisitions.
An interim dividend of 0.4p is being paid from earnings per share of 0.9p
(1.1p).

FT  17 SEP 94 / Gummer backs shops complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposed Pounds 200m property development next to the Manchester Ship
Canal yesterday won the backing of Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, in an important test of government policy on out-of-town shopping
centres.
Mr Gummer said that he would ask the House of Lords to overturn a Court of
Appeal judgment in July which threatened to block the 1m sq ft Trafford
Centre scheme.
The Appeal Court quashed outline planning approval granted in March 1993 by
Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, following opposition by local
authorities.
The authorities, led by Manchester City Council, said that the development
would increase traffic pollution and harm town-centre stores.
The outcome should clarify the government's attitude to large out-of-town
shopping developments. Recent planning guidance issued to local authorities
by Mr Gummer suggested that the government had changed its attitude to the
desirability of such centres since the Trafford scheme was given the green
light. The environment department has discouraged schemes which require
people to travel.
Mr Gummer said yesterday that the original decision was lawful and
reasonable in the light of circumstances at the time. He said the Appeal
Court ruling could have implications for the administration of the planning
system and should be clarified in the Lords.
The ruling is already being challenged in the Lords by Manchester Ship Canal
Company, owner of the 300-acre site.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Clinton's least worst option: Invading Haiti could deepen
White House isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was good,' the crusty Washington veteran said of President Bill Clinton's
nationally televised address on Haiti on Thursday evening. 'But, of course,
it was not good enough.'
It probably never could have been. Forceful as his arguments were during his
sombre 16-minute speech from the Oval Office, the president was, as R W
Apple put it in yesterday's New York Times, speaking 'into the teeth of a
howling political gale'.
The impact of his case was diluted by the instantaneous reaction from
Port-au-Prince. CBS television immediately switched to an interview with Lt
Gen Raoul Cedras. Mumbling in French, the leader of Haiti's military junta
said he was ready to die, as any soldier would, in defence of his country.
But the junta was not Mr Clinton's prime target. His task was to convince
his own public and politicians that he had not painted himself into such a
corner that he had no alternative but to send US forces overseas on a combat
mission for the first time in his presidency - and to a country of such
insignificance that its relevance to the US national interest is but dimly
understood and, if grasped, is perceived as not worth the expenditure of
American lives.
All week Congress and most of the media have been inveighing against
intervention. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, managed to avoid
the Senate voting against US action this week, but he could not prevent a
floor debate in which Democrats, including some of Mr Clinton's most loyal
troops, urged him to pull back. Absent an actual invasion, votes in both
houses may be unavoidable next week. Divisions were even apparent in the
congressional black caucus, the strongest advocates of restoring Haiti's
elected government by force if necessary.
Partisan criticism was predictably vicious. Both Dan Quayle, the former
vice-president, and Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate in
1992, said Mr Clinton was only acting to restore his sagging popularity in
advance of November's mid-term congressional elections. Mr Perot added the
twist that not serving in the Vietnam War rendered Mr Clinton morally
unqualified to send US troops into danger. But the balance of opinion from
both sides of the political aisle was definitely that Mr Clinton should
secure the authorisation of Congress for any intervention.
That has also been the thrust of much editorial comment. The New York Times
wrote yesterday that it was 'Congress's solemn duty to decide on issues of
war and peace'. USA Today warned that 'getting in is easy; getting out is
hard'. The Los Angeles Times thought that only the flight of the junta could
justify the president's sabre-rat-tling. Almost alone in offering a contrary
view among the pundits was Michael Elliott in Newsweek, who argued the US
did have legitimate national interests in Haiti and concluded 'the foreign
affairs gurus can be wrong.'
Mr Clinton showed himself sensitive to guru opinion by recalling in his
speech the public statements of President George Bush and James Baker, his
secretary of state, that the 1991 coup in Haiti 'cannot stand'.
But members of the former administration, including Messrs Bush and Baker,
have been in the vanguard of those urging Mr Clinton not to go to the wall
for Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president. A statement issued on
Thursday by Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser, was
typical. Its headline ran: 'Haiti revisited: is this trip necessary?' At
least Mr Clinton was able to assure them that Fr Aristide had agreed not to
seek another term, once restored to power.
Still, the weight of opposition to Mr Clinton's policies should not be
interpreted as meaning the US stands on the brink of its own constitutional
crisis over the limits of presidential authority. As Senator Robert Dole,
the Republican leader, conceded, the mere act of an invasion will dissuade
Congress from doing anything that could be construed as undermining the US
military mission or suggesting to the junta that US resolve is anything but
absolute.
Public opinion also is not set in concrete, with two overnight polls of
those who had watched the president speak finding he had won over some
hearts and minds. This improvement might hold up if, as expected, the
Haitian military crumbles quickly and if the operation resembles the short,
sharp incursions into Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989. But the experience
of the Gulf war, popular, congressionally approved and successfully
accomplished, shows how fickle public opinion can be. Waving the flag is
unlikely to have much influence on the mid-term elect-ions.
To this end, Mr Clinton sought to make much of the fact that most US troops
would be out of Haiti 'in months not years', to be replaced by an
international peacekeeping force, drawn from over 20 countries. But even
this commitment was greeted with scepticism by those noting, like Mr
Scowcroft, that the last US invasion of Haiti in 1915 led to a 19-year
occupation and by others pointing out that international support had been
extracted only with extreme difficulty.
Mr Clinton's other justifications for action mixed the highly moral - the
need to end gross human rights abuses and the proclamation of hemispheric
democratic values - with the domestically political. The cost of caring for
refugees and illegal immigrants is already a big issue in Florida (and, for
different reasons, California), and the president painted a somewhat lurid
picture of the threats posed by another wave of Haitian boat people washing
up on the Florida shores.
These arguments were also given short shrift. Congressman Newt Gingrich, the
Republican from Georgia, found it 'disgusting' that the president should
compare George Washington with Fr Aristide, while Congressman Porter Goss,
the Florida Republican, thought the refugee rationale 'disingenuous and
frankly unhelpful'. A M Rosenthal, in the New York Times, wondered what had
happened to a country which once welcomed immigrants with open arms.
But, beyond the particular, there is the general sense that Mr Clinton is
about to do something - invade a foreign country - which he entered his
presidency determined to avoid at all reasonable cost. More even than his
countless Haitian policy twists and turns, it is the often public agony of
his decision-making processes, also evident in the domestic arena, that
sometimes seems positively unpresidential.
On Thursday night, he came over as stern and tough, perhaps another
manifestation of this quicksilver man. But, by the time he spoke, he was
damned if he did invade and damned if he did not. Not backing down had
become, arguably, the lesser of the two evils.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Car a persuasive option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL LANDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Donkin asks (Jobs: September 14): 'Why do we persist with the
company car as a form of reward?' The answer is quite simple. It is still a
very cost-effective way of providing a benefit to employees.
The typical cost to an employer of providing an employee with a car priced
at Pounds 20,000 is about Pounds 9,000 a year (including private fuel and
Class 1A national insurance contributions).
The cost (including employer's National Insurance contributions) of paying
an employee a sufficient cash allowance to operate a similar car himself out
of after-tax earnings is about Pounds 12,500 a year.
Employees understand this quite well. Our recent survey, Company Cars and
Flexible Benefits, shows that 90 per cent of employees who are offered a
cash allowance instead of a company car choose to stick with the cars. The
average cash allowance of Pounds 6,000 a year for Pounds 20,000 cars is not
sufficient in most cases to persuade them to take on the costs of running
their own cars.
